[{"Title": "Missing link in community psychiatry: When a patient with schizophrenia was expelled from her home.", "Abstract": "Treatment and disposition of homeless patients with schizophrenia represent a great challenge in clinical practice. We report a case of this special population, and discuss the development of homelessness, the difficulty in disposition, their utilization of health services, and possible applications of mandatory community treatment in this group of patients. A 51-year-old homeless female was brought to an emergency department for left femur fracture caused by an assault. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 20 years ago but received little help from mental health services over the decades. During hospitalization, her psychotic symptoms were only partially responsive to treatment. Her family refused to handle caretaking duties. The social welfare system was mobilized for long-term disposition. Homeless patients with schizophrenia are characterized by family disruption, poor adherence to health care, and multiple emergency visits and hospitalization. We hope this article can provide information about the current mental health policy to medical personnel. It is possible that earlier intervention and better outcome can be achieved by utilizing mandatory community treatment in the future, as well as preventing patients with schizophrenia from losing shelters."}, {"Title": "A war over mental health professionalism: Scientology versus psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Over 60 years ago, founder L. Ron Hubbard began what has become Scientology's greatest battle. Scientology emerged from Dianetics, which Hubbard hoped would replace the psychiatric profession. In this article, we discuss how Scientology attempted to position itself as a rival profession to psychiatry and the consequences of those attempts. Scientology's battle with psychiatry gained some success from the social conditions during which it emerged, but it continues in a time that has seen increasing success with various psychiatric treatments. As such, Scientology's direct influence on the psychiatric profession may be difficult to measure, but its actions have coincided with substantial challenges to psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Attitudes to shared care for patients with dementia: a survey of general practitioners.", "Abstract": "Early diagnosis of dementia is important, but implications for care shared between primary and secondary care remain uncertain. We explored attitudes and expectations of Edinburgh's general practitioners (GPs) regarding current sharing of care for dementia. Surveys were distributed to all 335 Edinburgh GPs; 79.7% were returned. Attitudes and expectations were examined, specifically whether dementia care was currently appropriately shared. Two-thirds of GPs were sure of their role and a similar number felt that care was appropriately shared. The latter opinion was not associated with individual GP factors, such as gender or length of time since qualification, or local levels of deprivation. However, there was a significant association with sector consultant psychiatrist (F = 2.79, df = 6, p = 0.012) and with the proportion of the practice list diagnosed with dementia (\u03c1 = -0.13, p = 0.038). The endangered relationship between GP and specialist could be a key target to improve shared care and early diagnosis of dementia."}, {"Title": "Influence of mental stress on platelet bioactivity.", "Abstract": "It is well established that various mental stress conditions contribute, or at least influence, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in somatic, as well as in psychiatric disorders; blood platelets are supposed to represent a possible link in this respect. The anculeated platelets are the smallest corpuscular elements circulating in the human blood. They display different serotonergic markers which seem to reflect the central nervous serotonin metabolism. They are known as main effectors in haematological processes but recent research highlights their role in the innate and adaptive immune system. Platelets are containing a multitude of pro-inflammatory and immune-modulatory bioactive compounds in their granules and are expressing immune-competent surface markers. Research gives hint that platelets activation and reactivity is increased by mental stress. This leads to enhanced cross talk with the immune system via paracrine secretion, receptor interaction and formation of platelet leucocyte-aggregates. Recently it has been demonstrated that the immune system can have a remarkable impact in the development of psychiatric disorders. Therefore platelets represent an interesting research area in psychiatry and their role as a possible biomarker has been investigated. We review the influence of mental stress on what is termed platelet bioactivity in this article, which subsumes the mainly immune-modulatory activity of platelets in healthy volunteers, elderly persons with chronic care-giving strain, patients with cardiovascular diseases who are prone to psychosocial stress, as well as in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Research data suggest that stress enhances platelet activity, reactivity and immune-modulatory capacities."}, {"Title": "Behavioral health referrals and treatment initiation rates in integrated primary care: a Collaborative Care Research Network study.", "Abstract": "Although the benefits of integrating behavioral health (BH) services into primary care are well established (World Health Organization and World Organization of Family Doctors, 2012; Chiles et al. in Clin Psychol-Sci Pr 6:204-220, 1999; Cummings 1997; O'Donohue et al. 2003; Olfson et al. in Health Aff 18:79-93, 1999; Katon et al. in Ann Intern Med 124:917-925, 2001; Simon et al. in Arch Gen Psychiatry 52:850-856, 1995; Anderson et al. in Diabetes Care 24:1069-1078, 2001; Ciechanowski et al. in Arch Intern Med 160:3278-3285, 2000; Egede et al. in Diabetes Care 25:464-470, 2002), research has focused primarily on describing the types of interventions behavioral health providers (BHPs) employ rather than on reasons for referral, treatment initiation rates, or the patient characteristics that may impact them. This study presents the results of a multisite card study organized by The Collaborative Care Research Network, a subnetwork of the American Academy of Family Physicians' National Research Network devoted to conducting practice-based research focused on the provision of BH and health behavior services within primary care practices. The goals of the study included: (1) identifying the characteristics of patients referred for BH services; (2) codifying reasons for referral and whether patients were treated for the referral; (3) exploring any differences between patients who initiated BH contact and those who did not; and (4) assessing the types and frequency of BH services provided to patients who attended at least one appointment. Of the 200 patients referred to a BHP, 81\u00a0% had an initial contact, 71\u00a0% of which occurred on the same day. Men and women were equally likely to engage with a BHP although the time between appointments varied by gender. Depression and anxiety were the primary reasons for referral.

Of these, 7 were conducted on psychiatry residents alone, 6 assessed assaults on residents in nonpsychiatric specialties, and 2 reported cross-specialty data. The prevalence of assaults was defined as the percentage of residents who have experienced at least one assault. The prevalence of physical assaults on residents was 38% in surgery, 26% in emergency medicine, 16% to 40% in internal medicine, 5% to 9% in pediatrics, and 25% to 64% in psychiatry. All studies were cross-sectional; none collected data prospectively. Definitions of assault were heterogeneous or not specified. Few of the assaults were reported to clinical supervisors or training directors, and no programs had a formal reporting process. Approximately 21% to 79% of psychiatry residents and 30% of residents in other specialties had received some training on how to manage violent patients. We found no descriptions of formal curricula for managing the possibility of patient violence against residents or for preparing for the aftermath.\nAlthough the data are limited, assaults by patients are commonly experienced by residents in training. There is a paucity of information and curricula that pertain to reducing the prevalence of these incidents and to addressing potential psychologic consequences, especially in nonpsychiatric specialties."}, {"Title": "Transdermal patches: the emerging mode of drug delivery system in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Adherence to prescribed psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medication is a serious issue in people with mental illness that can contribute to poor health outcomes. Some of the factors influencing adherence include side effects of medication and the ease of use. With mental healthcare provision increasingly focusing on a community model of health delivery, there seems to be a renewed interest in addressing complex dilemmas of safety and adherence to treatment. The use of alternative methods of safely delivering medication in innovative ways may resolve some of these difficulties.

We report a 17-year-old boy, admitted to psychiatric department for psychotic symptomatology. He had suffered penetrating craniocerebral injury after stabbing by a billiard stick, three years earlier. On admission, he expressed delusions with paranoid and religious content. The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a 10 cm large tubular area of posttraumatic encephalomalacia of the left hemisphere, whereas the electroencephalography revealed slow left temporal activity. The patient's recovery was uneventful with clozapine at a dosage of 100 mg daily. This case shows the diagnostic challenge in differentiation between schizophrenia and psychotic disorder due to traumatic brain injury.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the decision-making competencies of inpatients with a range of psychiatric diseases.\nThis study was carried out at the psychiatry clinic of Kocaeli University Hospital in Turkey from June 2007 to February 2008. Decision-making competence was assessed in 83 patients using the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Treatment (MacCAT-T).\nThe study groups consisted of patients with mood (39.8%), psychotic (27.7%) and anxiety disorders (18.1%), and alcohol/substance addiction (14.5%). There was a significant relation between decision-making competence and demographic and clinical characteristics. Appreciation of the given information was more impaired in psychotic disorder patients than in other patients, but understanding and reasoning of the given information was similar in all groups.\nThese results reveal the importance of evaluating decision-making competencies of psychiatric patients before any treatment or intervention is carried out to ascertain their ability to give informed consent to treatment.

The aim of this study was to examine the associations of single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CHL1 gene locus, including rs2055314 (C/T), rs2272522 (C/T) and rs331894 (A/G), with schizophrenia in the Qatari population.\nAn association case control study was carried out on 86 Qatari schizophrenic patients from the Psychiatry Hospital, Hammed Medical Corporation, Qatar and 88 Qatari unrelated, healthy, control subjects. Schizophrenia was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia by two independent psychiatrists. Genotyping of the SNPs rs2055314 (C/T), rs2272522 (C/T) and rs331894 (A/G) was conducted using the 5' nuclease assay with the TaqMan MGB probe and an ABI 7500.\nIndividuals with the rs2272522 TT genotype had approximately 4.2 times greater risk of schizophrenia compared to individuals with the CC genotype (OR = 4.21; 95% CI: 1.12-15.53; P = 0.047). In addition, individuals carrying a T allele of the rs2272522 SNP had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia (1.78 times) among the population (P = 0.028). SNPs rs2055314 and rs331894 had no significant association with schizophrenia. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the three polymorphisms was modest in the schizophrenic group.\nThe rs2272522 polymorphism was found to exhibit a highly significant association with schizophrenia in the Qatari population.

Sixty-six percent received PC assessments, 32% received PC ministry, and 10% received PC ritual or worship interventions. Other interventions (counseling/education, crisis situation, grief/ bereavement counseling) occurred infrequently. Seventy-five percent of Roman Catholic patients received PC compared to 57% of those patients with no religious affiliation. However, the overall association between religious grouping and receiving PC was not significant. Gender, religion, marital status, legal status, country of birth, language spoken, living situation, carer needs, or educational level were not related to PC contact. Whether or not an inpatient received PC assessment was unrelated to diagnostic category. Patients seen by PC were significantly more likely to engage in religious practice, have longer length of stay, and have neuropsychological, social work and occupational therapy assessments.\nResults suggest that PC practitioners can help optimize the clinical care of patients by developing a comprehensive understanding of their spiritual and religious needs and providing a more holistic service."}, {"Title": "Role of 24 hour telephonic helpline in delivery of mental health services.", "Abstract": "A large number of persons with psychiatric disorders are not seeking treatment due to various reasons, thus contributing to the huge treatment gap.

Only 1 student (1.5%) opted for psychiatry as a career choice, another 2 students (3%) considered it as a strong possibility, 71.5% negated psychiatry as a career choice. Students rated psychiatry significantly lower than other specialties in regards to financially rewarding, enjoyable and satisfying work, intellectually challenging, scientific basis, prestige among others, lifestyle. Psychiatry was also rated as poor on prospects of having a bright and interesting future.

Being a rare paraphilia, it may sometimes be difficult to get necrophilia related literature or even understand this complex behavior. An interested person may have to rely on the few case reports from forensic journals or law books in order to understand what and how necrophiles do what they do! A movie club can be an interesting and novel way to learn various issues in medicine and psychiatry, including necrophilia. This paper discusses the use of this film in academic sessions in order to learn necrophilia."}, {"Title": "Rationale, design and baseline data for the Activating Consumers to Exercise through Peer Support (ACE trial): A randomized controlled trial to increase fitness among adults with mental illness.", "Abstract": "The benefits of regular physical activity are particularly salient to persons with serious mental illness (SMI) who have increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and earlier mortality from cardiovascular disease.\nThe Activating Consumers to Exercise through Peer Support (ACE) trial will examine the effectiveness of peer support on adherence to a 4-month pilot exercise program for adults with SMI. Design, rationale and baseline data are reported. Baseline measures included: graded treadmill test; six-minute walk; height, weight and blood pressure; body composition; fasting blood; and self-reported psychiatric symptoms. Fitness levels were compared with national data and relationships among fitness parameters, psychological factors and cardiovascular disease risk factors were examined.\nThere were 93 participants and 18 peer leaders recruited from community psychiatry programs with an average age of 47 years (SD 10). There were no differences in demographics (76% female, 72% African American) or mental health symptoms between participants and peer leaders. Ninety-five percent of the sample had below average fitness levels for their age and sex with average MET levels of 5.9(SD 2.2) for participants and 6.2(SD 2.3) for peer leaders. Fitness evaluated during the treadmill test and the six-minute-walk were associated (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.36, p<.001). Lower MET levels were associated with a higher BMI (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.35, p<.001) and percent body fat (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.36, p <.001).\nThe uniformly low baseline cardiovascular fitness and the association of fitness with BMI and adiposity underscore the importance of suitably tailored programs to increase physical activity among adults with SMI."}, {"Title": "Relationship between cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of delirium.", "Abstract": "To study relationship between the cognitive and the non-cognitive symptoms of delirium.\nEighty-four patients referred to psychiatry liaison services and met DSM-IVTR criteria of delirium were assessed using the Delirium Rating Scale Revised-1998 (DRSR-98) and Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD).\nThe mean DRS-R-98 severity score was 17.19 and DRS-R-98 total score was 23.36. The mean total score on CTD was 11.75. The mean scores on CTD were highest for comprehension (3.47) and lowest for vigilance (1.71). Poor attention was associated with significantly higher motor retardation and higher DRS-R-98 severity scores minus the attention scores. There were no significant differences between those with and without poor attention. Higher attention deficits were associated with higher dysfunction on all other domains of cognition on CTD. There was significant correlation between cognitive functions as assessed on CTD and total DRS-R-98 score, DRS-R-98 severity score and DRS-R-98 severity score without the attention item score. However, few correlations emerged between CTD domains and CTD total scores with cognitive symptom total score of DRS-R-98 (items 9-13) and non-cognitive symptom total score of DRS-R-98 (items 1-8).\nOur study suggests that in delirium, cognitive deficits are quite prevalent and correlate with overall severity of delirium.

A 30-year-old woman with bipolar disorder, treated with lithium carbonate presented severe dental decay. Dentin samples from lithium and healthy volunteers were collected and submitted to ionic and ultrastructural analysis. Samples from the lithium patient exhibited irregular peritubular walls and the mineral crystals were irregularly arranged in the intertubular dentin. In addition, a decrease in Mg/P/Ca and an increase of Zn concentrations were detected. These data suggest that the severe dental decay and changes in the tooth structure observed for the lithium-treated patient are related to dentin mineral loss and that this pathological condition is different from caries lesions."}, {"Title": "Equipping Residents to Address Alcohol and Drug Abuse: The National SBIRT Residency Training Project.", "Abstract": "The Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) service for unhealthy alcohol use has been shown to be one of the most cost-effective medical preventive services and has been associated with long-term reductions in alcohol use and health care utilization. Recent studies also indicate that SBIRT reduces illicit drug use. In 2008 and 2009, the Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration funded 17 grantees to develop and implement medical residency training programs that teach residents how to provide SBIRT services for individuals with alcohol and drug misuse conditions. This paper presents the curricular activities associated with this initiative.\nWe used an online survey delivery application (Qualtrics) to e-mail a survey instrument developed by the project directors of 4 SBIRT residency programs to each residency grantee's director. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative data.\nAll 17 (100%) grantees responded. Respondents encompassed residency programs in emergency medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, surgery, and preventive medicine. Thirteen of 17 (76%) grantee programs used both online and in-person approaches to deliver the curriculum. All 17 grantees incorporated motivational interviewing and validated screening instruments in the curriculum. As of June 2011, 2867 residents had been trained, and project directors reported all residents were incorporating SBIRT into their practices. Consistently mentioned challenges in implementing an SBIRT curriculum included finding time in residents' schedules for the modules and the need for trained faculty to verify resident competence.\nThe SBIRT initiative has resulted in rapid development of educational programs and a cohort of residents who utilize SBIRT in practice.

In response, the Department of Defense and the United States Army improved their data collection methods to better understand the causes of military suicides. As retired colonel Dr. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie writes, unit history and the accumulation of stressors-from relationship problems to chronic pain-are significant suicide risk factors among soldiers. But, she argues, Army officials must use this knowledge to design more-effective strategies for suicide reduction, including limiting access to weapons, especially post-deployment, and better connecting soldiers with their communities."}, {"Title": "The association between schizophrenia and violent or homicidal behaviour: the prevention and treatment of violent behaviour in these patients.", "Abstract": "This review article aims to discuss and evaluate the risk factors for the development of violence and homicidal behaviour and the effectiveness and outcomes of the preferred atypical antipsychotics in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nFor this purpose, the psychiatry literature was comprehensively reviewed. A screening of the articles in the international databases covering the period between 1970 and 2010 was performed.\nAlthough the risk of homicidal behaviours is higher in patients with schizophrenia compared to the overall population, little is known about the relevant conditions triggering acts of violence among the patients with schizophrenia. The available results suggest that certain factors including some sociodemographic characteristics, young age, alcoholism, substance abuse, noncompliance with treatment, fulfillment of the criteria for antisocial personality disorder and paranoid subtype, history of suicidal ideation and attempts and history of frequent hospitalization increase the potential for violent episodes. Available data show clozapine to be the most rational therapeutic choice in preventing violent behaviour in patients with schizophrenia. There is evidence from randomized controlled trials in support of the specific anti-aggressive effect of clozapine.\nIn clinical practice, patients with a risk of committing homicide should be detected and monitored closely. There are many trials showing the efficacy of clozapine on violent and aggressive behaviour."}, {"Title": "Depression among cardiovascular disease patients on a consultation-liaison service at a general hospital in Jamaica.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Jamaica and other Caribbean countries has been steadily rising.

The study used a questionnaire constructed by the authors, consisting of three parts: 1. socio-demographic variables, 2. attitudes towards psychiatric treatment, 3. knowledge about mental disorders.\nAccording to the majority of respondents (95%) specialization in psychiatry is necessary. Only 40% of respondents know that to hold a first visit to a psychiatrist a referral is not necessary. Over 90% of the students did not treat visiting the psychiatrist as a reason for shame. A small percentage of them would approach this appointment at the instigation (26.6%). Respondents demonstrated a knowledge of the causes of mental disorders, but confirmed the negative stereotypes about aggression of psychiatric patients and electroconvulsive therapy (only 22 students are aware of its use in modem psychiatry). According to the majority of respondents, mental illness does not begin suddenly (78.33%), hereditary factors play a dominant role in their development (48.33%), and stress significantly increases the risk of their occurrence. Only 26 of the respondents did not agree with the finding of increased aggressiveness of psychiatric patients.\nThe image a mentally ill person in the eyes of medical students does not differ from the stereotypical thinking of the general population.

They proved to be myorelaxant and anticonvulsive therapy in neurology; their anxiolytic and hypnotic properties have made them the treatment of choice for insomnia and anxiety problems; they have also been used in alcohol withdrawal and in anesthesia, and for a wide range of treatments in other clinical branches. However, reports giving rise to a prescription controversy including abuse, harmful effects, intoxication and dependence toward addiction appeared soon. On the other hand, the revolutionary appearance of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) overshadowed benzodiazepines. According to recommendations of many scientific and professional institutions, the use of benzodiazepines has been gradually excluded or reduced or limited to short-term use. However, clinical experience showed that benzodiazepines are frequently used for long-term treatment, and there are many reasons for this, e.g., prescribing tradition, patient preference, difficulties associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal (even in patients taking low doses) because they have a rapid clinical onset of action, and good efficacy with few initial adverse effects. Moreover, SSRIs as alternative drugs are associated with incomplete therapeutic response and more uncomfortable adverse effects. Some authors therefore point out that the rationale for the shift from benzodiazepines to SSRIs is inappropriate."}, {"Title": "[The first psychotic episode].", "Abstract": "In the large Second Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of County Hospital, Gyula, the author treated several thousand children, adolescents and young adults with the diagnosis of first psychotic episode between 1970-2003.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV) is used to diagnose ADHD, but its criteria are behaviorally defined, while ADHD is a neurological dysfunction. The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria do not differentiate between attention and inhibition or executive functions (EF). As well, there is little agreement in the field about what constitutes ADHD and EFs or how to measure or diagnose them, let alone rule them out. When rendering an ADHD diagnosis, the responsible clinician considers DSM-IV criteria along with other reasons why an individual may express symptoms of ADHD, for reasons other than ADHD. This article discusses postulated mechanisms of action for some medications prescribed for ADHD, the variance of medication outcomes in research, the variance of assessment measures used in identifying ADHD subjects for research, and flaws with DSM-IV-based diagnosis. An argument is posed that the field of neuropsychology needs a cohesive and agreed-upon definition of ADHD and EF and how to measure it to more exactly research the topic, accurately diagnose the disorder, and assist prescribing professionals to use medications with improved first-trial precision."}, {"Title": "Clinical neuropsychology within adolescent and young-adult psychiatry: conceptualizing theory and practice.", "Abstract": "Historically, clinical neuropsychology has made significant contributions to the understanding of brain-behavior relationships, particularly in neurological conditions. During the past several decades, neuropsychology has also become established as an important discipline in psychiatric settings. Cognition is increasingly recognized as being core to psychiatric illnesses and predictive of functional outcomes, augmenting theories regarding symptomatology and illness progression. Adult-type psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia and other psychotic, mood, anxiety, eating, substance-related, and personality disorders) typically emerge during adolescence or young adulthood, a critical neurodevelopmental period. Clinical neuropsychological assessment in adolescent psychiatric patients is particularly valuable in informing clinical formulation and intervention and can be therapeutic across a number of levels. This article articulates the theoretical considerations and practical challenges and applications of clinical neuropsychology within adolescent and young-adult psychiatry. The importance of considering the neurodevelopmental context and its relationship to current theoretical models underpinning clinical practice are discussed."}, {"Title": "Tear Film Break-up Time in Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "Ocular dryness is a well-recognized adverse side effect of many topical and systemic medications. In psychiatry, patients who have consumed such drugs as lithium carbonate and sodium valproate frequently experience dry eye symptoms. The purpose of this study was to compare tear film stability between patients who use these drugs with those patients who are not on medication.\nAfter obtaining informed consent, the tear film break up time (TBUT) test was performed in 96 eyes of 48 subjects. The subjects were placed in to three groups. Participants included two groups of euthymic bipolar disorder patients (16 cases each) with history of pharmacotherapy for more than two years. Patients in each group were taking only one type of mood stabilizer (lithium carbonate or sodium valproate). In addition,16 age-matched bipolar patients who did not take any topical or systemic medications were included in a control group. Values of TBUT were compared between the three groups using the student's t-test.\nThe mean tear film break up time (TBUT) in test groups were 4.88 seconds\u00b1 0.34(lithium group), 4.81 seconds \u00b1 1.60 (valproate group) and 15seconds\u00b1 2.0(control group), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the first and the second groups in TBUT values, but significant differences were found between the two groups and the control group (P< 0.0001).\nThe results of this study show that lithium carbonate and sodium valproate contribute to decrease of tear film break up time, resulting from dryness of the eyes."}, {"Title": "[Use of informatics technology in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Computer technology dominates our daily lives and has become an integral professional tool in medical practice and by extension, in psychiatry as well. The widespread use of internet technology has taken place with unprecedented speed in the history of human civilization, spreading in a few decades to all countries of the world, offering novel possibilities for transmitting information, and leading to the globalization of knowledge. However, the speed with which computer technology is becoming a part of our lives is accompanied by difficulties in integration. The continued evolution of applications often leads to the impression that to be modern and efficient we have to run continuously after developments, dedicating time and effort that we cannot often afford. At the same time, its widespread use alters the needs of our patients, and our efficiency is constantly judged in a globalized environment which, while offering new possibilities, also has new demands. The initial impression that computer technology is simply a tool that can facilitate the work of those who are willing and able to use it has been replaced by the perception that the practice of medicine, in both clinical and academic level, requires sufficient knowledge of modern technology and the development of relevant skills for ongoing training and following innovative applications. The result of this assumption is the introduction of technology courses in the curricula of medical schools in the country. This article offers a brief description of the uses of information technology in psychiatry. In particular, e-mail is one of the most popular Internet services and there is internationally an increasing pressure from the public to be able to contact their doctor by e-mail. Furthermore, almost all psychiatric journals now have a digital electronic edition, thus increasing the volume of articles published, the ease of accessing the required information, and ultimately the reduction of the time it takes a psychiatrist to come to possess a specialized field of knowledge. The Internet also enables psychiatrists, while being at their residence and from their offices and homes in remote areas of a country, or from developing countries to be able to take part relatively easily in continuing medical education programs that are under development in advanced educational centers, eliminating in this way the barrier of distance. Furthermore, telemedicine allows access in health-care to people living in geographically isolated areas with poor medical facilities. The electronic filing systems on the other hand, are also expected in the near future to provide the essential foundation of sharing and managing information material in health care. Apart from the uses of technology in the practice of psychiatry, technology has many uses in Psychiatric Education, providing valuable assistance to both trainees and trainers. Today the educational community has at its disposal a range of devices, operating systems, and web applications useful in medical education. For example, we can mention the existence of technological tools for educational administration and management, evaluation of educational work, tools for creating educational content, and learning outside the confines of the classroom. Developments arising from the use of technology are rapid, and its use brings new applications that have the potential to alter the framework of practicing medicine. However, in many cases, these applications do not go along with the guidelines and principles available to doctors in order to practice their profession in a manner not inconsistent with moral imperatives. The challenge of this new environment is to establish guidelines consistent with the principles of medical ethics."}, {"Title": "Brain rhythms and neural syntax: implications for efficient coding of cognitive content and neuropsychiatric disease.", "Abstract": "The perpetual activity of the cerebral cortex is largely supported by the variety of oscillations the brain generates, spanning a number of frequencies and anatomical locations, as well as behavioral correlates. First, we review findings from animal studies showing that most forms of brain rhythms are inhibition-based, producing rhythmic volleys of inhibitory inputs to principal cell populations, thereby providing alternating temporal windows of relatively reduced and enhanced excitability in neuronal networks. These inhibition-based mechanisms offer natural temporal frames to group or \"chunk\" neuronal activity into cell assemblies and sequences of assemblies, with more complex multi-oscillation interactions creating syntactical rules for the effective exchange of information among cortical networks. We then review recent studies in human psychiatric patients demonstrating a variety alterations in neural oscillations across all major psychiatric diseases, and suggest possible future research directions and treatment approaches based on the fundamental properties of brain rhythms."}, {"Title": "[Exile of Czechoslovak physicians to Sweden after 1968].", "Abstract": "The article describes the situation of the Czechoslovak exile, especially the exile of physicians to Sweden.

Part of the emigrants had to spend some months in the refugee camps and during this time they tried to get visa to other European or non European countries. One of target countries for medical emigrants was also Sweden. In the 60th Sweden had deficiency in physicians and the wave of Czechoslovak emigration was convenient for Swedish Ministry of Health. The group of emigrants consisted of experts from hospitals or graduated medical students. In Sweden they had to attend special courses of Swedish medical language, Swedish medical law and social medicine. If they had medical training shorter than three years, they had to attend special courses also in internal medicine, surgery and psychiatry. After one year of service in northern part of Sweden, where there was a lack of physicians, they could choose hospital, where they wanted to work.

Are delusions of theft symptomatic psychosis In the elderly, there are some physical disease cases which developed into mental illness. For example, delusions of theft were triggered by physical diseases such as knee osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and glaucoma. I think it is possible to position these patients group as having symptomatic psychosis. 2. \"Schizophrenia\" is symptomatic psychosis We are thinking that there is a group that the biological material (bilirubin) in body fluid by way of hepatic failure did play a role leading to the expression of schizophrenia. Therefore I propose the following hypothesis: \"there is a schizophrenia group that is an expression of a very mild kernicterus\". This research started from our experiences having patients who had Gilbert's syndrome which has a high indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin. The patients also had schizophrenia. The psychological symptoms of schizophrenia fluctuated depending on the indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin levels.

Symptom severity could be mild to moderate for many of them due to the incomplete remission, and, thus, electroconvulsive therapy is not applicable for them. However, they usually feel some difficulty performing cognitive behavioral therapy or social rehabilitation training due to residual symptoms such as thought inhibition and hypobulia. Under such conditions, those patients are longing for treatment options complementary to antidepressants, for less painful social reintegration. In October 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States finally approved repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for medication-resistant patients with major depression. The main reason for the FDA approval was that rTMS had shown similar effectiveness (effect size around 0.39 in a recent meta-analysis) to antidepressants for medication-resistant patients without serious adverse effects. TMS is a brain stimulation methodology employing magnetic energy which can penetrate the skull bone without energy decay, and, thus, eddy currents induced by TMS can stimulate cerebral cortices effectively and locally. When TMS is repetitively delivered over several hundreds of pulses within a session, stimulation effects can be observed beyond the stimulation period as aftereffects. Moreover, when a daily rTMS session is repeated over several weeks, rTMS could have antidepressant effects. Clinical trials of rTMS for depression have employed two kinds of rTMS protocol of high-frequency (facilitatory) rTMS over the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and low-frequency (inhibitory) rTMS over the right DLPFC. Although the antidepressant action of rTMS over DLPFC has not been fully elucidated, the neuronal level hypothesis includes the induction of neuroplasticity and activation of the dopamine system, and the neuronal circuitry level hypothesis includes the activation of the left DLPFC and inhibition of the right DLPFC and (para) limbic system such as the subgenual cingulate cortex and amygdala. On the therapeutic application of rTMS in clinical psychiatry, neuroethics and low invasiveness should be fully considered along with a negative history of punitive electroconvulsive therapy and prefrontal lobotomy. It is important to investigate the neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment and to place rTMS in a suitable position within comprehensive treatment algorithms of major depression."}, {"Title": "[The history of Polish criminalistics and forensic medicine and their links to Austrian science].", "Abstract": "The institution of the medical expert was already known in the early Polish courts. The first Chair of Forensic Medicine on Polish soil was established in 1805 at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow and has existed until today. Among its most prominent forensic scientists are Prof. Fryderyk Hechell (1795-1851), Prof. Leon Blumenstock (1838-1895), who was the first to give regular lectures on forensic medicine for law students, and Prof. Leon Wachholz (1867-1941), who was a student of both Prof. Blumenstock and Prof. Eduard von Hofmann (1837-1897), under whose supervision he worked in Vienna. Under his guidance and supervision, he started to collect material for his habilitation. At that time, Hofmann was considered the pioneer of experimental research in forensic medicine. In Vienna, Wachholz was a guest scientist not only with Prof. von Hofmann, but also in the Psychiatric Hospital of Prof. Richard von Krafft-Ebing. After his return to Cracow, he was head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Jagiellonian University for several decades. Apart from forensic medicine in the strict sense of the word, he also worked in the fields now known as criminalistics, forensic psychiatry and criminology. In these latter fields, the influence of Krafft-Ebing was still noticeable. Three students of Wachholz became professors of forensic medicine: Jan Olbrycht, Stanislaw Horoszkiewicz and W\u0142odzimierz Sieradzki. Their students founded a whole generation of forensic scientists.

Such testing may represent an unnecessary expense that prolongs emergency department stays without significantly improving care. This study determines the prevalence of such testing and how often it leads to changes in care.\nWe prospectively tracked laboratory testing among psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency departments of two academic tertiary care facilities. For each visit we determined whether laboratory or radiographic studies were ordered, and whether the examination was conducted at the request of the emergency physician as part of a medical screening examination or requested by the psychiatry service. We then determined if this testing changed patient disposition.\nOur study enrolled 598 patients. Of these, emergency physicians ordered testing as a part of medical screening on 155 patients (25.9%). We found the psychiatry service ordered laboratory or radiographic studies for 191 of 434 patients (44.0%) who emergency physicians determined did not require ancillary testing for medical clearance. Of these 191 patients, only one (0.5%; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.01% - 2.9%) had an abnormal result that led to a change in disposition. Total Medicare reimbursement rates for the additional ancillary testing in this study was $37,682.\nAncillary testing beyond what is required for medical clearance of psychiatric emergency patients rarely alters care.

Tracing the nomenclature within successive editions of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), I consider the reification of the term 'FSD', and the activism and scholarship that the rise of the category has occasioned. I suggest that analysis of FSD benefits from scrutiny of a wider range of sources (especially since the popular and scientific cross-pollinate). I explore the multiplicity of FSD that emerges when one examines this wider range, but I also underscore a reinscribing of anxieties about psychogenic aetiologies. I then argue that what makes the FSD case additionally interesting, over and above other conditions with a contested status, is the historically complex relationship between psychiatry and feminism that is at work in contemporary debates. I suggest that existing literature on FSD has not yet posed some of the most important and salient questions at stake in writing about women's sexual problems in this period, and can only do this when the relationship between 'second-wave' feminism, 'post-feminism', psychiatry and psychoanalysis becomes part of the terrain to be analysed, rather than the medium through which analysis is conducted."}, {"Title": "Jean-martin charcot pathologist, neurologist, psychiatrist and physician.", "Abstract": "Jean-Martin Charcot is known as father of modern neurology.

There is mounting evidence linking dietary patterns to major depression development. This article presents some of the most significant findings concerning the role of nutrition in major depressive disorder. Although more focused and clear results are needed, the correlation between nutrition and mental health is gaining attention. Now, there is evidence supporting the importance of nutrition in maintaining good mental health. We emphasize multiple findings that support adherence to healthy dietary patterns, taking into account that the production of neurotransmitters need, among others, right amounts of nutrients, a lot of which can only be supplied through diet. Not only certain nutrients are needed for proper brain functioning, but also others can be harmful, promoting depression. The Mediterranean diet has been linked to a low prevalence of depression while fast-food consumption has been found to increase the risk of developing and aggravating this disorder, hence the need for nutritional interventions.

Nascent emotional systems thus affect cognitive development. A second proposal concerns two additions to the affective systems identified by Panksepp. We suggest there is substantial evidence for a primary emotional organizing program dealing with power, rank, dominance, and subordination which instantiates competitive and territorial behavior and is an evolutionary contributor to self-esteem in humans.

Comparisons between the pregnancy-onset and postpartum-onset subjects included demographics, psychiatric diagnostic history, psychosocial stressors, reproductive history, and current episode symptoms. Time of onset within trimesters of pregnancy and within the postpartum year as well as the effects of discontinuation of antidepressant medication were also examined.\nWomen with major depressive episodes that began during pregnancy had higher rates of prior episodes of postpartum and nonperinatal major depression (both P values < .001). Major depression that began during pregnancy was also more commonly associated with psychosocial stressors. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and psychotic symptoms were more common in postpartum-onset depression. These findings were also evident in the subgroup of 176 subjects who did not discontinue antidepressant medication during the year prior to development of perinatal depression. The onset of 94% of postpartum major depressive episodes occured within the first 4 months postpartum. Episodes of major depression during pregnancy were more likely to develop in the first trimester for women who discontinued antidepressant medication within the past year; otherwise, depression onset was more evenly distributed across trimesters.\nWomen with a history of perinatal and nonperinatal major depression are more likely to relapse during pregnancy than postpartum, a finding that points to the need for closely monitoring these women for depression during pregnancy. In addition, these findings of differences in risk factors and clinical features suggest that postpartum-onset major depression may have a pathophysiology distinct from major depression that begins during pregnancy.

One of its side effects is the loud click sound generated simultaneously to the magnetic pulse, which depends both on the equipment and rTMS intensity. This impulse sound could transiently modify peripheral hearing mechanisms, and hence hearing thresholds, both in patients and in rTMS practitioners. Furthermore, if no precautions are taken, especially in subjects with several risks factors for hearing loss, it is possible that the repetition of exposure could lead to more definitive changes in hearing thresholds.

In this sense, we formulate psychiatric intervention as a \"pact with anorexia\", once it follows the very same logic, prohibitions and self-impositions of the disorder. Specifically, we envisage the meal plan as a way of maintaining anorexia, instead of suppressing it. As we could observe in our four year research project, in which we've followed several anorectic female patients, those who were more committed to their psychiatric treatment were precisely those who had more difficulty in recovering from anorexia - i.e., from renouncing the control from which the disorder lives.

This forms part of a wider effort to maintain the combat effectiveness of the fighting force. During a recent deployment, I maintained a reflexive journal of my experience of liaising with the British Chain of Command. I then used line by line coding via the NVIVO 9 software package to formulate the core themes that became a framework for this autoethnography. My personality and social anxieties shaped how I performed the psychiatric liaison role. I was able to develop a template for liaison that accounted for both 'me' and my need to feel authentic or credible as a nurse, yet still enabled me to communicate effectively with the Chain of Command. One template for psychiatric nursing liaison with British combat forces is to focus upon key stakeholders within the Chain of Command, specifically, the Officer Commanding, the Sergeant Major, the Trauma Risk Management co-ordinator (usually the Sergeant Major) and the embedded medical asset. Further research is needed to establish how other nurses approach psychiatric nursing liaison."}, {"Title": "Understanding alexithymia within a psychoanalytical framework.", "Abstract": "The object of this paper is to provide a metapsychological definition of alexithymia as described in 1967 in terms of operational thinking and negative hallucination. This is a familiar and established concept in the fields of psychopathology, psychology, and of clinical and psychosomatic medicine. From a psychoanalytic and psychosomatic point of view, the term is conceptually close to P. Marty's \"operative thinking\", as described in 1963, even though we know they do not belong to the same epistemological field: on one hand Neuroscience, Psychiatry and the objectalization of the symptom at different levels, and on the other, as regards mechanical functioning, a psychoanalytic clinical approach within the dynamics of the relationship between transference and counter-transference. The present authors consider that Freudian metapsychology, as now complexified by Andr\u00e8 Green, allows for a metapsychological approach to alexithymia insofar as it relates to Marty's operative thinking. Thus does Green's conceptualization of the mother's negative hallucination, of negative introjection, of a psychically 'dead (and insecure) mother', now provide us with the opportunity to describe, in metapsychological terms, the genesis of this particular mode of psychical functioning. Given the mother's negative hallucination produces a host structure as a background to negativity that will fit future object representations, we will assume that in the case of \u2026 future operational or alexithymic \u2026?, this negative hallucination will pathologically and defensively involve the endo-psychic perception of affect."}, {"Title": "Five years after implementation: a review of the Irish Mental Health Act 2001.", "Abstract": "The Mental Health Act 2001 (MHA 2001) was implemented in November 2006.

Mental Health Tribunals were held for 57% of those admitted involuntarily and 46% of service users found that the Mental Health Tribunal made the involuntary admission easier to accept. One year after discharge, 60% of service users reflected that their involuntary admission had been necessary. Professional groups have expressed concerns regarding workload, training time for junior doctors and paperwork.\nThe MHA 2001 has brought the practice of involuntary admission further into line with international standards.

Gene expression studies on post mortem brains indicate extensive changes prior to a successful suicide attempt; however, proteomic studies are scarce. Thus, we performed a DIGE proteomic analysis of post mortem tissue samples from the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of suicide victims to identify protein changes and biomarker candidates of suicide. Among our matched spots we found 46 and 16 significant differences in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, respectively; by using the industry standard t test and 1.3 fold change as cut off for significance. Because of the risk of false discoveries (FDR) in these data, we also made FDR adjustment by calculating the q-values for all the t tests performed and by using 0.06 and 0.4 as alpha thresholds we reduced the number of significant spots to 27 and 9 respectively. From these we identified 59 proteins in the cortex and 11 proteins in the amygdala. These proteins are related to biological functions and structures such as metabolism, the redox system, the cytoskeleton, synaptic function, and proteolysis. Thirteen of these proteins (CBR1, DPYSL2, EFHD2, FKBP4, GFAP, GLUL, HSPA8, NEFL, NEFM, PGAM1, PRDX6, SELENBP1 and VIM,) have already been suggested to be biomarkers of psychiatric disorders at protein or genome level.

In the antidepressant-treated patients, self-management of drug intake and pharmacist adherence instruction was initiated after depressive symptoms were in remission, and pharmacist adherence instruction was conducted until the day of discharge.\nThere were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between antidepressant-na\u00efve and antidepressant-treated patients. In antidepressant-treated patients, the mean DAI-10 total score was significantly lower and awareness of side effects was significantly higher than in antidepressant-na\u00efve patients who have never taken antidepressants, nor been referred to psychiatry services (according to pharmacist interviews and medical records). On the first day of self-management of drug intake, the DAI-10 total score in patients with melancholic and bipolar depression was significantly lower than that in patients with nonmelancholic depression. On the day of discharge, there was a significant improvement of DAI-10 total score in all antidepressant-treated patients, and the DAI-10 total score in patients with melancholic depression was significantly lower than that in patients with nonmelancholic depression. The limitation of the study was the small sample size and the fact that we followed only acute phase inpatients. However, the findings seem particularly robust in view of this.\nRisk factors for nonadherence included side effects of antidepressant treatment and type of depression.

There are several criteria used for the detection and diagnosis of ADHD, which are described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) validated diagnostic scales like the ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS). ADHD is often associated with different comorbid conditions like mood disorders, anxiety, defiant oppositional conduct or learning disorders in children, and substances abuse on adults. Studies on adults, demonstrate 87% of the patients with ADHD present with at least one psychiatric comorbidity which raises the importance of an accurate early diagnosis of ADHD. Pharmacological treatment approaches for ADHD as well as for some of the psychiatry comorbidities involve the dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic systems.

The complexity of NP disorders arises from their etiologic heterogeneity and the concurrent influence of environmental and genetic factors. In addition, the absence of rigid boundaries between the normal and diseased state, the remarkable overlap of symptoms among conditions, the high inter-individual and inter-population variations, and the absence of discriminative molecular and/or imaging biomarkers for these diseases makes difficult an accurate diagnosis. Along with the complexity of NP disorders, the practice of psychiatry suffers from a \"top-down\" method that relied on symptom checklists. Although checklist diagnoses cost less in terms of time and money, they are less accurate than a comprehensive assessment. Thus, reliable and objective diagnostic tools such as biomarkers are needed that can detect and discriminate among NP disorders. The real promise in understanding the pathophysiology of NP disorders lies in bringing back psychiatry to its biological basis in a systemic approach which is needed given the NP disorders' complexity to understand their normal functioning and response to perturbation. This approach is implemented in the systems biology discipline that enables the discovery of disease-specific NP biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutics. Systems biology involves the use of sophisticated computer software \"omics\"-based discovery tools and advanced performance computational techniques in order to understand the behavior of biological systems and identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers specific for NP disorders together with new targets of therapeutics. In this review, we try to shed light on the need of systems biology, bioinformatics, and biomarkers in neuropsychiatry, and illustrate how the knowledge gained through these methodologies can be translated into clinical use providing clinicians with improved ability to diagnose, manage, and treat NP patients."}, {"Title": "Rediscovering psychopathology: the epistemology and phenomenology of the psychiatric object.", "Abstract": "Questions concerning both the ontology and epistemology of the \"psychiatric object\" (symptoms and signs) should be at the forefront of current concerns of psychiatry as a clinical neuroscience.

In honor of the centenary of Karl Jaspers' book, General Psychopathology, we offer a critique of the contemporary \"operationalist\" epistemology, a critique that is consistent with Jaspers' views. Symptoms and signs cannot be properly understood or identified apart from an appreciation of the nature of consciousness or subjectivity, which in turn cannot be treated as a collection of thing-like, mutually independent objects, accessible to context-free, \"atheoretical\" definitions or unproblematic forms of measurement (as is often assumed in structured interviewing). Adequate and faithful distinctions in the phenomenal or experiential realm are therefore a fundamental prerequisite for classification, treatment, and research.

Rudolph Gottfried Arndt and his 1870s studies.", "Abstract": "Today's brain stimulation methods are commonly traced back historically to surgical brain operations. With this one-sided historical approach it is easy to overlook the fact that non-surgical electrical brain-stimulating applications preceded present-day therapies.\nThe first study on transcranial electrical brain stimulation for the treatment of severe mental diseases in a larger group of patients was carried out in the 1870s.\nBetween 1870 and 1878 German psychiatrist Rudolph Gottfried Arndt published the results of his studies in three reports. These are contextualized with contemporary developments of the time, focusing in particular on the (neuro-) sciences. As was common practice at the time, Arndt basically reported individual cases in which electricity was applied to treat severe psychoses with depressive symptoms or even catatonia, hypochondriac delusion and melancholia. Despite their lengthiness, there is frequently a lack of precise physical data on the application of psychological-psychopathological details. Only his 1878 report includes general rules for electrical brain stimulation.\nDespite their methodological shortcomings and lack of precise treatment data impeding exact understanding, Arndt's studies are pioneering works in the field of electric brain stimulation with psychoses and its positive impacts. Today's transcranial direct current stimulation, and partly vagus nerve stimulation, can be compared with Arndt's methods. Although Arndt's only tangible results were indications for the application of faradic electricity (for inactivity, stupor, weakness and manic depressions) and galvanic current (for affective disorders and psychoses), a historiography of present-day brain stimulation therapies should no longer neglect studies on electrotherapy published in German and international psychiatric and neurological journals and monographs in the 1870s and 1880s."}, {"Title": "Separate may not be equal: a preliminary investigation of clinical correlates of electronic psychiatric record accessibility in academic medical centers.", "Abstract": "Electronic Medical Records (EMR) have the potential to improve the coordination of healthcare in this country, yet the field of psychiatry has lagged behind other medical disciplines in its adoption of EMR.\nPsychiatrists at 18 of the top US hospitals completed an electronic survey detailing whether their psychiatric records were stored electronically and accessible to non-psychiatric physicians.

This capacity for self-regulation is evolutionarily realized by the highly developed neocortex and developmentally matures during adolescence. Inappropriate maturation of the neural systems responsible for self-regulation in adolescence could lead to the emergence of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder, the onset of which usually takes place during adolescence/youth; one of its core features is disturbance of self-related information processing. Although schizophrenia has been associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities during the perinatal period, recently improved neuroimaging techniques have shown progressive deterioration in the structure and function of neocortical regions in the prodromal and first-episode stages of the disorder. These reconsiderations have stimulated neurobiological investigations into the normal developmental process and its disturbance of the glutamatergic/synaptic system in adolescence. Of late, clinical psychiatry has been seeking early intervention strategies by integrating biological and psychosocial approaches.

Their main features are the following: the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); the symptoms resolve within 6 months, once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Adjustment disorder with anxiety (ADA) is a very common diagnosis in primary care, liaison and general psychiatry services but we still lack data about its specificity as a clinical entity. Current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress.\nNinety-seven patients with ADA according DSM-IV were recruited in this primary care study and compared with 30 control subjects matched for age and sex. The diagnosis was made according to the MINI questionnaire completed with a standardized research of stressful events and an assessment of anxiety symptoms using different scales: the Hamilton Anxiety rating Scale (HAM-A), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), The Penn-State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), the Positive and Negative Emotionality scale, 31 items (EPN-31 scale) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S).\nLife events in relation to work were the most frequent (43%). In terms of symptomatology, results showed that ADA is associated with a level of anxiety close to those obtained in other anxiety disorders, particularly GAD, in relation to general symptoms (physical and somatic) as well as anxious rumination and negative emotions.\nFurther research is needed to better understand the disorder and clarify its frontiers, which still remain a controversial issue with regard to the homeostatic response to stress and other types of anxiety disorders.

From their inpatient medical records, we investigated the descriptions of persecutors and their persecutory behaviors in the delusions of 124 patients (54 in the1990s and 72 in the 2000s).\nOverall, persecutory behaviors and nature of persecutors in the delusions of schizophrenia did not differ between the two time frames. However, subgroup analysis revealed that in women but not in men, rejection as a persecutory behavior was significantly higher in the 1990s (p<0.05).\nThe ten-year time interval may be too short to find significant changes in delusional content in general. However, our additional finding in women may be a result of the tremendous change in status of Korean women during the last decade."}, {"Title": "Attitude scale and general health questionnaire subscales predict depression?", "Abstract": "According to Beck theory, dysfunctional attitude has a central role in emergence of depression. The aim of this study was to determine contributions of dysfunctional attitude and general health index to depression.\nIn this case-control study, two groups of subjects participated. The first group consisted of 65 patients with major depression and dysthymic disorder, who were recruited from Noor and Navab Safavi Psychiatry Clinics in Isfahan. The control group was consisted of 65 non-patient individuals who were accompanied or relatives of the patients and was matched with them based on age, sex and education. Both groups completed 26-item Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS-26) and 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Logistic regression and correlation methods were applied for statistical analysis.\nLogistic regression analysis showed that by an increase of one level in categorized DAS-26 scores and one score in the physical symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression subscales of GHQ-28 the risk of depression increase by 6.8, 1.6, 1.9, 3.7, 4.78 times, respectively.\nCapability of dysfunctional attitude and general health subscales to predict depression supports the Beck's cognitive diathesis stress theory of depression that dysfunctional attitude may be a predisposing risk factor for depression."}, {"Title": "[Social representations of psychiatric care in Tunisia].", "Abstract": "The progress in the field of the treatment of the mental illnesses is considerable. However, the clinical reality confirms the delay in access to care for numerous patients. This avoidance is due,in big part, to the pejorative representations of the psychiatrics'system care.\nTo assess the social images in the Tunisian population, regarding 3 stereotypes: \"insane\", \"mentally ill\" and \"depressive\".\nThe used instrument is the socio-anthropological questionnaire of the \" Mental health in general population: images and realities\" survey.\nThe medicinal treatment occupies the first place of the planned care for an \"insane\" and for the \"mentally ill\". For the \"depressive\" and for our self, population would rather use relational support. Also, we notice that the family, in spite of its suffering and of the undergone daily load, is given is a central place in perception of the care for psychiatric pathologies.\nFinally, an \"insane\" is not perceived as possibly cured while it is more expected for the \"mentally ill\" and even more for the \"depressive\", even without any medical intervention. In the term of our analysis, let us underline the misunderstanding of the available therapeutic possibilities in psychiatry and the necessity of large-scale raising awareness."}, {"Title": "Lessons learned in the conduct of a global, large simple trial of treatments indicated for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Large, \"practical\" or streamlined trials (LSTs) are used to study the effectiveness and/or safety of medicines in real world settings with minimal study imposed interventions. While LSTs have benefits over traditional randomized clinical trials and observational studies, there are inherent challenges to their conduct. Enrollment and follow-up of a large study sample of patients with mental illness pose a particular difficulty. To assist in overcoming operational barriers in future LSTs in psychiatry, this paper describes the recruitment and observational follow-up strategies used for the ZODIAC study, an international, open-label LST, which followed 18,239 persons randomly assigned to one of two treatments indicated for schizophrenia for 1 year. ZODIAC enrolled patients in 18 countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia using broad study entry criteria and required minimal clinical care intervention. Recruitment of adequate numbers and continued engagement of both study centers and subjects were significant challenges. Strategies implemented to mitigate these in ZODIAC include global study expansion, study branding, field coordinator and site relations programs, monthly site newsletters, collection of alternate contact information, conduct of national death index (NDI) searches, and frequent sponsor, contract research organization (CRO) and site interaction to share best practices and address recruitment challenges quickly. We conclude that conduct of large LSTs in psychiatric patient populations is feasible, but importantly, realistic site recruitment goals and maintaining site engagement are key factors that need to be considered in early study planning and conduct."}, {"Title": "[The profile of neonaticide mothers in legal expertise].", "Abstract": "Neonaticide is the term used to refer to the killing of newborn infants within the first 24 hours of life. A recent study conducted by Inserm Unit 750 found a frequency of 2.1 cases of neonaticide for 100,000 births in France. The persistence of these crimes raises serious issues, and scientists have attempted to explain this by the profile of neonaticidal mothers: young, or even teenage, single, primiparous, and socially deprived. The present study sought to question this profile, and to suggest a new profile for neonaticidal mothers.\nThis retrospective study over the years 1996-2000 comprised 32 cases of neonaticide perpetrated in three French regions. Seventeen solved cases of these 32 cases generated 54 documents by expert consultants, mainly psychiatric and psychological expertise, studied and analysed here using Modalisa software for quantitative analyses and Nvivo software for qualitative data.\nNo single socio-demographic profile was observed. The mothers were in contrasting situations at the time of the event. There were few psychotic profiles. The other psychopathological disturbances detected were very often related to the event. The most surprising feature in the expert reports describing the neonaticidal mothers was the existence of what we have termed \"descriptive absent-factors\". These mothers had not experienced major trauma in childhood such as the death of persons close or foster care. They were not living in an environment of family violence. They did not exhibit addictive or self-harm behaviour. Their parents before them had similar profiles, except three cases of alcoholism. Their parentage, and that of the infants, was not an issue. The most widely described personality features were immaturity, dependency on others, withdrawal, inhibition, emptiness, lack of affectivity, non-expressiveness, and devaluation of self-image. The very impoverished relational environment of these mothers also appears in the expertise data. Their affective and relational foundations were insecure.\nThe \"classic\" profile of the neonaticidal mother as being young, single, and primiparous is not confirmed in this study. Recent American and European studies reach similar conclusions. More than half of these mothers already had other children; more than half were living with a partner. Nor did these mothers have an evident psychopathological profile, and even less so a psychopathic profile. This study suggests a \"psycho-relational\" profile for the neonaticidal mother: immature, affectively dependent, expressing herself very little, and experiencing considerable affective isolation.\nThese neonaticidal mothers did not present any specific socio-demographic or evident psychopathological profile. The study nevertheless enabled definition of a \"psycho-relational\" profile."}, {"Title": "[Charisma and leadership: new challenges for psychiatry].", "Abstract": "New challenges arise in medicine, particularly in psychiatry. In the near future, psychiatrists' role may evolve into management of mental health care teams (GPs, nurses, psychologists\u2026) thus creating the need for charisma and leadership. Charisma is defined as \u00ab\u00a0a quality that allows it's possessor to exercise influence, authority over a group\u00a0\u00bb; leadership as \u00ab\u00a0the function, the position of chief, and by extension, a dominant position\u00a0\u00bb.\nTo offer some reflections on charisma and leadership and the ways to develop them in three situations common in clinical practice: dual communication (between caregivers or with patients), oral communication (e.g., during\u00a0a symposium) and managing a mental health care team.\nMedline (1966-hits) and Web of Science (1975-hits) were explored according to the PRISMA criteria. The research paradigm was [(psychiatrist OR physician) AND mental health AND (leadership OR charisma)].\nTwo hundred and eighty articles were found, but only 34 corresponded to our subject and were included in the qualitative analysis. The leader must first ask himself/herself about his/her vision of the future, so as to share it with passion with his/her mental health team. Charisma and leadership are based on several values, among which we can mention: providing understandable, personalized care for the patient, in continuity and confidentiality; adapting care to the general population's request, maintaining one's own physical and mental health, submitting one's daily practice to peer review, engaging in continuous improvement of one's practices in response to new requirements, and recognizing that research and instruction are part of an M.D's professional obligations. The clinician will work on ways to develop his/her own charisma, through interactions with peers and team members, the care of his/her appearance (especially for first meetings) and workplace, and through positive reinforcement (some cognitive-behavioral techniques like assertiveness have been proposed to enhance the charisma, e.g., visualization and affirmation). Leadership does not depend on hierarchical position and administrative responsibilities: leaders should learn to manage and harmonize the different types of personalities within his/her team, paying special attention to passive-aggressive attitudes. We recall here some techniques to improve charisma during oral communication, such as making relationships with people by calling them by their names, making reference to things and people that the audience can identify with (like sport or cooking), using one's own style without trying to imitate someone else, focusing on one major idea, being brief and using anecdotes, using silences effectively and finally having good non-verbal communication. The conclusion should never be neglected, as an audience especially remembers the beginning and the end of a presentation. Although some features are common to all charismatic leaders (dominance, self-confidence, high energy level), a recent theory of leadership (called contingency theory) seeks to examine how different leadership styles can adapt to circumstances. This theory focuses more on the vision, passion, determination and courage of the leader and depends not only on their intrinsic qualities. No research has indeed shown individual characteristics that differentiate leaders from followers. However, doctors have not been prepared in their training to acquire leadership skills that they can use to adapt to the circumstances of their clinical practice. The most important qualities expected of a leader according to the current leadership theorists are: listening, communication, stress management, development of other's capacities, feedback, introspection and risk taking. Moreover, leadership involves positive reinforcement of the team while maintaining the feeling of individual autonomy, and being able to take an innovative decision alone with shared optimism. There is no need to have great management responsibilities in order to succeed in leadership. We reiterate the importance for a charismatic leader to smile, to be able to mock oneself and to regulate one's emotions.\nCharisma seems to be an essential dimension for effective leadership and team management. Beyond psychiatry, we believe these reflections to be useful for all branches of medicine."}, {"Title": "[Patient therapeutic education in psychiatry. A survey of practice in Aquitaine public hospitals].", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to assess the characteristics of therapeutic education practice in French public psychiatric hospitals and to describe the ongoing patient education programs.\nWe conducted an online survey. Adult and child psychiatrists (n=264) of Aquitaine's public hospitals (n=9) were asked to describe their daily educational practice using an internet questionnaire. Coordinators of patient education programs were invited to complete a specific questionnaire describing these programs.\nOf the 264 psychiatrists contacted, 95 participated in the only survey (participation rate 36%), 85.7% were adult psychiatrists and 14.3% child psychiatrists. Most psychiatrists (85% or more) \"always or often\" educated their patients on the disease (name, etiology, symptoms), its treatment and the prevention of relapses and complications. Other mental health professionals, such as nurses, were rarely involved in this educational process. Less than a quarter of the psychiatrists \"always or often\" invited their patients to participate in a structured patient education program. Twelve education programs were described by their coordinators (13.6% of the participants). Compared to non-coordinators, coordinators had graduated significantly more frequently less than 10years before (92% vs. 49%) but did not differ regarding other characteristics. Bipolar disorder (n=4) and schizophrenia (n=7) were the most frequent indications of these programs. Half of the programs were distributed by pharmaceutical companies. Almost half (45%) of the programs were opened to patient's carers and relatives. Increase in knowledge and competence were evaluated in 73% of the programs, and satisfaction in 64% of the programs. These findings have to be interpretated in the light of a possible selection bias favouring the participation of practitioners supporting or actively implicated in patient education, contributing to inflated estimates of the real frequency of educational practice in public psychiatric hospitals.\nOn the one hand, our study shows a strong involvement of psychiatrists in patient therapeutic education in daily practice. On the other hand, very few structured programs were ongoing, mostly concerning bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, i.e. disorders for which evidence of efficiency of patient education has been demonstrated. These findings suggest that implementation of further patient education programs should be encouraged and that formation of further professionals is a priority."}, {"Title": "Classification of mental disorders: the importance of inclusive decision-making.", "Abstract": "With DSM-V and ICD-11 on the horizon, now is an excellent time to consider the process leading on to the revision of classificatory systems in psychiatry. The challenges of classification in psychiatry are not inconsiderable. Among these are the controversies about what constitutes a 'disorder' and the appropriate place to draw the line between 'normality' and abnormal psychological status. In the absence of validating biomarkers for most mental disorders, judgements are required about the emphasis to put on available empirical data in the revision of existing classifications. In this review we propose that, given the salience of factors such as culture and contextual social experience to the experience and nature of mental disorders, there is an important need for inclusiveness in the process of leading to the revisions of classifications of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Basing psychiatric classification on scientific foundation: problems and prospects.", "Abstract": "To examine whether and how the classification of mental disorders can be based on research, we evaluate the relevance of psychiatric science to the major questions in classification. We conclude that most studies cannot inform the validity of diagnostic categories because they are constrained by the classification through a top-down diagnostic approach. Analyses of relationships between diagnostic categories suggest that most interdiagnostic boundaries in current classifications lack validity. Likewise, genetic studies show that the susceptibility to mental illness is at most partly disorder-specific. Neuroimaging research is uninformative due to unsystematic single-diagnosis studies, use of super-healthy controls, and publication bias. Treatment research suggests moderate specificity in several areas of psychopathology (e.g. lithium for bipolar disorder), but lack of specificity is the rule (e.g. the broad indications of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors). In summary, evidence from multiple lines of research converges to indicate that current classifications contain excessively large numbers of categories of limited validity. Dimensional classification will not solve the problem because the number of dimensions is as uncertain as the number of categories. Psychiatric research should discard the assumption that current classification is valid. Instead of diagnosis-specific investigations, studies of unselected groups assessed with bottom-up approaches are needed to advance psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric illness of systemic lupus erythematosus in childhood: spectrum of clinically important manifestations.", "Abstract": "To determine the spectrum of manifestations in clinically important (i.e., requiring alterations of immunosuppressive therapy) psychiatric illness of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) and to describe the laboratory and imaging features associated with psychiatric illness of pSLE (psySLE).\nThis was a single-center cohort study of patients with pSLE followed at a pediatric SLE clinic from August 1985 to July 2009.

This creates problems for physicians as the patients seen in clinical practice are not representative of those on which medical treatments and interventions have been trialled, and we need to consider whether results (both negative and positive) from these trials are applicable to these patients. Our aim was to gauge whether exclusion of older people was prevalent in research proposals submitted to Dublin teaching hospitals. We audited all clinical research proposals submitted to the Research Ethics committee (REC) covering the teaching hospitals attached to Trinity College Dublin (TCD) from July 2008 to July 2011 inclusive, recording exclusion of patients based on an arbitrary upper age limit. Of the 226 relevant trials studied, 31(13.7%) excluded participants based solely on an arbitrary upper age limit. 22 (9.8%) of the relevant trials were submitted by geriatricians, none of which excluded patients based solely on age. Over 50% (12 of 22) trials submitted by neurology/psychiatry excluded patients based on an upper age limit. The mean upper age limit used over all trials as a cut-off was 69.2 years of age. As well as this, the majority of the remaining trials also contained other exclusion criteria, especially those based on cognitive function which further limited participation of older people. While we found that a significant proportion of clinical trials submitted to the TCD REC still excluded patients based arbitrarily on an upper age limit, participation rates of older people seem to be higher in this Irish centre than that seen in international trials. Significant room for improvement still remains however and there needs to be a promotion of greater awareness of the need for developing, testing and licensing medicines so that it mirrors the consumer groups in which they will be used. Increased input from geriatricians around the testing and licensing of medicines, and in licensing agencies, would greatly help in this regard. It is both unhelpful for optimal healthcare as well as fundamentally unjust to exclude participants from clinical research based solely on an arbitrary age limit."}, {"Title": "Ordered subset linkage analysis based on admixture proportion identifies new linkage evidence for alcohol dependence in African-Americans.", "Abstract": "Genetic heterogeneity could reduce the power of linkage analysis to detect risk loci for complex traits such as alcohol dependence (AD). Previously, we performed a genomewide linkage analysis for AD in African-Americans (AAs) (Biol Psychiatry 65:111-115, 2009). The power of that linkage analysis could have been reduced by the presence of genetic heterogeneity owing to differences in admixture among AA families. We hypothesized that by examining a study sample whose genetic ancestry was more homogeneous, we could increase the power to detect linkage. To test this hypothesis, we performed ordered subset linkage analysis in 384 AA families using admixture proportion as a covariate to identify a more homogeneous subset of families and determine whether there is increased evidence for linkage with AD. Statistically significant increases in lod scores in subsets relative to the overall sample were identified on chromosomes 4 (P = 0.0001), 12 (P = 0.021), 15 (P = 0.026) and 22 (P = 0.0069). In a subset of 44 families with African ancestry proportions ranging from 0.858 to 0.996, we observed a genomewide significant linkage at 180 cM on chromosome 4 (lod = 4.24, pointwise P < 0.00001, empirical genomewide P = 0.008). A promising candidate gene located there, GLRA3, which encodes a subunit of the glycine neurotransmitter receptor. Our results demonstrate that admixture proportion can be used as a covariate to reduce genetic heterogeneity and enhance the detection of linkage for AD in an admixed population such as AAs.

However, mental institutions in Japan were inadequate until the end of World War II in 1945. The Tohoku region, comprised of 6 prefectures located in northeastern Japan, experienced a delay in modernization, struggled economically, and also showed a delay in the development of mental institutions. To supplement the insufficient number of mental institutions, the Tohoku region had private institutions for the mentally disturbed. This report presents an overview of the mental and private institutions for the mentally disturbed in the Tohoku region between 1868 and 1945.\nWe investigated mental and private institutions for mentally disturbed persons in the Tohoku region between 1868 and 1945 based on a review of the literature: Shuzo Kure: Current conditions of facilities with mental patients in Japan (1907). Shuzo Kure, Goro Kashida: Actual situation and statistical observation of home custody for mental patients (1918). Osamu Kan: Survey on mentally disturbed persons similar to mentally ill persons, and on mental illness in Japan (1937). Ministry of Health and Welfare: Report on Psychiatric Institutions (1940).\nThe establishment of both mental and educational institutions for clinical psychiatry was delayed by 30 years in Tohoku compared to the central part of Japan (Kyoto and Tokyo). Private institutions for the mentally disturbed were also uncommon, but the treatment of mental illness in the Tohoku region between 1968 and 1945 was mainly performed at Joge Hot Spring, Miyagi Prefecture, which was also a private institution for the mentally disturbed. (1)Miyagi Prefecture: A hotel was completed in 1864 at Joge Hot Spring, and, by 1891, many mental patients were staying at the hotel. The treatment involved bathing in the hot spring with a temperature close to the body temperature for a long period of time. Mental patients gathered from multiple prefectures in the Tohoku region. The hotel became increasingly less popular from around 1960 and closed around 2005. Tohoku Jikei-In was a private institution established in 1899 for persons who fell ill during a journey with no-one to help. It began to take in mental patients in 1905, and, at its prime, contained 18 to 19 patients. From around 1934 to around 1943, Jisho Nishikata built an institution for mental patients within Nichiren Shu Butsugenji Temple, which is a Buddhist temple. (2) Yamagata Prefecture: The Buddhist temple Kangetsuzan Myohoji Temple contained mental patients. (3) Fukushima Prefecture: In 1927, Ryokan Oe established Ryozenan at the top of Ryozen Mountain to treat mental patients by reciting sutra and prayer. The facility was closed down when abusive treatment of mental patients was revealed in 1936. There are no records regarding private institutions for mental patients in Akita, Aomori, or Iwate Prefectures.\nThe establishment of mental institutions in Tohoku Prefecture was delayed and the number of beds for patients was insufficient between 1868 and 1945. Private institutions played a large role in housing mental patients.

Keijo was the name used for the capital city of Korea, Seoul, when Korea was under Japanese rule. We believe the Keijo Imperial University evolved out of the Governor-General of Korea Hospital and Keijo Medical Professional School. The first Professor at the University was Shinji Suitsu, who studied under Shuzo Kure. He visited Shizuoka prefecture when he collaborated in Kure's \"Actual situation and statistical observation on home custody of mental patients\" (1918). This was confirmed by photographic materials from this time. The year after the visit to Shizuoka, Suitsu was sent to the Korean Peninsula. In 1913, Suitsu established the Department of Psychiatry at the Governor-General of Korea Hospital, and the institution had 500 tsubo (approximately 1,650 m2) of land within Keijo (Seoul), with floor space of 160 tsubo (approximately 528 m2) and 24 beds. Treatments were performed by Suitsu, an assistant, and 8-9 nurses. The number of hospitalized patients was 30-50 patients per year. Cells had floor heating. Keijo Imperial University was established in 1924, and was called Jodai. In 1925, Suitsu retired from his Professorship of Psychiatry at Keijo Medical Professional School. Suitsu was from Kyoto Imperial University, and had studied abroad. In 1925, Suitsu's father-in-law, and a long-time friend of Shuzo Kure, Seiji Yamane, passed away. The professor who took up the position after Suitsu was Kiyoji Kubo, who was originally supposed to go to Hokkaido Imperial University. When the medical school was established at Keijo Imperial University in 1926, Kubo was offered a professorship there. Jodai was under the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Korea, and not the Ministry of Education. Later, professors and assistant professors and assistants of Jodai lectured in Mental Science at Keijo Medical Professional School. There was insufficient funding to run two Medical Departments within Seoul, and therefore the staff were transferred to Jodai, from which they supported the Medical Professional School. Jodai hospital was expanded to 222 beds with a total of 35 physicians, including the hospital director, medical officers, and professors. Members of the Medical Department, including professors of Psychiatry, although not near one another, reported homework and submitted subjects for speeches at every annual meeting. Starting from Manjiro Sugihara's \"Supplementary knowledge of induced insanity,\" the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (original article, 1929), there is a record of 35 presentations at conferences and published papers, and each person engaged in their own study in this environment. In 1936, Kiyoji Kubo reported his homework on drug addiction at the 35th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. This report was on morphine addiction, which was common in the Korean Peninsula at the time, and was presented in \"Psychiatria et Neurologia Japonica\" with the title \"Morphine Addiction.\" In 1941, Michio Watanabe became the second professor following Kiyoji Kubo, and held this position until the end of the war in 1945. Academic publications of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology consist of 15 papers/original articles, 19 summaries of annual meetings and abstracts, and 1 report of homework from an annual meeting.

To identify new aminergic drugs in vivo, we used a mutation in the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (dVMAT) as a sensitized genetic background and performed a suppressor screen. We fed dVMAT mutant larvae \u223c 1000 known drugs and quantitated rescue (suppression) of an amine-dependent locomotor deficit in the larva. To determine which drugs might specifically potentiate neurotransmitter release, we performed an additional secondary screen for drugs that require presynaptic amine storage to rescue larval locomotion. Using additional larval locomotion and adult fertility assays, we validated that at least one compound previously used clinically as an antineoplastic agent potentiates the presynaptic function of aminergic circuits. We suggest that structurally similar agents might be used to development treatments for PD, depression and ADHD, and that modifier screens in Drosophila provide a new strategy to screen for neuropsychiatric drugs. More generally, our findings demonstrate the power of physiologically based screens for identifying bioactive agents for select neurotransmitter systems."}, {"Title": "Telemedicine and Pediatric Obesity Treatment: Review of the literature and lessons learned.", "Abstract": "Pediatric obesity is more prevalent in rural areas, yet rural families may not have access to pediatric obesity treatment programs. Use of new technologies, particularly telemedicine, has proven effective in other behavioral fields, such as psychiatry. This paper reviews the literature on the use of telemedicine in pediatric obesity treatment, and describes one tertiary-care pediatric obesity telemedicine program. We performed a systematic review of the literature from 1990-2011 using the following criteria: pediatric age group, overweight or obesity care or treatment, and use of telemedicine technology. Of 2873 abstracts identified, four studies met all inclusion criteria; all were published after 2008. The limited evidence suggests that telemedicine to be a promising approach to pediatric weight management, particularly for rural families with limited access to treatments. We also provide important lessons learned from one pediatric obesity treatment clinic offering services to rural families via telemedicine. Few studies have examined the use of telemedicine for pediatric obesity treatment, but the available data favor this method for treating rural patients. There are several unique key factors influencing successful delivery of a pediatric obesity telemedicine treatment program. This review identifies a potential avenue for expanded treatment, and highlights the need for further investigation."}, {"Title": "What is psychiatry? Co-producing complexity in mental health.", "Abstract": "What is psychiatry? Such a question is increasingly important to engage with in light of the development of new diagnostic frameworks that have wide-ranging and international clinical and societal implications. I suggest in this reflective essay that 'psychiatry' is not a singular entity that enjoins consistent forms of critique along familiar axes; rather, it is a heterogeneous assemblage of interacting material and symbolic elements (some of which endure, and some of which are subject to innovation). In underscoring the diversity of psychiatry, I seek to move towards further sociological purchase on what remains a contested and influential set of discourses and practices. This approach foregrounds the relationships between scientific knowledge, biomedical institutions, social action and subjective experience; these articulations co-produce both psychiatry and each other. One corollary of this emphasis on multiplicity and incoherence within psychiatric theory, research and practice, is that critiques which elide this complexity are rendered problematic. Engagements with psychiatry are, I argue, best furthered by recognising its multifaceted nature."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic efficacy of add-on yogasana intervention in stabilized outpatient schizophrenia: Randomized controlled comparison with exercise and waitlist.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a highly disabling illness. Previous studies have shown yoga to be a feasible add-on therapy in schizophrenia.\nThe current study aimed to test the efficacy of yoga as an add-on treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia.\nThe study done at a tertiary psychiatry center used a single blind randomized controlled design with active control and waitlist groups.\nConsenting patients with schizophrenia were randomized into yoga, exercise, or waitlist group. They continued to receive pharmacological therapy that was unchanged during the study. Patients in the yoga or exercise group were offered supervised daily procedures for one month. All patients were assessed by a blind rater at the start of the intervention and at the end of 4 months.\nKendall tau, a nonparametric statistical test, showed that significantly more patients in the yoga group improved in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative and total PANSS scores as well as social functioning scores compared with the exercise and waitlist group. Odds ratio analysis showed that the likelihood of improvement in yoga group in terms of negative symptoms was about five times greater than either the exercise or waitlist groups.\nIn schizophrenia patients with several years of illness and on stabilized pharmacological therapy, one-month training followed by three months of home practices of yoga as an add-on treatment offered significant advantage over exercise or treatment as usual.

In psychiatry, neurocognitive assessment is useful in the identification of brain lesions, evaluation of cognitive deterioration over time, and advancement of theories regarding the neuroanatomical localization of symptoms. Neurocognitive models provide a bridging link between brain pathology and phenomenology. They provide a useful framework to understand the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders, bringing together isolated findings in behavioral, neuroimaging, and other neurobiological studies.

A range of models have been proposed that approximate the shape of the discount curve describing the relationship between subjective value and time. Recent evidence suggests that more than one free parameter may be required to accurately model human temporal discounting data. Nonetheless, many temporal discounting studies in psychiatry, psychology and neuroeconomics still apply single-parameter models, despite their oftentimes poor fit to single-subject data. Previous comparisons of temporal discounting models have either not taken model complexity into account, or have overlooked particular models. Here we apply model comparison techniques in a large sample of temporal discounting datasets using several discounting models employed in the past. Among the models examined, an exponential-power model from behavioural economics (CS model, Ebert & Prelec 2007) provided the best fit to human laboratory discounting data. Inter-parameter correlations for the winning model were moderate, whereas they were substantial for other dual-parameter models examined. Analyses of previous group and context effects on temporal discounting with the winning model provided additional theoretical insights. The CS model may be a useful tool in future psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience work on inter-temporal choice."}, {"Title": "Factors that might be predictive of completion of vaginismus treatment.", "Abstract": "Vaginismus is defined as a recurrent or persistent involuntary spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina that interferes with sexual intercourse. The aim of this study was to assess the level of symptoms of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and perfectionism among patients with vaginismus, as well as to determine if these clinical variables are related to the completion of treatment.\nThe study included 20 women with vaginismus and their spouses that were referred as outpatients to Ankara University, School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Consultation and Liaison Unit. All couples underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, which was administered as 40-60-min weekly sessions. At the first (assessment) session, the female patients were assessed using a sociodemographic evaluation form, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), and the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS). The male spouses were evaluated using the GRISS. The same scales were administered after the completion of treatment to those that completed the treatment.\nThe correlation between completion of treatment, and an elevated level of anxiety and self-oriented perfectionism was significant (P < 0.05). Among those that completed the study, depressive symptoms in the female patients improved (P< 0.05), and scale scores related to sexual functioning in both the males and females improved significantly (P < 0.05).\nVaginismus is not only a sexual dysfunction, but it is related to multiple components of mental health.

Dynamics during hyperventilation in healthy adults].", "Abstract": "In various fields of medicine the transcutaneous measurement (p(tc)CO\u2082) of carbon dioxide pressure (pCO\u2082) has been accepted as a reliable measuring method while for other disciplines the method has been doubted. Nevertheless, some minor therapeutic interventions, such as electroconvulsive therapy and breathing biofeedback used in psychiatry could benefit considerably from transcutaneous monitoring. The study presented here investigated the accuracy of transcutaneous measurement as compared to end-tidal (p(et)CO\u2082) and capillary (p(cap)CO\u2082) measurements in hyperventilation.\nIn this study 22 healthy volunteers underwent a hyperventilation procedure with assessment of p(tc)CO\u2082, p(et)CO\u2082, p(cap)CO\u2082, breathing and pulse rates. The three measurement methods of pCO\u2082 were compared pairwise by Bland-Altman diagrams before and at the end of hyperventilation. The time delay between p(et)CO\u2082 and p(tc)CO\u2082 was determined for each individual participant by a stepwise shifting the time course of p(et)CO\u2082 until an optimal congruence with p(tc)CO\u2082 was reached.\nThe study group consisted of 10 men and 12 women with a mean age of 30.5\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 years. The experimental procedure lasted an average of 27.7 min including 1.9 min for the baseline measurement and 11.6 min for the actual hyperventilation procedure. The course of pCO\u2082 from baseline to the end of the hyperventilation phase and back to normal baseline followed a U-curve in all individuals. The pCO\u2082 could be reduced by a mean of approximately 45 % for the 3 measurement methods from the individual baseline of 35 mmHg. The breathing and pulse frequencies increased by 26.8 % and 17.3 %, respectively. A total of 91 p(cap)CO\u2082 values (mean 4 values per person) and 1,218 pairs of p(et)CO\u2082 and p(tc)CO\u2082 values (mean 55 values per person) could be evaluated. The difference of the pCO\u2082 values for two measurement methods revealed similar standard deviations in the Bland-Altman diagrams of about 2.5 mmHg for the 3 pairwise comparisons. The absolute measurement differences between p(et)CO\u2082 and p(tc)CO\u2082, p(cap)CO\u2082 and p(tc)CO\u2082 as well as p(et)CO\u2082 and p(cap)CO\u2082 were averaged for each single participant and afterwards across all individuals resulting in values of 2.0, 2.5 and 2.3 mmHg, respectively. When the baseline and hyperventilation periods were examined separately in this analysis they did not show any relevant differences. The individually determined delays of p(tc)CO\u2082 in regard to p(et)CO\u2082 averaged 53 s. The time delay exceeded 1 min in only two study participants.\nIn the presented hyperventilation experiment the agreement between the p(tc)CO\u2082 values and the p(et)CO\u2082 and p(cap)CO\u2082 measurements were comparable to the agreement between the latter two. Altogether, the comparability of the measurement methods seemed satisfactory. The delay between the time courses of p(et)CO\u2082 and p(tc)CO\u2082 of <1 min for most participants was short and is acceptable for clinical practice. Because only healthy subjects were tested these results might not be the same in children and critically ill patients and could differ from the presented results."}, {"Title": "3D PET image reconstruction including both motion correction and registration directly into an MR or stereotaxic spatial atlas.", "Abstract": "This work explores the feasibility and impact of including both the motion correction and the image registration transformation parameters from positron emission tomography (PET) image space to magnetic resonance (MR), or stereotaxic, image space within the system matrix of PET image reconstruction. This approach is motivated by the fields of neuroscience and psychiatry, where PET is used to investigate differences in activation patterns between different groups of participants, requiring all images to be registered to a common spatial atlas. Currently, image registration is performed after image reconstruction which introduces interpolation effects into the final image. Furthermore, motion correction (also requiring registration) introduces a further level of interpolation, and the overall result of these operations can lead to resolution degradation and possibly artifacts. It is important to note that performing such operations on a post-reconstruction basis means, strictly speaking, that the final images are not ones which maximize the desired objective function (e.g. maximum likelihood (ML), or maximum a posteriori reconstruction (MAP)). To correctly seek parameter estimates in the desired spatial atlas which are in accordance with the chosen reconstruction objective function, it is necessary to include the transformation parameters for both motion correction and registration within the system modeling stage of image reconstruction. Such an approach not only respects the statistically chosen objective function (e.g. ML or MAP), but furthermore should serve to reduce the interpolation effects. To evaluate the proposed method, this work investigates registration (including motion correction) using 2D and 3D simulations based on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) PET scanner geometry, with and without resolution modeling, using the ML expectation maximization (MLEM) reconstruction algorithm. The quality of reconstruction was assessed using bias-variance and root mean squared error analyses, comparing the proposed method to conventional post-reconstruction registration methods. An overall reduction in bias (for a cold region: from 41% down to 31% (2D) and 97% down to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% down to 8% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) and in root mean squared error analyses (for a cold region: from 43% to 37% (2D) and from 97% to 65% (3D), and for a hot region: from 11% to 9% (2D) and from 16% down to 14% (3D)) in reconstructed regional mean activities (full regions of interest; all with statistical significance: p < 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-10)) is found when including the motion correction and registration in the system matrix of the MLEM reconstruction, with resolution modeling. However, this improvement in performance comes with an extra computational cost of about 40\u00a0min. In this context, this work constitutes an important step toward the goal of estimating parameters of interest directly from the raw Poisson-distributed PET data, and hence toward the complete elimination of post-processing steps."}, {"Title": "[Follow-up of a 16-year-old adolescent with early-onset schizophrenia and catatonic symptoms].", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to underline the need of a systematic monitoring (1) of atypical antipsychotics and (2) of catatonic symptoms in child psychiatry. We present in this paper the clinical history of a 16-year-old adolescent inpatient needing a prescription of atypical antipsychotic drug. We present the most relevant results of our clinical monitoring over 7 months.\nA 16-year-old Caucasian male adolescent, by the name of Paul, was admitted in August 2009 to an Adolescent University Psychiatry Unit for an acute psychotic disorder. On admission, he presented paranoid delusion, auditory hallucinations and impulsive movements. The score on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was 17 (the threshold score for the diagnosis of catatonic symptoms is 2). Laboratory tests showed the lack of blood toxic levels, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was 684 IU/L. Paul was treated with clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). This particular day was considered to be day #1 of the clinical drug monitoring. Immediately after, regular follow-up of catatonic symptoms was performed. On day #15, the CPK level returned to normal with improvement of clinical catatonia but with still a score of 4 on the BFCRS scale. Auditory hallucinations and delusion persisted. Risperidone treatment was begun (1mg/d and 1.5mg/d after 24 hours), associated with oral clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). On day #17, after 48 hours of improvement of delusion, the catatonic symptoms rapidly worsened. Risperidone was stopped; Paul was transferred to intensive care where he was treated with clonazepam IV (0.1mg/kg/d). The score on BFCRS scale was 20, Paul presented no fever and the CPK level was below 170 IU/L. The diagnosis was a relapse of the catatonic episode, which was caused by the administration of risperidone. On day #24, no improvement in the state of catatonia was obtained. The treatment was changed with the following combination of medicine: clonazepam (0.1mg/kg/d)-lorazepam (5mg/d)-carbamazepine (10mg/kg/d). With this combination, the state of catatonia improved quickly and on day #31, he was transferred to the adolescent psychiatry unit. However, delusion and hallucinations persisted; a treatment with olanzapine was started at 5mg/d and then progressively increased to 20mg/d for 10 days. On day #115, after 3 months with olanzapine, no improvement of the hallucinatory and delusional symptoms was observed; the diagnosis of early-onset refractory schizophrenia was established. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) confirmed the good compliance; clozapine was introduced and progressively increased up to 250 mg/d. On day #199, after 3 months under clozapine (250 mg/d), the speech was coherent and delusion was rare. During this period, no relapse of the catatonic state was observed.\nIn this case, the BFCRS scale was sensitive to catatonic symptom diagnosis. CPK levels vary differently for each atypical antipsychotic and are not a specific complication indicator. In complex cases, the TDM seems useful when choosing atypical antipsychotics.\nThe association of two benzodiazepines (clonazepam-lorazepam) with carbamazepin allowed the improvement of catatonic symptoms. Plasma levels of atypical antipsychotics helped the practitioner in deciding the type of care required: plasma levels confirmed the patient's treatment adherence and thus reinforced the choice of clozapine."}, {"Title": "Mechanical and pharmacological restraints in acute psychiatric wards--why and how are they used?", "Abstract": "Restraint use has been reported to be common in acute psychiatry, but empirical research is scarce concerning why and how restraints are used. This study analysed data from patients' first episodes of restraint in three acute psychiatric wards during a 2-year study period. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors for type and duration of restraint. The distribution of restraint categories for the 371 restrained patients was as follows: mechanical restraint, 47.2%; mechanical and pharmacological restraint together, 35.3%; and pharmacological restraint, 17.5%. The most commonly reported reason for restraint was assault (occurred or imminent). It increased the likelihood of resulting in concomitant pharmacological restraint. Female patients had shorter duration of mechanical restraint than men. Age above 49 and female gender increased the likelihood of pharmacological versus mechanical restraint, whereas being restrained due to assault weakened this association. Episodes with mechanical restraint and coinciding pharmacological restraint lasted longer than mechanical restraint used separately, and were less common among patients with a personality disorder. Diagnoses, age and reason for restraint independently increased the likelihood for being subjected to specific types of restraint. Female gender predicted type of restraint and duration of episodes."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric services in the community? The German public's opinion in 1990 and 2011.", "Abstract": "Background.

The study is based on data from two population surveys among German citizens aged 18 years and over, living in the 'old' German States. The first was conducted in 1990 (n\u00a0=\u00a03067), the second in 2011 (n\u00a0=\u00a02416). With the help of identical questions, respondents' attitudes towards psychiatric units at general hospitals and group homes for mentally ill people were assessed. Results. While the proportion of the public that explicitly welcomed establishing psychiatric units at general hospitals and opening group homes for mentally ill people decreased, the proportion of those who reacted with indifference increased.

In this column we describe an approach to training in community psychiatry that is intended to prepare future psychiatrists for the clinical and systems challenges they will undoubtedly face and that achieves this goal through trainees' caring for an especially vulnerable subpopulation--homeless individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. We describe how this model teaches residents to think simultaneously at both the individual and the systems levels and enables them to understand the critical need to use nontraditional treatment approaches in order to provide comprehensive care for this marginalized population.

This term refers to children with one or both parents emigrated from the country for work purposes. In connection with the social transformations of orphan-hood types described in the literature (nature, spiritual, social), the definition has been broadened by the definition ofeuro-orphan. The Ministry of Education describes the euro-orphan as the destruction of the family structure, the disorder of the socialisation process of children and reduction of the emotional exchanges among family members, as a result of migration of their parents. It provides further that not every child whose parents are not present in the country is covered as an euro-orphan. However, this group has become an increasingly larger populations. Lack of physical proximity and accessibility of important persons may have some psychological and pedagogical implications. These in turn can be shaped over time, into pathological symptoms, which are diagnostic entities in developmental psychiatry.

Since the emergence of the significant article by Geddes and Harrison in 1997, this doctrine has become part of psychiatry too. According to the rules of EBM, the most valuable clinical data comes from randomized-controlled trials (RCT). Nevertheless there are numerous researchers who point out at some limitations making RCT less valid in psychiatry than in other medical disciplines. The authors of this paper reviewed the available literature on the place of RCT in psychiatry and subsequently presented current opinions about the reliability of those trials, as well as highlighted the possible solutions of potential controversies. We suggest that in spite of the limitations mentioned above, RCT remains the most valuable research strategy in psychiatry. Most of the obstacles do not differ significantly from the problems seen in other medical fields. There are also known methods of improving methodology of RCT (such as recruiting larger groups of patients or performing expertise-based RCT)."}, {"Title": "[Genomic instability in the brain: etiology, pathogenesis and new biological markers of psychiatric disorders].", "Abstract": "The latest advances in molecular medicine, medical genetics and neurobiology have provided for a new look at processes occurring in cells of the brain and have allowed to discover previously unknown phenomena associated with mental traits and to propose new biomedical direction which include genomics, psychiatry and neurobiology - brain genomics.

Goethe was one of the most creative writers, productive scientists, and effective statesmen that ever lived. His descriptions of feelings, emotions, and mental states related to anxieties, depressive episodes, dysthymia, and creativity are unique in their phenomenological precision and richness. His life and work can thus serve as an excellent example enhancing our understanding of the relationship between anxiety, depression and creativity. Furthermore, he described (self-)therapeutic strategies that reinforce and refine modern views.\nGoethe's self-assessments in his works and letters, and the descriptions by others are analyzed under the perspective of current psychiatric classification. His therapeutic techniques and recommendations are compared with cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and existential psychotherapy to amplify modern concepts of psychotherapy.\nFrom a scientific perspective, several distinctive depressive episodes can be diagnosed in Goethe's life. They were characterized by extended depressive moods, lack of drive, and loss of interest and self-esteem combined with social retreat. Goethe displayed diffuse and phobic anxieties as well as dysthymia. His (self-)therapeutic strategies were: (a) the systematic use of helping alliances, (b) behavioral techniques, (c) cognitive reflection on meanings and beliefs, (d) psychodynamic and psychoanalytic remembering, repeating, and working through, and (e) existential striving for self-actualization, social commitment, meaning, and creativity.\nIn Goethe's life, creative incubation, illumination, and elaboration appear to have been associated with psychic instability and dysthymia, sometimes with depressive episodes in a clinical sense. On the one hand, his creative work was triggered by anxieties, dysthymia, and depressive moods. On the other hand, his creativity helped him to cope with psychic disorders and suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, Goethe described psychotherapeutic strategies that resemble modern techniques. He integrated relational, behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic, and existential techniques and attitudes. These modern psychotherapeutic approaches can be exemplified and enhanced by reflecting upon the (self-)therapeutic efforts of one of the most creative persons that have ever lived. Hermeneutics as the art of communication and understanding derived from Goethe's (self-)therapy and creative works can serve as a meta-theoretical framework for the integration of different psychotherapeutic approaches."}, {"Title": "[Liaison psychiatry nurse: the development of supervision in somatic medicine].", "Abstract": "Over the years, somatic care has become increasingly specialized. Furthermore, a rising number of patients requiring somatic care also present with a psychiatric comorbidity. As a consequence, the time and resources needed to care for these patients can interfere with the course of somatic treatment and influence the patient-caregiver relationship. In the light of these observations, the Liaison Psychiatry Unit at the University Hospital in Lausanne (CHUV) has educated its nursing staff in order to strengthen its action within the general care hospital. What has been developed is a reflexive approach through supervision of somatic staff, in order to improve the efficiency of liaison psychiatry interventions with the caregivers in charge of patients. The kind of supervision we have developed is the result of a real partnership with somatic staff. Besides, in order to better understand the complexity of interactions between the two systems involved, the patient's and the caregivers', we use several theoretical references in an integrative manner. PSYCHOANALYTICAL REFERENCE: The psychoanalytical model allows us to better understand the dynamics between the supervisor and the supervised group in order to contain and give meaning to the affects arising in the supervision space. \"Containing function\" and \"transitional phenomena\" refer to the experience in which emotions can find a space where they can be taken in and processed in a secure and supportive manner. These concepts, along with that of the \"psychic envelope\", were initially developed to explain the psychological development of the baby in its early interactions with its mother or its surrogate. In the field of supervision, they allow us to be aware of these complex phenomena and the diverse qualities to which a supervisor needs to resort, such as attention, support and incentive, in order to offer a secure environment. SYSTEMIC REFERENCE: A new perspective of the patient's complexity is revealed by the group's dynamics. The supervisor's attention is mainly focused on the work of affects. However, these are often buried under a defensive shell, serving as a temporary protection, which prevents the caregiver from recognizing his or her own emotions, thereby enhancing the difficulties in the relationship with the patient. Whenever the work of putting emotions into words fail, we use \"sculpting\", a technique derived from the systemic model. Through the use of this type of analogical language, affects can emerge without constraint or feelings of danger. Through \"playing\" in that \"transitional space\", new exchanges appear between group members and allow new behaviors to be conceived. In practice, we ask the supervisee who is presenting a complex situation, to design a spatial representation of his or her understanding of the situation, through the display of characters significant to the situation: the patient, somatic staff members, relatives of the patient, etc. In silence, the supervisee shapes the characters into postures and arranges them in the room. Each sculpted character is identified, named, and positioned, with his or her gaze being set in a specific direction. Finally the sculptor shapes him or herself in his or her own role. When the sculpture is complete and after a few moments of fixation, we ask participants to express themselves about their experience. By means of this physical representation, participants to the sculpture discover perceptions and feelings that were unknown up to then. Hence from this analogical representation a reflection and hypotheses of understanding can arise and be developed within the group.\nThrough the use of the concepts of \"containing function\" and \"transitional space\" we position ourselves in the scope of the encounter and the dialog. Through the use of the systemic technique of \"sculpting\" we promote the process of understanding, rather than that of explaining, which would place us in the position of experts. The experience of these encounters has shown us that what we need to focus on is indeed what happens in this transitional space in terms of dynamics and process. The encounter and the sharing of competencies both allow a new understanding of the situation at hand, which has, of course, to be verified in the reality of the patient-caregiver relationship. It is often a source of adjustment for interpersonal skills to recover its containing function in order to enable caregiver to better respond to the patient's needs."}, {"Title": "Impact of the Florida Medicaid prior-authorization program on use of antipsychotics by children under age six.", "Abstract": "This study assessed the impact of a prior-authorization process on the use of antipsychotic medications by children under six years old in Florida's fee-for-service Medicaid program.\nChild psychiatrists reviewed requests for antipsychotic treatment (N=1,424) using forms and criteria created by a panel of Florida-based experts.

After ruling out all medical etiologies, psychiatry was consulted due to a history of panic attacks, and to evaluate for a psychosomatic etiology.\nDuring the initial consultation, it was elicited that the patient had been the victim of a date rape as a teen, which resulted in dramatic weight gain and obesity. Following a comprehensive medical workup, brief psychodynamic psychotherapy, and the initiation of pharmacotherapy, the patient had a resolution of her symptoms, and at a 2 month follow-up, remained asymptomatic.\nPrior to surgery, patients should be questioned about any history of abuse by utilizing a structured diagnostic questionnaire, such as the Weight and Lifestyle Inventory (WALI). To prevent minimization, individuals with a history of abuse should be screened more thoroughly, and psychiatric involvement should be an intrinsic component of the follow-up care as abused patients may also be more sensitive to complaints as they lose weight. Psychiatric involvement can be a useful adjunctive treatment while medical etiologies are being ruled out, rather than after they have been ruled out."}, {"Title": "[Tunisian mothers' beliefs about their child's first psychotic episode].", "Abstract": "Initiating psychiatric treatment depends on several factors including clinical, personal, familial and economic factors. In the case of a first psychotic episode in an adolescent, parents, especially mothers, have a critical role in initiating psychiatric treatment for their child.\nIn this study, we investigated mothers' beliefs about their child's first psychotic episode.\nParticipants were adolescents consulting the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Razi hospital in Tunisia. They were aged from 12 to 19 years at the onset of their medical follow-up. Their diagnoses were schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder according to DSM-IV. A questionnaire was submitted to patients' mothers after their approval. It was divided into two parts. The first part was used to collect information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the mothers and their children. The second part was composed of the following four questions in Tunisian dialect: (1) what did you think was the matter when you first noticed psychotic symptoms in your child? (2) what was the main reason for which you thought psychiatric treatment was necessary? (3) what obstacles did you perceive in initiating psychiatric treatment? (4) do you have any advice or suggestions for caregivers on how they could facilitate an early start of treatment?\nTwenty-two mothers were included. The mean age of the mothers at onset of the follow-up of their child was 42 years (SD: 4.81). Ten mothers had never been schooled, five had primary school level, four had secondary school level, three had bachelor's degree and two had a diploma of doctorate; 63.6% of the mothers were housewives. The mean age of patients was 13.77 years at the start of their medical follow-up (SD= \u00b1 2.14). Most of the patients were male (14 males for eight girls). Most patients were diagnosed as having schizophrenia (91%); 4.5% were diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and 4.5% with schizophreniform disorder. The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) was 11.5 months. Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with male gender (P=0.008). A significant relationship was also found between long DUP and stigmatization of mental hospital and psychiatry (respectively P=0.04 and P=0.05). Most of the mothers did not think that their child initially suffered from a psychotic disorder. In 63.3%, the cause of the child's symptomatology was attributed to spirit possession. The others reasons for seeking psychiatric treatment were: behavioral disorder in 77.3%, inefficacity of traditional practices in 54.5%, and patient refusal (40.9%). Stigmatization of the Razi hospital, the unique psychiatric hospital in the country, and of psychiatry in general were evoked by mothers as the main obstacles in initiating psychiatric treatment in more than half of the cases (70%). Others obstacles were: fear of side effects of psychiatric treatment (50%), patient refusal (40.9%), inaccessibility to psychiatric services (31.8%) and fear of an addiction to psychotropic agents (31.8%). Thirty-six percent of mothers underlined the need to consult in the occurrence of school difficulties or any change in the child's behavior; 27% proposed educational and anti-stigmatizing campaigns about the signs of early psychosis through radio, newspapers, cinema, and TV media advertisements. Making teachers and educators sensitive to psychosis was proposed by 13.6% of mothers; 9.1% thought that diagnostic skills should be improved in general practitioners.\nKnowledge of attitudes of mothers towards the illness of their child prior to psychiatric treatment and towards the start of treatment is essential for the development of interventions for reducing duration of untreated psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Antipsychotic prescription assessment in general practice: metabolic effects].", "Abstract": "Second-generation antipsychotics have improved living conditions of patients affected by severe mental illness. Some of them can induce weight gain with metabolic complications. Furthermore, they are prescribed to vulnerable patients, with comorbidity and high cardiovascular mortality rate. Prevention of a metabolic syndrome by simple measures improves patient's physical health. General practitioners are privileged partners for psychiatrists.\nThis study was conducted to assess the prevention and management of a metabolic syndrome in patients treated with antipsychotics in general practice. With this in mind, at first we needed to explore how general practitioners prescribe antipsychotics.\nTo assess the general practice, we interviewed 204 general practitioners in the Hauts-de-Seine. Our database was the yellow pages of this area (September 2007). We then conducted a random draw using random digits. We called 507 general practitioners, 410 of whom were sent a questionnaire. We received the return of 204 questionnaires. Each questionnaire consisted of four parts: the general practitioner's profile, psychiatry in his/her practice, the prescription of antipsychotics and the management of metabolic syndromes in patients treated with antipsychotics.\nThe general practitioner's response rate was 49.7%. The results show that although they prescribe antipsychotics, general practitioners need more information on these molecules and on their side effects. Indeed 57% of them feel they are not given enough information on antipsychotics, but 69% have already initiated antipsychotic treatment and 17% do so regularly. Furthermore, a metabolic syndrome is insufficiently detected by general practitioners, although they know of its prevalence after the introduction of antipsychotic treatment. Thus, 81% reported having been confronted with this problem, but only 54% of them calculated the body mass index of patients taking antipsychotics, and 26% measured waist circumference. These results are consistent with studies tracking metabolic syndrome performed in all patients, so, general practitioners do not conduct specific monitoring of patients on antipsychotics. However, they are faced with difficulties related to adherence to treatment because of weight gain. In such cases, 16% of respondents start a new treatment, without a psychiatrist's opinion. These results confirm the results of previous studies on the risks of such prescriptions in general practice, when not supervised.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that information of general practitioners about their role in prevention of metabolic syndromes should be improved, and psychiatrists and general practitioners should be informed on the necessity of joint care of patients affected by severe mental illness."}, {"Title": "['Optimal care for depression': Freiburg model of integrated care for depressive disorders].", "Abstract": "Health care for persons with depressive disorders is not networked to an optimal degree in Germany.

However, benzodiazepines present some limitations: they are ineffective for some subtypes of anxiety disorders. Moreover, they entail side effects such as dependency, somnolence, and memory disturbances. Since 1980s, several clinical trials have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have no dependency, are effective for most subtypes of anxiety disorders. Consequently, SSRIs are now anti-anxiety drugs as well as antidepressants. In a recent guideline for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force, SSRIs are first-line drugs for the treatment of most subtypes of anxiety disorders. However, SSRIs do not improve symptoms in all patients with anxiety disorders. Therefore, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants are used even now for the treatment of anxiety disorder. Furthermore, off-label pharmacotherapies, supportive and other psychotherapies, and psychoeducation are applied to the treatment of anxiety disorders. Pharmacotherapy is part of integrative therapy of anxiety disorders. The treatment and pathogenesis of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders have not been elucidated sufficiently. Future studies must be conducted to elucidate the pathogenesis and to develop a new treatment for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. In contrast to those for other emotions, the neurocircuits related to anxiety and fear have been clarified in detail. The author and others have investigated the mechanisms and target brain regions of the anti-anxiety action of SSRIs using an animal model of anxiety: conditioned fear stress. Results show that SSRIs inhibit glutamatergic neurons of the amygdala through increased extracellular serotonin levels. This inhibition engenders anti-anxiety action. Benzodiazepines also inhibit the amygdala, thereby reducing fear or anxiety. The inhibitory action on the amygdala might be a common mechanism of anti-anxiety action of SSRIs and benzodiazepines."}, {"Title": "[The present and future of anxiety disorders: a view and problems to DSM-5: panic disorder].", "Abstract": "Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare shows that the estimated number of all patients with any anxiety disorders is more than ten million, while the number of all depressive patients is about six million.

Around 1900, the German-speaking countries in Europe played an important role in this development. In this article, the publication of three influential multivolume and multiauthor handbooks are studied. All available volumes of Max Lewandowsky's Handbuch der Neurologie (1910-1914) and the Handbuch der Neurologie (1935-1937) of Oswald Bumke and Otfrid Foerster are analyzed. The handbooks are compared with Pierre Vinken and George Bruyn's Handbook of Clinical Neurology (1968-2002). This article is particularly timely in that it helps to reveal some of the origins of the disciplinary split-even at a moment when \"brain psychiatry\" (Wilhelm Griesinger), \"neuropsychiatry\" (Kurt Goldstein), and the German notion of Nervenheilkunde all acknowledged the interdisciplinary nature of both psychiatry and neurology. Particular emphasis is placed on the preeminent role that Jewish clinical neurologists assumed in the editing of the respective handbooks, leading to the extraordinary breadth and wealth of these publications. A great number of doyens in the fields of neurology and psychiatry-among them numerous Nobel Prize laureates-were involved in the dissemination of contemporary knowledge, including diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, which testifies to the fundamental status that these handbooks held for training purposes for both undergraduate and postgraduate students.

As the field anticipates DSM-5, it is useful to take stock of this history and consider not only how diagnosis impacts our understanding of mental illness but also how contemporary thought influences diagnosis. Before the DSM, the field was disjointed. The publication of the first American diagnostic manual, the precursor of the DSM, mirrored society's interest in organized record keeping and prevention rather than treatment of mental illness. The first and second editions of DSM brought a common language to diagnosis and were largely the work of outpatient and academic psychiatrists rather than those based in large state hospitals. The third edition of the DSM saw the shift in American psychiatry's leadership from the eminent clinician to the researcher, whereas the fourth edition reflected the rise of \"evidence-based medicine.\" DSM-5 will likewise represent the current status of the field-not only with regard to science but also reflecting the place of American psychiatry in medicine today."}, {"Title": "[Social representations of the psychiatric diseases in Tunisia].", "Abstract": "Nowadays, and thanks to the major transformations experienced by psychiatry, since a half century, we estimate that the perception of the persons with psychiatric disorders would have changed and that they would have acquired the statute of patient with whole share.\nTo study social representation of psychiatric diseases in Tunisia.\nProspective study, based on the socio-anthropological fold of the study \"Mental health in general population: images and realities\", the social representations associated with \"madness\", \"mental illness\" and \"depression\" in a representative sample of 920 subjects.\nGradual images for these 3 archetypes were found. In fact, the depression is perceived as a soft disorder, which is reactional to the difficulties of life. The behaviour related to depression not only is seen as the least dangerous, but also the closest to the normality. Therefore, the \"depressive\" remains relatively accepted and integrated within the society. On the contrary the image of the \"insane\" is printed by a pejorative connotation and is marked by dangerousness, unpredictability, and immorality. Besides, the origins of the madness seem enigmatic. The \"insane\" is, therefore, stigmatized and thrown back. His exclusion extends as well to the family, social and professional domains.\nThe image of the mental illness seems some what blurred, taking place in the interface of madness, depression and neurological diseases."}, {"Title": "[Neuroimaging investigation in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Recently, neuroscience approach has revealed new findings in the mental disorder of schizophrenia, now clearly established as a brain disease, and affecting 1% of the world population.

In this article, the author has overviewed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with schizophrenia. Recent MRI studies show it is characterized in MRI by loss of brain gray matter (neuropil, not cells), some of which occurs before full symptom onset and some of which progresses in the 1-2 years after onset. This is most prominent in some neocortical regions and is associated with worsening of symptoms.

However, its incidence is on the rise. This is due to an increasing population with predisposing factors. Also, the availability of more effective diagnostic tools has brought it increasingly to the surgeon's attention. In this study the patients were treated in the Neurosurgery Division of the Department of Neurological Sciences and Psychiatry of the Sapienza University of Rome, between 2001 and 2009. They had thoracolumbar pyogenic spondylitis. This study was undertaken in order to identify the correct diagnostic and therapeutic treatment needed in such cases. From the cases studied here, it is evident that spinal infections can be extremely insidious and that diagnosis tends to be reached late. Surgery, along with the antibiotic treatment, allows for eradication of the causes of the pathology by the reclamation of the affected region. Surgery is also fundamental in helping to recover vital functions and in restoring as much as possible the correct curvature of the rachises. The use of an anterolateral approach is dictated by the necessity of obtaining 360\u00b0 stability as well as by the need to clear away extensive infections, which are not always reachable using a posterior approach."}, {"Title": "Offender patients' opinions on placement in a forensic hospital.", "Abstract": "People who become patients in secure hospitals may not understand their situation and have different opinions about the nature of institutionalisation from each other and from staff and the authorities. More knowledge of patient perspectives could improve treatment outcomes.\nOur aim was to evaluate patients' beliefs about whether placement in an institution should be mainly punitive, therapeutic or a mixture of both and whether offence type should have any influence on the nature of the institutionalisation.\nInpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, from the Department of Forensic Psychiatry in Popova\u010da, Croatia, were asked to report their personal opinions about appropriateness of placements according to three case vignettes related to psychotically motivated offences of (1) homicide; (2) property damage; and (3) arson.\nA total of 52 patients were eligible for participation and consenting. Their average age was 44 (\u00b1 9.56) years and the mean duration of treatment in the specialist hospital was 7.7 (\u00b1 5.59) years; just over a third of them (20 patients) had committed or attempted homicide. They were more likely than not to favour at least 5 years of detention in a secure hospital for a person with psychosis who had killed another, regardless of mental state, but that for minor property damage, improvement in mental state should be the key determinant of discharge. They were more equivocal about arsonists.\nPerceptions of male offenders with psychosis on determinants of length of stay in a secure hospital appear to have much in common with what one would expect in the wider community. The fact that in spite of generally having poor insight into their own situation, these men could make judgments about fictitious but similar patients that appeared so unremarkable raised the possibility of building on this vignette study towards an educationally therapeutic module in preparation for rehabilitation."}, {"Title": "Screening for depression with Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Revised and its implication for consultation-liaison psychiatry practice among cancer subjects: a perspective from a developing country.", "Abstract": "Co-morbidity of depressive symptomatology is a common indication for use of mental health services in oncology.

The topics discussed during the interviews were mental incompetence, advance directives, representation, resistance, and complaint and conflict resolution. For further exploration of the results, we presented these to focus groups in three sectors. We received written comments from several experts of the intensive care sector.\nMost healthcare providers' initial assumption was that the assessment of mental competence should be more thorough when the treatment is more drastic. The healthcare providers were unenlightened on matters concerning the tasks and authority of patient guardians. This sometimes created tension when their opinions deviated from those of the guardians. It was notable that guardians of mentally incompetent patients in intensive care perceived themselves to be most informed. There is indeed frequent consultation with relatives or guardians in the intensive care unit; however, they are hardly ever asked to participate in decision making.\nThere is much ambiguousness on issues relating to mental incompetence and representation among healthcare providers. According to the legislation, reconstructing the will of the patient or client is paramount. Guardians should be involved in establishing mental incompetence and in decisions about treatment, care and research. Advance directives also play an important role. This study has resulted in recommendations on legislation, self-regulation and daily practice."}, {"Title": "What is the role of pharmacogenetics in clinical psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide and despite significant pharmacologic advances, often remain difficult to diagnose correctly and treat fully. Factors which contribute to these difficulties include imprecise understanding of etiology, syndromal nature of many disorders and overlap in diagnostic criteria between conditions, medical and psychiatric comorbidity and high rates of noncompliance to treatment either due to lack of efficacy or adverse effects. In addition to genetics and known biological factors, the severity and presentation of many psychiatric conditions may be influenced by psychosocial factors, which in turn can affect treatment outcomes. Currently, the selection of medications for a given patient in psychiatry is primarily based on a trial and error process; thus, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can improve diagnostic homogeneity and provide useful prognostic information. Pharmacogenetics has the potential, in combination with other approaches, to enhance both care at an individual level as well as in drug development by improving efficacy and minimizing drug-induced side effects."}, {"Title": "Sexual sadism: current diagnostic vagueness and the benefit of behavioral definitions.", "Abstract": "The phenomenon of sexual sadism was first scientifically described by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in 1999 as a sexual preference disorder that focuses on the infliction of suffering, pain, or humiliation to achieve sexual gratification. The present article reviews the historical development of the term sexual sadism, including the current descriptive nosology of psychiatric classification. Despite clear definitions that specify the sexual objects, duration, and distress necessary for a disorder, evidence for the diagnostic reliability for sexual sadism in the forensic domain is mixed. We argue that the reliance on the patient's willingness to divulge corresponding violent sexual fantasies is the Achilles' heel of the diagnosis. In an attempt to improve agreement across diagnosticians, we argue for the use of behavioral indicators. We summarize the extant research on the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SESAS), which is a file-based observer rating of pertinent crime-scene actions. We conclude that the analysis of crime-scene behavior, as achieved with the SESAS, can provide a useful complement for the clinical diagnosis in forensic psychiatry and psychology."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric-related emergency department visits among children with an autism spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to examine the prevalence and characteristics of psychiatry-related emergency department (ED) visits among children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including the specific reason for visit, as well as the influence of insurance type.\nData used for this cross-sectional, observational study were obtained from the 2008 National Emergency Department Sample, the largest all-payer ED database in the United States.

Yet, how many old age psychiatrists commonly check with older women about whether the depression they are treating, or the SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) they have prescribed, have adversely affected their patient's sexual lives? We consider the latest evidence regarding cultural, social and medical influences on older women's sexual lives and some specific issues which affect lesbian and transsexual people. We examine how mental illness and psychotropic medication in particular can adversely affect older women's sexual functioning and at how difficult it often proves to be for women to seek help. We also focus on why doctors and in particular psychiatrists may not take a sexual history, look for sexual side effects or refer for appropriate treatment, especially when interviewing older women patients. Most published information about psychiatric training and sexual issues focuses on the younger male patient. We therefore aimed to provide a broad-ranging review of the literature regarding female sexual functioning in old age, the difficulties that can arise and the role that old age psychiatrists have an opportunity to fulfil, in this often neglected aspect of their patients' treatment. From our review it was clear that, in the light of the increasing cultural acceptability of discussions regarding sexuality and older women, the training of student doctors and trainee psychiatrists needs to reflect this change so that old age psychiatrists can enhance the quality of their patient care."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry for the general practitioner: Isaac Ray's Jefferson Lectures, 1871 to 1873.", "Abstract": "In late 19th century, psychiatry developed a seriousness of purpose beyond the mere isolation of people who were insane.

In this article, we aimed to provide an overview of areas where nanotechnology is applied and how they could be extended to care for psychiatric illnesses. The main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology: drugs have to pass the blood-brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanoshells and dendrimers (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have succeeded to modelize inorganic synapses and mimick synaptic behavior, a step essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small worlds and free-scale networks architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses. We are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice. Even if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still inconsistent and this must be kept in mind. However, it seems essential that psychiatrists do not forsake this area of research the perspectives of which could be decisive in the field of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Mortality and guideline-concordant care for older patients with schizophrenia: a retrospective longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with excess mortality and multimorbidity, which is possibly associated with difficulty in coordinating care for multiple mental and physical comorbidities. We analyzed the receipt by patients with schizophrenia of 11 types of guideline-concordant care and the association of such care with survival.\nGuideline-concordant care over an 8-year period (financial years 2002 to 2009) was examined in a nationwide sample of 49,173 male veterans with schizophrenia, who were aged 50 years or older. Administrative databases from the electronic medical record system of the Veterans Health Administration (VA) provided comprehensive measures of patient demographics and medical information. Relying on the 2004 American Psychiatric Association guidelines, patterns in 11 types of care were identified and cluster-analyzed. Care types included cardiovascular, metabolic, weight management, nicotine dependence, infectious diseases, vision, and mental health counseling (individual, family, drugs/alcohol, psychiatric medication, and compensated work therapy). Survival analysis estimated association of care patterns with survival, adjusting for clinical and demographic covariates.\nThere was an average of four chronic diseases in addition to schizophrenia in the cohort, notably hypertension (43%) and dyslipidemia (29%). Three longitudinal trajectories (clusters) were identified: 'high-consistent' (averaging 5.4 types of care annually), 'moderate-consistent' (averaging 3.8), and 'poor-decreasing' (averaging 1.9). Most veterans were receiving cardiovascular care (67 to 76%), hepatic and renal function assays (79 to 84%), individual counseling (72 to 85%) and psychiatry consults (66 to 82%), with the proportion receiving care varying by cluster group. After adjustment for age, baseline comorbidity, and other covariates, there was a greater survival rate for those with poor-decreasing care compared with high-consistent care, and for high-consistent compared with moderate-consistent care.\nRelatively low levels of guideline-concordant care were seen for older VA patients with schizophrenia, and trajectories of care over time were associated with survival in a non-intuitive pattern. The group with the lowest and decreasing levels of care was also the oldest, but nonetheless had the best age-adjusted and other covariate-adjusted survival rates, possibly because they were requiring less care relative to younger, sicker veterans, and thus their comorbidity burden was markedly lower. Notably, in the group with the sickest individuals (that is those with the highest comorbidity scores, who were very disabled), receiving guideline-concordant care was associated with improved survival in adjusted models compared with those patients receiving only moderate levels of care."}, {"Title": "Primary care support for youth mental health: a preliminary evidence base for Ireland's Mid-West.", "Abstract": "Mental and substance use disorders are leading causes of morbidity.

Leaders in the field continue to emphasize that diagnoses must be validated by the pathogenesis, course, and response to treatment of specific disorders. However, many current genetic and family studies have failed to support the concept of diagnostic specificity, as has the current use of psychotropic agents, which are now being prescribed with little regard for diagnosis.

The study group was created by recruiting 132 psychiatrists participating in the International Scientific-Training Conference in Wis\u0142a, Poland in 2011. The obtained results were analyzed statistically.\nThe majority of the respondents decided to become psychiatrists during their university studies (43.61%) and just after their studies (37.59%). Only 9.02% knew before starting university, which field of medicine to select, and 8.27% were originally practitioners in a different medical specialization. The factors having the greatest influence on making the decision were: self-esteem (58.64%), practical classes in college and the experience of special types of work with a patient (the percentage for both factors was 33.83%). Prestige (3%) and media influence (3.76%) seem to be the least important factors. 81% of respondents admitted that it was their own independent decision. In the group of those who were influenced by others, the strongest source of advice was the opinion of a partner (4.51%), while the opinion of the family and a well-known specialist in the field turned out to be much less important (the percentage for both factors was 1.5%). 94.73% participants said that they would choose the same specialization once again.\nPublic perception of psychiatry is still not satisfactory and may have little impact on the popularity of this specialization.

Waltz with Bashir is a 2008 Israeli animated documentary film written and directed by Ari Folman. It portrays the protagonist (Folman) in search of his lost memories of his experience as a soldier in the 1982 Lebanon War and his attempt to both decipher them and reconcile himself with them. 2012 marks the 30th year commemoration of the Sabra and Shatilla tragedies. Waltz with Bashir vividly depicts the massacres of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Beirut through the lens of an ex-IDF serviceman and the harrowing effects that PTSD has on him. Waltz with Bashir was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film however despite the popularity of the film and much critical acclaim it is officially banned in Lebanon.

After the transfer of power from the British to the Kingdom of Mysore in 1881, it became, for a while, the only asylum to be supported by a native kingdom. A larger mental hospital, in the light of the expanding population of Mysore, was thought essential by the 1920's, when the Maharaja of Mysore approved the decision to build a new asylum. This was finally completed in 1937, and by then had been renamed as the Mysore State Mental Hospital. The hospital, and its staff, was recommended as the first institution to begin training specialists in psychiatry and related mental health fields, after Independence, in 1953, when it was renamed the All-India Institute of Mental Health. It now houses the Department of Psychiatry at NIMHANS.

Recommendations for psychiatrists on psychiatry, religion and spirituality.", "Abstract": "Although there is still a lot of controversy surrounding the debates on religion and psychiatry, working toward consensus based on clinical experience and research seems to be far more fruitful. DISCOURSE: The main idea in this contribution runs as follows. It is no longer appropriate to treat psychiatry and religion as enemies. It is argued here that they are in fact allies. This position is elucidated in the light of two statements. (1) The World Psychiatric Association, indeed representing world psychiatry, needs to change its position toward religion and psychiatry. It should do so by crossing narrow-minded scientific boundaries like reductionist and materialistic boundaries. (2) Science and religion should not be regarded as opposing adversaries against each other, but as allies against nonsense and superstition.\nTwo recommendations are formulated. First, science-and-religion, and in our case psychiatry-and-religion, is not purely about description based on gathering evidence, systematic empirical testing and mathematical modeling. We need an approach of both descriptive and prescriptive aspects of our daily reality, not only how our world is, but also how it should be. Secondly, science-and-religion, in our case psychiatry-and-religion as allies should formulate sensible criteria and develop an appropriate attitude to discernment based on intellectual, moral and spiritual sincerity."}, {"Title": "Relational mindfulness, spirituality, and the therapeutic bond.", "Abstract": "Mindfulness training, which emphasizes deliberate non-judgmental attention to present moment experiences, has become increasingly mainstream over the past several decades. With accumulating evidence for the physical and mental health benefits of mindfulness, it has been integrated into medical and psychological treatments and is increasingly accepted in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. However, several elements of mindfulness practice which potentially contribute to its benefits have been largely neglected. These include the connections between mindfulness, interpersonal relationships, spirituality, and the psychotherapeutic alliance. The emerging concept of \"relational mindfulness\" focuses attention on the oft-neglected interpersonal aspects of mindfulness practices. Relational mindfulness is potentially relevant to the psychotherapeutic process, due to its cultivation of the types of qualities that enhance the therapeutic relationship, including warmth, empathy, curiosity, acceptance, self-attunement, and emotional intelligence. In addition, mindfulness practices, especially relational ones, can contribute to the development of spiritual qualities, such as transcendence, boundlessness, ultimacy, and interconnectedness. Several recent studies suggest that meditation/mindfulness interventions may be explained and or enhanced by an emphasis on spiritual components. In this paper, we suggest that focusing on the oft-neglected relational and spiritual aspects of mindfulness practice has the potential to deepen its benefits, especially within the context of the psychotherapeutic relationship."}, {"Title": "Sikhism, spirituality and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Sikhism has millions of followers in India and among the Indian diaspora. As a religion it is relatively young but carries with it unique perspectives which are often not well known. The holy book of Sikhism, Guru Granth Sahib, is not only the last Guru, but also remained a key text for this religion. Using descriptions of the religion and its followers we attempt to understand the context of spirituality within this religion and attempt to apply it to clinical settings. We explored various texts to understand the notions of spirituality and ethics and directions for living one's life. We studied both the Gurumukhi version as well as the English translation of the Sikh holy text. In the context of history of the Sikhs, various descriptions related to mental well being were identified. In this paper we describe the history, development and the core values of the religion and we also review their role on psychiatric and mental health settings for managing Sikh patients. Guru Granth Sahib offers a very useful insight into what is understood by the term equivalent to depression and its phenomenology. The notions of dukh (loosely translated as pain, but can also mean sadness or suffering) and maya (illusion) and their role in daily living are also discussed. In this paper these descriptions are explored further and their importance explained."}, {"Title": "Pathway to psychiatric care in a tertiary mental health facility in Jaipur, India.", "Abstract": "This study was planned to evaluate the pathway to care of mentally ill patients attending a tertiary mental health facility in Jaipur to highlight the difficulties of mentally ill and their relatives in accessing appropriate care.\nSeventy-six patients, who attended the Out Patient Department of Psychiatry of a tertiary care hospital in Jaipur, India for the first time, were enrolled in this study. The family members of the patients were interviewed to evaluate the pathway to care using the Encounter form developed by the WHO.\nThe patients were predominantly young adults, male, from rural, agrarian but educated background and a majority of them presented with psychotic illnesses. It was seen that there were five major gateways to care of the mentally ill in the region, Faith healers being the most popular portal of care. The median duration of untreated illness (DUI) was 6 months, and subjects had already visited, 2 carers before visiting any mental health professional. The median monetary cost of the pathway was Rs. 3565. Patients suffering from psychotic illnesses presented earlier. Those who used psychiatric services as first portal of care had different socio-demographic variables as compared to clients who used other services.\nThis pathway to psychiatric care study in Jaipur, India demonstrated that referral pathway heavily relies on faith healers.

Although many efforts have been made to eradicate both prejudice and stigma, they still prevail even among medical professionals, and little is known about how contact with schizophrenia patients affects their attitudes towards schizophrenia.\nWe assessed the impact of the renaming of the Japanese term for schizophrenia on clinical residents and also evaluated the influence of contact with schizophrenia patients on attitudes toward schizophrenia by comparing the attitudes toward schizophrenia before and after a one-month clinical training period in psychiatry. Fifty-one clinical residents participated. Their attitudes toward schizophrenia were assessed twice, before and one month after clinical training in psychiatry using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) as well as Link's devaluation-discrimination scale.\nThe old term for schizophrenia, \"Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo\", was more congruent with criminal than the new term for schizophrenia, \"Togo-Shitcho-Sho\", before clinical training. However, quite opposite to our expectation, after clinical training the new term had become even more congruent with criminal than the old term. There was no significant correlation between Link's scale and IAT effect.\nRenaming the Japanese term for schizophrenia still reduced the negative images of schizophrenia among clinical residents. However, contact with schizophrenia patients unexpectedly changed clinical residents' attitudes towards schizophrenia negatively. Our results might contribute to an understanding of the formation of negative attitudes about schizophrenia and assist in developing appropriate clinical training in psychiatry that could reduce prejudice and stigma concerning schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression: The making of a \"gold standard\" and the unmaking of a chronic illness, 1960-1980.", "Abstract": "To show why and how the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression became the 'Gold Standard' for assessing therapies from the mid-1960s and how it was used to frame depression as a short-term and curable illness rather than a chronic one.\nMy approach is that of the social construction of knowledge, identifying the interests, institutional contexts and practices that produce knowledge claims and then mapping the social processes of their circulation, validation and acceptance.\nThe circulation and validation of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was relatively slow and it became a 'Gold Standard' 'from below', from an emerging consensus amongst psychiatrists undertaking clinical trials for depression, which from the 1960s were principally with psychopharmaceuticals for short-term illness. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, drug trials and the construction of depression as non-chronic were mutually constituted.\nHamilton Rating Scale for Depression framed depression and its sufferers in new ways, leading psychiatrists to understand illness as a treatable episode, rather than a life course condition. As such, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression served the interests of psychiatrists and psychiatry in its new era of drug therapy outside the mental hospital. However, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was a strange kind of 'standard', being quite non-standard in the widely varying ways it was used and the meanings given to its findings."}, {"Title": "Mindfulness and bodily distress.", "Abstract": "We have created a mindfulness approach to treat patients who experience multiple, persistent, and disabling physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a well-defined medical or surgical condition. Randomized controlled trials in this area are few, and research is hampered by the lack of clear definitions. Bodily distress syndrome (BDS) or bodily stress is an empirically defined definition unifying various conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and somatization disorder. In the present PhD, we explored whether patients suffering from BDS may be committed to mental training in the form of mindfulness therapy, which is a mindfulness program specifically targeted patients suffering from BDS. The theoretical model for including mindfulness training in the treatment of BDS is based on identified neurobiological impairments in these patients and the neurobiological improvements that mindfulness training may offer. BDS is a major public health issue possibly associated with the pathology of the immuno-endocrine and autonomic nervous system. BDS patients are often stigmatized, and effective treatment is rarely delivered, which leaves these patients isolated, left by themselves, vulnerable to potentially harming medical and/or alternative treatments. Accordingly, there is a need for non-harming practical tools that patients can learn to master so that they can improve the ability to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a group program that employs mindfulness practice to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic, and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is designed to prevent depressive relapse. Paper I and II present systematic literature reviews only of randomized controlled trials on MBSR and MBCT. The effect of MBSR has been explored on fibromyalgia in three studies, none of them showed convincing results, but gave some indications as to improvement. The reviews recommended MBSR as a useful method for improving mental health; however, lack of long-term follow-up and active control groups are limitations in most studies. MBCT was recommended as a tool for preventing depressive relapse in recovered, recurrently depressed patients, but the implication of MBSR and MBCT is problematic, especially due to the lack of well educated mindfulness teachers. We combined MBSR with cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, specifically targeted BDS. Paper III provides original data from 119 patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial, mindfulness therapy for BDS. The randomized controlled trial indicates that BDS patients are capable of and willing to engage in mindfulness therapy. This thesis showed that mindfulness therapy can safely and successfully engage BDS patients in mindfulness practice. Since individual CBT and psychiatric consultation have previously been found to have positive outcomes for BDS patients, we compared mindfulness therapy to an active control group entitled specialized treatment in which an individual treatment was planned in collaboration between the patient and an MD specialized in BDS, CBT, and psychiatry. Mindfulness therapy was comparable to specialized treatment in improving the quality of life and the symptoms of the patients with BDS at 15-month follow-up. For primary outcome physical health (PCS) at 15-month follow-up, different developments over time for the two treatment groups could not be established (F(3,2674) = 1.51, p = 0.21). However, in the mindfulness therapy group, PCS significant changed at the end of treatment and this change remained at 15-month follow-up, whereas no significantly change was seen in the specialized treatment group until at the 15-month follow-up. In the mindfulness therapy group, 26%; CI: 14-38 reported a marked improvement (> 1 SD) at the end of treatment compared with 10%; CI: 2-18 in the specialized treatment group. This amounts to a statistically significant difference between the groups (OR = 3.21; CI 1.05-9.78, p = 0.04). The results are indicating that mindfulness therapy produced greater and more rapid improvements than specialized treatment. Mindfulness therapy appears to produce improvements within the range of those reported in the STreSS-1 trial, where CBT was compared with enhanced usual care, and no improvements on the SF-36 scale were observed in the enhanced usual care group. This indicates that the changes accomplished with the two treatments mindfulness therapy and specialized treatment reflect real changes attributable to the interventions. The economic effects of mindfulness therapy are evaluated in paper IV by the use of original register data from the 119 enrolled patients and a matched control group of 5,950 individuals. Mindfulness therapy had substantial socioeconomic benefits over specialized treatment. The costs incurred to cover permanent health-related benefits, especially disability pension, were significantly lower in the mindfulness therapy group than in the specialized treatment group over a 15-month follow-up period; 25% from the mindfulness therapy group received disability pension compared with 45% from the specialized treatment group (p = 0.025). The total health care utilization was reduced over time in both groups from the year before inclusion (mean $ 5,325, median $ 2,971) to the year after inclusion (mean $ 3,644, median $ 1,593) (p = 0.0001). There was no difference between the two groups. Five and ten years before their inclusion, the BDS patients were less self-supporting than an age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched population control group; the BDS patients accumulated more weeks of sickness benefit and unemployment. Thus, the included BDS patients may have been ill and in high risk for a social decline five and ten years before they received a proper diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, the social and economic consequences of BDS are significant and mindfulness therapy may have a potential to significantly improve function, quality of life and symptoms, prevent a social decline, and reduce societal costs."}, {"Title": "Strengths and weaknesses of pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotic drugs: the potential value of the PEPs study.", "Abstract": "The successful application of pharmacogenetics in routine clinical practice is still a long way from becoming a reality.

This is a narrative review in which we analyze the main results of pharmacogenetic studies performed with the most relevant groups of psychoactive drugs and discusses missing for incorporating these advances into our daily practice. We conclude that despite the remarkable progress in the field of Pharmacogenetics in the last 10 years, studies in psychiatry have been inconclusive and the clinical use of pharmacogenetic testing is still limited. However, there are some encouraging elements about the applicability of these tools for the improvement of psychiatric treatments."}, {"Title": "Causes and management of aggression and violence in a forensic mental health service: perspectives of nurses and patients.", "Abstract": "Nurses' attitudes about the causes and management of aggression affects their choice of intervention. We aimed to compare the attitudes held by patients and staff in a forensic mental health service with the Management of Aggression and Violence Attitudes Scale, and examine the factor validity of the tool in this setting by conducting a prospective comparative questionnaire survey. Staff (n\u2009=\u200972) and patient (n\u2009=\u200998) attitudes differed to a limited extent. Confirmatory factor analysis refuted the previously reported structure of the tool. Exploratory factor analysis suggested three underlying factors related to modifiability of aggression, hands on management, and hands off management. Patients were more optimistic than nurses about the modifiability of aggressive behaviour. Male patients and those with diagnoses other than personality disorder were significantly more likely to agree about modifiability than controls. Forensic inpatients recognize the need for the use of a range of techniques to prevent and manage aggression and violence, but selected groups are most likely to believe that aggression is modifiable. Prevention and management of aggression training should emphasize the modifiability of aggressive behaviour. The development of measures of modifiability and management style would assist in the evaluation of training and would offer new avenues for research."}, {"Title": "Community alternatives to acute inpatient care for severe psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "Community psychiatry has mainly relied upon intermediate long term care services while there is a large gap between patient's needs and availability of acute care services. Taking this into consideration, the main aim of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the efficacy and feasibility of implementing the new models of care developed to fulfil the gap in the provision of community and hospital care for acute and severely ill patients. Finally the paper will propose a \"care balanced approach\" to integrate the key elements of the new alternatives of acute community and hospital care in the mental health system.\nA review of the current literature was used to identify the key components of acute care for psychiatric illness. For this purpose Medline (1966-2010), EMBASE (1980-2010), and PsycINFO (1985-2010) databases were reviewed using key terms relating to assertive outreach, home treatment/crisis resolution, psychiatric acute day care, deinstitutionalization, Mental Health Service Models.\nThree main types of acute care have been identified: Acute Continuous Day Care (ACDC) -day hospitals -, Assertive Outreach Care (AOC) -Assertive Community and Assertive Outreach teams-, and Home Acute Care (HAC) -Crisis resolution, Home treatment teams-. The feasibility of these alternatives is supported by available evidence. Although these acute care alternatives may be complementary and could be combined for achieving a greater positive impact on the clinical and social recovery of the patients, there are usually implemented independently.\nAn integrative acute care subsystem combining these three strategies in a balanced care system should be formally incorporated to the advanced community model in mental health care."}, {"Title": "[The observation as a strategy to generate research questions: experience in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The observation as a strategy to generate research questions: an experience in a psychiatric ward.\nThe daily activity could, and should, be the natural setting where research hypotheses are generated, specifically in areas of care where the frequency of problems Evidence Based Practice \"orphans\" is high, such as psychiatry.\nTo test the possibility and the yeld of identifying-formulating research needs and hypotheses from - within nursing duties.\nProspective registration of clinical conditions decisions to be taken from a position of substantial uncertainty over a pilot period of 7 working days.\nUp to 39 diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitation, organizational, behavioral problems have been and included in the diary and associated with one or more hypothesis considered to be a potential need/opportunity for observational and/or experimental research.\nPsychiatry is very rarely among the priorities of nursing attention and research, thus exposing nursing care to a systematic risk of empirical-uncontrolled practices."}, {"Title": "Why are antiepileptic drugs used for nonepileptic conditions?", "Abstract": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to treat various nonepileptic central nervous system (CNS) disorders, both in neurology and psychiatry. Most AEDs have multiple mechanisms of action (MOAs), which include modulation of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission, and alteration of voltage-gated ion channels or intracellular signaling pathways. These MOAs may explain the efficacy of AEDs in the treatment of bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain. Bipolar disorder and epilepsy have some common features, such as their episodic nature and associated kindling phenomena, which led to the regulatory approval and use of the AEDs carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid (VPA), and lamotrigine (LTG) in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A major limitation for the development of drugs with improved mood-stabilizing activity is the lack of knowledge on the mechanism of treatment for bipolar disorder. In contrast to epilepsy, no animal models in bipolar disorder are universally accepted and no model is able to exhibit the characteristic mood swings. Although most AEDs have now been investigated for their mood-stabilizing effects, only three (e.g., VPA, CBZ, and LTG) demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients. This suggests that the mechanism of drug action in mood disorder and in epilepsy only partially overlaps. Peripheral nerve damage leads to the initiation of cellular and molecular changes in the nervous system resulting in ectopic, repetitive firing perceived as chronic pain. Epileptic seizures are also characterized by hyperexcitability of neurons in the brain. The spontaneous electrogenesis in neuropathic pain has similarities to that of epilepsy. Alteration in sodium channels expression suggests that the mechanism underlying epileptic hyperexcitability may be similar to those underlying neuropathic pain. The AEDs gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) have become the mainstay of treatment for various neuropathic pain syndromes, owing to their ability to inhibit neuronal hyperactivity along the pain pathways. One explanation for how GBP and PGB relieve neuropathic pain is that they bind selectively to the Ca(+2) -channel subunit \u03b12-\u03b4 in muscle tissue and brain. With 16 new AEDs having entered the market since 1990 the antiepileptic market is crowded. Consequently, epilepsy alone is not attractive in 2012 to the pharmaceutical industry, even though the clinical needs of refractory epilepsy remain unmet. Due to this situation, the future design of new AEDs must also include a potential in nonepileptic CNS disorders, such as bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain. The global market size of each of these two indications is similar to that of epilepsy, whereas they both currently have fewer approved drugs for treatment than epilepsy. Therefore, a new AED with additional approved indications in bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain might have a potential market size three times larger than that of epilepsy alone."}, {"Title": "The startle syndromes: physiology and treatment.", "Abstract": "Startle syndromes are paroxysmal and show stimulus sensitivity, placing them in the differential diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Startle syndromes form a heterogeneous group of disorders with three categories: hyperekplexia (HPX), stimulus-induced disorders, and neuropsychiatric syndromes. HPX is characterized by an exaggerated motor startle reflex combined with stiffness and is caused by mutations in different parts of the inhibitory glycine receptor, leading to brainstem pathology. The preserved consciousness distinguishes it from epileptic seizures. Clonazepam is the first-choice therapy. The stimulus-induced disorders cover a broad range of epileptic and nonepileptic disorders, and distinguishing the two can be difficult. Additional information from electroencephalography (EEG) and video registration can help. Many stimulus-induced disorders now have an identified gene defect. Antiepileptic drugs, including benzodiazepines, are frequently mentioned as the best treatment option. Neuropsychiatric syndromes are on the borderland of neurology and psychiatry, and their etiology is poorly understood. These syndromes include startle-induced tics, culture-specific disorders such as Latah, and functional startle syndromes. The electromyography (EMG) startle reflex in these syndromes is characterized by variable recruitment patterns and the presence of a second \"orienting\" response. Treatment options are limited, but urgently required. In the clinical setting, the patient's history and a (home) video recording together with genetic and electrophysiologic testing help to classify these challenging disorders."}, {"Title": "Collaboration: The Paradigm of Practice Approach between the Forensic Psychiatrist and the Forensic Psychologist.", "Abstract": "The importance and relevance of forensic practice to societal evolution has increased exponentially in recent years.

Clearly Wnt effects in synaptic and plastic processes are relevant, however the implication of this pathway in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases that produce synaptic impairment, is even more interesting. Several years ago our laboratory found a relationship between the loss of Wnt signaling and the neurotoxicity of the amyloid-\u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2), one of the main players in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, the activation of the Wnt signaling cascade prevents A\u03b2-dependent cytotoxic effects. In fact, disrupted Wnt signaling may be a direct link between A\u03b2-toxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation, ultimately leading to impaired synaptic plasticity and/or neuronal degeneration, indicating that a single pathway can account for both neuro-pathological lesions and altered synaptic function. These observations, suggest that a sustained loss of Wnt signaling function may be a key relevant factor in the pathology of AD. On the other hand, Schizophrenia remains one of the most debilitating and intractable illness in psychiatry. Since Wnt signaling is important in organizing the developing brain, it is reasonable to propose that defects in Wnt signaling could contribute to Schizophrenia, particularly since the neuro-developmental hypothesis of the disease implies subtle dys-regulation of brain development, including some core components of the Wnt signaling pathways such as GSK-3\u03b2 or Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 (DISC-1).

In the majority of cases, it can be assumed that this information and these ideas are travelling in the same direction; however, it is possible that the objective and subjective cannot be synthesised, and appear mutually contradictory. In this commentary, an example of where this might be the case has been analysed: a report published by the Scottish Public Health Network, a Health Care Needs Assessment of Services for people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It appears from reflection and analysis of this document that this process may indeed have gone awry. We propose that, if followed, this document would lead to the adoption of dangerous diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, as well as preventing patients from making informed decisions about treatment options, and discouraging clinicians from following evidence-based medicine and recommending proven treatments for ME/CFS, because of potential implications for future commissioning. This commentary seeks to highlight some of the problems, contradictions and unintended consequences of a divergence between patient perspectives and evidence-based medicine despite probably sharing the same aim, that of improving patient care and striving for better understanding and better treatments for disease."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and mental health research in South Africa: national priorities in a low and middle income context.", "Abstract": "The recent National Mental Health Summit included discussion of research priorities for South Africa.

This paper will describe the impact of the Act on mental health care service delivery in the country. Literature pertaining to the MHCA published from 2006-2012, a report compiled by the South African Society of Psychiatrists and the results of a national survey conducted among Heads of Departments of Psychiatry, Mental Health Review Boards and Provincial Directors of Mental Health was reviewed. The MHCA has been successful in shifting the emphasis of care from psychiatric institutions to general hospitals. However, the integration of services has been hampered by infrastructure constraints and shortages of mental health personnel. It has been less successful in integrating mental health care into primary health services where the focus remains largely on the pharmacological maintenance treatment of the chronically mentally ill. Little attention has been given to the health promotion, disease prevention and rehabilitation aspects of care. Mental health review boards contend with limited resources, administrative challenges and limited political support.

College students view psychiatrists as effective for treating relatively severe mental health problems, although depression was not considered to be a psychiatrist's relative strong suit (only half viewed them as being effective). Some confusion between psychiatrists and psychologists seemed apparent. Although students did not consider the media a highly reliable source of information, media sources nonetheless appeared to play a dominant role in determining how college students framed psychiatry roles.

However, meeting the standards requires adequate faculty, expertise, motivation, and patient population to support a substantive didactic and experiential base for residents to develop phase-appropriate competence. Psychoanalysts are in a position to provide capable instruction and supervision in psychodynamic as well as supportive psychotherapy, but they are not evenly distributed in the United States. The psychoanalyst authors investigated the experience of psychiatry residency training programs in eastern Massachusetts and northeast Ohio with regard to their current practice in psychotherapy training in general and psychodynamic psychotherapy in particular. They asked about the time given to formal teaching, therapy experience and supervision, the composition of the faculty, and the presence of psychoanalysts as teachers or supervisors. Personal interviews to clarify aims, attitudes, and needs supplemented responses to the questionnaire. This article describes these findings and the opportunities and challenges that are evident in the current environment of psychiatric training.

It is argued the utility and topicality of those psychopathological concepts that aren't commonly investigated, especially in the evaluation and management of onset paranoid psychosis in an emergency ward.\nWe provide clinical vignettes of two young patients, admitted in the emergency psychiatry ward, who represent a concrete example of the dynamic-affective comprehension of delusional elaboration, through its embodiment in the individual biographical development.\nAn interpretative key, based on this specific conceptual frame, seems to provide an integrated intervention tool that aims both to a causal comprehension and demolition of the delusional solution in onset psychotic cases.\nThe rediscovery of classical psychopathological concepts appears to be a necessary process, especially in the clinical management of onset psychotic disorders.

Assessments included the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis II, Personality Disorders (SCID-II), the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Symptom Check List, 90 questions, revised (SCL-90-R).\nOf the 42 SUD patients, 48% had independent MDD episode(s) only, 24% had S-I MDD episode(s) only, and 28% had both independent and S-I MDD episodes. Insomnia, psychomotor agitation, concentration and decision problems, melancholic features, higher total MDD symptom count, longer time being depressed, higher mean score on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and shorter duration of SUDs characterized independent MDDs.\nSmall sample size with risk of type II error.\nIndependent MDDs were more severe and had different qualities compared with S-I MDDs, suggesting important treatment implications.

Here, the authors report on the adaptation, implementation, and results attained with a broadly applicable, developmental, competency-based framework for promoting scholarship during child and adolescent psychiatry residency.\nThe authors instituted structural program changes, protecting time for all residents to engage in scholarly pursuits and a mentorship program to support residents in their scholarly interests. The authors assessed five graduating classes before and five classes after these changes were implemented, examining whether these changes sustained scholarship for residents with previous experience during general psychiatry residency and whether they promoted emergence of new scholarship among residents without such experience.\nThe authors observed a tenfold increase in the number of residents engaged in rigorously-defined scholarly pursuits after the program changes, which helped sustain the scholarship of more residents with previous experience and promoted the emergence of more new scholarship among residents without previous experience.\nThe authors conclude that it is possible to sustain and promote scholarship during child psychiatry residency despite the relatively short duration of the program and the many requirements for graduation and certification. The changes implemented were universal in scope and required no special funding mechanisms, making this approach potentially exportable to other training programs."}, {"Title": "[The history of Spanish neurosurgery: the Valencian school: J.J.

Since the first intervention, based on the methods and surgical instruments already used in Europe and the U.S.A., the neurosurgical practice became the mainstay of the department, from which other auxiliary specialties emerged, such as neuroradiology, neurophysiology, neuropathology and also new techniques such as stereotactic surgery, functional neurosurgery and palencephalography. This year, the department celebrates its 80th anniversary. The broad spectrum of Prof. Barcia's scientific work included fields like neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry, as well as anthropology, medical thought, history of medicine, morphology and history of anatomical language in his work \"Onomatologica anatomica nova\", in addition to an interesting poetic work.

One such quickly shifting diagnostic area has been that of bipolar disorder (BD). Historically regarded as a relatively uncommon condition until recent decades, the construct of BD underwent a major expansion in the 1990s and 2000s with promulgation of the concept of the soft bipolar spectrum disorder, from which the recent research focus on subthreshold BD presentations was derived. Related to this has been renewed interest in treatments for BD from the pharmaceutical industry. The increasing rates of diagnosis have largely related to BD II, for which there has been a dramatic broadening of diagnostic criteria. This article critically reviews research data, both for broadening the diagnostic criteria for BD and, conversely, for the growing evidence of overdiagnosis in clinical practice. Why does this debate matter? I would suggest that there are many valid reasons to be concerned about overdiagnosis: first, the potential for overtreatment or inappropriate treatment of such patients with mood stabilizing treatments, including antipsychotics; second, the potential for diagnostic oversimplification, with consequent diagnostic deskilling and loss of credibility for the psychiatric profession; and third, the potential major impact on etiologic research for this condition. Psychiatry should not uncritically accept the shift to overdiagnosis, which has developed a rapid momentum in recent decades, in both clinical and academic circles. We must ensure, as a profession, that any change in diagnostic practice is underpinned by rigorous and critical research inquiry."}, {"Title": "Mental illness and mental health: is the glass half empty or half full?", "Abstract": "During the past century, the scope of mental health intervention in North America has gradually expanded from an initial focus on hospitalized patients with psychoses to outpatients with neurotic disorders, including the so-called worried well. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fifth Edition, is further embracing the concept of a mental illness spectrum, such that increasing attention to the softer end of the continuum can be expected in the future. This anticipated shift rekindles important questions about how mental illness is defined, how to distinguish between mental disorders and normal reactions, whether psychiatry is guilty of prevalence inflation, and when somatic therapies should be used to treat problems of living. Such debates are aptly illustrated by the example of complicated bereavement, which is best characterized as a form of adjustment disorder. Achieving an overarching definition of mental illness is challenging, owing to the many different contexts in which DSM diagnoses are used. Careful analyses of such contextual utility must inform future decisions about what ends up in DSM, as well as how mental illness is defined by public health policy and society at large. A viable vision for the future of psychiatry should include a spectrum model of mental health (as opposed to exclusively mental illness) that incorporates graded, evidence-based interventions delivered by a range of providers at each point along its continuum."}, {"Title": "Suicide and psychiatrist's liability in Italian law cases.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study is to analyze the factors that are most frequently associated with a verdict of guilty delivered to the psychiatrist in cases of a patient's suicide in Italian law. Twenty-six sentences (1975-2009) were analyzed according to the claim of malpractice, patient characteristics, circumstances of the suicide, and reasons for the court's judgment. The court held the psychiatrist guilty in 12 cases, considering that the act of suicide was predictable and could have been avoided. Predictability was mainly related to errors in surveillance (7 cases), therapy (1 case), or both (2 cases). An error in diagnosis was considered to be related to the patient's death in two cases. Analysis of medical behavior considered to be erroneous and associated with a verdict of guilty provides an opportunity to discuss the topics relevant not only to practicing psychiatrists but also to experts assessing medical liability in cases of patient suicide."}, {"Title": "Financial impact of accurate discharge coding in a liaison psychiatry service.", "Abstract": "Previous research has shown that patients seen by liaison psychiatry services are a complex and expensive patient group and that the psychiatric co-morbidities of hospital inpatients are poorly attested at discharge for assignment to diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of discharge coding in a neuropsychiatry liaison population. We also aimed to establish whether or not, had the correct diagnosis been assigned, additional funding would have been allocated to the hospital.\nDiagnostic codes were retrospectively collected from the discharge diagnoses for all inpatients (n=276) referred to the neuropsychiatry liaison service in a university hospital over a 12 month period and these were compared to a consensus diagnosis. Using grouper software, codes were then changed to reflect the consensus diagnoses and DRGs were recalculated to see if the change in diagnosis led to a change in reimbursement for those patients.\nDischarge diagnosis and consensus diagnosis were in agreement in 30% of cases. When discharge codes were corrected, patients changed to a higher paying DRG in 28/220 (12.7%) of patients. The increase in costing associated with this change in DRG was \u20ac305,349.\nAccording to these results, not only is the complexity of patients seen by psychiatry consult services in general hospitals not reflected in the discharge diagnosis, but, in this sample of patients, the additional complexity would have led to a significant increase in reimbursement to the hospital.

Mental disorders, defined as affective, psychotic and anxiety disorders (ICD-10 F20-42) were evaluated in order to identify associated drugs. Included was a total of 188,024 older individuals, who collectively filled 2,013,079 prescriptions for the treatment of mental disorders. Descriptive analyses were performed, including frequency distribution and 95% CI. The competence of the prescribers was analyzed by subdividing them into five groups: geriatricians, psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs), other specialists, and physicians without specialist education.\nGPs represented the main prescribers, whereas geriatricians and psychiatrists rarely prescribed drugs to older persons. Benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed drugs. Women were prescribed drugs from geriatricians and psychiatrists to a greater extent than men.\nThis study examined the prescription of psychotropic drugs to older persons. Physicians specialized in older persons' disorders and mental health were rarely the prescribers of these drugs.

Data were extracted from forensic psychiatric and crime reports.\nIn a nationwide sample of 593 homicide offenders, 21 had at least one cluster C personality disorder. These offenders had significantly shorter criminal histories than the others. Offender-victim relationship did not differ between the groups, but confession to the crime and feelings of remorse were more common among people with cluster C disorders.

We discussed studies addressing or related to the issue of staging in a number of mental disorders (schizophrenia, unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, substance use disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa). The literature indicates that disorders have a longitudinal development or a treatment history that can be categorized according to stages. We proposed staging formulations for the above-mentioned psychiatric disorders.\nStaging models offer innovative assessment tools for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.

Few studies have been published where family nursing interventions are integrated into routine inpatient services.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of implementing a therapeutic conversation intervention in acute inpatient psychiatry with families, by evaluating family perceived support, expressive family function and general well-being.\nA controlled before and after study design was used. Patients and family members at four acute psychiatric units at a university hospital were selected for the implementation of family systems nursing (FSN). The nurses on one acute psychiatric unit were educated, trained, and supervised in a therapeutic conversation intervention built on the Calgary Family Assessment and Interventions models (Wright and Leahey, 2009).

Vagal afferents are involved in some of these effects. We previously showed that ingestion of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) caused extensive neurochemical changes in the brain and behavior that were abrogated by prior vagotomy. Because information can be transmitted to the brain via primary afferents encoded as neuronal spike trains, our goal was to record those induced by JB-1 in vagal afferents in the mesenteric nerve bundle and thus determine the nature of the signals sent to the brain. Male Swiss Webster mice jejunal segments were cannulated ex vivo, and serosal and luminal compartments were perfused separately. Bacteria were added intraluminally. We found no evidence for translocation of labeled bacteria across the epithelium during the experiment. We recorded extracellular multi- and single-unit neuronal activity with glass suction pipettes. Within minutes of application, JB-1 increased the constitutive single- and multiunit firing rate of the mesenteric nerve bundle, but Lactobacillus salivarius (a negative control) or media alone were ineffective. JB-1 significantly augmented multiunit discharge responses to an intraluminal distension pressure of 31 hPa. Prior subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolished all of the JB-1-evoked effects.

By emphasizing novel and apparently effective interventions and excluding severe or intractable cases from the film, Wright encouraged an optimistic sense of achievement. Filmed at a time when victory was considered an eventual outcome, the picture presented a health service to which all had access without charge. Children and unemployed women, two groups excluded under the 1911 National Insurance Act, had been required to pay for healthcare in the prewar period and were shown receiving free treatment from the Emergency Medical Service. However, the therapeutic optimism presented in the film proved premature. Most U.K. battle casualties arose in the latter half of the conflict and follow-up studies failed to confirm the positive outcome statistics reported in the film. Aubrey Lewis, clinical director of the hospital, criticized research projects conducted at Mill Hill for a lack of rigor.

MI has been shown to be effective in situations where the patient's ambivalence seems to impede the therapeutic process. Communication skills and the ability of the care taker to induce the so called \"change talk\" by the patient play a particularly important role and correlate with the positive effects of MI. Those groups of patients in which other factors than ambivalence affect the therapeutic process seem to benefit much less from this intervention method. MI hallmarks the substantial change that gradually took place during the last two decades in caretakers' attitude towards patients with dependence and other psychiatric patients: away from \"prescriptive\" towards \"supportive\" treatment and communication style.

The diagnostic criteria, first formulated more than 100 years ago, have since undergone multiple changes. While the disease was originally named \"dementia praecox\" by Emil Kraepelin, the term \"schizophrenia\" was coined by Eugen Bleuler soon afterwards. DSM-III changed diagnostic criteria dramatically in 1980, relying especially on Kurt Schneider's first rank criteria. These changes were also incorporated into ICD-10. Diagnosis of schizophrenia thus became much more reliable. Yet there remain many problems to be solved: the demarcation towards other psychotic disorders remains arbitrary; the diagnosis is based on multiple, quite different symptoms, enabling two patients being diagnosed with schizophrenia without sharing a single symptom, yet further important symptoms (e.g. cognitive impairments) are not even covered by present diagnostic criteria; until now it was not possible to formulate diagnostic criteria reflecting underlying biological processes or to find a reliable biological marker. These methodological uncertainties are in stark contrast to the persistence of the stigma which accompanies schizophrenia despite all efforts.

Forgetting operates in a dynamic neural connection with remembering, allowing the elimination of unnecessary or irrelevant information overload and decreasing interference. Stress and traumatic experiences could affect this connection, resulting in memory disturbances, such as functional amnesia. An overview of clinical, epidemiological, neuropsychological, and neurobiological aspects of functional amnesia is presented, by preponderantly resorting to own data from patients with functional amnesia. Patients were investigated medically, neuropsychologically, and neuroradiologically. A detailed report of a new case is included to illustrate the challenges posed by making an accurate differential diagnosis of functional amnesia, a condition that may encroach on the boundaries between psychiatry and neurology. Several mechanisms may play a role in \"forgetting\" in functional amnesia, such as retrieval impairments, consolidating defects, motivated forgetting, deficits in binding and reassembling details of the past, deficits in establishing a first person autonoetic connection with personal events, and loss of information. In a substantial number of patients, we observed a synchronization abnormality between a frontal lobe system, important for autonoetic consciousness, and a temporo-amygdalar system, important for evaluation and emotions, which provides empirical support for an underlying mechanism of dissociation (a failure of integration between cognition and emotion).

Health expenditures are estimated at 15.6% of the gross domestic product, almost as much as those of Germany, Japan and other developed countries. The numbers of hospitals, hospital beds and primary healthcare centers in the country have all increased. The Ministry of Health (MOH) currently operates 27 of 76 hospitals, with a total of 3074 beds, which represent 61% of total beds of all hospitals in the Palestinian Authorities area. Also, the MOH is operating 453 of 706 Primary Health Care facilities. By 2007, about 40\u2009000 people were employed in different sectors of the health system, with 33% employed by the MOH.\nThis purpose of this study was to develop a financing strategy to help cover some or all of the costs involved in operating such institutions and to estimate the unit cost of primary and secondary programs and departments.\nA retrospective study was carried out on data from government hospitals and primary healthcare centers to identify and analyze the costs and output (patient-related services) and to estimate the unit cost of health services provided by hospitals and PHCs during the year 2008. All operating costs are assigned and allocated to the departments at MOH hospitals and primary health care centers (PPHCs) and are identified as overhead departments, intermediate-service and final-service departments. Intermediate-service departments provide procedures and services to patients in the final-service departments. The costs of the overhead departments are distributed to the intermediate-service and final-service departments through a step-down method, according to allocation criteria devised to resemble as closely as possible the actual use of resources by each of the departments.

Data cleaning was carried out by cross-validating the results through conducting cross-tabulations between the hospital/center and section/program to identify errors from the data collection or entry process. Depreciation of assets and the consumption of capital costs are ignored in this study, as it is difficult to evaluate the MOH facilities owing to a lack of recording of depreciation of assets or other costs of servicing capital assets.\nInpatient costs contributed about 75% of all costs, whereas outpatient services contributed the remaining 25% of total costs. The average cost per visit was $13.00 for outpatient departments, whereas the average cost per patient day for inpatient departments was $90.00.

Up to 45% of all patients are classified as having more than one psychiatric disorder. These high rates of comorbidity have led to a debate concerning the interpretation of this phenomenon. Some authors emphasize the problematic character of the high rates of comorbidity because they indicate absent zones of rarities. Others consider comorbid conditions to be a validator for a particular reclassification of diseases. In this paper we will show that those at first sight contrasting interpretations of comorbidity are based on similar assumptions about disease models. The underlying ideas are that firstly high rates of comorbidity are the result of the absence of causally defined diseases in psychiatry, and second that causal disease models are preferable to non-causal disease models. We will argue that there are good reasons to seek after causal understanding of psychiatric disorders, but that causal disease models will not rule out high rates of comorbidity--neither in psychiatry, nor in medicine in general. By bringing to the fore these underlying assumptions, we hope to clear the ground for a different understanding of comorbidity, and of models for psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Innovative trends in the design of therapeutic trials in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "The standard randomized controlled trial design is still based on the acute disease model.

The current standard of therapeutic trial in psychiatry is represented by the large, multi-center, controlled randomized trial with broad inclusion criteria, and little attention to other factors such as the clinical history of patients and comorbidity. The heterogeneous features of these patients would then affect the outcome of the trial. Conflicting results among randomized controlled trials can represent a spectrum of outcomes, based on different patient groups, more than bias or random variability. If a treatment is tested by a series of small trials with inclusion criteria for specific characteristics (including treatment history, subgroups and comorbidity), we may have a better knowledge of its indications and contraindications. Further, there is increasing need of expanding the content of customary clinical information, by including evaluation of variables such as stress, lifestyle, well-being, illness behavior and psychological symptoms.

The dialectal Arabic version was carried out by translation from English to dialectal Arabic followed by a back translation to English. Some questions were modified to be understood by a population with low education. After giving their verbal informed consent, the participants filled in the Arabic version of the BIS-11. For the illiterate, responses and quotations were performed by the interviewer. The persons were also asked to fill in socio-demographic data. Cronbach's coefficient was calculated, and then we assessed impulsivity prevalence and a correlation between demographic features and impulsivity scores. For the analyses, the statistical software SPSS 11 was used.\nThe sex ratio is 1.02. Most of the interviewed persons were 20 to 49 years old. Around 25.4% of the sample were analphabets, 32.1% had primary education, 29.1% had secondary education and 13.4% were undergraduates. The Cronbach's alpha was respectively 0.66 for attention, 0.72 for motor impulsivity, 0.61 for lack of planning and 0.78 for total impulsivity. Factor analysis identified three factors explaining the total variance of 32.6%. Impulsivity prevalence was 9%. We did not find significant correlation between demographic features and impulsivity scores.\nLimits of the study: scale stability over time was not verified. This was due to the difficulty in re-inviting the same persons to fulfil the scale a second time. Because no instrument for assessing exists in Arabic, comparison was not possible between the translated Barratt's scale and the reference. Our sample represents the general population. This choice was justified in order to study an eventual correlation between impulsiveness and socio-demographic characteristics. We must mention difficulties when asking persons with low education to complete the scale, what may have caused a poorer performance of the scale due to difficulties in understanding some questions. Moreover, we had chosen a non-clinical sample. The validation of the scale could be performed in a clinical population. The measure of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) fell within an acceptable range (0.61-0.78), suggesting that the Arabic version of the BIS-11 is reliable. Exploratory factor analysis of the current version identified three factors, but these factors differed from those of other translated versions.\nThere is growing interest in the impulsivity concept. Forensic psychiatry is particularly concerned by impulsivity. In fact, it is related to psychiatric patients' violence. Impulsivity also reveals the problem of responsibility assessment in psychiatric expertise and the dangerousness of psychiatric patients. The Arabic version of the BIS-11 has a good apparent and internal consistency. This version could be useful in assessing psychiatric patient's dangerousness."}, {"Title": "Hazards analysis, within departments and occupations, for hepatitis B virus among health care workers in Public Teaching Hospitals in Khartoum State; Sudan.", "Abstract": "Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can lead to a range of clinical illnesses.\nTo examine hazards of hepatitis B virus associated with clinical departments and occupations; among health care workers in Public Teaching Hospitals in Khartoum State, Sudan.\nThe study was a cross sectional, facility-based study.

To assess hazards of HBV among departments and occupations of HCWs, non-parametric Methods of Chi-square test, was used.\nFor Anti-HBc vulnerable departments was Renal Dialysis (100%); while for occupations was midwives (73.3%). For carrier rate (+ve HBsAg), highest rate found in department of Management (6.8%); while for occupations was Midwives (6.7%). Regarding immunity (+ve Anti-HBs), the highest percentage found in the department of Dentistry (25.9%); while for occupations was associated with Doctors (14.8%). For a profile of high infectivity (+ve HBeAg), the most vulnerable department in terms of HBV hazards was the Surgery (1.4%); while for occupations was nurses (0.9%).\nThere was a significant association for infection rate of HBV with occupation and type of department.

Their opinions were studied using the Attitude to Containment Measures Questionnaire.\nThe adolescents were more critical toward most containment measures compared to the staff. Exactly as reported in previous studies among adult service users, the containment measures most accepted by the adolescents were as-needed medication, intermittent observation, and time out. They were considered as helpful, safe, and respectful methods. Net bed, which has never been used in Finland, was most disapproved. It was considered as a distressing, inhuman, and cruel method. Opinions toward mechanical restraint, which is commonly used in Finnish adolescent psychiatry, were noticeable: adolescents rated mechanical restraint among the three least accepted, staff among the three most accepted containment methods. Adolescents considered it as distressing and not consistent of human dignity.\nAdolescents disapprove of containment measures some of which are widely used in psychiatric practice. Their opinions differ significantly from those of the staff. New ways to manage crisis situations should be developed. Where containment cannot be avoided, information, explanation about the procedures involved, and debriefing should be offered to an underaged patient in a manner which takes account of his/her developmental level."}, {"Title": "Expanding the scope of psychiatric nursing practice: devaluing the essence of psychiatric nursing?", "Abstract": "Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners are quickly becoming sought after employees, especially in public mental health systems where a shrinking number of psychiatrists necessitate alternate access to prescribers.

At the same time there is an increased focus on a recovery orientation to psychiatry alongside the primacy of psychotropic medicine as the most cost effective treatment, which can become competing aims for practitioners.

OBJECTIVE To develop a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for depression, called the Computerized Adaptive Test-Depression Inventory (CAT-DI), that decreases patient and clinician burden and increases measurement precision. DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING A psychiatric clinic and community mental health center. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1614 individuals with and without minor and major depression were recruited for study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The focus of this study was the development of the CAT-DI. The 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Patient Health Questionnaire 9, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were used to study the convergent validity of the new measure, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used to obtain diagnostic classifications of minor and major depressive disorder. RESULTS A mean of 12 items per study participant was required to achieve a 0.3 SE in the depression severity estimate and maintain a correlation of r = 0.95 with the total 389-item test score. Using empirically derived thresholds based on a mixture of normal distributions, we found a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.88 for the classification of major depressive disorder in a sample consisting of depressed patients and healthy controls. Correlations on the order of r = 0.8 were found with the other clinician and self-rating scale scores. The CAT-DI provided excellent discrimination throughout the entire depressive severity continuum (minor and major depression), whereas the traditional scales did so primarily at the extremes (eg, major depression). CONCLUSIONS Traditional measurement fixes the number of items administered and allows measurement uncertainty to vary. In contrast, a CAT fixes measurement uncertainty and allows the number of items to vary. The result is a significant reduction in the number of items needed to measure depression and increased precision of measurement."}, {"Title": "False-positive methadone urine drug screen in a patient treated with quetiapine.", "Abstract": "We present a case of T.M. admitted to University Department of Psychiatry, Split University Hospital Center, in Croatia, because of the acute psychotic reaction (F23.9). The patient's urine tested positive for methadone without a history of methadone ingestion. Urine drug screen was performed with the COBAS Integra Methadone II test kit (kinetic interaction of microparticles in solution /KIMS/ methodology) by Roche. Drugs that have been shown to cross-react with methadone feature a tricyclic structure with a sulfur and nitrogen atom in the middle ring, which is common for both quetiapine and methadone. Therefore, it is plausible that this structural similarity between quetiapine and methadone could underlie the cross-reactivity on methadone drug screen. Besides quetiapine, a number of routinely prescribed medications have been associated with triggering false-positive urine drug screen results. Verification of the test results with a different screening test or additional analytical tests should be performed to avoid adverse consequences for the patients."}, {"Title": "Women and hysteria in the history of mental health.", "Abstract": "Hysteria is undoubtedly the first mental disorder attributable to women, accurately described in the second millennium BC, and until Freud considered an exclusively female disease. Over 4000 years of history, this disease was considered from two perspectives: scientific and demonological. It was cured with herbs, sex or sexual abstinence, punished and purified with fire for its association with sorcery and finally, clinically studied as a disease and treated with innovative therapies. However, even at the end of 19(th) century, scientific innovation had still not reached some places, where the only known therapies were those proposed by Galen. During the 20(th) century several studies postulated the decline of hysteria amongst occidental patients (both women and men) and the escalating of this disorder in non-Western countries. The concept of hysterical neurosis is deleted with the 1980 DSM-III. The evolution of these diseases seems to be a factor linked with social \"westernization\", and examining under what conditions the symptoms first became common in different societies became a priority for recent studies over risk factor."}, {"Title": "The Psychiatric Association of Bosnia-Herzegovina--distinctive role in national and international framework.", "Abstract": "Following the initiative and after preparation that lasted about a year, a national association of experts dealing with psychiatry has been formed in our country named Psychiatric Association of Bosnia-Herzegovina (PABH).

This division resulted from a certain dose of mystification of the psychotherapeutic work of those practicing, and fear of psychological determinism of the functioning, of those who are looking for answers in the biological substrate. The gap of polarization is now described as a form of Cartesian dualism, the division of the mind and the brain. The integration of psychotherapy in psychiatry is the trend in psychiatric specialization, virtually erasing this dualism.

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated.

Over the last two and a half millennia, during which principles of Hippocratic ethics applied, attitudes towards psychiatric patients, from an ethical and practical standpoint, were and still are controversial to say the least. During this period thousands of people with mental disorders were abused, tortured, or killed, all of this in accordance to the existing ethical and legislative norms (Malleus Maleficarum, eugenic laws of totalitarian regimes...). In the last forty years many international organizations and associations brought forth a number of resolutions and declarations warning of the position and of the rights of psychiatric patients and giving instructions on the humane, that is to say ethical, treatment of this category of patients. In almost all the western countries laws are passed to protect the rights of people with mental disorders. Thanks to this and maybe even more to the development of psychiatry as a medical and scientific profession, the position of those with mental disorders is improving. However, at the same time over the last 40 years we are witnesses to the destruction of the classic moral principles and the establishment of certain \"new\" ethics which put psychiatric patients at a disadvantage, only in a more subtle way then before.

After psychiatry was recognized as a distinct medical discipline, in nineteenth century, it begun to shift away from religious approach to the treatment of mentally ill persons. During the twentieth century, it was enriched using psychotherapy, socio-therapy and biological methods of treatment, and completely secularized. The renaissance of religion and religious influence on secular events in the beginning of 21th century and postsecular atmosphere has launched a process of desecularization of psychiatry. It can best be seen through the changes in attitude towards spiritual and religious in the process of patients' evaluation, quality of life assessment, respect for the spiritual needs of patients in the process of clinical treatment, and objective consideration of the phenomenon of religiosity by psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Without the ambition to precisely explain and define this notion, the basic sketch of what a postsecular psychiatry is and what it is not will be outlined in this paper. The goal is to open a professional debate over the issue, which would contribute that psychiatry, despite the ongoing challenges and provocations, maintains its essence as a medical discipline and adequately respond to all the needs of its patients, including those related to spirituality and religion. Overcoming rigid secular framework, psychiatry becomes more human and more close to human. In this way, psychiatry does not lose its \"scientific component\" because the effects of spirituality, beliefs or religious practices on mental health can be scientifically investigated without crossing the boundaries between the natural and spiritual sciences. Although people often consider that science and religion contradict each other, these are by their very nature convergently moving towards the meeting point even if it is located at infinity."}, {"Title": "Using brief clinician and parent measures to track outcomes in outpatient child psychiatry: longer term follow-up and comparative effectiveness.", "Abstract": "\u2002 This study explored the feasibility and validity of using brief clinician- and parent-rated measures routinely over 6\u2003months in outpatient child psychiatry.\n\u2002 All patients under 18\u2003years of age seen for intake in the Child Psychiatry Clinic from 1 August 2007 through 31 July 2010 were eligible for inclusion in the study.

The present article describes the protocol of a study that will examine the relative efficacy, the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility of adding an Inpatient Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy and treatment-as-usual for inpatients with unipolar depression.\nThe study is a one-month randomized controlled trial with a two parallel group design and a 12-month naturalistic follow-up. A sample of 130 consecutive adult inpatients with unipolar depression and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score over 18 will be recruited. The study is carried out in the university hospital section for mood disorders in Lausanne, Switzerland. Patients are assessed upon admission, and at 1-, 3- and 12- month follow-ups. Inpatient therapy is a manualized brief intervention, combining the virtues of inpatient setting and of time-limited dynamic therapies (focal orientation, fixed duration, resource-oriented interventions). Treatment-as-usual represents the best level of practice for a minimal treatment condition usually proposed to inpatients. Final analyses will follow an intention-to-treat strategy. Depressive symptomatology is the primary outcome and secondary outcome includes measures of psychiatric symptomatology, psychosocial role functioning, and psychodynamic-emotional functioning. The mediating role of the therapeutic alliance is also examined. Allocation to treatment groups uses a stratified block randomization method with permuted block. To guarantee allocation concealment, randomization is done by an independent researcher.\nDespite the large number of studies on treatment of depression, there is a clear lack of controlled research in inpatient psychotherapy during the acute phase of a major depressive episode.

Whereas the wide variety of involuntary behaviors (and here mostly the deviant or pathological ones will be considered) will necessarily be represented at some biophysical level in nervous system activity-for after all those cellular activity patterns manifest themselves as behaviors and thus there will be a multiplicity of them-there could be some general tendencies to be discerned amongst that assortment. Collecting observations derived from neurophysiological activity associated with several pathological conditions characterized by presenting will-less actions such as Parkinson's disease, seizures, alien hand syndrome and tics, it is proposed that a general neurophysiologic tendency of brain activity that correlates with involuntary actions is higher than normal synchrony in specific brain cell networks, depending upon the behavior in question. Wilful, considered normal behavior, depends on precise coordination of the collective activity in cell ensembles that may be lost, or diminished, when there are tendencies toward more than normal or aberrant synchronization of cellular activity. Hence, rapid fluctuations in synchrony is associated with normal actions and cognition while less variability in brain recordings particularly with regards to synchronization could be a signature of unconscious and deviant behaviors in general."}, {"Title": "An evaluation of a proactive geriatric trauma consultation service.", "Abstract": "To describe and evaluate an inpatient geriatric trauma consultation service (GTCS).\nDelays in recognizing the special needs of older trauma patients may result in suboptimal care.

An anonymous questionnaire covering five domains (academic teaching, psychoanalysis, extra-academic training, interest in a more developed model of training, supervision) was sent by the French Federative Association of Psychiatrists Trainees (AFFEP) to all French psychiatrist trainees, through their local trainee associations (n=26).\nThe questionnaire was answered by 869 of the 1334 psychiatry residents (65%). The vast majority of the trainees reported being interested in psychotherapy, but 75% thought that their training in psychotherapy (psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] and systemic therapy) is insufficient. In 20 of the 26 universities, more than half of the trainees reported that their training was insufficient in the three fields; in four universities, more than half of the trainees were satisfied with at least one field. Yet, satisfaction rates were very different among universities: for example, 27% were satisfied with their psychoanalytic training in Paris and 87% in Strasbourg; 7% were satisfied with their CBT training in Strasbourg, but 65% in Nice. The vast majority (97%) believes that supervision about therapeutic relationship is necessary during residency rotations in the hospital. More than three quarters (78%) would like to have supervision at least twice a month. Yet, only 51% of respondents have such supervision. Once again, large disparities were observed between different Academies: for example 74% had supervision in Montpellier, but only 29% in Marseille. The vast majority (95%) of trainees would like a two-phase model of training (general theoretical teaching plus in-depth training in one or more methods), which is different to the current training model.\nOur results show a clear discrepancy between the importance of training in psychotherapy for psychiatrists, the interest of psychiatry students for these therapies, and the very high rate of dissatisfaction for the training received, as well as the rate of students supervised during their training period at the hospital. These results differ from what is observed in other countries, where satisfaction rates are much higher among students, and various psychotherapy training methods are proposed in a much more homogeneous manner.

Amnestic MCI subtypes were not associated with higher rates of progression to dementia, whereas subtypes with multiple impairments were so associated. Eight out of the 18 EC measures, including all three measures assessing inhibition of prepotent responses, predicted MCI outcome at the univariate level. However, the multivariate GEE model indicated that age, daily functioning, and overall cognitive functioning best predicted progression to dementia.\nMeasures of EC (i.e., inhibitory control) are associated with MCI outcome. However, age and global measures of cognitive and functional impairment are better predictors of incident dementia."}, {"Title": "[Field of tension between psychomatics and psychiatry].", "Abstract": "As a medical topic psychosomatic medicine is able to look back on an almost 100-year-old tradition. Nevertheless, questions about its definition, area of application and by whom it should be practiced remains unsolved. This causes considerable tension with the field of psychiatry which has always seen psychosomatic medicine as a subspecialty of its own discipline. In the article, the development and current position of psychosomatic medicine in German speaking countries other than Germany (Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol) is presented. While psychosomatic care is currently planned and also partially already executed in Austria, psychosomatic medicine in Switzerland is located with general practitioners on the one hand and consultation-liaison psychiatry on the other. After the radical psychiatric reform of the late 1970s in South Tyrol psychosomatic medicine proved to be a means to remove taboos regarding psychiatric institutions and the mentally ill."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatry in Chile.", "Abstract": "Mental disorders are among the most prevalent of chronic disorders, and a high prevalence of these disorders has been consistently found in jails and prisons. This study was a retrospective case series that described the population of adults charged with a criminal offense who were court ordered to undergo a psychiatric assessment within the Medical Legal Service in Santiago, Chile from 2005 to 2006. Characteristics were explored in order to better understand this population in light of the recent reforms in the judicial and health systems of Chile. Ninety percent of sampled individuals were male, primarily between the ages of 18-39 years. Seventy percent of the evaluations came from the pre-reformed judicial system and 30% were from the reformed system. Approximately 63% of evaluated offenders were considered to have a psychiatric pathology, the most common being the personality disorders. Of the evaluated offenders, approximately 84% were considered by a psychiatrist to be criminally responsible for their crime, 7% were regarded as having diminished criminal responsibility, 4% were considered to be not criminally responsible for their crime, and 4% were cases where criminal responsibility was not applicable. Profession status, municipality of residence, type of residence, ICD-10 diagnosis, treatment recommendation, and criminal responsibility were found to be significantly different between male and female evaluated offenders. Results from this investigation will contribute to knowledge about forensic psychiatry and mental health in Latin America, and will hopefully pave the way for more research and international comparisons."}, {"Title": "[General psychopathology--the basis for objective psychiatric findings].", "Abstract": "General psychopathology is an integral part of psychiatry; without knowledge of it we would be unable to describe an objective clinical psychiatric finding and set the diagnosis. It is dealing with not only description of single psychopathologic terms but also studies its connection with pathophysiology, genetics, biochemistry, psychology and sociology. The grounds of psychopathology were given by Karl Jaspers who devoted much attention to the problem of subjective and objective; it happens quite often that subjective symptoms may bear a character of objective signs. In spite of serious importance of general psychopathology these facts have been grossly neglected during the last several decades.

This was largely unchanged across the 35 years. Comparing intending psychiatrists with doctors who chose other careers, factors with a greater influence on psychiatrists' choice included their experience of the subject at medical school, self-appraisal of their own skills, and inclinations before medical school. In a substudy of doctors who initially considered but then did not pursue specialty choices, 72% of those who did not pursue psychiatry gave 'job content' as their reason compared with 33% of doctors who considered but did not pursue other specialties. Historically, more women than men have chosen psychiatry, but the gap has closed over the past decade.\nJunior doctors' views about psychiatry as a possible career range from high levels of enthusiasm to antipathy, and are more polarised than views about other specialties. Shortening of working hours and improvements to working practices in other hospital-based specialties in the UK may have reduced the relative attractiveness of psychiatry to women doctors.

Paralleling media coverage of neuroimaging research and the high visibility of clinics selling scans is pressure from sponsors to move basic research about brain function along the translational pathway. Indeed, neuroimaging may offer benefits to mental health care: early or tailored intervention, opportunities for education and planning, and access to resources afforded by objectification of disorder. However, risks of premature technology transfer, such as misinterpretation, misrepresentation, and increased stigmatization, could compromise patient care. The insights of stakeholder groups about neuroimaging for mental health care are a largely untapped resource of information and guidance for translational efforts. We argue that the insights of key stakeholders-including researchers, healthcare providers, patients, and families-have an essential role to play upstream in professional, critical, and ethical discourse surrounding neuroimaging in mental health. Here we integrate previously orthogonal lines of inquiry involving stakeholder research to describe the translational landscape as well as challenges on its horizon."}, {"Title": "[Infants and toddlers behavioral and functional disorders: characteristics, mother-child interactions, alliance and outcome after a brief parents-child psychotherapy. A pilot study].", "Abstract": "Functional and behavioral disorders are the most frequent reasons for consultation in infant psychiatry, but there are still few studies about the efficacy of parents-child psychotherapies. Functional disorders appear to be easier to treat than behavioral disorders. The aim of this study was: (1) to assess outcome after a brief psychotherapy in a population of 49 infants aged 3 to 30 months, presenting functional or behavioral disorders; (2) to compare characteristics before therapy and outcomes for children with functional disorders and with behavioral disorders, to have a better understanding of the worse outcome of children with behavioral disorders.\nTwo assessments were performed, one before treatment and the second a month after the end of the therapy including the infant's symptoms (Symptom Check-list), parents' anxious and depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) and mother-infant interactions (Crittenden Experimental Index of adult-infant relationship). The therapeutic alliance was assessed by the therapist and the parents after the first consultation (Working Alliance Inventory).\nThe assessments after therapy show complete or partial improvement in the child's symptoms, in the mother's anxious and depressive symptoms and in the father's anxious symptoms. During interaction, the mothers become more sensible, the number of controlling and of unresponsive mothers decrease, while the children become more cooperative and less passive. Initial characteristics and outcome are however different according to the type of the child's disorder. The children with behavioral disorders are older and present an association of several symptoms. The disorder onset is later. Their mothers are, before therapy, more anxious and depressive. The therapeutic alliance is weaker. After therapy, despite the fact that their mothers' affective state and that interactive behavior improves, the mothers are more anxious and less sensible, while the children no longer differ from the group without behavioral disorder from the point of view of opposition (assessed during mother-child interaction).\nAlthough this study is limited by the lack of a control group and the sample size, it underlines some particularities of infants and toddlers presenting behavioral disorders and the difficulties involved in their treatment. One can wonder if these characteristics are specific of the behavioral disorders or if they are the result of an older dysfunction, complicated by the developmental evolution of the child and the duration of the difficulties. The small number of cases, among the children with behavioral disorders, presenting a preexistent functional disorder, the absence of difference in the duration of the disorders, and the different disorder's onset plead in favor of the first hypothesis. The behavioral disorders often associate child psychopathology, dysfunctional parents-child-relationships and environmental factors difficult to modify with a brief therapy focused on the relationship. It would appear necessary to develop specific treatments for this population."}, {"Title": "A cross-sectional study of body shape and eating attitude among Indian female healthcare students.", "Abstract": "The current study aimed at assessing eating attitude and body shape concerns among Indian female healthcare students who had received some teaching/training in Psychiatry.\nThe study was conducted at government medical and nursing college.

While combinatory strategies rely on receptor and synaptic mechanisms, it should also be considered that two drugs may also \"interact\" on the long-term to determine more robust changes in neuronal plasticity, which represents a downstream target important for functional recovery.\nThe aim of the study is to investigate neuroadaptive changes set in motion by chronic concomitant administration of the novel antipsychotic lurasidone and the mood stabilizer valproate.\nAnimals were chronically treated with lurasidone, valproate, or the combination of the two drugs and killed 24\u00a0h after the last injection to evaluate alterations of different measures of neuronal plasticity such as the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the immediate early gene Activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein, and the epigenetic regulators HDAC 1, 2, and 5 in dorsal and ventral hippocampus.\nThe results suggest that coadministration of lurasidone and valproate produces, when compared to the single drugs, a larger increase in the expression of BDNF in the ventral hippocampus, through the regulation of specific neurotrophin transcripts. We also found that the histone deacetylases were regulated by the drug combination, suggesting that some of the transcriptional changes may be sustained by epigenetic mechanisms.\nOur results suggest that the beneficial effects associated with combinatory treatment between a second-generation antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer could result from the ability to modulate neuroplastic molecules, whose expression and function is deteriorated in different psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "[Music therapy, a partner in patient care].", "Abstract": "Long time the preserve of psychiatry, music therapy is today used in general care.

This article also considers Australasian, British, North and South American medical and immigration legislation history, and contrasts this with the legislation and medical discourses which formed part of a fear of heredity, racial degeneracy, immigration and mental illness in New Zealand."}, {"Title": "[Report of a study concerning carry-over in epilepsy patients: questionnaire survey of neurologists].", "Abstract": "We conducted a questionnaire survey on 7,500 members of the Societas Neurologica Japonica regarding the carry-over from pediatric to adult epilepsy care. The response rate was 16.9%. Analysis of the responses showed that 46% of the neurologists were aware of the term \"carry-over\" in epilepsy care, and 78% felt difficulties with epilepsy care in general. The most common reasons included \"not familiar with interpreting EEG\" and \"not familiar with the laws, regulations and medical and welfare systems specific to epilepsy\". Among the neurologists who felt difficulties when accepting epilepsy patients aged 20 years or older referred from the pediatric department, 68% had experienced accepting these patients. The two major reasons for feeling difficulties when accepting these patients were \"difficult to have good understanding of the disease course from infancy\" and \"not familiar with the epilepsy syndrome specific to infancy\". The above findings highlight the importance of recognizing the existence of the issue of carry-over in adult epilepsy care and its significance, and to resolve the factors that hinder the transition of care. To achieve this goal, joint activities of the Japanese Society of Child Neurology and the Japan Epilepsy Society in collaboration with the Societas Neurologica Japonica, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, and the Japan Neurosurgical Society are critical."}, {"Title": "The prevalence and clinical associations of mood instability in adults living in England: results from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007.", "Abstract": "Mood instability is underinvestigated but potentially clinically important. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of mood instability in adults living in England and test whether it is important in explaining the extent of symptoms of common mental disorders, suicidality and healthcare use. An analysis of data from the adult psychiatric morbidity survey 2007, a household survey of private households in England (N=7403), was completed. The prevalence of mood instability was 13.9%. In univariate analysis it was strongly associated with socio-demographic and clinical variables. In regression modelling mood instability was independently associated with non-psychotic psychopathology, increasing the odds by 9.89. It was also linked with suicidal ideas (odds ratios (OR): 2.04) but not suicidal acts, and associated with being in receipt of medication, counselling or therapy for mental health problems (OR: 1.88), independent of a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Mood instability is relatively common in the adult population, occurs frequently in common mental disorders and appears to be an important symptom in its own right. It is associated with two important measures in psychiatry, namely suicidal thinking and healthcare service use. It warrants more widespread recognition and further research is required to understand if, when and how to intervene."}, {"Title": "Hikikomori as a possible clinical term in psychiatry: a questionnaire survey.", "Abstract": "The word hikikomori, the abnormal avoidance of social contact, has become increasingly well-known. However, a definition of this phenomenon has not been discussed thoroughly. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the perception of hikikomori amongst health-related students and professionals and to explore possible psychiatric conditions underlying hikikomori.\nA total of 1,038 subjects were requested to complete a questionnaire regarding hikikomori phenomenon.\nWhile some differences in the perception of hikikomori do exist, all subjects tended to disagree with the statement, \"hikikomori is NOT a disorder\". Regarding the underlying psychiatric disorders of hikikomori, approximately 30% of psychiatrists chose schizophrenia as the most applicable ICD-10 diagnosis for hikikomori, whereas 50% of pediatricians chose neurotic or stress-related disorders.\nAn argument still exists regarding the relationship between hikikomori and psychiatric disorders. We propose that the term hikikomori could be used to describe severe social withdrawal in the setting of a number of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "A computational approach to \"free will\" constrained by the games we play.", "Abstract": "Human choice is not free-we are bounded by a multitude of biological constraints. Yet, within the various landscapes we face, we do express choice, preference, and varying degrees of so-called willful behavior. Moreover, it appears that the capacity for choice in humans is variable. Empirical studies aimed at investigating the experience of \"free will\" will benefit from theoretical disciplines that constrain the language used to frame the relevant issues. The combination of game theory and computational reinforcement learning theory with empirical methods is already beginning to provide valuable insight into the biological variables underlying capacity for choice in humans and how things may go awry in individuals with brain disorders. These disciplines operate within abstract quantitative landscapes, but have successfully been applied to investigate strategic and adaptive human choice guided by formal notions of optimal behavior. Psychiatric illness is an extreme, but interesting arena for studying human capacity for choice. The experiences and behaviors of patients suggest these individuals fundamentally suffer from a diminished capacity of willful choice. Herein, I will briefly discuss recent applications of computationally guided approaches to human choice behavior and the underlying neurobiology. These approaches can be integrated into empirical investigation at multiple temporal scales of analysis including the growing body of experiments in human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and newly emerging sub-second electrochemical and electrophysiological measurements in the human brain. These cross-disciplinary approaches hold promise for revealing the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for the variety of choice capacity in humans."}, {"Title": "National hospice for the insane and the Brazilian Neurology in the beginning of the 20th century.", "Abstract": "The modern Brazilian Neurology was born in the campus of Praia Vermelha, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Among them, the work of J\u00fcrg Zutt (1893-1980), Professor of Psychiatry at University Hospital Frankfurt 1950-63, closely relates to the anthropological psychiatry of Ludwig Binswanger, Victor von Gebsattel and Erwin Straus. Since both anthropological psychiatry and social psychiatry are based on a person-centred approach, it was hypothesized that common roots are to be detected in what is called humanistic psychology. The main finding of the present paper is that there is a strong relationship between Zutt's concept of Comprehending Anthropology and the biopsychosocial model on which social psychiatry is based. However, it cannot be concluded from the existing evidence that the reform of psychiatric services necessarily resulted from the anthropological approach."}, {"Title": "R.D.

On one hand, Laing's mystical theology combined with psychoanalytic theory, to provide a New Age psychotherapeutic account of the recovery of authentic selfhood via metanoia. On the other, his incarnational, corporate theology promoted social inclusion of the mentally ill, particularly via therapeutic communities. For Laing, as for other post-war British Christians, a turn inwards, to mysticism and the sacralization of the self, and a turn outwards, to social and political activism, were ways of negotiating with the decline of traditional Christianity."}, {"Title": "Cadaver brains and excesses in Baccho and Venere: dementia paralytica in Dutch psychiatry (1870-1920).", "Abstract": "This article explores the approach of dementia paralytica by psychiatrists in the Netherlands between 1870 and 1920 against the background of international developments. The psychiatric interpretation of this mental and neurological disorder varied depending on the institutional and social context in which it was examined, treated, and discussed by physicians. Psychiatric diagnoses and understandings of this disease had in part a social-cultural basis and can be best explained against the backdrop of the establishment of psychiatry as a medical specialty and the specific efforts of Dutch psychiatrists to expand their professional domain. After addressing dementia paralytica as a disease and why it drew so much attention in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, this essay discusses how psychiatrists understood dementia paralytica in asylum practice in terms of diagnosis, care, and treatment. Next we consider their pathological-anatomical study of the physical causes of the disease and the public debate on its prevalence and causes."}, {"Title": "[Social conditions of suicides in Austria. An overview on risk and protective factors].", "Abstract": "Referring to the 'biopsychosocial' model of health first, the article deals with the relevance of social factors in letal suicidality, giving an overview upon recent research findings specific for the Austrian society. In the beginning, the sociodemographic 'basic variables' of gender, age, marital status, partnership and parenthood are treated: Older men must be seen as a high risk population for suicide here, and married persons still have the lowest relative suicide risks. Regarding social status a study for the region of Styria shows an U-shaped-pattern, the highest suicide rates being situated at the lower end of the occupational prestige scale, amongst factory and unskilled workers, but also within the category of farmers, which is rather heterogeneous in terms of the economic status of its members. Moreover, people without occupation show much higher suicide rates-compared to those, who were economically active, the risk of committing suicide was more than five times higher in the years 2000-2004. After these topics, the suicide-protective consequences of the extension of the supply systems regarding medicine, psychiatry, psychotherapy and psychosocial support, taking place since the late twentieth century, are discussed. Likewise long-term changes in town-village-differences of suicide rates in the context of 'postmodernisation' and the theme of multiple psychosocial problem situations as triggers for suicide are addressed."}, {"Title": "A spiritual problem?

The vulnerability of these disenfranchised biological citizens is multiplied through exposure to disproportional health risks compounded by exclusion from essential healthcare. The first-generation Korean Americans, who commonly work in small businesses, face the double burden of increased health risks from long, stress-laden work hours and lack of access to healthcare due to the prohibitive costs of health insurance for small business owners. Even as their health needs become critical, their insurance status and costly medical bills discourage them from visiting healthcare institutions, leaving Korean Americans outside the \"political economy of hope\" (Good, Cult Med Psychiatry 52:61-69, 2001).

A Rasch analysis produced a linear scale as to the perceived biasing potential of these different kinds of situations from the most biasing to the least biasing. Working for only one side in both civil and criminal cases had large scaled values and also were the first factor. In interesting contrast, a) an opposing expert also serving as the litigant's treater and b) an opposing expert being viewed as a \"hired gun\" (supplying an opinion only for money) were two situations viewed as not very biasing.

The work on FrAGe (an own self-descriptive tool) which asks about different emotion regulation strategies, has also been included in this research.\nThe investigation--which is a part of a wider project--was conducted in the Clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Bethel in Bielefeld, Germany. Subjects were 19 patients with diagnosis of BPD and 20 healthy people as a control group. Tools used in the diagnostic part of the research were: Mini--DIPS, SKID II. In order to verify the hypothesis were used: 1. to assess emotion regulation: FrAGe, ERQ, DERS, 2. to assess EI: MSCEIT, TEMINT; 3. for the assessment of general intelligence: LPS--K.\nBPD patients reported severe impairments in emotion regulation--there are significant differences between groups in frequency of using the individual strategies of emotional regulation, negative and positive as well--but did not exhibit impairments of ability EI. The results do not prove the dependence between emotion regulation strategies and the global value of EI.\nEmotional dysfunction in BPD might affect a self perceived behaviour of the patients rather than their abilities: patients seems to possess a sufficient theoretical knowledge about functioning in the emotional context."}, {"Title": "[Clinical analysis of safety and effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy.\n43 patients included into the study were hospitalised in The Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology and received all together over 400 bilateral electroconvulsive procedures.

First, stock is taken of what the field has achieved so far, using tools from the prevention science literature, and, second, a research plan of action is offered that plays to the unique strengths of public health, drawing on a triggers-to-action framework from public health law. Minimal participation was found from public health professionals in eating disorders prevention research, and the vast majority of prevention research to date was found to be concentrated within the disciplines of psychology and psychiatry. Extreme disciplinary concentration of the research has led to a preponderance of individually targeted prevention strategies with little research focused on environmental targets, particularly at the macro level. New environmental initiatives are now emerging, such as a government-sponsored mass media anti-dieting campaign, and legal bans on extremely thin models in advertising, but for the most part, they have yet to be evaluated. A triggers-to-action framework, which focuses on evidentiary base, practical considerations, and political will, developed in public health law provides a basis for a strategic research plan for a public health approach to eating disorders prevention.\nThere is enormous potential for growth in the scope and diversity of eating disorder prevention research strategies, particularly those targeting the macro environment. A public health approach will require a strategic plan for research that leverages the macro environment for prevention.

The literature suggests that forensic patients tend to be left behind by the overall psychiatric reforms in developed countries. The recent law reform on forensic mental health in Japan is intended to be compatible with the contemporary ideas of psychiatry, such as normalization and community-based care. The primary objective of the new legislation is to provide intensive psychiatric treatment to offenders with mental disorders, attaching great importance to their re-integration into society.

For example, methodologically rigorous meta-analyses have recently found only modest overall effect sizes of CBT treatment, and therefore questions have emerged about forwhat and for whom it actually works.\nThe focus of the present paper is to elucidate the theoretical assumptions underlying CBT for schizophrenia and to examine their consistency with abnormalities of experience and self-awareness frequently reported by schizophrenia patients and systematically studied in phenomenological psychopathology from the beginning of the 20th century.\nWe argue that a strong theoretical emphasis on cognitive appraisals with only subsidiary attention devoted to affective and behavioral processes - as is characteristic of many forms of CBT - cannot satisfactorily account for the complex subjective experiences of schizophrenia patients. We further argue that certain theoretical strategies widely employed in CBT to explore and explain mental disorders, which involve atomization and, at times, a reification of mental phenomena, can be problematic and may result in a loss of explanatory potential. Finally, we provide a detailed account of how negative symptoms and delusions are conceptualized in CBT and consider the question of how these concepts fit the actual phenomenology of schizophrenia.\nWe suggest that further advancement of CBT theory and practice can benefit from a dialogue with phenomenological psychiatry in the search for effective psychotherapeutic strategies for schizophrenia patients."}, {"Title": "Psychotic disorder due to traumatic brain injury: analysis of case studies in the literature.", "Abstract": "The present study utilized methodology from a previous descriptive study that analyzed case studies of psychotic disorder due to traumatic brain injury (PD-TBI) reported in psychiatry and neurology journals.

His investigations into undisclosed physician-industry ties culminated in the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (PPSA), which will make drug and device companies' payments to physicians a matter of public record. Yet it is unclear whether PPSA will resolve the problems that Grassley's campaign for it revealed.\nWe analyzed five signal cases, all involving psychiatrists, that Grassley presented to the U.S. Senate as examples of why PPSA was needed. We sought to determine the impact of the information Grassley brought to light on the physicians who failed to report their industry ties and on the medical institutions responsible for overseeing their conduct. Despite the clarity of the violations and the powerful actors and institutions involved, the consequences of exposure were slow to materialize and limited in their impact.\nOur findings demonstrate both the need for transparency and its limitations. The medical profession and the government should use the PPSA data to verify disclosures, but they must also implement stronger conflict of interest policies to help ensure that physicians' industry ties, however transparent, do not compromise scientific integrity or patient care."}, {"Title": "Lamotrigine in epilepsy, pregnancy and psychiatry--a drug for all seasons?", "Abstract": "Lamotrigine has been demonstrated to be effective as both an antiepileptic drug and a mood stabiliser. For epilepsy it is less efficacious than valproate in primary generalised epilepsy, but it is comparable to some traditional drugs in partial epilepsy. In psychiatry it has significant advantages over other mood stabilisers for the treatment and prevention of depressive phases of bipolar illness, but not for the treatment of mania. It has a more benign adverse effect profile than older antiepileptic agents and is not a proven teratogen. Risk of adverse reactions is reduced by commencing treatment at a markedly reduced dose that is gradually increased."}, {"Title": "Role of pain medications, consultants, and other services in improved pain control of elderly adults with cancer in geriatric evaluation and management units.", "Abstract": "To determine whether pain medication use and inpatient consultations and services were associated with significantly better pain control.\nSecondary data analysis from a randomized two-by-two factorial trial.

Participants in GEMU care received psychiatry, endocrinology, and psychology consultations 12.7% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004), 9.1% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and 21.8% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05) times more, respectively, and occupational and physical therapy 27.3% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) and 18.2% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) more, respectively. There were no significant differences in pain medication use between intervention and usual care.\nSignificantly greater use of psychology, psychiatry, physical and occupational therapy in the GEMU participants may have improved the effectiveness of pain management in individuals in inpatient GEMUs. Although analgesic use was not significantly different between the GEMU and usual care groups, small sample size may have limited the ability to detect these differences."}, {"Title": "[Susmann Galant (1896-1978).

These activities include the works of intellectual scholars, such as disgruntled psychiatrists, critical social scientists, and humanistic psychologists; the analyses and writings of high-profile and prominent investigative journalists; blogs, Web sites, and social media that communicate a disdain for psychiatry among citizen Internet activists; and the ongoing, well-documented critique of followers of Scientology.

Having eliminated the death penalty as a punishment, the Court recently struck down mandatory life sentences without prospect of parole. The decision is interesting for its emphasis on rehabilitation, opening the door to further restrictions on punitive sentences for juveniles-and perhaps for adults too."}, {"Title": "Electronic symptom reporting between patient and provider for improved health care service quality: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. part 1: state of the art.", "Abstract": "Over the last two decades, the number of studies on electronic symptom reporting has increased greatly. However, the field is very heterogeneous: the choices of patient groups, health service innovations, and research targets seem to involve a broad range of foci. To move the field forward, it is necessary to build on work that has been done and direct further research to the areas holding most promise. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on electronic communication between patient and provider to improve health care service quality, presented in two parts. Part 2 investigates the methodological quality and effects of the RCTs, and demonstrates some promising benefits of electronic symptom reporting.\nTo give a comprehensive overview of the most mature part of this emerging field regarding (1) patient groups, (2) health service innovations, and (3) research targets relevant to electronic symptom reporting.\nWe searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and IEEE Xplore for original studies presented in English-language articles published from 1990 to November 2011. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of interventions where patients or parents reported health information electronically to the health care system for health care purposes and were given feedback.\nOf 642 records identified, we included 32 articles representing 29 studies. The included articles were published from 2002, with 24 published during the last 5 years. The following five patient groups were represented: respiratory and lung diseases (12 studies), cancer (6), psychiatry (6), cardiovascular (3), and diabetes (1). In addition to these, 1 study had a mix of three groups. All included studies, except 1, focused on long-term conditions. We identified four categories of health service innovations: consultation support (7 studies), monitoring with clinician support (12), self-management with clinician support (9), and therapy (1). Most of the research (21/29, 72%) was conducted within four combinations: consultation support innovation in the cancer group (5/29, 17%), monitoring innovation in the respiratory and lung diseases group (8/29, 28%), and self-management innovations in psychiatry (4/29, 14%) and in the respiratory and lung diseases group (4/29, 14%). Research targets in the consultation support studies focused on increased patient centeredness, while monitoring and self-management mainly aimed at documenting health benefits. All except 1 study aiming for reduced health care costs were in the monitoring group.\nRCT-based research on electronic symptom reporting has developed enormously since 2002. Research including additional patient groups or new combinations of patient groups with the four identified health service innovations can be expected in the near future. We suggest that developing a generic model (not diagnosis specific) for electronic patient symptom reporting for long-term conditions may benefit the field."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of UK psychiatrists to the diagnosis of MCI in clinical practice.", "Abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may represent a transitional stage between normal functioning and dementia. Following the initial criteria developed by Petersen et al. in 1999, which focused on memory deficit in the context of otherwise normal cognition and general functioning, the concept has evolved with the introduction of subtypes of MCI and improved understanding of etiology. Our aim was to investigate current practice as well as familiarity with and attitudes toward the concept of MCI amongst UK old age psychiatrists.\nWe sent an anonymized postal survey to all clinicians on the Royal College of Psychiatrists Old Age Psychiatry register. Questions covered attitudes toward the concept of MCI in addition to diagnostic criteria and assessment tools used.\nThe response rate was 39% (453 of 1,154 questionnaires returned completed). The majority of respondents were consultants (83%) and 91% diagnosed MCI. Only 4.4% of the respondents thought that the concept of MCI was not useful and 79% of them required a memory complaint from either the patient or an informant for a diagnosis, but the majority did not have a specific cut-off on cognitive testing. Eighty-two percent reported that they required no or minimal impairment in activities of daily living for a diagnosis of MCI. The two most frequently used tools for assessment were the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised.\nOur survey shows that in the United Kingdom, the term MCI has become part of everyday clinical practice in psychiatry, suggesting that clinicians find it a useful term to conceptualize the transitional stage between normal aging and dementia.

Since then several negative findings were reported in relatively large samples. The aim of this study was to provide an update of the literature on the efficacy of rTMS for AVH and to investigate the effect of rTMS one month after the end of treatment.\nA literature search was performed from 1966 through August 2012 using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Embase Psychiatry, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO and PubMed. Randomized, double blind, sham-controlled studies with severity of AVH or severity of psychosis as an outcome measure were included.\nData were obtained from 17 randomized studies of rTMS for AVH. Five studies fulfilled the criteria for the meta-analysis on the effect of rTMS one month after the end of treatment.\nStandardized mean weighted effect sizes of rTMS versus sham were computed on pre- and posttreatment comparisons.\nThe mean weighted effect size of rTMS directed at the left temporoparietal area was 0.44 (95% CI 0.19-0.68). A separate meta-analysis including studies directing rTMS at other brain regions revealed a mean weighted effect size of 0.33 (95% CI 0.17-0.50) in favor of real TMS. The effect of rTMS was no longer significant at one month of follow-up (mean weighted effect size=0.40, 95% CI -0.23-0.102). Side effects were mild and the number of dropouts in the real TMS group was not significantly higher than in the sham group.\nWith the inclusion of studies with larger patient samples, the mean weighted effect size of rTMS directed at the left temporoparietal area for AVH has decreased, although the effect is still significant. The duration of the effect of rTMS may be less than one month.

The psychiatry of dying is not a prominent component in the assessment of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in jurisdictions with liberalised assisted dying laws. The literature on the assessment processes, with particular reference to mental status, involved in euthanasia requests is considered.\nAn experienced palliative medicine specialist and psychiatrist selectively reviewed the recent literature published about the mental health issues involved in euthanasia and PAS.\nAssessments of competency, sustained wish to die prematurely, depressive disorder, demoralisation and 'unbearable suffering' in the terminally ill are clinically uncertain and difficult tasks. There is a growing psychiatric and psychological literature on the mental status of the terminally ill. As yet psychiatry does not have the expertise to 'select' those whose wish for hastened death is rational, humane and 'healthy'. Rarely in those societies with liberalised assisted dying laws are psychiatrists involved in the decision-making for individuals requesting early death. This role is fulfilled by non-specialists.\nThere remain significant concerns about the accuracy of psychiatric assessment in the terminally ill. Mental processes are more relevant influences on a hastened wish to die than are the physical symptoms of terminal malignant disease. Psychiatric review of persons requesting euthanasia is relevant.

For these (and other) reasons, increasing numbers of psychiatrists are turning to genotyping for help in selecting the psychopharmacologic agents best suited to an individual patient's distinctive metabolic characteristics and clinical presentation. Fortunately, routine genotyping is already available for gene variations that code for proteins involved in neurotransmission, and for drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the elimination of many medications. Thus, genotyping-based personalized psychiatry is now in sight. Increasing numbers of clinically useful DNA microarrays are in the development stage, including a simplified procedure for genotyping patients for CYP2D6, which metabolizes a high proportion of the currently prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics. It has been pointed out that psychiatric disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of complex intracellular networks in the brain. Thus, analysis of functional neuronal networks is becoming an essential component of drug development strategies. The integrated use of technologies such as electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in combination with pharmacogenetics, promises to transform our understanding of the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. The concept of network medicine envisions a time to come when drugs will be used to target a neural network rather than simply components within the network.

Although a few proposals have been put forth, there is a need for empirical validation if they are to be adopted. Using data from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), we tested a previously elaborated hypothesis on the utility of using the number of previous episodes as a relevant prognostic variable for staging in bipolar disorder.\nThis report utilizes data from the multisite, prospective, open-label study 'Standard Care Pathways' and the subset of patients with acute depressive episodes who participated in the randomized trial of adjunctive antidepressant treatment. Outpatients meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder (n = 3345) were included. For the randomized pathway, patients met criteria for an acute depressive episode (n = 376). The number of previous episodes was categorized as less than 5, 5-10 and more than 10. We used disability at baseline, number of days well in the first year and longitudinal scores of depressive and manic symptoms, quality of life and functioning as validators of models constructed a priori.\nPatients with multiple previous episodes had consistently poorer cross-sectional and prospective outcomes. Functioning and quality of life were worse, disability more common, and symptoms more chronic and severe. There was no significant effect for staging with regard to antidepressant response in the randomized trial.\nThese findings confirm that bipolar disorder can be staged with prognostic validity.

Our aim was to consider the areas where this commonly occurs and the strengths and pitfalls of such promotion.\nForensic psychiatrists need to be effective, accurate communicators. For court work, they need special training. High standards of work are the best selling technique. Outside court, the greatest challenge for forensic psychiatry is to reduce its stigma - it can easily be construed, wrongly, as excusing serious anti-social behaviour. Special attention should be given to writing for a wider audience, not just the inner circle of practitioners. Electronic social media should also be deployed for this task. Those who provide funds for academic work should be specifically but differently targeted. They need to be persuaded of the scientific merit of the subject.\nTemptation to claim more for the discipline than can be justified have to be resisted. An English case that led to a miscarriage of justice illustrates this. The limitations of science here have to be understood. Philosophical questions relating to responsibility and culpability cannot be resolved by physical science alone. Misuse neuroimaging in court, for example, can lead to miscarriages of justice.\nSelling forensic psychiatry to public and professionals is difficult but essential to counter anti-forensic psychiatry movements that have emerged.

This dichotomy arose as training pathways diverged historically, legal medicine being the older discipline. In this system, the courts are always assured of an independent medical opinion, although treating psychiatrists would generally advise on release decisions.

The overall percentage of correct diagnoses was 55.4%. There were no significant differences in correct diagnosis rates between psychiatry and general medical doctors. There was poor inter-rater agreement (Kappa = 0.159). Neither group was particularly confident in reaching a diagnosis, and diverse reasons underpinned the diagnoses given.\nAmong the participants, merely observing an epileptic or non-epileptic event is insufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Such was the atmosphere of society during this period that the ideas and notions regarding HD disseminated by the respected medical profession were believed and accepted as fact by the general population and other professions, who would have been ignorant of any other contrary information.

Several abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex have been demonstrated in major depressive disorders; however, only a small number of quantitative studies have been conducted, partly because the stereological techniques often used for such investigations are hampered by intrinsically low throughput, typically requiring long periods of time to complete. Recently, we developed a quantitative cell-counting method for frozen unfixed postmortem brains using a flow cytometer. Anisotropic frozen brain tissue was transformed into an isotropic suspension of nuclei; the numbers and fluorescent intensities of 7-AAD(+), a DNA marker, were quantified; and the nuclei were immunolabeled for the neuronal and oligodendroglial nuclear markers, NeuN and olig2, respectively. Using this method, the frontopolar and inferior temporal cortical gray matter of major depressive disorder patients, as well as that of normal controls, was analyzed. We found that the densities of 7-AAD(+) and olig2(+) nuclei in the gray matter tissue of the frontopolar cortex from major depressive disorder subjects were significantly reduced when compared to those from controls, but not in the inferior temporal cortex. Our findings suggest that the pathogenesis of major depressive disorders may involve some abnormalities in cortical myelination in the adult frontopolar cortex."}, {"Title": "[The difference between depression and melancholia: two distinct conditions that were combined into a single category in DSM-III].", "Abstract": "In DSM-III (1980), depressive states of neurosis and those of manic-depressive illness (melancholia or endogenous depression) were combined into the single category \"major depression,\" which is the progenitor of \"major depressive disorder\" in DSM-IV-TR (2000). According to Hamilton, the word \"depression\" is used in three different ways. In common speech, it is used to describe the state of sadness that all persons experience when they lose something of importance to them. In psychiatry, the word is used to signify an abnormal mood, analogous to the sadness, unhappiness, and misery of everyday experiences. Moreover, the depression discussed in psychiatry often has another quality that makes it distinctive, and this quality appears to be related to an inability to experience any pleasure (anhedonia) regardless of experience. Accordingly, we classify these three uses of the term \"depression\" into sadness, depression, and melancholia in order of appearance within this paper. According to DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depressive disorder, depression corresponds closely to A1 \"depressed mood\", while melancholia is roughly compatible with A2 \"markedly diminished interest or pleasure.\" Depression and melancholia differ in terms of origin, psychopathology, and therapy. Before DSM-III, depression had not been considered as a diagnosis, but was a ubiquitous symptom that was seen in such conditions as neurasthenia, psychasthenia, nervousness, and neurosis. Melancholia has a history that reaches back to Hippocratic times. Its modern meaning was established based on Kraepelin's manic-depressive illness. Depression is a deepened or prolonged sadness in everyday life, but melancholia has a distinct quality of mood that cannot be interpreted as severe depression. In modern times, depression has been treated with a diverse range of methods, including rest, talk therapy, amphetamines (1930s), meprobamate (1950s), and benzodiazepines (1970s). Melancholia has primarily been treated with somatic therapy, such as electroconvulsive therapy, and tricyclic antidepressants. When preparing diagnostic criteria for DSM-III, Spitzer referred not to DSM-II but to Feighner's (1972) criteria as a model because Feighner's operational criteria were considered to be effective in establishing inter-rater reliability. At the outset, Spitzer established Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC, 1975), which he revised in 1978. In the first edition of RDC, Spitzer adopted most of the Feighner criteria, including essential criteria A \"dysphoric mood\" and eight optional criteria (B1-B8). However, he reduced the minimal morbid duration for diagnosis. Moreover, for the purpose of excluding neurosis from the diagnostic criteria, Spitzer eliminated the distinction between primary and secondary depression, which had been used to differentiate melancholia from depression. In the revised RDC, Spitzer upgraded optional criteria B5 \"loss of pleasure or interest\" to one of the essential criteria A with \"dysphoric mood.\" This revision reflects the fact that \"loss of pleasure or interest\" has been designated as an essential feature of Klein's concept of \"endogenomorphic depression\" (1974), which is equivalent to melancholia or endogenous depression. At that time, depression and melancholia were completely amalgamated into a single category. DSM-III followed almost all of the revisions in the revised RDC and accepted the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy. However, Klein's endogenomorphic depression was downgraded to the specifier \"with melancholia\", which has been used only rarely. Thus, as depression and melancholia were fused into major depressive disorder, we have only limited evidence of the efficacy of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. DSM-IV divided major depression into major depressive disorder and bipolar II disorder. Consequently, some depression and some melancholia were moved from unipolar depression to bipolar disorder, although the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy was proposed for manic-depressive illness and recurrent unipolar melancholia, but not depression. Therefore, we suspect that we will not obtain strong therapeutic evidence for bipolar II disorder as well. Our proposals are as follows: give up the unitarian view of depression and melancholia and accept the binarian view; and restrict the bipolar-unipolar dichotomy to manic-depressive illness and unipolar melancholia."}, {"Title": "Talking science and wishing for miracles: understanding cultures of mental health practice.", "Abstract": "Science can only offer a limited account of, and prescription for, mental health care. Yet the language of science and faith in the universal applicability of particular scientific methods to the craft of mental health care has come to permeate mental health practice communities. In this paper, the argument that many beliefs held by mental health professionals might be considered to be based on faith rather than science is presented, and the view that culture provides a useful lens for understanding mental health services and these paradoxes is proposed. Clearly there is a grand mental health narrative or colonizing influence of biological psychiatry that in various ways affects all mainstream mental health services. Local health services and professional communities might be considered subcultures. Understanding how mental health professions and practice are embedded in culture might be useful in considering how practice changes and why. Culture and caring practices are mutually embedded in localized subcultures. Therefore, a rich description of context and history is necessary in publication, presentation, or other communications to enable genuine understanding by a global audience. Viewing mental health practice in a cultural context highlights the importance of values and differences, and encourages humility in the face of ambiguity."}, {"Title": "Reflective practice groups for nurses: a consultation liaison psychiatry nursing initiative: part 1--The model.", "Abstract": "In the present study, we outline the evolution of a process-focused reflective practice group (RPG) model for nurses working in clinical settings. The groups were initiated at Redcliffe and Caboolture hospitals by the consultation liaison psychiatry nurse and author. An associated article provides an evaluation of these RPG. The literature review identifies the key themes and theories on which the model is based, and the article outlines the process and practicalities of facilitating RPG in critical care, midwifery, and oncology specialties over a 3-year period. The model proposes that the effectiveness and sustainability of RPG arises from adequate preparation and engagement with prospective participants. Group rules, based on principles of confidentially, supportiveness, and diversity, were collaboratively developed for each group. Facilitation utilized a group-as-a-whole approach to manage process and stimulate reflection. While the purpose of RPG was a reflection on interpersonal aspects of nursing, contextual workplace issues were frequently raised in groups. Acknowledgement and containment of such issues were necessary to maintain clinical focus. The literature highlights facilitator credibility and style as crucial factors in the overall success of RPG, and it is proposed that reflective practice as a process-focused model for groups succeeds when nurse facilitators are trained in group process and receive concurrent supervision."}, {"Title": "The role of communities in advancing the goals of the Movement for Global Mental Health.", "Abstract": "This special section of Transcultural Psychiatry explores the local-global spaces of engagement being opened up by the Movement for Global Mental Health, with particular emphasis on the need for expanded engagement with local communities. Currently the Movement places its main emphasis on scaling up mental health services and advocating for the rights of the mentally ill, framed within universalised western understandings of health, healing and personhood. The papers in this section emphasise the need for greater attention to the impacts of context, culture and local survival strategies on peoples' responses to adversity and illness, greater acknowledgement of the agency and resilience of vulnerable communities and increased attention to the way in which power inequalities and social injustices frame peoples' opportunities for mental health. In this Introduction, we highlight ways in which greater community involvement opens up possibilities for tackling each of these challenges. Drawing on community health psychology, we outline our conceptualisation of \"community mental health competence\" defined as the ability of community members to work collectively to facilitate more effective prevention, care, treatment and advocacy. We highlight the roles of multi-level dialogue, critical thinking and partnerships in facilitating both the \"voice\" of vulnerable communities as well as \"receptive social environments\" where powerful groups are willing to recognise communities' needs and assist them in working for improved well-being. Respectful local-global alliances have a key role to play in this process.

Psychiatry has become rich in methodology but conceptually limited, with a drift toward biological reductionism. Psychoanalysis has remained relatively limited in methodology, but conceptually rich. The rich methodology of psychiatry has led to major contributions in discovering gene by environment interactions, the importance of early adversity, and to recognition of the serious problem posed by treatment resistance. However, psychiatry's biologically reductionistic conceptual focus interferes with the development of a nuanced clinical perspective based on emerging knowledge that might help more treatment resistant patients become treatment responders. This article argues that recognition of the problem of treatment resistance in psychiatry creates a need for it to reconnect with the conceptual richness of psychoanalysis in order to improve patient care. Psychodynamic psychiatry is defined as the relevant intersection of psychiatry and psychoanalysis where this reconnection can occur. I will suggest selected aspects of psychoanalysis that are especially relevant to psychiatry in improving outcomes in work with treatment resistant patients."}, {"Title": "Disorder in the domain of the personality disorders.", "Abstract": "In contrast to medical conditions like cancer, pneumonia, and nephritis--all unequivocally diseases, application of the medical model to the domain of personality disorders is necessarily controversial. Everyone has a personality. The dividing lines between peculiarities and quirks, occasional outbursts under stress, persistent abnormalities of a mild sort, and chronic disorders with severe consequences for self and others--cannot readily be drawn, certainly not to universal agreement. Even where there is widespread acceptance about criteria for a particular disorder, one cannot speak prescriptively about its \"ideal\" treatment. The current diagnostic manual in psychiatry (DSM-IV) will soon be replaced by DSM-V. Some of the deficiencies and ambiguities of the last edition will be corrected; new ones will appear. There will always be some disagreement, in effect--some \"disorder\" in the domain of personality disorders. In this article some of the more pervasive problem areas are outlined. Among them: the continuum between personality oddity, outright personality disorder, and the more disease-like symptom-disorder pertinent to almost all the currently recognized Axis II disorders. Also: the effects of culture on what is-or is not-recognized as a valid disorder of personality, the inherent complexities in the personality domain (which require attention to dimensional as well as category-based concepts), the overlap among the various categories, the tendency (especially in forensic work) toward diagnostic oversimplification (as though all narcissists or borderlines are alike), the interactions of genetic, prenatal, and environmental factors, and lastly, the importance of traits-including the often neglected positive traits modifying any given disorder.

The complex and intense transference and countertransference dynamics that patients with even \"secondary\" BPD evoke in psychotherapy treatments require careful handling and supervision. Cases can quickly lose focus, with resultant morbidity for both patient and treater alike. Little literature exists to guide supervision of psychiatry trainees treating outpatients with BPD and Axis I illness. We describe a case of a young woman with BPD with a comorbid major depressive episode (MDE) who was treated by a third-year psychiatry resident with a mixture of supportive and dynamic psychotherapy and medication management. The treatment rapidly became chaotic, with escalating levels of patient acting out and resident dissatisfaction. We outline suggestions for supervision of resident treatment of patients with comorbid or primary BPD, including importance of careful intake assessment and treatment formulation, the establishment of a clear-cut frame and/or treatment contract, and the need for contextualizing expectable transference and countertransference reactions.

Residents often lack formal guidance in this role, as there exists limited examination of clinical scenarios from a psychodynamic perspective. The authors present a historical review of the literature on countertransference with the medically ill and describe a clinical vignette illustrating the vicissitudes of liaison work. The case involves a psychotic patient with mental retardation and acute renal failure. Through refusal of care and a tumultuous clinical course, this patient elicited various countertransferential reactions from the primary care and CL teams, in turn adversely impacting treatment. The case illustrates how clinicians' failure to collaborate led to hospital administrators having to take on the liaison role. (1) A review of literature corroborates the importance of CL psychiatrists' assistance in the management of countertransference. At the same time, it is notable for a paucity of guidance in teaching these skills to psychiatry trainees. The psychiatry resident-in-training faces challenges and shortcomings in the management of countertransference. Formal training in this aspect of psychiatric consultation is lacking, as evidenced by extant publications.

Treating CD is a challenge in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. The use of drugs for this indication is broad despite the lack of systematic knowledge on this subject.\nThis paper aims to review research data available on the efficacy of the different medication classes and agents for CD and to specify the considerations that should be taken accordingly.\nTrials on the pharmacotherapy of CD in children and adolescents are reviewed from the PubMed database (dated from 1980 until today).\nTrials of antipsychotics, lithium, anti-epileptics, stimulants, alfa-2 agonists and beta-blockers were found. The use of typical antipsychotics is accompanied by major side-effects. Research on risperidone, the most investigated agent, shows it to be effective. Limited research with positive results is also available on quetiapine, olanzapine and aripiprazole. Trials of lithium yield contradictory results. Few trials with valproate suggest it to be effective for this indication. There is evidence showing the efficacy of stimulants but substance abuse is a potential risk in this population. The results for other agents are very few.\nThere are few well controlled studies of the pharmacotherapy of conduct disorder in children and adolescents. The most proven efficacy is for the atypical antipsychotics. Valproate or lithium may be possible second or third alternatives, based on some supporting evidence. When Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is diagnosed, stimulant use should be considered.

This modernisation of sexuality was closely linked to the recognition of sexual diversity, as it was articulated in the medical-psychiatric understanding of what, at that time, was labelled as perversion. From around 1870, psychiatrists shifted the focus from immoral acts, a temporary deviation of the norm, to an innate morbid condition. In the late nineteenth century, several psychiatrists, collecting and publishing more and more case histories, classified and explained the wide range of deviant sexual behaviours they traced. The emergence of medical sexology meant that perversions could be diagnosed and discussed. Against this background both Krafft-Ebing and Moll articulated a new perspective, not only on perversion, but also on sexuality in general. Krafft-Ebing initiated and Moll elaborated a shift from a psychiatric perspective in which deviant sexuality was explained as a derived, episodic and more or less singular symptom of a more fundamental mental disorder, to a consideration of perversion as an integral part of a more general, autonomous and continuous sexual instinct. Before Sigmund Freud and others had expressed similar views, it was primarily through the writings of Krafft-Ebing and Moll that a new understanding of human sexuality emerged."}, {"Title": "The psychiatric interview: validity, structure, and subjectivity.", "Abstract": "There is a glaring gap in the psychiatric literature concerning the nature of psychiatric symptoms and signs, and a corresponding lack of epistemological discussion of psycho-diagnostic interviewing. Contemporary clinical neuroscience heavily relies on the use of fully structured interviews that are historically rooted in logical positivism and behaviorism. These theoretical approaches marked decisively the so-called \"operational revolution in psychiatry\" leading to the creation of DSM-III. This paper attempts to examine the theoretical assumptions that underlie the use of a fully structured psychiatric interview. We address the ontological status of pathological experience, the notions of symptom, sign, prototype and Gestalt, and the necessary second-person processes which are involved in converting the patient's experience (originally lived in the first-person perspective) into an \"objective\" (third person), actionable format, used for classification, treatment, and research. Our central thesis is that psychiatry targets the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like objects. We claim that in order to perform faithful distinctions in this particular domain, we need a more adequate approach, that is, an approach that is guided by phenomenologically informed considerations. Our theoretical discussion draws upon clinical examples derived from structured and semi-structured interviews. We conclude that fully structured interview is neither theoretically adequate nor practically valid in obtaining psycho-diagnostic information.

In some cases, particularly in psychiatry, it is unclear how the criteria ought to be interpreted and applied by clinicians. In this paper, I argue that this uncertainty arises because the concept of capacity employed in the Act, and the diagnostic tools developed to assist its assessment, overlook the inherent normativity of judgements made about whether a person is using or weighing information in the decision-making process. Patients may fail on this criterion to the extent that they do not appear to be handling the information given in an appropriate way, on account of a mental impairment disrupting the way the decision process ought to proceed. Using case law and clinical examples, I describe some of the normative dimensions along which judgements of incapacity can be made, namely epistemic, evaluative and affective dimensions. Such judgements are complex and the normative standards by which a clinician may determine capacity cannot be reduced to a set of criteria. Rather, in recognizing this normativity, clinicians may better understand how clinical judgements are structured and what kinds of assumption may inform their assessment."}, {"Title": "The application of Cartwright's concept of capacities to complex interventions in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Cartwright and Munro argued that extrapolation of findings from randomized controlled trials to other settings can be difficult because information about the underlying causal structure and subgroups is often not available. They advocated the use of 'capacities' - that is fixed causal contributions - in predicting effects of interventions. In psychiatry, it is often not possible to determine what the fixed causal contributions are and one can only establish 'approximate capacities'. However, using 'approximate capacities' does imply a different way of evaluating health services, especially combined interventions. In health service research, if different studies, randomized controlled trials or other designs, have given different outcomes, the best way to investigate the effectiveness of a particular way of service organization is not to conduct more randomized controlled trials. It is preferable to study the effects of certain elements of the complex intervention, which have been tested before in other settings, that is investigating 'approximate capacities'. One should check whether the separate elements do form a part of the complex intervention in practice and whether they have the same effect as in other studies and if not, why not. This enhances knowledge about the underlying causal structure and increases the possibility of extrapolation of the findings."}, {"Title": "Values-based practice in mental health and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Values-based practice (VBP) challenges traditions of clinical practice and moral decision-making and the literature published over the last 18 months demonstrates a growing momentum for its use.\nThe VBP model has become part of the narrative of health and social care practice.

From a philosophical perspective the model faces several challenges; from a practice perspective it is welcomed as a necessary partner to Evidence-Based Practice. Both perspectives suggest VBP requires significant adjustment to professional ideas of good practice, expectations of the clinician service user relationship and notions of what constitutes good care.\nVBP is both a solution and a problem for clinicians. Whether VBP is seen as providing a much needed clinical skill for working with the complexity of mental health and psychiatry which is steeped in values or a solution to a dominant sociopolitical neoliberal ideology demand for choice and personalization of care, VBP will require clinicians to make personal changes to their values base that reach to the depths of their professional identity."}, {"Title": "History of social psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The overview focuses on publications relating to the history of social psychiatry and the mental health movement, respectively.\nThe selected works show fundamental developments within psychiatry, which can be conceived in the broadest sense as sociomedical in nature. Main emphases are the criticism of large institutions, reform movements and antipsychiatric movements, the search for alternative therapeutic methods, and the question of the resocialization of the mentally ill. Furthermore, it is important to demonstrate the influences of other scientific disciplines.\nAlthough social psychiatric approaches can be discerned as early as in the 19th century, the focus of the works lies on the development of social psychiatry in the 20th century. Only from the 1950s onwards did social psychiatry establish itself as an integral part of psychiatric practice and later of research. Accordingly, the main focus of the studies is on the development after the Second World War, not least because processes that began at that time have not yet been concluded. Happily, a trend is apparent in this respect: the one-sided view of physicians and their actions is being increasingly complemented by further professional groups and is consequently broadened by important dimensions."}, {"Title": "History of psychiatry and its institutions.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this review is to highlight recent English-language literature on the history of psychiatric institutions. It considers work published since 2010, as well as a few important older articles that have not yet been reviewed in these pages.\nDevelopments in the last half of the 20th century suggest that psychiatric historiography might finally be able to put the mental asylum behind it. Deinstitutionalization and the diffusion of professional jurisdictions seem to have consigned institutional histories to the methodological dustbin. But these transformations have also opened new perspectives on the institutional history of psychiatry and its methodologies. This review reflects on some of the enduring historiographic potential and importance of evidence drawn from institutional settings.\nAs carceral narratives have begun to lose their paradigmatic status within psychiatric historiography, a much more nuanced picture of asylum culture is becoming visible. The history of psychiatric institutions remains an integral and productive part of psychiatric historiography."}, {"Title": "Brain stimulation in psychiatry: methods and magnets, patients and parameters.", "Abstract": "Electromagnetic brain stimulation is performed in various ways in psychiatric settings for the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders.\nTranscranial direct current stimulation is a comparatively simple procedure. The available results warrant optimism regarding the future of this therapeutic approach in psychiatry. Multicentre studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrate a moderate treatment effect in depression. Theta burst stimulation and deep brain repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation represent innovative promising developments. The invasiveness of deep brain stimulation still causes this method to be one of the last resorts, even though promising results in severely disordered patients have been published.\nIn our view, the field of brain stimulation will be rapidly moving forward in the near future and will establish itself as one more of the 'tools of the trade' in psychiatric therapeutic practice."}, {"Title": "Health and education: service providers in partnership to improve mental health.", "Abstract": "Children and adolescents from complex or disadvantaged backgrounds and multiple needs often are reluctant to seek help and this is particularly relevant in the context of mental health difficulties. Further, the complexity of the health system can be overwhelming to the family who are likely to be chaotic and less able to seek help. The current project piloted an integrated service delivery model involving a child psychiatry service and the department of education to promote access to mental health assessment and intervention to young people attending special education schools in Sydney, Australia.\nThe project allowed improved access to mental health services for a group of young people who would otherwise not have sought help through traditional referral pathways.

Here, we describe a 5-year trend in assaults and seclusions, stratified by gender, at Stikland Hospital, South Africa. A retrospective review of clinical records of patients admitted to the acute psychiatric admission wards at Stikland and involved in assault and secluded was undertaken between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Data on the number of patient and staff assaults as well as seclusions, gender, age, marital status, level of education, level of income, duration of hospital admission and primary psychiatric diagnosis were collected. Significantly (P < 0.01) more men than women engaged in patient assaults, while significantly (P < 0.01) more men were secluded than women. On a monthly basis, the number of gender-stratified patient assaults and seclusions significantly increased (P < 0.01) throughout the study period. In conclusion, we show here that gender had a significant effect on both patient assault and seclusion numbers, which increased towards the end of the study period. Monitoring of these events is therefore important to continuously improve quality of care."}, {"Title": "Position statement and guidelines on unmodified electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "In modern day psychiatric practice, it is assumed as a matter of fact that when electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is administered, it will be administered under anesthesia and with succinylcholine (or its equivalent) modification. Yet, as surveys indicate, there is considerable practice of unmodified ECT in developing countries and, to a small extent, in the developed world, as well.\nThis document examines historical and recent literature on the geographical practice, physiology, efficacy, and adverse effects of unmodified ECT. Particular attention is paid to musculoskeletal risks.\nAlthough almost all the research is of poor methodological quality, there is a good reason to accept that unmodified ECT is associated with a wide range of adverse consequences, important among which are musculoskeletal complications, pre-ECT anxiety, and post-ECT confusion. However, it appears from recent data that these risks are not as large as historically portrayed. Possibly explanations are suggested, with seizure modification using parenteral benzodiazepines as a special possibility.\nUnder exceptional circumstances, if ECT is strongly indicated and seizure modification with succinylcholine is not feasible, unmodified ECT, especially benzodiazepine-modified ECT, may be a viable option. A detailed set of recommendations for such use of unmodified ECT is proposed along with necessary checks and balances. This document has been approved by the Indian Psychatric Society, the Indian Association of Biological Psychiatry, and the Indian Association of Private Psychiatry (which commissioned the preparation of the document)."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric oncology: Cancer in mind.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial oncology is an upcoming area of interest, which deals with numerous psychiatric, psychological, and social aspects of malignancies. Psychiatric oncology relates to some of the common psychological and emotional problems encountered in persons with malignancy and their formal and informal caregivers. This oration will discuss the importance of this field of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry, with a focus on the research and practice in the Indian setting. This presentation will also share the findings and researches of the presenter. All these range from studies on cancer pain and palliative care, screening for psychiatric morbidity, quality of life, communication skills for health professionals in breaking bad news and handling difficult questions, and counseling. The findings on researches on somatization and illness behavior in cancer patients would highlight newer challenges in this field. Caregivers of persons with cancer are as important as the patient, but usually ignored. The stress, strain, burden, positive emotions, and coping in the context of care giving for persons with cancer are being increasingly realized. Professional caregivers should be aware of caregiver difficulties and support them through their ordeal. Lastly, the importance of dealing with staff stress and burnout among health professionals looking after families with cancer patients and survivors will be emphasized."}, {"Title": "Implications of the use of genetic tests in psychiatry, with a focus on major depressive disorder: a review.", "Abstract": "Advances in technology have enabled research to link many genetic markers to specific disease risk. This has led to the commercialization of genetic tests across a wide range of medical disorders. Public interest in one's own future health and an increasing desire for autonomy over one's health care have facilitated a large and growing market for such genetic tests to be sold direct to the consumer (DTC). Amidst a plethora of tests for a broad range of medical conditions, DTC genetic tests currently include a number of tests related to risk for various psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and also for prediction of individual response to psychotropic medication. Although a large number of studies show that there is strong public interest in genetic susceptibility testing for psychiatric disorders, little is known about the impact on individuals of receiving the results of genetic tests. Moreover, the low predictive power and uncertain clinical validity and utility of DTC genetic tests for psychiatric disorders have led to both controversy and difficulties of interpretation of results. This review summarizes the rationale for using genetic risk tests in psychiatry, as an intervention for protective cognitive and behavioral change, and to predict medication response, with a focus on MDD. Since genetic risk information has the potential to influence major life-changing health decisions, there is an imperative to ensure that there is an appropriate evidence base to support the use of such genetic tests."}, {"Title": "Extrapyramidal examinations in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Extrapyramidal signs include increased motor tone, changes in the amount and velocity of movement, and involuntary motor activity.

To facilitate implementation of these requirements, the ABPN convened a task force to prepare training materials for faculty and programs to guide them in the CSV process. This article reviews the specific requirements for the CSV experience within general residency programs, and briefly describes the recommendations of the task force for faculty training and program implementation.\nMaterials prepared by the ABPN Task Force include background information on the intent of the observed interview, a literature review on assessment methods, aids to train faculty in direct observation of clinical work, directions for effective feedback, notes regarding special issues for cross-cultural trainees, clarification of performance standards, and recommendations for structuring and conducting the assessments.\nRecommendations of the task force include the use of a variety of clinical settings for CSV assessments, flexibility in the duration of CSV interviews, use of formative and summative feedback after each CSV assessment, and frequent use of the CSV across all years of training. Formal faculty training is recommended to help establish performance parameters, increase interrater reliability, and improve the quality of feedback.\nThe implementation of the CSV process provides psychiatry training programs with an excellent opportunity to assess how interviewing skills are taught and evaluated. In the process, psychiatry educators have an opportunity to establish performance parameters that will guide the training of residents in patient interaction and evaluation."}, {"Title": "Talking about stigma towards mental health professionals with psychiatry trainees: a movie club approach.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry as a discipline is often perceived as 'different' by other medical professionals as much as by a common man. This perception of 'difference' may give rise to stigma both towards mental illness and to mental health professionals. Mental health professionals are thus both recipients of stigma and agents who can de-stigmatize psychiatry. A psychiatry movie club approach can be a very useful learning experience to understand various aspects of this stigmatization process.

This indicates that greater attention to one's bodily state may contribute to the development of intense negative emotions and anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that reactivity in the anterior insular cortex underlies the intensity of interoceptive awareness and anxiety. To elucidate this triadic mechanism, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and mediation analyses to examine the relationship between emotional disposition and activation in the anterior insular cortex while participants evaluated their own emotional and bodily states. Our results indicated that right anterior insular activation was positively correlated with individual levels of social anxiety and neuroticism and negatively correlated with agreeableness and extraversion. The results of the mediation analyses revealed that activity in the right anterior insula mediated the activity of neural correlates of interoceptive sensibility and social fear. Our findings suggest that attention to interoceptive sensation affects personality traits through how we feel emotion subjectively in various situations."}, {"Title": "Victims of bullying in the emergency department with behavioral issues.", "Abstract": "Bullying has become one of the most significant school problems experienced by our children.

Olanzapine treatment is associated with tolerability issues such as metabolic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, increase in blood glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol levels), extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS] (e.g. parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) and sedative adverse effects. Metabolic issues lead to some long-term consequences, which include cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and these complications cause high rates of mortality and morbidity among patients with severe mental illnesses. The expanded indications of olanzapine in psychiatry suggest a need to investigate whether there is a difference in the incidence and severity of adverse effects related to category diagnosis. Are the adverse effects expressed differently according to phenotype? Unfortunately, there are no reported studies that investigated these differences in adverse effects associated with olanzapine treatment in psychiatric patients with different phenotypes.\nThe aim of the present meta-analysis is to separately examine olanzapine-induced cardiometabolic adverse effects and EPS in patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders.\nA search of computerized literature databases PsycINFO (1967-2010), PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (1980-2010) and the clinicaltrials.gov website for randomized clinical trials was conducted. A manual search of reference lists of published review articles was carried out to gather further data.\nRandomized controlled trials were included in our study if (i) they assessed olanzapine adverse effects (metabolic or extrapyramidal) in adult patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders; and (ii) they administered oral olanzapine as monotherapy during study.\nTwo reviewers independently screened abstracts for choosing articles and one reviewer extracted relevant data on the basis of predetermined exclusion and inclusion criteria. It should be mentioned that for the affective disorders group we could only find articles related to bipolar disorder.\nThirty-three studies (4831 patients) that address olanzapine monotherapy treatment of adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were included in the analysis. The primary outcomes were metabolic adverse effects (changes in weight, blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels). The secondary outcomes of our study were assessing the incidence of some EPS (parkinsonism, akathisia and use of antiparkinson medication). The tolerability outcomes were calculated separately for the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder groups and were combined in a meta-analysis. Tolerability outcomes show that olanzapine contributes to weight gain and elevates blood triglycerides, glucose and total cholesterol levels in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. However, olanzapine treatment produced significantly more weight gain in schizophrenia patients than in bipolar disorder patients. In addition, increases in blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in the schizophrenia group compared with the bipolar disorder group, even though these differences were not statistically significant. Based on our results, the incidence of parkinsonism was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group than in the bipolar disorder group. Subgroup analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the influence of treatment duration, dose, industry sponsorship, age and sex ratio on tolerability outcome.\nOur results suggest that schizophrenia patients may be more vulnerable to olanzapine-induced weight gain. The findings may be explained by considering the fact that in addition to genetic disposition for metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia patients, they have an especially high incidence of lifestyle risk factors for CVD, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, stress and smoking. It might be that an antipsychotic induces severity of adverse effect according to the phenotype."}, {"Title": "Intervention to prevent child custody loss in mothers with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Depending on jurisdiction, time period studied, and specifics of the population, approximately 50 percent of mothers who suffer from schizophrenia lose custody of their children.

Any improvement brought about by these changes may be jeopardized unless the ICD-10, which is used by non-psychiatric clinicians and researchers worldwide, and the DSM resolve the differences in the definitions and diagnostic criteria of most disorders. Unless there is congruence between the two manuals, debate is therefore likely to continue in the literature as to which provider is best suited to direct the care for the person with dementia: primary care providers, psychiatric providers, or neurologists. The changes to the DSM-IV-TR have the potential to promote preventive measures and early diagnosis, provided that the stigma associated with mental illnesses can be mitigated. A common language among psychiatric and primary care APRNs, other clinicians, and researchers will enhance effective communication and improve dementia care."}, {"Title": "Religious and spiritual issues in DSM-5: matters of the mind and searching of the soul.", "Abstract": "Religion, spirituality, and psychiatric illnesses share a complex relationship in the realm of diagnosis. Historically, however, these three constructs have existed in a very peripheral place in the diagnostic taxonomy for psychiatry in the United States. Given the important role that spirituality and religion play for many people in the experiences of coping with health and illness, it seems odd that such important elements are in the margins of the powerful and commanding nosology of the DSM. Explanations for understanding the glaring absence are complex and impacted by some very powerful political and sociological forces, including contributory elements from within the mental health disciplines. This article invites the reader to explore salient issues in the emergence of a broader recognition of religion, spirituality and psychiatric diagnosis in the DSM-5."}, {"Title": "Difficult encounters with psychiatric patients: a South Texas Psychiatry practice-based research network (PBRN) study.", "Abstract": "To examine the prevalence of difficult psychiatrist-patient interactions of 20 psychiatrists in the South Texas Psychiatric practice-based research network, determine what characteristics were associated with \"difficult\" patients, and compare findings with previous studies in primary care.\nDuring a 2-month observational study, psychiatrists collected patient information on setting, demographics, diagnoses, and medications and rated the patients using the Difficult Doctor-Patient Relationship Questionnaire, which had previously been used and validated in the primary care setting.\nA total of 905 valid data cards were collected. Difficult patients were identified in 15% of the sample. Diagnoses of schizophrenia, alcohol/substance abuse, and personality disorder were associated with difficulty. Psychiatrists least burdened by difficult patients were older and in a solo practice and worked 51 to 55 hours per week.\nThis cross-sectional study demonstrates that psychiatrists encounter difficult patients at a rate (15%) similar to that of primary care physicians.

Whereas research was primarily driven by the premature view that negative environmental stimuli can trigger psychopathology in those subjects that are genetically predisposed, a closer look at the available data shows that G\u00d7E interactions are much more complex than initially thought. Here, we discuss G\u00d7E studies focussing on serotonin transporter (5-HTT, SERT, SLC6A4) gene variation in humans, monkeys, and rodents. Recent studies, across species, confirm the theorized 'for-better-and-for-worse' effect of low activity serotonin transporter genotypes. In addition, while 5-HTT\u00d7E interactions were thought to take place in early life, recent evidence illustrates that these interactions are also manifested in adulthood. Therefore, we discuss data based on 5-HTT\u00d7E interactions, and propose a model in which predictive adaptive responses (PARs), as shaped by early life 5-HTT\u00d7E interactions, shape responses to environmental challenges in later life, i.e. reflecting 5-HTT\u00d7E\u00d7E interactions."}, {"Title": "The most deadly disease of asylumdom: general paralysis of the insane and Scottish psychiatry, c.1840-1940.", "Abstract": "General paralysis of the insane (GPI) was one of the most devastating diseases observed in British psychiatry during the century after 1840, in terms of the high number and type of patients diagnosed, the severity of its symptoms and, above all, its utterly hopeless prognosis.

De-indentified data were transcribed and coded using the constant comparative method. Multiple themes emerged but only those related to responsibility and accountability are reported in this paper.\nOne tertiary Australian maternity hospital.\nMaternity care midwives, nurses (neonatal, mental health, bed managers) and doctors (obstetric, neontatology, anaesthetics, internal medicine, psychiatry).\nPrimary outcome measures were the perceptions of clinicians of maternity clinical handover.\nThe majority of participants did not automatically connect maternity handover with the transfer of responsibility and accountability. Once introduced to this concept, they agreed that it was one of the roles of clinical handover. They spoke of complete transfer, shared and ongoing responsibility and accountability. When clinicians had direct involvement or extensive clinical knowledge of the patient, blurring of transition of responsibility and accountability sometimes occurred. A lack of 'ownership' of a patient and their problems were seen to result in confusion about who was to address the clinical issues of the patient. Personal choice of ongoing responsibility and accountability past the handover communication were described. This enabled the off-going person to rectify an inadequate handover or assist in an emergency when duty clinicians were unavailable.\nThere is a clear lack of consensus about the transition of responsibility and accountability-this should be explicit at the handover. It is important that on each shift and new workplace environment clinicians agree upon primary role definitions, responsibilities and accountabilities for patients.

While the prevalence figures of mental disorders in Germany remained fairly constant over the last 15 years, utilization rates of healthcare services due to mental disorders increased by 70-80% including inpatient and outpatient services, sick leave cases and cases of early retirement due to mental disorders. Several challenges are currently evident for mental healthcare in Germany, ranging from interesting a sufficient number of medical students for this field of medicine, dealing with the yet unforeseeable consequences of a novel mental hospital remuneration system, better integration of services and remuneration providers, to elucidating the causes of the increasing utilization rates.

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare estimated that about 5-10% of the population is in need of psychiatric treatment, but only 3-4% seek psychiatric care. Among patients who receive psychiatric care, approximately 47% are treated with psychopharmacology, 13% are treated with psychotherapy and 40% receive both treatments. There are still challenges facing Swedish psychiatry: reduction in waiting times for psychiatric care, broader accessibility of evidence-based treatment methods for all groups of psychiatric patients both in rural and urban areas, and targeting the needs of immigrants and refugees. The allocation of resources to psychiatric research, and development of novel treatment methods are crucially needed. The Swedish government is strongly committed to decreasing the number of suicides, as there are approximately 1,400 individuals lost to suicide every year in a country with a population of around 10 million.

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Spanish journals, reference lists, national databases, and European and Spanish official documents to describe the current state of the MHCS in Spain. The main results were: (1) existence of great variability among the autonomous communities with respect to mental health resources and provision of care; (2) lack of national epidemiological information on mental disorders with the exception of substance use disorders and suicide, which comprise powerful longitudinal national data, (3) training in psychiatry is well established, although there is no specialism of child and adolescent psychiatry, and (4) a dramatic increase in scientific productivity in the last decade among research groups, in part due to the creation of the Spanish Mental Health Network, the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en el \u00c1rea de Salud Mental (CIBERSAM).

They highlight the figures with greater emphasis during these periods, as well as their contributions to the speciality, not forgetting the essential role of Ordens Hospitaleiras (Hospitallers Orders). The transition period for mental health is examined in the light of the socio-political conditions of that time. The authors then describe both the teaching of psychiatry, and the actual training program of that medical speciality in Portugal. In this regard, the authors address the on-going mental health policies and their consequences on the current situation on the ground. Aspects such as the prevalence of mental disorders in Portugal, the current status of training in psychiatry, the sub-specialities of psychiatry and allied professions, the main areas of research, workforce issues and human rights issues are also analysed.

It became the ideological and legislative basis for reforms. However, there are definite obstacles to structural reforms in psychiatry. They are unfavourable technical conditions in many psychiatric clinics, hypercentralization of psychiatric services, shortage of clinical psychologists and social workers in psychiatry, some difficulties in cooperation between psychiatric and general medical institutions. Economic difficulties in the transition period of Russia's social development prevent the overcoming of these problems.

A critical appraisal of national and local data.", "Abstract": "Thirty-four years have elapsed since the passing of the Italian Law 180, the reform law that marked the transition from a hospital-based system of care to a model of community psychiatry that was designed to be an alternative to, rather than to complement, the old hospital-centred services. The main principle of Law 180 is that psychiatric patients have the right to be treated the same way as patients with other diseases and only voluntary treatments are allowed, with a few exceptions that are strictly regulated. The main features and consequences of the Italian reform are initially reviewed; national and local level experiences and epidemiological data are then analysed in order to highlight and disentangle the 'active ingredients' of the Italian experience. A public health attitude with the capacity to network good practice in service organization by giving voice to successful experiences and promoting health service research, apart from some local services, is still generally lacking.

Although suicide rates have decreased since the mid 1980s, the country has still the second highest rate in the European Union. The high prevalence of alcohol use and the rapidly increasing prevalence of illicit drug use contribute to comorbidity and related behavioural issues, including the increased frequency of severe violent events committed by people with psychiatric disorders, which have not been properly addressed.

Following a large-scale reform effort that started in the mid 1980s, de-institutionalization and establishment of numerous community services has been achieved to a great extent. However, sectorization, development of primary care policies, inter-sectoral communication and long-range planning have not been achieved and deficiencies in the provision of care for children, adolescents, old people, individuals with autism, with intellectual disabilities and with eating disorders as well as deficiencies in forensic psychiatric services have been identified. Thus, the Greek psychiatric reform is an unfinished reform. The financial crisis that has recently hit the country has had a serious impact on the population and especially on vulnerable groups such as individuals with psychiatric disorders. Continuation of psychiatric reform to its desired extent has become problematic. This situation calls for re-orientation of the national mental health strategy towards more realistic and priority-orientated goals, i.e. securing a satisfactory level of function of the existing services, persisting in the implementation of the basic targets of psychiatric reform, creating the necessary infrastructure but avoiding the creation of expensive facilities of secondary importance."}, {"Title": "State of psychiatry in Denmark.", "Abstract": "Danish psychiatry has gone through profound changes over the past two to three decades, reducing inpatient-based treatment and increasing outpatient treatment markedly.

Furthermore, 'new' diagnostic groups are represented in the treatment statistics with steeply increasing incidences, e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders, especially in the outpatient part of the statistics. Over the same 30 years, the number of available beds has been reduced by 60-70%; however, as the length of stay of inpatients has been reduced markedly, the departments are still able to treat a high number of patients. The financial budgeting of psychiatry is not increasing equivalently to the somatic specialities, handicapping development in psychiatry.

A total of 10.2% of the gross domestic product is spent on healthcare but only 6.1% of this total expenditure goes to mental health. Although mental healthcare is largely accessible and offers high levels of quality, it is questionable whether this can be maintained, given the economic climate. The collection of epidemiological data is problematic due to the different ways registration takes place within different care systems and the complexity of the state structure and its consecutive constitutional reforms. Coming from a largely hospital-driven psychiatric care, mental healthcare reforms of past decades have created more community-based care and new care pathways, still an on-going process. Psychiatry as a profession is currently challenged. Teaching mental health issues remains extremely limited within medical schools, resources for research are disproportionally limited, and working conditions less favourable, all this compared with other specialisms. Hence few graduates choose a career in psychiatry.

Countries have drafted mental health strategies, replacing institutions with community based models of care with the aim to offer good and decent care. Psychiatry across Europe is very diverse, whether one considers models of care, resources, ways of working or training. Variation within countries, due to regionalization, can be as large as across frontiers. Valid comparisons of service delivery and their outcomes is essential for identification and dissemination of effective and efficient practice, but hampered by widely used but poorly defined terminology such as 'primary care' and 'community services', or assumptions about common ways of working. There is also still a lack of standardisation of outcome indicators. The combination of high morbidity and low supply in the presence of effective interventions is a strong argument in favour of investment, especially at times of growing need. It is necessary to support this argument with consistent evidence of improved outcome. It is essential that international groups now accept the challenge to reach consensus in order to advocate for more mental health resources."}, {"Title": "[On clinical diagnosis of depression].", "Abstract": "In this paper, diagnosis of depression was deliberatively considered from a view of psychopathological studies, and problems of operational diagnostic system in psychiatry were discussed.

The largest specialty was family medicine, followed by internal medicine and pediatrics. Mean years of practice was 16, and 60 percent of the respondents were male. Respondents indicated the extent to which difficulties were encountered when communicating with patients.\nThe study finds that physicians had more difficulties with patients in the 0-20 year age bracket on 12 of the 18 communication statements. Psychiatry and pediatrics reported more difficulties with language interpreters. Pediatrics reported more difficulties with patients using culturally-based alternative medicine. Internal medicine had more difficulty with patients not appearing to trust or participate in treatment decisions. Patients in the 41-60 years age bracket had the highest mean for non-adherence to treatment plans, health maintenance and needed lifestyle change. The female physician-female patient dyad had fewer communication difficulties on all statements.\nFurther research should examine how family structure influences health-care delivery and health outcomes. Health care organizations can contribute to improving quality of care by seeking out and correcting sources of latent errors, and by supporting professional development and practice interventions.\nFew studies exist that have linked communication difficulties to adverse events.

The aim of this study was to find differences in the steroid spectrum in patients and controls, and to assess the diagnosis of schizophrenia by building a predictive model based on steroid data. Thirty-nine serum steroids (22 neuroactive steroids and their metabolites and 17 polar conjugates) representing steroid metabolome were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 22 drug-naive (first episode) schizophrenia patients (13 men and 9 women) before and after six-month treatment with atypical antipsychotics. The results were compared to the data from healthy subjects (22 males, 25 females). In summary the following significant differences were found: (1) In both sexes higher levels of pregnenolone sulfate and sulfated 5\u03b1- as well as 5\u03b2-saturated metabolites of C21-steroids in progesterone metabolic pathway were found in patients, pointing to decreased activity of sulfatase. (2) In a few instances decreased levels of the respective 5\u03b1-metabolites of C21 steroids were found in patients. (3) As C19 steroids concern, in both sexes there were considerably lowered levels of 5\u03b2-reduced metabolites in patients. On the other hand, with only a few exceptions, the treatment did not significantly influence most steroid levels. Further, to assess the relationships between schizophrenia status and steroid levels and to build the predictive model of schizophrenia, multivariate regression with reduction of dimensionality (the method of orthogonal projections to latent structures, OPLS) was applied. Irrespective of the small number of patients, use of this model enabled us to state the diagnosis of schizophrenia with almost 100% sensitivity. Our findings suggest that the assessment of steroid levels may become a valid and accurate laboratory test in psychiatry. A limitation of our study is the absence of subjects with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia, so we cannot conclude whether the results are specific for schizophrenia. On the other hand, steroid metabolome model may be used as a diagnostic tool for further studies."}, {"Title": "The genetics of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs in psychiatry. Based on the fact that SSRIs increase extracellular monoamine levels in the brain, the monoamine hypothesis of depression was introduced, postulating that depression is associated with too low serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline levels. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this hypothesis is too simplistic and that depression and the efficacy of SSRIs are dependent on neuroplastic changes mediated by changes in gene expression. Because a coherent view on global gene expression is lacking, we aim to provide an overview of the effects of SSRI treatment on the final targets of 5-HT receptor signal transduction pathways, namely the transcriptional regulation of genes. We address gene polymorphisms in humans that affect SSRI efficacy, as well as in vitro studies employing human-derived cells. We also discuss the molecular targets affected by SSRIs in animal models, both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that serotonin transporter gene variation in humans affects the efficacy and side-effects of SSRIs, whereas SSRIs generally do not affect serotonin transporter gene expression in animals. Instead, SSRIs alter mRNA levels of genes encoding serotonin receptors, components of non-serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, neurotrophic factors, hypothalamic hormones and inflammatory factors. So far little is known about the epigenetic and age-dependent molecular effects of SSRIs, which might give more insights in the working mechanism(s) of SSRIs."}, {"Title": "Clinical excellence in psychiatry: a review of the psychiatric literature.", "Abstract": "The provision of excellent patient care is a goal that physicians would like to achieve in caring for all patients, all of the time.

The perspective of trying to define specific anatomic correlates of the syndrome has led to disappointing results. In that context, neurophysiologic hypotheses (e.g. glutamatergic hypothesis) and connectivity hypotheses became prominent. Nevertheless, despite their commitment to the principle of denying 'localist' views and approaching the syndrome's endophenotype from a whole brain perspective, efforts to integrate both have not flourished at this moment in time.\nThis paper aims to introduce a new etiological model that integrates the glutamatergic and the WM (WM) hypotheses of schizophrenia's etiology. This model proposes to serve as a framework in order to relate to patterns of brain abnormalities from the onset of the syndrome to stages of advanced chronification.\nNeurotransmitter abnormalities forego noticeable WM abnormalities. The former, chiefly represented by NMDAR hypo-function and associated molecular cascades, is related to the first signs of cell loss. This process is both directly and indirectly integrated to the underpinning of WM structural abnormalities; not only is the excess of glutamate toxic to the WM, but its disruption is associated to the expression of known genetic risk factors (e.g., NRG-1). A second level of the model develops the idea that abnormal neurotransmission within specific neural populations ('motifs') impair particular cognitive abilities, while subsequent WM structural abnormalities impair the integration of brain functions and multimodality. As a result of this two-stage dynamic, the affected individual progresses from experiencing specific cognitive and psychological deficits, to a condition of cognitive and existential fragmentation, linked to hardly reversible decreases in psychosocial functioning."}, {"Title": "HIV screening practices in U.S. hospitals, 2009-2010.", "Abstract": "A 2004 national survey of hospitals showed that 23.4% of hospitals screened for HIV in at least one department, most frequently in labor and delivery departments.

His convulsive seizures were controlled by the administration of antiepileptic drugs (diazepam, phenytoin); however, he later showed prolonged disturbance of consciousness and left spastic hemiparesis. Gastrostomy was performed, but the patient died of aspiration pneumonia approximately 9 months after the onset of status epilepticus. Pathological examination showed widespread neuron loss with gliosis involving the entire right cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontotemporal lobe and hippocampus, and with patchy involvement of the contralateral cerebellum, especially in the cortex and dentate nucleus. These findings seemed to be consistent with a chronic stage of selective neuronal necrosis and secondary cerebellar degeneration due to diaschisis of the cerebral cortical involvement. Evidence of limbic-type DLB was also observed. We believe that selective neuronal necrosis associated with status epilepticus is an interesting neuro-pathological finding."}, {"Title": "The DGPPN research project on mental healthcare utilization in Germany: inpatient and outpatient treatment of persons with depression by different disciplines.", "Abstract": "The analysis of the utilization of mental healthcare services using routine data provided by statutory health insurance companies and pension funds is a way to assess the frequency of service use, the distribution of the service use among various healthcare settings (inpatients vs. outpatients, rehabilitation according mainly to the German Social Code Book IX vs. curative treatment according to the German Social Code Book V [note that some elements of rehabilitation are financed according to Social Code Book V as well]) and medical disciplines (psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine vs. somatic disciplines and general medicine). In addition, these data can provide information on the social consequences of mental disorders, as assessed by the number of cases and the duration of sick leave or case numbers of early retirement due to mental disorders. In this study, healthcare utilization data from 10 million Germans were analysed. Within a 3 year observation period (2005-2007), about one-third (approx. 3.3 million) persons had a contact with a healthcare service due to a diagnosis of the ICD-10 groups F0-F5. Given the large number of persons with depression in Germany, the initial results of an analysis of mental healthcare utilization due to depression are presented here. Among the study group of 3.3 million Germans with mental healthcare utilization within the observation period, 1.4 million had at least one contact to healthcare system due to the diagnosis of depression. In most cases, depression was diagnosed without specification of severity. It was found that non-psychiatric disciplines like general practitioners were the most frequently used providers in outpatient mental health care, whereas inpatient treatment predominantly occurred in psychiatric departments. For those persons with depression for which a severity-indicating ICD-10 code was used, it was found that utilization of psychiatric and psychosomatic disciplines increased in both in- and outpatient treatment compared to use of general medical facilities with more severe depression. Specialists for psychosomatic medicine and psychological psychotherapists predominantly treated cases of mild and moderate depression, whereas severe cases were mostly cared for by psychiatrists or psychiatric departments."}, {"Title": "[Schizophrenia and Liver Transplantation: Case Report].", "Abstract": "Liver transplantation is a treatment available for many patients with liver cirrhosis who find in this treatment a way to improve life expectancy and quality of life.

Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. About 20% of the stroke is hemorrhagic and about 50% of these is due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A troublesome neuropsychiatric complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage is agitation/aggression. Case Presentation. A 45-year-old man with no prior psychiatric history, sustained subarachnoid hemorrhage. After initial stabilization for 2 days, he underwent craniotomy and clipping of anterior cerebral communicating artery aneurysm. Treatment was continued with labetalol, nimodipine, and levetiracetam. Beginning postoperative day 4, patient developed episodes of confusion and agitation/aggression. Switching of Levetiracetam to valproate did not show any improvement. Psychiatry team tried to manage him with intense nursing intervention and different medications like olanzapine, valproate, lorazepam, and haloperidol. However, patient continued to be agitated and aggressive. Switching from labetalol to metoprolol resulted in dramatic improvement within 3 days. Discussion. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are often not sufficiently effective in the control of agitation/aggression in patients with traumatic brain injury and similar conditions.

On balance, children report that stimulants improve their capacity for moral agency, and they associate this capacity with an ability to meet normative expectations. I argue that although under certain conditions stimulant drug treatment may increase the risk of a threat to authenticity, there are ways to minimise this risk and to maximise the benefits of stimulant drug treatment.

Based on clinical observations, schizophrenia (SCZ) and affective disorder (AD) patients can experience different SGA side effects. The expanded use of SGAs in psychiatry suggests a need to investigate whether there is a difference in the incidence and severity of side effects related to diagnosis.\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies reporting side effects of four common prescribed SGAs (aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) in the treatment of SCZ or AD. Randomized controlled trials were included in this study if they administered oral SGAs as a monotherapy, in adult patients. The metabolic and extrapyramidal side effects were collected separately for each group, and then were combined in a meta-analysis.\n80 studies were included in the analysis (N = 14,319). Quetiapine treatment induced significantly higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total blood cholesterol mean change in the SCZ group, relative to the AD group. Based on the results, the incidence of extrapyramidal side effects was more frequent in the AD group. Aripiprazole treatment led to significantly more akathisia incidence in the AD group, compared with the SCZ group.\nThe results suggest that SCZ patients may be more vulnerable to some SGA-induced metabolic disturbances, in which lifestyle risk factors and possible inherent genetic vulnerabilities may play a role. Most of the studied SGAs caused more movement disorders in AD patients than SCZ.

The maternal immune response is largely sequestered from the fetus. Maternal antibodies, specifically immunoglobulin G (IgG), are passed to the fetus to provide passive immunity throughout much of pregnancy. However, both protective and pathogenic autoantibodies have equal access to the fetus (Goines and Van de Water [2010]: Curr Opin Neurol 23:111-117). If the mother has an underlying autoimmune disease or has reactivity to fetal antigens, autoantibodies produced before or during pregnancy can target tissues in the developing fetus. One such tissue is the fetal brain. The blood brainbarrier (BBB) is developing during the fetal period allowing maternal antibodies to have direct access to the brain during gestation (Diamond et al. [2009]: Nat Rev Immunol; Braunschweig et al. [2011]; Neurotoxicology 29:226-231). It has been proposed that brain injury by circulating brain-specific maternal autoantibodies might underlie multiple congenital, developmental disorders (Lee et al. [2009]: Nat Med 15:91-96).

Symptoms and complaints are approached in terms of a medical semiological model, and are seen as signs of underlying illness processes. In discussing this approach the author makes use of Gottlob Frege's theory, in which three aspects of a sign are discerned: the reference/referent or Bedeutung, the sense or Sinn, and the representation/idea or Vorstellung. Based on this distinction, it is argued that in the transition from the DSM-III to the DSM-5 much effort has been taken to disambiguate the sense attributed to symptoms and complaints, while person-specific ideas and representations have been excluded. This exclusion of the Vorstellung is criticized, both from a psychiatric and a psychotherapeutic perspective. Subsequently it is argued that whereas the DSM-III and DSM-IV avoided strong statements on etiology, the DSM-5 makes clear choices. The DSM-5, and more recently the RDoC group within the NIMH, aims at developing systems of classification that start from the assumption that psychiatric disorders are brain disorders. It is argued that by doing so a referent is classified that is different from the object of intervention that psychotherapeutic theories are concerned with.\nSuch a view of diagnosis is not workable for psychotherapy. The exclusion of personal experiences associated with symptoms and complaints is problematic and the referent that recent psychiatric classification uses, that is, brain processes, is not compatible with the referent that psychotherapeutic theories use. Case formulation can be seen as an alternative to standard classification."}, {"Title": "The diagnosis of depression: current and emerging methods.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the leading causes of disability in adolescents and adults, particularly starting from age 15 years and older. Diagnosis of depression has traditionally been made based on clinical criteria, including patient current symptoms and history. This process is widely used but relies on subjective interpretation. To standardize both the data obtained and data interpretation, various interview-based instruments and noninterview methods exist for screening and testing for depression in various clinical settings. This article evaluates the technical basis for and clinical performance of these various instruments and methods to diagnosis depression in clinical settings. Traditional tools include physician-administered or patient self-administered interview tools that have reasonable clinical accuracy depending on the threshold score and may lead to a full diagnostic evaluation for high-risk patients. In addition, older laboratory methods such as the dexamethasone test have contributed to the diagnosis of depression over a long period. Newer diagnostic methods such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics are technically sophisticated and objective and are beginning to emerge in psychiatry.

This paper focuses on the overarching theme of 'medicalisation', identified from the analysis of women's psychiatric inpatient charts, including two subthemes: (1) language and composition and (2) decontextualisation. Our analysis suggests that psychiatric chart documentation practices that reproduce gendered, sexualised, and racialised biases and assumptions and decontextualise the social and structural context of women's experiences of madness serve to create the paradox of women's visibility/erasure in psychiatric charts. The paper concludes with an exploration of the significance of women's authorship legitimacy in psychiatric chart documentation."}, {"Title": "Depression in China: integrating developmental psychopathology and cultural-clinical psychology.", "Abstract": "With a starting point in John Abela's groundbreaking developmental psychopathology research on adolescent depression in China, we aimed to review the state of the literature on Chinese depression across the lifespan. We began with Dr. Abela's published studies relevant to depression in China and our own research with adults before turning to the reference lists of these articles to find additional sources. Then we conducted literature searches using PsycINFO and PubMed to find other relevant studies published between April 2001 and April 2011 . There are two distinct literatures on depression in China. Developmental psychopathology research has emphasized adolescent samples and cognitive models of causation; cultural-clinical psychology and cultural psychiatry research have emphasized adult samples and the meanings associated with emotions, symptoms, and syndromes. Both approaches to the study of depression in China have yielded important findings but have also highlighted issues that could be better addressed by incorporating the other approach. Beyond depression in China, the psychological study of culture and mental health more generally would benefit from greater exchange between developmental psychopathology and cultural-clinical psychology."}, {"Title": "Efficacy and enlightenment: LSD psychotherapy and the Drug Amendments of 1962.", "Abstract": "The decline in therapeutic research with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the United States over the course of the 1960s has commonly been attributed to the growing controversy surrounding its recreational use. However, research difficulties played an equal role in LSD psychotherapy's demise, as they frustrated researchers' efforts to clearly establish the efficacy of treatment. Once the Kefauver Harris Drug Amendments of 1962 introduced the requirement that proof of efficacy be established through controlled clinical trials before a drug could be approved to market, the value of clinical research became increasingly dependent on the scientific rigor of the trial's design. LSD psychotherapy's complex method of utilizing drug effects to catalyze a psychological treatment clashed with the controlled trial methodology on both theoretical and practical levels, making proof of efficacy difficult to obtain. Through a close examination of clinical trials performed after 1962, this article explores how the new emphasis on controlled clinical trials frustrated the progress of LSD psychotherapy research by focusing researchers' attention on trial design to the detriment of their therapeutic method. This analysis provides a new perspective on the death of LSD psychotherapy and explores the implications of the Drug Amendments of 1962."}, {"Title": "[Clinical application of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in psychiatry: the advanced medical technology for differential diagnosis of depressive state].", "Abstract": "Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a functional neuroimaging technique that has been increasingly employed in psychology and psychiatry. Because NIRS can detect only cerebral cortex reactivities with low spatial resolution and may suffer from contaminating signals from skin and skull, its data should be interpreted as a global index of cerebral cortex reactivities. Within these limitations, the advantages of NIRS over fMRI such as complete non-invasiveness, small measurement apparatus, high time resolution, and natural examination setting makes it the preferred method in studies of brain substrates of subjective feeling of sleepiness and fatigue, personality, conversation, and psychiatric disorders. Two-thirds of the original articles on NIRS application in psychiatry have been published by Japanese researchers. NIRS examination of psychiatric disorders using a verbal fluency task of only three minutes demonstrated their characteristics of frontal lobe function: depression was characterized by smaller activation, bipolar depression by comparable but delayed activation, and schizophrenia by reduced activation followed by re-activation during the post-task period. These characteristics can also be identified in individual NIRS data using two automatically calculated parameters. Based on these results, NIRS application in psychiatry has been approved as one of the Advanced Medical Technologies in 2009 as an aid for differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms. A lack of clinical laboratory tests for diagnosis and treatment has been one of the major difficulties for reliable diagnosis, quantitative treatment assessment, and prevention of psychiatric disorders; NIRS may be the first step toward such clinical laboratory tests in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The objectives of the reform of hospitalisation under restraint in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The law of July 5th, 2011 reforms legislation dating from June 27th, 1990.

We examined explanatory models of West African patients with schizophrenia in a community-centred department of psychiatry in Mali, West Africa.\nPatients and experts volunteered to be interviewed in the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital, Pont G, in Bamako, the capital of Mali. We used semi-structured interviews to explore key psychotic symptoms and explanatory models of psychosis in five experts and fifteen patients with schizophrenia. All interviews were analysed using computer assisted content-analysis with the program Atlas.ti.\nAfrican patients displayed key symptoms of schizophrenia such as commenting and imperative voices, inserted thoughts and other phenomena of alien control, which were often subjectively explained as obsession by witches or jinns. Explanatory models differed depending on occidental migration experience and age. The involvement of family members in the treatment-setting facilitates inclusion and recovery.

For example in schizophrenia, it has been suggested that the activity of the self and the distinction between self and others are impaired. However, such models of the self and its dysfunction have been developed among Western societies and may not easily be transferred into different cultural settings, which can be characterized by alternative concepts of a person's self. This study compares traditional Western concepts of the self and its dysfunction with self-concepts developed in Caribbean, African and South-East-Asian societies. This review demonstrates that \"the self\" is a fluid concept. Social function and dysfunction of such a self-concepts depend on a given cultural context. We argue that the cursive concept of the self is culturally constructed around cursive experiences which are shared by all human beings. Such universal experiences may include the prereflective access to individual thoughts and feelings, an automatic knowledge that (at least in non-pathological states) these emotions and cognitions belong to my self. Conscious self-reflection and its narrative articulation, on the other hand, is necessarily imbued with social and cultural norms, images and events, often of conflicting nature."}, {"Title": "[The importance of movement-directed interventions in the multidisciplinary treatment of binge eating disorder: an overview].", "Abstract": "More than three out of four persons with binge eating disorder do not get enough physical exercise.\nTo collect scientific evidence of the effects and benefits that movement and physical exercise can have on persons with a binge eating disorder.\nPubMed, PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, the Dutch Journal of Psychiatry (Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie), het Tijdschrift voor Vaktherapie and Actual Themata derived from psychomotor therapy were screened for the period January 1994 to August 2011.

Strong evidence was found for: 1) significant weight-loss after movement interventions; 2) fewer symptoms of depression after a combination of both movement and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) than after CBT on its own. There was only limited evidence for 1) the fact that the combination of movement and CBT leads to less eating disorder pathology than does CBT alone; 2) the beneficial effects of yoga on weight-loss as well as on the reduction of eating disorder pathology.There are indications that walking can be helpful in reducing of eating disorder pathology.\nActivities involving movement and physical exercise deserve to play an important role in the multidisciplinary treatment of binge eating disorders."}, {"Title": "[Personality traits in adults with autism spectrum disorders measured by means of the Temperament and Character Inventory].", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in autism spectrum disorders (asd) in adulthood.

With the goal of (re-)introducing his work to an anglophonic audience, we review and provide an historical context for RKE's etiologic theory of major psychiatric illness. RKE saw psychiatric disorders as multifactorial, arising from two sets of etiologic factors: predisposing and exciting. Exciting causes were either psychological or physical, while predisposing causes were either general (e.g. sex, occupation, age) or individual-specific. Three major individual-specific risk factors were of particular importance: heredity, personality and education/rearing. Hereditary factors were typically the most important but were usually non-specific in their effect with the forms of psychiatric illness often differing in close relatives. He emphasized the importance of the 'neuropathic personality,' which rendered affected individuals sensitive to the pathogenic effects of various exciting influences. Poor rearing could also substantially increase risk for major mental illness. RKE saw the influences of hereditary and rearing factors on psychiatric illness as often mediated through a neuropathic personality. While RKE believed in degeneration theory and emphasized the potential etiologic importance of masturbation in psychiatric illness, his clinical writings were otherwise characterized by a broad-minded and sensible approach that lacked the narrowness of the strongly brain-based or psychoanalytic psychiatric schools which were very influential during and shortly after his life."}, {"Title": "Psycho-education and group cognitive-behavioural therapy for clinical perfectionism: a case-series evaluation.", "Abstract": "Research indicates that psycho-education and cognitive behavioural interventions can reduce perfectionism but to date no group treatments have been examined.\nThe current study utilized a case series design to compare psycho-education materials and subsequent eight-week group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) to a baseline waitlist in an outpatient community psychiatry sample (n = 21).\nParticipants were assessed on five occasions: baseline, 4 weeks later (waitlist), 4 weeks after receiving psycho-education material, post-treatment (8 weeks after receiving the group intervention), and 3-month follow-up.\nThere was a main effect of time for perfectionism and negative affect from baseline to post-group (effect sizes ranging from 1.46 to 1.91) that were maintained at 3-month follow-up.\nThese results suggested that group CBT for clinical perfectionism may be beneficial, but that psycho-education alone is not effective for reducing perfectionism or negative affect."}, {"Title": "Development of expertise in mental health service provision for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities.", "Abstract": "There are significant health disparities according to sexual orientation and gender identity, particularly in mental health; however, very few mental health professionals specialise in caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities.

Participants represented four professional disciplines: psychiatry (n = 2); social work (n = 3); psychotherapy (n = 2), and psychology (n = 1). The data were analysed for themes that were identified using a descriptive phenomenological approach.\nAll providers self-identified as members of LGBT communities; however, most agreed that this membership was not necessary to provide supportive, appropriate care for LGBT individuals. Providers described their self-identity as members of LGBT communities, associated lived experiences and recognition of the need for mental health services that are sensitive to the unique needs of LGBT individuals as influential factors in their career decisions. The lack of training opportunities and resources specific to the provision of LGBT-sensitive mental health services was highlighted. Provider recommendations included the introduction of mandatory LGBT health content in education curricula that addresses basic LGBT-related terminology, appropriate interview questions to facilitate the disclosure of sexual orientation and gender identity, information regarding the health impact of heterosexism and homophobia, and specific health care needs of sexual and gender identity minority people.\nData from this study suggest there are few opportunities for medical providers to access training and gain expertise in the provision of care to LGBT people.

In this paper, we will discuss recent perspectives on disordered intersubjectivity among the core symptoms of schizophrenic psychoses. Based on symptoms crucial for communication deficits in schizophrenia, we address indeterminacy of translation as a potential default in the therapeutic setting. The concept of indeterminacy of translation reviewed here assumes that no reference for translation of languages is given, but principles to substitute this non-referring space of unknown terms are to be demonstrated: firstly, a maxim of indulgence which requires that as many true considerations as possible have to be achieved by the final interpretation of a proposition, and secondly, a coherence which is given when the considerations are deductable and not contradictory. Indulgence and coherence are hypothesized as reflecting an approximation process of reconstructing intersubjectivity in conditions where it is severely disturbed such as schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Another view of the history of antipsychotic drug discovery and development.", "Abstract": "Chlorpromazine initiated effective pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia 60 years ago.

Currently, around 30% of patients receiving interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) treatment for HCV experience clinically significant depression. Effective and timely detection of depression is crucial to ensuring appropriate treatment and support. However, little is known about how clinical nurse specialists identify patients at risk of developing interferon-alpha-induced depression, and monitor those receiving antiviral treatment for the occurrence of depression.\nThis study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of staff experience of, and attitudes towards, the identification and monitoring of interferon-alpha-induced-depression and the decision-making process concerning the use of liaison psychiatry and other clinical services.\nA qualitative interview study was conducted among clinical staff involved in the care of patients with hepatitis C, using the perspective of naturalistic decision making.\nOutpatient liver clinics in three large teaching hospitals in South London, the United Kingdom.\nAll clinical nurse specialists from the three outpatient liver clinics were included. All were involved directly in the care of patients receiving interferon-alpha treatment and had at least one year experience (mean 6.4 years, range 1-11 years) in this field.\nSemi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted between 2010 and 2011. Data collection and analysis were carried out iteratively to ensure the reliability of the analysis using the constant comparison method.\nStaff used verbal and non-verbal cues when assessing risks of patients developing depression before and during IFN-\u03b1 treatment. Major sources of uncertainty were patient engagement and familiarity, referrals to psychiatrists, language barriers, and distinguishing between psychological and physical symptoms. Good rapport with patients and good communication among multidisciplinary professional groups were key strategies identified to reduce uncertainty.\nCurrent methods of identifying vulnerable patients rely on the availability of clinical experts and good communication within a multidisciplinary team. Detection and management of depression in this population is complex, however, various strategies are employed by nurses to overcome difficulties when making decisions regarding patient welfare.

Results confirmed that those in whom EOAA co-occurred with CD showed the highest level of personality pathology, particularly Cluster B traits and antisocial/borderline comorbidity. Those with co-occurring CD with EOAA, compared with those showing only CD, showed more violence in their criminal history and greater recreational drug use. Regression analysis showed that both EOAA and CD predicted adult ASB when covariates were controlled. Further analysis showed that EOAA significantly mediated but did not moderate the effect of CD on ASB. The failure to demonstrate an exacerbating effect of EOAA on the relationship between CD and ASB likely reflects the high prevalence of CD in this forensic sample.

The data seem to confirm that the prevention of bullying must be implemented by the work organization and by handling interpersonal conflicts in the work context."}, {"Title": "The impact of psychiatric patient boarding in emergency departments.", "Abstract": "Objectives. Studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of emergency department (ED) boarding. This study examines the impact of resource utilization, throughput, and financial impact for psychiatric patients awaiting inpatient placement. Methods. The authors retrospectively studied all psychiatric and non-psychiatric adult admissions in an Academic Medical Center ED (>68,000 adult visits) from January 2007-2008. The main outcomes were ED length of stay (LOS) and associated reimbursement. Results. 1,438 patients were consulted to psychiatry with 505 (35.1%) requiring inpatient psychiatric care management. The mean psychiatric patient age was 42.5 years (SD 13.1 years), with 2.7 times more women than men. ED LOS was significantly longer for psychiatric admissions (1089\u2009min, CI (1039-1140) versus 340\u2009min, CI (304-375); P < 0.001) when compared to non-psychiatric admissions. The financial impact of psychiatric boarding accounted for a direct loss of ($1,198) compared to non-psychiatric admissions. Factoring the loss of bed turnover for waiting patients and opportunity cost due to loss of those patients, psychiatric patient boarding cost the department $2,264 per patient. Conclusions. Psychiatric patients awaiting inpatient placement remain in the ED 3.2 times longer than non-psychiatric patients, preventing 2.2 bed turnovers (additional patients) per psychiatric patient, and decreasing financial revenue."}, {"Title": "Workplace violence and influencing factors among medical professionals in China.", "Abstract": "Workplace violence has attracted increasing public attention over the past few decades in China.

Women, with signs of postpartum depression, were usually identified by family members who noticed behaviours that seemed abnormal. Care providers indicated they had inadequate time and access to screening techniques to identify women with depression attending unit-based pregnancy and postpartum groups.

In addition, a survey was performed among physicians of a municipal health service and also among family practitioners working in the same district by investigating health problems, habits and professional careers of physicians, and their addictive problems, their attitude toward addict patients and their opinion upon chemical dependency.\nCAGE-test was used to examine the presence of alcohol problem and a questionnaire was constructed for the study undertaken among physicians.\nThe response rate was 60.18% and 32.98% among patients who visited the pulmonology out-patient clinic and their family physician, respectively. Among those who responded to the test, as many as 6.02% and 4.82% of the cases would need a further medical examination to make clear whether alcohol related health problem was present or not, whilst 9.77% and 11.67% of the patients proved to be alcohol dependent, respectively. The response rate in the survey among physicians was 41.28%. As stated, physicians not only screen the patients for alcohol and drug dependence, but also refer them to a specialist. The general experience seems to oppose this statement. The majority of health professionals considered chemical dependence as a chronic disease, whereas a kind of moral judgment of the problem was also seen, particularly among family physicians. If they had the opportunity to choose whom to treat: an alcoholic or a drug dependent patient, the majority of them would treat patients brought under the first category. The CAGE test revealed alcohol problem in three family physicians, but none in specialists. Nearly all physicians consumed coffee, but the majority of them were non-smokers. As the risk for committing suicide is higher among physicians than in the general population, physicians were interviewed in this regard, too. Three physicians in the sample reported an attempt of suicide, and eleven physicians had suicidal ideas in the past. Although the majority of physicians were satisfied with their physical and mental health, several of them had serious health problems or were treated for depression. At the same time, the majority of physicians were unsatisfied with their financial and professional respect, and had the opinion that a career is unlikely to depend on the professional knowledge.\nAlthough the relatively low rate of physicians answering the questions did not make it possible to reveal the interrelationships among different variables, the study was able to direct the attention to the risk existing among physicians to commit suicide or use chemical substances. A proposal is made to establish an effective, but discreet and easy way to acquire psychiatric-addictological support. To avoid mental health problems among professionals working in psychiatry, organization of groups headed by someone not belonging to the same institute would be much encouraged. Parallel to these, the requirements and the conditions of making a career have to be made clear. On the basis of these surveys, as well as literature data, a continuous test examination of alcohol problem is recommended in the practice of family physicians as well as in the out-patient clinic of such disciplines like pulmonology and gastroenterology."}, {"Title": "The development and validation of the Peradeniya Depression Scale (PDS)--a culturally relevant tool for screening of depression in Sri Lanka.", "Abstract": "Cultural factors may influence the manner in which a given population interprets and conceptualizes their experience of depression.

It shows satisfactory sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for depression. The findings also suggest that it maybe worthwhile for Asian countries to consider adopting scales which are based on internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for depression, but which incorporate expressions that are more appropriate to their own culture and language."}, {"Title": "Trichotillomania, bipolar disorder and white matter hyperintensities in a six-year old girl.", "Abstract": "A six-year-old girl was referred to our child psychiatry outpatient clinic by the Pediatric Neurology Unit with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and trichotillomania.

A questionnaire on the confidence in primary health care, psychiatry, social services, and work colleagues was distributed to members of reindeer-herding families through the Sami communities and to the control population through the post. The relative risk for poor confidence was analyzed by calculating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals adjusted for age and level of education.\nThe confidence in primary health care and psychiatry was significantly lower among the reindeer-herding Sami compared with the control group. No differences were found between men and women in the reindeer-herding Sami population. In both the reindeer-herding Sami and the control population, younger people (\u2264 48 years) reported significantly lower confidence in primary health care than older individuals (>48 years).\nA conceivable reason for the poor confidence in health care organizations reported by the reindeer-herding Sami is that they experience health care staff as poorly informed about reindeer husbandry and Sami culture, resulting in unsuitable or unrealistic treatment suggestions. The findings suggest that the poor confidence constitutes a significant obstacle of the reindeer-herding Sami to fully benefit from public health care services."}, {"Title": "A history of physician suicide in America.", "Abstract": "Over the course of the last century, physicians have written a number of articles about suicide among their own. These articles reveal how physicians have fundamentally conceived of themselves, how they have addressed vulnerability among their own, and how their self-identification has changed over time, due, in part, to larger historical changes in the profession, psychiatry, and suicidology. The suicidal physician of the Golden Age (1900-1970), an expendable deviant, represents the antithesis of that era's image of strength and invincibility. In contrast, the suicidal physician of the modern era (1970 onwards), a vulnerable human being deserving of support, reflects that era's frustration with bearing these unattainable ideals and its growing emphasis on physician health and well-being. Despite this key transition, specifically the acknowledgment of physicians' limitations, more recent articles about physician suicide indicate that Golden Age values have endured. These persistent emphases on perfection and discomfort with vulnerability have hindered a comprehensive consideration of physician suicide, despite one hundred years of dialogue in the medical literature."}, {"Title": "Anti-inflammatory and neuroactive properties of selected fruit extracts.", "Abstract": "Epidemiological evidence supports inverse associations between fruit and vegetable intake and incidence of cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration.

Usually, physicians in private practice are not part of the expert committees of medical societies that author guidelines. Guidelines represent a consensus appraising evidence from clinical studies on efficacy and side effects but also evaluating aspects of the health care system such as costs. Guidelines commonly do not account for regional specifics. Transfer of knowledge from guidelines to general practice, therefore, is incomplete.\nWe describe a consensus of neuropsychiatric and general physicians (n=12; 10 to 38 years of professional experience) on prioritization of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for patients with Alzheimer's dementia as judged by relevance and practicability compared to the guideline of the Society for General Medicine (DEGAM-guideline No. 12) and the S3-guideline dementia of the German Society for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Neuropsychiatry (DGPPN).\nIf patients and proxies do not oppose diagnosis, e. g. in cases of progressive impairment of memory with everyday relevance, the appropriate diagnostic procedures should be performed for every patient.

Several reasons contribute to this delay: lack of a biological 'gold standard' definition of psychiatric illnesses; a profusion of statistically significant, but minimally differentiating, biological findings; 'approximate replications' of these findings in a way that neither confirms nor refutes them; and a focus on comparing prototypical patients to healthy controls which generates differentiations with limited clinical applicability. Overcoming these hurdles will require a new approach. Rather than seek biomedical tests that can 'diagnose' DSM-defined disorders, the field should focus on identifying biologically homogenous subtypes that cut across phenotypic diagnosis--thereby sidestepping the issue of a gold standard. To ensure clinical relevance and applicability, the field needs to focus on clinically meaningful differences between relevant clinical populations, rather than hypothesis-rejection versus normal controls. Validating these new biomarker-defined subtypes will require longitudinal studies with standardized measures which can be shared and compared across studies--thereby overcoming the problem of significance chasing and approximate replications. Such biological tests, and the subtypes they define, will provide a natural basis for a 'stratified psychiatry' that will improve clinical outcomes across conventional diagnostic boundaries."}, {"Title": "Single trial time-frequency domain analysis of error processing in post-traumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Error processing studies in psychology and psychiatry are relatively common. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are often used as measures of error processing, two such response-locked ERPs being the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error-related positivity (Pe). The ERN and Pe occur following committed error in reaction time tasks as low frequency (4-8 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations registered at the midline fronto-central sites. We created an alternative method for analyzing error processing using time-frequency analysis in the form of a wavelet transform. A study was conducted in which subjects with PTSD and healthy control completed a forced-choice task. Single trial EEG data from errors in the task were processed using a continuous wavelet transform. Coefficients from the transform that corresponded to the theta range were averaged to isolate a theta waveform in the time-frequency domain. Measures called the time-frequency ERN and Pe were obtained from these waveforms for five different channels and then averaged to obtain a single time-frequency ERN and Pe for each error trial. A comparison of the amplitude and latency for the time-frequency ERN and Pe between the PTSD and control group was performed. A significant group effect was found on the amplitude of both measures. These results indicate that the developed single trial time-frequency error analysis method is suitable for examining error processing in PTSD and possibly other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry services at a tribally run behavioral health clinic.", "Abstract": "Telepsychiatry provides a helpful resource to rural, poor, and isolated communities for whom traditional psychiatry may not be an option.

The presented study was conducted to further evaluate the safety of CIONM and identify possible VNS related side effects.\nProspective nonrandomized controlled trail.\nForty patients scheduled for thyroid or parathyroid surgery were enrolled in the trail. The intervention group consisted of 22 patients receiving VNS for CIONM. Eighteen patients were operated on with routine IONM. To assess VNS-induced effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), heart rate variability analysis (HRVA) was applied. Serum cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were monitored to evaluate immunomodulatory effects of VNS.\nHRVA revealed significantly increased vagal activity during CIONM. This parasympathetic predominance was not countered by the sympathetic nervous system. Despite a significant increase of vagal tone, no hemodynamic events occurred; in fact, no significant changes in median heart rate or in median arterial blood pressure were detected. Even though anti-inflammatory effects of VNS have been reported, no attenuation of cytokine release of TNF-\u03b1 was measured.\nVNS for CIONM resulted in increased vagal activity assessable via HRVA. The increased parasympathetic tone affected neither hemodynamics nor levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1.

To begin to address this gap, a skills-based, interactive curriculum based on motivational interviewing (MI) as a teaching method is presented.\nThe curriculum described in this paper is a four-week block rotation taught in the second year of residency. Motivational interviewing (MI) is used as a teaching approach toward the goal of clinical behavior change. Residents' strengths, personal choice and autonomy are emphasized. Each week of the rotation, there is a clinical topic and a set of specific skills for mastery. Residents are offered a \"menu\" of skills, role modeling, role/real play, practice with standardized patients (SP), and direct supervision in clinic.\nThirty-nine residents have completed the curriculum. Based on residents' subjective reporting using pre-post scales (i.e., importance and confidence), all participants to date have reported substantial increases in confidence/self-efficacy using primary care counseling skills in their continuity clinic.\nThis paper presents an innovative, empirically based model for teaching the essential skills necessary for physicians providing care for patients with mental/emotional health needs as well as health-behavior change concerns.

Further, functional neurosurgeons are now being charged with taking care of patients as part of a multi-disciplinary group that includes psychologists and psychiatrists. As DBS for psychiatry continues to evolve, and as further indications are explored, it is incumbent on neurosurgeons who treat these disorders to familiarize themselves with current standards of diagnosis and treatment. Just as the movement disorder surgeon should be familiar with the biology, physiology, diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, so they should become familiar with similar aspects of commonly referred psychiatric conditions.

This study employed logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equation clustering by hospital to identify the factors associated with needlestick or sharp injuries.\nThe majority (70.4%) of the hospital nurses had experienced needlestick or sharp injuries in the previous year. The non-use of safety containers for disposal of sharps and needles, less working experience as a registered nurse, poor work environments in regards to staffing and resource adequacy, and high emotional exhaustion significantly increased risk for needlestick or sharp injuries. Working in perioperative units also significantly increased the risk for such injuries but working in intensive care units, psychiatry, and obstetrics wards showed a significantly lower risk than medical-surgical wards.\nThe occurrence of needlestick or sharp injuries of registered nurses was associated with organizational characteristics as well as protective equipment and nurse characteristics. Hospitals can prevent or reduce such injuries by establishing better work environments in terms of staffing and resource adequacy, minimizing emotional exhaustion, and retaining more experienced nurses.

Therefore, the authors conducted a needs-assessment survey to determine the needs of IMGs transitioning into psychiatry residency.\nUsing a 15-item online questionnaire, authors conducted a needs-assessment of IMG residents in five Canadian psychiatry residency programs. The survey examined IMGs' perceived difficulties with the transition into psychiatry residency, educational needs, and demographic data. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Mann-Whitney tests.\nIMGs identified the following difficulties with their transition into residency: understanding the healthcare system, medical documentation, and evidence-based medicine/mental health. Language barriers and social isolation were significant factors affecting the transition into residency for residents who did not speak English as their first language. Residents who lived in Canada 12 months or less had greater perceived difficulties in psychotherapy knowledge and adapting to the Canadian healthcare system; 88% of IMGs reported having little-or-no IMG-specific preparation for psychiatry residency from their psychiatry program; however, 69% reported that they would use IMG resources if offered; 63% felt that faculty in their program should undergo training to assist with IMG transition.\nSeveral perceived challenges, needs, and gaps in training were reported by IMGs in Canadian psychiatry residency programs. The results of this survey will be used to inform future curriculum development to facilitate IMG transition into psychiatry postgraduate training programs."}, {"Title": "DSM-5 and clinical trials in psychiatry: challenges to come?", "Abstract": "The publication of the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in 2013 raises important questions for clinical trials and associated regulatory decisions on new drugs for psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Textual data in psychiatry: reasoning by analogy to quantitative principles.", "Abstract": "Personal meaning in subjective experience is a key element in the treatment of persons with mental disorders.

The revised BDI-II was developed in 1996, partially due to concerns about the influence of somatic symptoms from medical illness on BDI scores. The BDI, however, continues to be frequently used in medical settings. The objective of this study was to examine the degree to which somatic symptom items influence BDI scores among hospitalized post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to psychiatry outpatients with MDD matched on cognitive/affective scores, sex, and age.\nSomatic scores of post-MI patients with MDD and matched psychiatry outpatients with MDD were compared using independent samples t-tests.\nA total of 579 post-MI patients with MDD (mean age=54.4 years, SD=9.9) and 579 psychiatry outpatients with MDD (mean age=51.2 years, SD=9.7) were matched on cognitive/affective scores, sex, and age. Somatic symptoms accounted for 47% of BDI total scores among post-MI patients (mean total=22.6, SD=8.8) versus 37% among psychiatry outpatients (mean total=19.2, SD=9.7). Somatic scores of post-MI patients were 3.4 points higher than for matched psychiatry outpatients (95% confidence interval 3.0 to 3.9; p<.001), a difference that is equivalent to 15% of total post-MI patient scores.\nBDI scores of hospitalized post-MI patients with MDD may, in part, reflect symptoms of the acute medical condition or its treatment, rather than depression. The BDI-II was designed to reduce the influence of somatic symptoms on total scores and may be preferable to the 'BDI among heart disease patients."}, {"Title": "The occurrence of priapism as a result of the use of a single dose of quetiapine.", "Abstract": "Priapism is a prolonged pathologic erection situation that occurs after sexual stimulation or without sexual stimulation. This condition is divided into two types, ischemic (low-flow, veno-occlusive) and non-ischemic (high-flow, arterial). A 68-year-old male patient applied to our clinic with the complaints of hardness and pain in the penis. Three days before he applied to our clinic, he was prescribed a single dose of 200 mg quetiapine by a psychiatry polyclinic for the complication of insomnia. Nearly 6 hours after the first dose of quetiapine, an involuntary erection occurred with accompanying pain in the penis. The patient waited for spontaneous detumescence without consulting a psychiatrist. After the patient had waited for 48 hours without any change, he applied to our clinic. Other etiologic factors of priapism were excluded (such as malignancy, blood dyscrasia, leukemia, and trauma). In blood gas samples obtained from the corpus cavernosum, hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis were diagnosed. Ischemic priapism was supposed.

To determine the effect of this intervention on child and mother psychosocial problems related to parenting stress and on the children's cognitive abilities, we performed a cluster randomized controlled trial.\nParticipants were 238 pairs of mothers and typically developing preschool children (ages 4-6 years old) from Wakakusa kindergarten in Japan. The pairs were asked to play at home for about 10 min a day, 5 days a week for 3 months. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group by class unit. The Parenting Stress Index (PSI) (for mothers), the Goodenough Draw-a-Man intelligence test (DAM), and the new S-S intelligence test (NS-SIT) (for children) were administered prior to and 3 months after the intervention period. Pre-post changes in test scores were compared between the groups using a linear mixed-effects model analysis. The primary outcomes were the Total score on the child domain of the PSI (for child psychosocial problems related to parenting stress), Total score on the parent domain of the PSI (for maternal psychosocial problems related to parenting stress), and the score on the DAM (for child cognitive abilities). The results of the PSI suggested that the program may reduce parenting stress. The results of the cognitive tests suggested that the program may improve the children's fluid intelligence, working memory, and processing speed.\nOur intervention program may ameliorate the children's psychosocial problems related to parenting stress and increase their cognitive abilities.\nUMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000002265."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of a computer-based intervention to enhance metabolic monitoring in psychiatry inpatients treated with second-generation antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) play an important role in the pharmacologic management of various psychiatric conditions.

A questionnairing on 181 people with GID diagnosed in the Okayama University Hospital (Japan) showed that female to male (FTM) transsexuals hoped to begin masculinizing hormone therapy at age of 15.6 +/- 4.0 (mean +/- S.D.) whereas male to female (MTF) transsexuals hoped to begin feminizing hormone therapy as early as age 12.5 +/- 4.0, before presenting secondary sex characters. After confirmation of strong and persistent cross-gender identification, adolescents with GID should be treated with cross-gender hormone or puberty-delaying hormone to prevent developing undesired sex characters. These treatments may prevent transsexual adolescents from attempting suicide, being depressive, and refusing to attend school.

Results. 145 patients completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 97%. Ninety-eight patients (68%) preferred attending a specialized psychiatry service even when stabilised on their treatment. The common reason given by patients in this category was fear of substandard quality of psychiatric care from their general practitioners (GPs) (67 patients, 68.4%). Twenty-nine patients (20%) preferred to attend their GP for continuing mental health care. The reasons given by these patients included confidence in GPs, providing same level of care as psychiatrist for mental illness (18 patients or 62%), and the advantage of managing both mental and physical health by GPs (13 patients, 45%). Conclusion. Most patients who attend specialised psychiatric services preferred to continue attending specialized psychiatric services even if they become mentally stable than primary care, with most reasons revolving around fears of inadequate psychiatric care from GPs."}, {"Title": "Treatment patterns in inpatients with bipolar disorder at a psychiatric university hospital over a 9-year period: focus on mood stabilizers.", "Abstract": "The increasing number of pharmacological treatment options for bipolar disorder seems to be paralleled by the number of evidence-based guidelines published previously.

This is a retrospective study of 531 bipolar in patients who were consecutively admitted to the Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Innsbruck. Their complete medical histories were evaluated for psychotropic medications, with a special focus on mood stabilizers (MSs). To compare the use of individual MSs or combinations with other psychotropic medications in two preselected observation periods (1999-2003 and 2004-2007), we used Fisher's exact test. Overall, the proportion of patients receiving at least one MS increased significantly from 1999-2003 to 2004-2007 (74.1 vs. 83.1%, P=0.011). Among the individual MSs, valproate was used most frequently in both time periods, showing a significant increase (P<0.001). Prescriptions of quetiapine (P<0.001) and lamotrigine (P=0.033) increased significantly, carbamazepine showed a significant decrease (P<0.001). Prescriptions of lithium and olanzapine decreased without reaching significance. The significant increase in the prescription of MS reflects the increasing awareness and implementation of recent evidence-based medicine guidelines into clinical practice.

However, there has been increasing recognition in the general medical literature that such sequelae might encompass more pervasive alterations in health status and physiology. Recent findings in telomere biology have suggested a new avenue for exploring the adverse health effects of childhood maltreatment. Telomere length in proliferative tissues declines with cell replication and the effect can be accelerated by such factors as inflammation, oxidative stress, radiation, and toxins. Reduced telomere length, as a proxy for cellular aging, has been associated with numerous chronic somatic diseases that are generally considered to be diseases of aging, such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. More recently, shorter telomeres have been demonstrated in several psychiatric conditions, particularly depression. Sustained psychosocial stress of a variety of types in adulthood appears to be associated with shorter telomeres. Now, emerging work suggests a robust, and perhaps dose-dependent, relationship with early-life stress. These findings present new opportunities to reconceptualize the complex relationships between experience, physical and psychiatric disease, and aging."}, {"Title": "Long-term course of severe depression: late remission and recurrence may be found in a follow-up after 38-53 years.", "Abstract": "This study is a follow-up of inpatients diagnosed with severe depression/melancholia between 1956 and 1969.

Long-term course of depression was evaluated by cluster analysis and compared to background variables, such as heredity for depression, perceived parental rearing behaviour, and treatment of index depressive episode. Using a cluster analysis the patients could be separated into six clusters describing the course: i) single or few episodes followed by long-lasting remission; ii) single or few episodes followed by long-lasting remission, although shorter; iii) single or few episodes followed by late recurrence; iv) single or few episodes, but more frequently ill, followed by late recurrence; v) several episodes followed by lasting remission; vi) chronic course of episodes.

This paper describes the challenges and opportunities of this project.\nThis was a collaborative, in situ health service project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a needs assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and evaluation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical support materials. Cycle 2: Preparation and evaluation of educational and clinical outreach sessions.\nVideoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and technical support for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation.\nTelepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments."}, {"Title": "Videoconference-based education for psychiatry registrars at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry registrars form the backbone of specialized psychiatric service provision in South Africa.

Access to education was improved with potential cost savings identified.\nWell supported and planned videoconference-based teaching is a feasible, cost-effective and acceptable method of supporting registrars at sites distant from academic centers."}, {"Title": "Histone regulation in the CNS: basic principles of epigenetic plasticity.", "Abstract": "Postmitotic neurons are subject to a vast array of environmental influences that require the nuclear integration of intracellular signaling events to promote a wide variety of neuroplastic states associated with synaptic function, circuit formation, and behavioral memory. Over the last decade, much attention has been paid to the roles of transcription and chromatin regulation in guiding fundamental aspects of neuronal function. A great deal of this work has centered on neurodevelopmental and adulthood plasticity, with increased focus in the areas of neuropharmacology and molecular psychiatry. Here, we attempt to provide a broad overview of chromatin regulation, as it relates to central nervous system (CNS) function, with specific emphasis on the modes of histone posttranslational modifications, chromatin remodeling, and histone variant exchange. Understanding the functions of chromatin in the context of the CNS will aid in the future development of pharmacological therapeutics aimed at alleviating devastating neurological disorders."}, {"Title": "Budgetary impact analysis of buprenorphine-naloxone combination (Suboxone\u00ae) in Spain.", "Abstract": "Opioid addiction is a worldwide problem. Agonist opioid treatment (AOT) is the most widespread and frequent pharmacotherapeutic approach. Methadone has been the most widely used AOT, but buprenorphine, a partial \u03bc-opiod agonist and a \u03ba-opiod antagonist, is fast gaining acceptance. The objective was to assess the budgetary impact in Spain of the introduction of buprenorphine-naloxone (B/N) combination.\nA budgetary impact model was developed to estimate healthcare costs of the addition of B/N combination to the therapeutic arsenal for treating opioid dependent patients, during a 3-year period under the National Health System perspective. Inputs for the model were obtained from the specialized scientific literature. Detailed information concerning resource consumption (drug cost, logistics, dispensing, medical, psychiatry and pharmacy supervision, counselling and laboratory test) was obtained from a local expert panel. Costs are expressed in euros (\u20ac, 2010).\nThe number of patients estimated to be prescribed B/N combination was 2,334; 2,993 and 3,589 in the first, second and third year respectively.

Psychopathology and clinical judgment are often discarded as non-scientific and obsolete methods. Yet, in their everyday practice, psychiatrists use observation, description and classification, test explanatory hypotheses, and formulate clinical decisions.\nThe aim of this review was to examine the clinical judgment in psychiatry, with special reference to clinimetrics, a domain concerned with the measurement of clinical phenomena that do not find room in customary taxonomy.\nA MEDLINE search from inception to August 2011 using the keywords \"clinical judgment\" and \"clinimetric\" in relation to psychiatric illness for articles in English language was performed. It was supplemented by a manual search of the literature. Choice of items was based on their established or potential incremental increase in clinical information compared with use of standard diagnostic criteria. The most representative examples were selected.\nResearch on clinical judgment has disclosed several innovative assessment strategies: the use of diagnostic transfer stations instead of diagnostic endpoints using repeated assessments, subtyping versus integration of different diagnostic categories, staging, macro-analysis, extension of clinical information beyond symptomatic features. Evidence-based medicine does not appear to provide an adequate scientific background for challenges of clinical practice in psychiatry and needs to be integrated with clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS. A renewed interest in clinical judgment may yield substantial advances in clinical assessment and treatment.

A phenomenological and a context sensitive conception of autonomy is needed within the perspective of dialogical ethics. A dialogical perspective requires from psychiatric professionals a susceptibility for what the patient as a human being really has to say. On the basis of a dialogue where there is space and attention for life histories, backgrounds and the potentials of patients, a new perspective can be developed that is shared by the persons involved.\nIn psychiatry, statements about real autonomy and genuine respect for autonomy are only truly meaningful within the context of doctors, nurses and patients.

This narrow focus has hampered the development of relevant animal models and human experimental medicine paradigms. Other fields in psychiatry, most notably in the realms of addiction and anxiety, have prospered from results obtained in parallel studies using animal models and experimental human studies.

Bleuler emphasised the potential of therapeutic communities in providing care, the drawbacks of extended hospitalisation and the therapeutic potential of planned 'early discharge' and job integration.\nSome of the current evidence on therapeutic communities, planned early hospital discharge, alternatives to inpatient care and job integration in people with severe mental illness are reviewed.\n(i) Current evidence suggests that therapeutic communities (and new forms of milieu therapy, e.g. Soteria) are an effective ingredient of care; (ii) the evidence on planned early discharge suggests that there is scope for early discharge if continuity of care is ensured, and (iii) the evidence on supported employment suggests that there is scope for early job placement/supported employment among people with schizophrenia with little risk to clinical stability.\nEugen Bleuler was a far-sighted social psychiatrist who concentrated on treatment issues and complex interventions that are considered cornerstones of care for people with severe mental illness one hundred years later."}, {"Title": "Eugen Bleuler's concept of schizophrenia and its relevance to present-day psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper links the historical perspective with the actual debate on the concept of schizophrenia. By this, two aims shall be accomplished. First, to prove that Eugen Bleuler's (1857-1939) concept of 'schizophrenia' in its central parts was a clear step forward, as compared to previous approaches, especially the notion of 'dementia praecox', proposed and favored by French authors like B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Augustin Morel (1809-1873) and, in Germany, by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926). Bleuler considerably reduced the epistemological presuppositions of Kraepelin's nosological model and coined the term 'group of schizophrenias', which was markedly broader and, as for prognosis, much less pessimistic. The second aim of this paper is to argue in favor of a continuous reflection upon psychiatry's historical and epistemological basis which is regarded not just as 'l'art pour l'art', but as an indispensable component of psychiatry, clinically and scientifically."}, {"Title": "\"By the foolish Paynter Bayer\"--characteristics of the psychopathology of expression in a previously unknown work of the early 18th century by a very probably schizophrenic heraldic painter and his identification.", "Abstract": "Whether schizophrenia existed before the 19th century is an important issue within the history of psychiatry. Written records or other documents that could identify this psychopathology are extremely rare and must therefore be subjected to meticulous historical and psychopathologic analysis.\nA previously unknown heraldic sheet, with accompanying text, was subjected to historical, heraldic, and psychopathologic analysis. The contemporary inscription \"by the mad paynter Bayer\" was found on the back of the painting. The phenomenologic analysis emphasized the phenomenology of Jaspers for the formal criteria of a psychosis.\nMany of the characteristics as seen typical psychopathologic of presumably schizophrenic psychoses by some authors can be found in the formal features of the work. Moreover, a precise historic and heraldic investigation (blazon) allowed us to assign this previously anonymous work to an artist of the period around 1720 to 1740, Abraham Beurer, and to find his contemporary portrait.\nThis is one of the earliest works that can be unambiguously assigned to the psychopathology of expression (art brut). The formal features of schizophrenia appear to be remarkably typical, timeless, and stable, although the objective features are strictly historical. The work provides further evidence that there were individual cases of schizophrenia even before the 18th century. The external designation as \"mad\" provides important additional support for this view."}, {"Title": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy versus psycho-education for patients with major depression who did not achieve remission following antidepressant treatment: a preliminary analysis.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with a psycho-educational control group designed to be structurally equivalent to the MBCT program but excluding the claimed \"active ingredient\" of MBCT (i.e., mindfulness meditation practice) for the treatment of patients with major depression (MD).\nThis was a randomized controlled trial.\nThe study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of Bologna, Italy.\nPatients who had MD and who did not achieve remission following at least 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment were considered for inclusion. Eligible subjects were randomized to receive MBCT or psycho-education and were prospectively followed for 8 weeks.\nMD severity was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and quality of life, as measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale, and the Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI), respectively, were also included. All assessments were performed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. Changes of psychologic variables over the study period were analyzed by means of the repeated-measures analysis of variance.\nOf 29 screened subjects, 16 received MBCT or psycho-education. Both HAMD and PGWBI scores improved to a significantly higher extent in the MBCT group than in the psycho-educational control group.\nAlthough limited by a small sample size and the lack of follow-up measures, the results of this preliminary study suggest the superiority of MBCT over psycho-education for subjects who had MD and who did not achieve remission following antidepressant treatment."}, {"Title": "The disease entity in psychiatry: fact or fiction?", "Abstract": "The current debate concerning the forthcoming revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) lacks sufficient historical perspective on groundwork concepts in psychiatry, such as the nature of the disease entity, categorical typologies, dimensional models and their validity and utility.\nTo offer an overview of the evolution and metamorphoses of the conceptual basis of classification in psychiatry, with particular focus on psychotic disorders.\nDiscursive, proceeding from history of ideas to a critique of present dilemmas.\nMuch of the present-day discussion of basic issues concerning the classification of mental disorders is a replay of debates that took place in the earlier periods of scientific psychiatry.

Most elderly with depression are managed in primary health care. Although the number of scientific publications related to geriatric psychiatry has increased, there are still important gaps. Implementation of evidence-based guidelines for managing depression in primary care has had limited success, but has led to improvements compared to standard care. It is logical that the determinants (barriers and enablers) of implementing depression guidelines can be identified and can guide the selection of more effective implementation strategies that are tailored to address those determinants. We are testing that logic as part of a multinational implementation research project called 'Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases' (TICD). Our focus in Norway is on the management of depression in the elderly in primary care. We will identify the determinants of implementing evidence-based recommendations using various methods and comparing those methods. We will then use different methods to match the implementation interventions to the identified determinants and compare those methods.

To study the factors associated with the DSH in the elderly group of 60 years and above and to recommend changes to be implemented in order to improve the management in this specific group. Materials and Methods. Five-year retrospective study was undertaken from July 2005 to July 2010 in the Plastic Surgery Department of the Royal Preston Hospital, NHS Trust. A Performa was designed to collect data about the inpatient admission and included certain areas of key information. The case notes for all patients were extensively analysed in order to gather adequate information for the devised Performa. Results. DSH is getting more common in the elderly group, and males are more affected than females. 60% of the patients had a previous history of DSH. A large number (80%) of patients had a previous history of mental illness. 60% of those DSH patients were living with family. Almost all patients (90%) were reviewed by the Psychiatry Liaison Team. The timing of patients being assessed was highly variable. Conclusions. Marriage is not a protective factor in the prevention of the DSH in the elderly group. A mental health team referral in the early phases of the management would be of huge benefit and a likely step to prevent possible future admissions. The Department would benefit from the creation of a protocol for the management of these patients. There should be a joint effort of the professionals in the management of DSH in the elderly, and GPs play a very important role in the prevention of DSH in the later life."}, {"Title": "Winner of Young Writer's Competition: How loud is the unquiet mind? William Sargant (1907-88) and British psychiatry in the mid-20th century.", "Abstract": "William Walters Sargant (1907-1988) is credited, for better or for worse, with putting physicalist psychiatry on the map--at the expense of the dictum 'primum non nocere' (first do no harm). He was an outspoken supporter and practitioner of what he termed the 'practical rather than philosophical approaches' to the treatment of mental illness. This paper examines Sargant's fascinating career, beginning with the reasons behind lifelong passion for radical psychiatry, then discusses the various physical treatments he pioneered and publicized during his three decades at St Thomas' including prolonged electroconvulsive therapy, insulin coma therapy, dangerous combinations of antidepressants and, most notably, prefrontal leucotomy. His heady mix of dogma and charisma enabled him to get away with flying in the face of evidence-based medicine--but not without courting the considerable controversy and contempt that was to so blacken his reputation posthumously. This paper ends with comments on misguided and misplaced enthusiasm in the history of therapeutics, acknowledgement of Sargant's positive contributions to psychiatry and finally a reminder not to be tempted to pass post hoc judgement on the man or his legacy all too quickly."}, {"Title": "People-centred care: new research needs and methods in doctor-patient communication.

New research challenges and windows of opportunity for therapeutic practice will be addressed in this contribution, as they relate to the three main tasks that psychiatrists have to meet when talking with their patients: understanding patient's problems and concerns; establishing the therapeutic alliance by acknowledging and responding to patient's emotion; informing and involving patients and their families, when appropriate. Therapeutic decisions need the elaboration of valid strategies of shared decision-making, which still have to be implemented and adapted to psychiatric context.

The results showed that, in the cohort studied, a majority of subjects lacked insight into their heroin-use behavior. Compared with the impaired-insight group, those who possessed insight into their illness showed significantly greater awareness of past social, somatic, and psychopathological impairments, and had a greater number of past treatment-seeking events for heroin addiction. In contrast with other psychiatric illnesses, the presence of awareness appears to be related to the passing of time and to the worsening of the illness. Methodologies to improve the insight of patients should, therefore, be targeted more directly on patients early in their history of heroin dependence, because the risk of lack of insight is greatest during this period."}, {"Title": "Encouraging teaching and presentation skills.", "Abstract": "After qualifying from medical school, doctors are expected to present on a regular basis in formal settings. It is important to acquire presenting skills early, so that students can practise and improve this skill prior to graduating.\nMany medical students at Manchester University wanted more emphasis on presenting formally to give them experience prior to qualifying. There were other problems during the Psychiatry block that included non-attendance of students and clinicians for teaching sessions, and difficulty covering all aspects of the syllabus within a 4-week block.\nSeveral presentation topics were devised on mental health based on the syllabus, for a pair of medical students to present to their peers within the Psychiatry block. A presentations skills training session was delivered at the start of each block. Students presented in pairs, chaired by a senior clinician. This was often the first time they had presented formally with formative, structured feedback.\nThis new addition to the available teaching was well received, and benefitted presenters, learners and facilitators alike: the presenters felt that they had obtained a deeper understanding of their chosen topic (all taken from the syllabus, and so relevant to their needs); the peer group wanted to listen to their colleagues present, thereby improving attendance rates; and busy clinicians were more likely to facilitate, as they did not have to prepare presentations and could practise their chairing and feedback skills.

Several arguments have been adduced in support of this impossibility thesis. My critical examination of two master arguments advanced to this effect by Derek Bolton and Jerome Wakefield, respectively, raises serious doubts about their soundness. Furthermore, I articulate an alternative, thoroughly objective, though in part normative, framework for the elucidation of the concept of mental disorder. The concepts of mental dysfunction and impairment of basic psychological capacities to satisfy one's basic needs are the building blocks of this framework. I provide an argument for the objective harmfulness of genuine mental disorders as patterns of mental dysfunctions with objectively negative biotic values, as well as a formally correct definition of the concept of mental disorder. Contrary to the received view, this objective framework allows for the possibility of genuine mental disorders due to adverse social conditions, as well as for quasi-universal mental disorders.

Here we intend to explain a prototypal model based on the postulates of groups that could have potential in categorizing clinical states.\nAs an example, we begin by modifying the original 'Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale' (BPRS), the most frequently used standards for evaluating the psychopathology of patients with schizophrenia. We consider a presumptively idealized (virtually standardized) BPRS (denoted BPRS-I) with assessments ranging from '0' to '6' to simplify our discussion. Next, we introduce the modulo group Z7 containing elements {0,1,2,\u2026,6} defined by composition rule, 'modulo 7 addition', denoted by *. Each element corresponds to a score resulting from grading a symptom under the BPRS-I assessment. By grading all symptoms associated with the illness, a Cartesian product, denoted Aj, constitutes a summary of a patient assessment. By considering operations denoted A(j\u2192k) that change state Aj into state Ak, a group M (that itself contains Aj and Ak as elements) is also considered. Furthermore, composition of these operations obey modulo 7 arithmetic (i.e., addition, multiplication, and division). We demonstrate the application with a simple example in the form of a series of states (A4\u2009=\u2009A1*A(1\u21922)*A(2\u21923)*A(3\u21924)) to illustrate this result.\nThe psychiatric disease states are defined as 18-fold Cartesian products of Z7, i.e., Z7\u00d718\u2009=\u2009Z7\u00d7\u2026\u00d7Z7 (18 times). We can construct set G \u2261 {a(m)i| m = 1,2,3,\u2026(the patient's history of the i-th symptom)} and M\u2009\u2261\u2009{Am | Am \u2208 Z7\u00d718 (the set of all possible assessments of a patient)} simplistically, at least, in terms of modulo 7 addition that satisfies the group postulates.\nDespite the large limitations of our methodology, there are grounds not only within psychiatry but also within other medical fields to consider more generalized notions based on groups (if not rings and fields). These might enable through some graduated expression a systematization of medical states and of medical procedures in a manner more aligned with other branches of natural science."}, {"Title": "Staff's perception of adolescent aggressive behaviour in four European forensic units: a qualitative interview study.", "Abstract": "Aggressive behaviour among patients is extremely common in forensic adolescent psychiatry compromising the safety of the treatment milieu and posing a treatment challenge to the staff.

Principal axis exploratory factor analysis, multiple factor extraction criteria, and higher-order factor analysis were used. Results were inconsistent with the five-factor structure of the RBANS purported in the test manual. Factor extraction criteria recommended extraction of one or two factors. Extraction of two factors resulted in a memory dimension and a less homogeneous visual perception and processing speed dimension. Higher-order analysis found that a second-order factor, representing general neurocognitive functioning, accounted for over three times the total and common variance than the two first-order factors combined. It was concluded that although the RBANS appears to be a useful measure of general neurocognitive functioning for inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, clinical interpretation beyond a general factor (i.e., Total Scale score) should be done with caution in this population.

To explore the effect of the revised national guidelines, we examined testing rates for two years pre- and two years post-PICT guideline publication.\nCombining the clinical services, 253,178 patients were seen and 9,183 tests were performed (of which 80 tested positive, 0.9%) in the four-year study period. The emergency department (ED) performed the second highest number of tests, but had the lowest testing rates (0.9-1.1%). Of inpatient services, neurology and psychiatry had higher testing rates than internal medicine (19.7% and 9.6% versus 8%, respectively). There was no significant increase in testing rates, either globally or in the majority of the clinical services examined, and no increase in new HIV diagnoses post-PICT recommendations.\nUsing a simple two-database tool, we observe no global improvement in HIV testing rates in our hospital following new national guidelines but do identify services where testing practices merit improvement.

Thus, dreams have been addressed from a number of different perspectives ranging from philosophy to clinical medicine, as well as psychiatry, psychology, artificial intelligence, neural network models, psychophysiology or neurobiology.\nThe main models are grounded on the biological function of dreams, especially those based on processes involving the consolidation of memory and forgetting, and models of simulation. Similarly, current models are developed upon the neurobiology and the neuropsychology of the REM phases of sleep and how they are differentiated from wakefulness. Thus, neurobiologically speaking, dreams are related to the role of acetylcholine and, neuropsychologically, to the activation of the limbic and paralimbic regions, the activation of the basal ganglia, the activation of cortical areas with a specific modality (especially Brodmann's areas 19, 22 and 37) and the deactivation of the ventromedial, parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate.\nDreams can be considered a state of consciousness that is characterised by a reduced control over their content, visual images and activation of the memory, and which is mediated by motivational incentives and emotional salience."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric nurses' self-rated competence.", "Abstract": "This study explored the self-rated competence of 52 Swedish psychiatric nurses in three clinical environments: forensic psychiatry, general psychiatric inpatient care, and clinical non-residential psychiatric care.

The students completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire, asking about their attitude toward CAP and their view of CAP as a possible career choice.\nOf the 574 students, 42.9% had \"high\" or \"very high\" interest in CAP, and 59.4% rated CAP basic knowledge as \"highly\" or \"very highly\" relevant for their prospective work as physicians. CAP was a possible career choice for 25.4%. The most frequently mentioned reasons for choosing CAP were interesting clinical cases (65.8%), helping ill children (52.1%), and close patient-physician contact (50.7%). The most frequently mentioned reasons against this decision were a definite decision for another subspecialty (54.8%), expected difficulties in working with parents and family members (35.3%), and an expected high emotional burden (29.6%). In addition to the highly significant correlation with general interest in CAP, students with previous experience in general psychiatry and CAP clinical courses, as well as female students and students with relatives or acquaintances with CAP-related disorders, showed the highest interest in CAP as a possible career choice.\nThe majority of the students surveyed showed a positive attitude toward CAP and considered CAP basic knowledge to be relevant for their future work. When designing recruitment strategies, it may be helpful to consider that CAP exposure early in the curriculum might be decisive and that students with previous clinical courses in this field, as well as female students, showed the highest interest in CAP as a possible career choice."}, {"Title": "Promoting psychiatry as a career option for Ghanaian medical students through a public-speaking competition.", "Abstract": "Authors assessed the impact of a public-speaking competition on the level of interest in psychiatry of Ghanaian medical students.\nAn inter-medical school public-speaking competition was organized to promote psychiatry as a fulfilling career option for Ghanaian medical students.

The HPATHI was also administered to 31 Psychiatry residents and faculty and 41 Emergency Medicine residents and faculty one time during the course of this study.\nFor Psychiatry clerks, t-tests showed significant differences pre- and post-clerkship experiences on 2 of the 23 items on the HPATHI. No statistically significant differences were noted for the Emergency Medicine students. An analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences on 7 out of the 23 survey questions for residents and faculty in Psychiatry, as compared with those in Emergency Medicine.\nResults suggest that medical students showed small differences in their attitudes toward homeless people following clerkships in Psychiatry but not in Emergency Medicine. Regarding resident and faculty results, significant differences between specialties were noted, with Psychiatry residents and faculty exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward homeless persons than residents and faculty in Emergency Medicine.

They were also asked about their ethnic group (using U.K. national census categories), religious affiliation, and how important religion was in their lives. Independent-samples t-tests and one-way ANOVA were used to compare differences between groups on the MCRS.\nStudents showed the highest regard for patients with pneumonia and lowest regard for patients with long-standing, unexplained abdominal complaints. Although attitudes toward pneumonia were more positive in fifth-year students than in first-year students, attitudes toward unexplained chronic abdominal pain were worse in fifth-year students than in first-year students. Personal experience of mental health treatment, or that among family and friends, were associated with less stigmatizing attitudes. Men showed more stigmatization than women for nearly all conditions; Chinese and South Asian students showed more stigmatizing attitudes toward delusions and hallucinations than their white British counterparts.\nMedical students in this survey showed the lowest regard for patients with unexplained abdominal pain, and these attitudes were worse in the most experienced medical students.

Until the late 1990 s, the public's attitude toward depression was generally unfavorable, due to the negative connotations of the Japanese word for clinical depression, 'utsubyou'. After the 1999 introduction of the first selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, pharmaceutical companies initiated educational campaigns. In order to aid the drug's acceptance, they coined the catchphrase 'kokoro no kaze', which literally means 'a cold of the soul'. Thanks to these marketing practices, antidepressant sales have increased six fold, from \u00a5 14.5 billion in 1998 to \u00a5 87 billion in 2006. However, the catchphrase 'kokoro no kaze' masked a critical difference between a cold and depression. It falsified the nature of treatment for depression by concealing the putative duration of medication. Owing to this distortion of information, pharmaceutical companies were assured a steady stream of profits. Now, the pharmaceutical industry is shifting its focus from depression to bipolar disorder. Japanese psychiatrists can learn a great deal from their experience with the aggressive marketing of antidepressants. In the case of depression, over-medication arguably did more harm than good.

Positive attributes appear to be associated with increased participation in cardiac health behaviors (e.g., healthy eating, physical activity) linked to beneficial outcomes; data linking positive psychological states and biomarkers of cardiac health (e.g., inflammatory markers) is mixed but suggests a potential association. Positive psychological interventions have consistently been associated with improved well-being and reduced depressive symptoms, though there have been few such studies in the medically ill.\nThese findings regarding the relationship between positive psychological attributes and cardiac health are promising and suggest that positive psychology interventions may be worth study in this population.

The following are study findings from Shimane Prefecture, Japan. 1. Among PC physicians, 38.4% had experienced the suicide of outpatients. For internists, the figure was 55.6%, while for physicians in other specialties it was 17%. 2. In the greater Matsue area, of the 948 new patients seen at psychiatric hospitals and clinics between June and August, 2009, 29.6% had been referred from PC physicians. Of the referred patients, 25.3% exhibited suicidal ideation (17.8% classified as mild, 5.7% as moderate, and 1.8% severe), while 12.5% had attempted suicide (6.4% classified as minor attempts, 3.9% as moderate, and 2.1% as serious). 3. In the greater Izumo area, although 73% of family doctors are treating patients with symptoms of depression, 38% of physicians noted the absence of specialists with whom they can consult. This highlights the need for greater availability of local psychiatric consultation services. 4. In the greater Masuda area, which had a very high suicide rate, a model suicide prevention project was implemented over two years, beginning in 2004. The project put great emphasis on cooperation between numerous concerned entities and organizations. Notable aspects of this project included cooperation between medical institutions and psychiatric hospitals, as well as efforts to promote the use of self check mental health assessments at the time of regular health checkups, after which persons with mental health issues were provided with support at the checkup site, as well as at medical and other facilities. Another element of the program consisted of the proactive implementation of home visits by public health nurses. These approaches are believed to have contributed to the decline seen in the suicide rate, from 48.9-58.1 per 100,000 population in 2001-2003, to 19.8-36.7 per 100,000 population in 2008-2010. 5. The findings of this study illustrate the fact that many PC physicians have experienced the suicide of outpatients, and endeavor to refer patients with mental health issues-including suicidal ideation and attempted suicide-to psychiatrists. Findings also show, however, that PC physicians are struggling due to a lack of psychiatric specialists available for consultation. Comprehensive measures to prevent suicide, including efforts by PC physicians and cooperation with psychiatrists, are effective.

There is a suicidal process where negative life events are there in the beginning, and social support and help-seeking behavior play an important role in impeding the progress of the process. Mental disturbance would be deeply associated with the suicidal process around the final stage, thinking of the fact that approximately 90% of the suicides suffered from mental disorders at the time of suicide. In considering the strategies for suicide prevention, there are two perspectives: a community model and a medical model. A community model is thought to be related mainly to the first half of the suicidal process and a medical model to the latter half. It is an ideal that both community and medical approaches are put into practice simultaneously. However, if resources available for suicide prevention are limited, a medical-model approach would be more efficient and should be given priority. Starting from a medical model and considering treatment and social resources necessary for suicidal people, the range of suicide prevention activities would be expand more efficiently than starting from a community-model approach. Clinical psychiatry plays a greatly important role in preventing suicide. It is found that approximately 20% of seriously injured suicide attempters were diagnosed as adjustment disorder in Japan, which means that even the mildly depressed can commit suicide. Therefore, no one can take a hands-off approach to suicidality as long as he/she works in the field of clinical psychiatry. It is earnestly desired to detect and treat properly the suicidal patients, but there is no perfect method. It would be helpful to pay attention to patients' personality development, stress-coping style and present suicidal ideation.

First, neuroeconomics-derived theoretical predictions about optimal adaptation in a changing environment provide an objective metric to examine psychopathology. Second, neuroeconomics provides a \"multilevel\" research approach that combines performance (behavioral) measures with intermediate measures between behavior and neurobiology (e.g., neuroimaging) and uses a common metaphor to describe decision-making across multiple levels of explanation. As such, ecologically valid behavioral paradigms closely mirror the physical mechanisms of reward processing. Third, neuroeconomics provides a platform for investigators from neuroscience, economics, psychiatry, and social and clinical psychology to develop a common language for studying reward-related decision making in psychiatric disorders.

To identify factors related to choosing psychiatry as a future medical career and attitude towards psychiatry among medical students of the International Class Programme of the Faculty of Medicine, The University of Indonesia. METHODS. This was a cross-sectional design which included 225 data sets from first to sixth year medical students (n = 188) as well as the freshly graduated medical doctors (n = 37). The Attitude Towards Psychiatry-30 questionnaire (ATP-30) was adopted. Data including demographics, past experience in psychiatry, inclination to work in psychiatry, and 3 specialty choices for future medical career were collected. Independent t test and logistic regression were used in data analysis. RESULTS. The mean ATP-30 score from the fresh graduates was slightly higher compared with the medical students. Inclination to work in the field of psychiatry, past experience in psychiatry, and the ATP-30 score were significantly correlated and contributed 57% to the prediction of choosing psychiatry as a future medical career (p < 0.05).

Public institutions such as the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center in the central area of the city and the Mental Health and Welfare Center in the southern area have mainly developed the psychiatric rehabilitation system. However, since 2000, new mental health needs have emerged, as the target of mental health and welfare services has been diversified to include people with developmental disorders, higher brain dysfunction, or social withdrawal, in addition to those with schizophrenia. Therefore, Kawasaki City's plan for community-based rehabilitation was drawn up, which makes professional support available for individuals with physical, intellectual, and mental disabilities. As the plan was being implemented, in 2008, the Northern Community Rehabilitation Center was established by both the public and private sectors in partnership.

The aim of this article is to compare the psychiatric therapeutic system in France with that in Japan and to reflect on problems related to involuntary hospitalization in Japan, especially \"hospitalization for medical care and protection.\" French psychiatry has been developing for about 150 years, and is based on the 1838 Statute (la loi 1838). Historically, J-E. Esquirol, defined two modalities of hospital admission: voluntary hospitalization and compulsory hospitalization. The 1838 statute also stipulated in-patients' rights. In the 1960's, the sector psychiatric therapeutic system, \"sectorisation,\" was introduced in France. According to this system, the continuity of treatment is regarded as important and all people with psychiatric disorders are treated continuously by the same therapeutic team in a sector that comprised of 70,000 inhabitants. Following this, the psychiatric ordinance of 1986 defined additionally 12 types of new therapeutic structures. It elaborated French community psychiatry with various intra-/extra-hospital institutions, and also encouraged \"hospitalization with consent\" (Hospitalisation libre), thus placing more importance on the subjective judgements and autonomy of patients. In accord with \"sectorisation\", the law of 1990 concerning hospitalization and the advocacy of inpatients' rights defined new procedures of psychiatric hospitalization: \"hospitalization at the request of a third party\" (Hospitalisation sur demande d'un tiers) and \"compulsory hospitalisation\" (Hospitalisation d'office). The reform of the law in 2011 went so far as to change the name of each category of admission: i.e. substituting \"psychiatric medical care\" for \"hospitalisation\". It also introduces an evaluation system to review involuntary hospitalization after 24 hours, 72 hours and 15 days during the early stages of hospitalization. This demonstrates the importance of judicial inspection in advocating for clients in determining the continuation of the psychiatric hospitalization. In discussion, we propose three suggestions in terms of quality of treatment and patients' rights advocacy concerning the future reform of psychiatric legislation in Japan: 1) institute an evaluation system to examine the validity of involuntary hospitalization, especially in the early phase of hospitalization; 2) recognize the necessity of making third parties such as Psychiatric Review Board or the courts responsive to the needs of psychiatric patients 3) ameliorate the Japanese Protector System for patients to bring it in line with contemporary contractual treatment of patients and to show a greater respect for patients' autonomy."}, {"Title": "[Examination of involuntary admissions in relations of CRPD].", "Abstract": "When we examine the problems of involuntary admissions, CRPD (the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities-2006) must be considered within the context of the problems. The principle of the convention is based on enjoyment of legal capacity of persons with disabilities. So, it is necessary to recognize the relation and the contradiction between disease-disorder-disability spectrum and capacity-ability spectrum. The two spectrums have been developed after the Second World War with development of societies of the world. Author presents the recognition of involuntary admissions of Japan. So, Japanese psychiatry must select the road to community psychiatry to solve the problems."}, {"Title": "Coercion, autonomy, and the preferential option for the poor in the ethics of organ transplantation.", "Abstract": "The debate concerning whether to legalize and regulate the global market in human organs is hindered by a lack of adequate bioethical language. The author argues that the preferential option for the poor, a theological category, can provide the grounding for an inductive moral epistemology adequate for reforming the use of culturally Western bioethical language. He proposes that the traditional, Western concept of bioethical coercion ought to be modified and expanded because the conditions of the market system, as viewed from the perspective of organ vendors systemically deprived of access to sufficient resources, are sufficiently exploitative as to diminish the possibility of these vendors giving informed consent. Moreover, empirical studies conducted by professionals in medicine, sociology, psychiatry, economics, and medical anthropology continue to contribute support to the growing interdisciplinary consensus that functionally coercive structural factors exert the most significant influence upon a vendor's decision to sell an organ within any market, regardless of legality or degree of regulation. Therefore any proposal to legalize and regulate the organ market remains patently unethical because doing so would likely function to constrain further the agency of poor potential vendors."}, {"Title": "[Suicide in children and adolescents - a 13-year study with 78 cases].", "Abstract": "Updated and regional data about the circumstances of death and the psychosocial backgrounds of suicides can be helpful for improving suicide-preventive strategies in childhood and adolescence.\nAll known cases of completed suicide in the period from 1996 to 2008 in persons \u2264 21 years of age from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Frankfurt/Main were analysed in a retrospective study. We included 78 cases and matched them with a comparative sample of 1,797 adult suicides of persons > 21 years of age.\nWithin the chosen period there was a 44 % decrease in incidence of suicide in the group of \u2264 21-year-olds. The fraction of incarcerated persons in this group was 8.0 % compared to 2.56 % in the adult group. Differences from suicide in adulthood were also demonstrated in terms of suicide-related substance abuse (less detection of alcohol, more frequent detection of illicit drugs) and choice of methods (more deaths by being hit by a train).\nIncarcerated adolescents are an important risk group for suicidal tendency and need increased, well-directed preventive measures. Clinical adolescent psychiatry should pay special attention to the indications in this study of an age-dependent association of drug use in suicide."}, {"Title": "Knowledge: a possible tool in shaping medical professionals' attitudes towards homosexuality.", "Abstract": "The attitudes of medical professionals towards homosexuals can influence their willingness to provide these individuals with medical help. The study evaluated the medical professionals' knowledge about homosexuality and their attitudes towards it.\nThe sample consisted of 177 participants (physicians n=79 and students n=98). The study respondents anonymously completed three questionnaires (socio-demographic questionnaire, the questionnaire on knowledge, and the questionnaire on attitudes towards homosexuals).\nMale and religious participants showed a lower level of knowledge and a greater tendency to stigmatize. Furthermore, the subjects who knew more about homosexuality tended to hold less stigmatizing attitude. Age group, specialty (psychiatry, gynecology, internal medicine and surgery), and student's/physician's status had no effect on stigmatization. The study showed that the final year students/ residents had more knowledge than the second year students/specialists did. Knowledge had significant negative predictive effect on attitudes in the analyzed predictive model.\nTo our knowledge, this has been the first study in Serbia and Eastern Europe, which provides information on knowledge and attitudes of health professionals towards homosexuality. We would like to point out the degree of knowledge on homosexuality as a possible, but not exclusive tool in shaping the attitudes towards homosexuals and reducing stigmatization. However, regardless of the personal attitude, knowledge and variable acceptance of the homosexuals' rights, medical professionals' main task is to resist discriminative behavior and provide professional medical help to both homosexual and heterosexual patients."}, {"Title": "Restless Legs Syndrome: a common disorder, but rarely diagnosed and barely treated--an Indian experience.", "Abstract": "Restless Legs Syndrome is a common problem that is under-diagnosed. This disorder has a significant socio-economic impact as it worsens quality of life. There is either no or little data available in terms of the Indian context.\nPatients who presented with insomnia or leg pain were screened for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in the Psychiatry and Neurology departments of a tertiary care teaching institution from June 2011 to October 2011. One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with RLS were included. Duration of symptoms, previous medical consultation history, and treatment received were scrutinized and recorded. Severity of RLS was assessed using the IRLS Hindi version. For statistical analysis, descriptive analysis and independent sample t-test were used.\nOut of 653 subjects with insomnia or leg pain, 15.31% of the subjects had RLS. Females outnumbered males by a ratio of 2:1. Ninety-four percent of subjects had a moderate to very severe form of the illness. Only 32% of subjects reported leg symptoms to their physician on each visit. The rest of the patients sought an opinion for other symptoms like insomnia, daytime-fatigue, memory impairment, irritability, etc. Eighty percent of patients visited a general Physician or a primary care Physician. On average, five consultations were made before patients came to see us. None of the patients were diagnosed with RLS by any of their general Physicians or by specialists like neurologists, psychiatrists, etc. Common misdiagnoses (available in just 8% of cases) for legs symptoms were arthritis, calcium deficiency, worms in the stomach, depression, anxiety, stress, and vitamin deficiency. All the patients were prescribed medicines. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed drugs (97%), followed by injectable vitamin B-Complex (95% cases), calcium tablets (62% cases), selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (30%), and tri-cyclic antidepressants (25%). Proton pump inhibitors or NSAIDs were prescribed to almost all the patients along with previously mentioned drugs.\nDiagnosis of RLS was missed not only by general physicians, but also by specialists like neurologists and psychiatrists. Most of the time diagnosis could not be established, yet medicines were prescribed. Many of these medicines were either ineffective or deleterious to RLS."}, {"Title": "'Abnormalities and deformities': the dissection and interment of the insane poor, 1832-1929.", "Abstract": "The body trade of anatomy schools in Victorian times that underpinned the expansion of medical education has been neglected.

In all diagnostic groups, olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic followed by risperidone. Very few patients (8%) received typical antipsychotic medication. In all diagnostic groups, escitalopram was the most commonly prescribed antidepressant; other frequently prescribed antidepressants were sertraline, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. Among the mood stabilizers, valproate was preferred over lithium. In all the groups, more than half of the patients were prescribed benzodiazepines, clonazepam being the most commonly prescribed agent, followed by lorazepam. The mean number of psychotropic medications was highest in the bipolar disorder group. Very few patients received the combination of same group of drugs.\nOlanzapine, escitalopram, and clonazepam are the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, respectively.

The older population is rapidly increasing worldwide and, as a result of deinstitutionalization in mental health care, older persons are remaining at home to a greater extent. Although they constitute a large proportion of the population, older persons with mental disorders have been neglected in research as well as in care organizations. As there is little previous knowledge concerning older persons' experiences of their own situations, this study aimed to illuminate the meaning of the life situation as experienced by older persons with mental disorders (excluding dementia disorders). Interviews were conducted with seven older persons and the text was analyzed using a phenomenological hermeneutical research method, inspired by the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. \"Struggling for existence\" emerged as a main theme in the older persons' narratives, understood as a loss of dignity of identity and involving being troubled and powerless as well as yearning for respect. The older persons fought to master their existence and to be seen for who they are. The study highlights the importance for caregivers, both formal and informal, to avoid focusing on the diagnoses and rather acknowledge the older persons and their lifeworld, be present in the relation and help them rebuild their dignity of identity. This study brings a new understanding about older persons with mental disorders that may help reduce stigma and contribute to planning future mental health care."}, {"Title": "Serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effects of childhood adversity on posttraumatic stress disorder risk: a replication study.", "Abstract": "We reported that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) moderates the effect of childhood adversity on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk [Xie et al.

In the present study, we considered 5,178 subjects (a group with generally high substance dependence comorbidity, as for our previous study) using similar methodology to replicate our previous results. We used logistic regression analyses to explore the interaction effect of 5-HTTLPR genotype and childhood adversity on PTSD risk. We found that, as reported in our previous study, in individuals with childhood adversity, the presence of one or two copies of the S allele of 5-HTTLPR increased the risk to develop PTSD.

This assessment has to draw on research results on factors determining effectiveness. This must be seen against the background of a lack of high-quality trials in Germany. The article discusses system, context and setting factors related to the transfer of evidence on community-based service models from other countries. These issues are discussed on the basis of evidence concerning the models of case management, assertive community treatment and community mental health teams. International differences in study findings are highlighted and the importance of treatment-as-usual in influencing study results is emphasized. The more control services including elements of community-based care there are and the less the pressure to reduce inpatient treatment (threshold to inpatient care admission), the smaller the relative effect sizes of innovative care models will be.In the absence of direct evidence, careful examination of transferability is required before introducing health care models. Research has revealed solid evidence for several factors influencing the effects of innovative community mental health care. Among key factors in the care of people with severe mental illness, home visits and joint team responsibility for both psychiatric and social care were identified.

Half of the patients reported experiencing anxiety from time to time. Patients with Lewy-body dementia reported anxiety more often compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease. Anxiety was associated with depression, higher caregiver stress, and more dementia-related impairment, but not with cognitive test performance. Caregiver stress and higher CDR score increased the odds for anxiety significantly, even when controlling for depression.\nAnxiety is common in patients with mild dementia, and seems to be associated not so much with cognitive test performance than with caregiver distress and the patient's ability to function in daily life.

The results for each individual query was manually examined for relevance to the functional neurosurgery field in order to arrive at the top 100 most highly cited papers as well as the citation classics.\nThe top 100 most cited papers, including 61 citation classics, in the stereotactic and functional neurosurgery field can be divided into 7 categories: functional/anatomic studies, technological innovations, and papers relevant to movement disorders, pain, psychiatry, radiosurgery and epilepsy.\nWe have attempted to ascertain which papers have had, and continue to have, significant impact in our rapidly advancing field. At a minimum, the citation classics in functional neurosurgery provide both trainees and seasoned surgeons with a reading list of the 'must-know' works in the field - works whose influence have helped shape the direction of functional neurosurgery well into the future."}, {"Title": "Stress-related depression: neuroendocrine, genetic, and therapeutical aspects.", "Abstract": "To summarize current concepts on neuroendocrine and genetic principles underlying stress-related depression and to discuss the challenges of personalized treatment in depression.\nReview of the literature pertaining to genetic and neuroendocrine basis of stress-related depression including aspects of treatment response with a focus on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.\nThere is increasing evidence that genetic polymorphisms and dysregulation of the HPA axis are associated with the pathophysiology of stress-related depression.

The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is both contested and stigmatized, in mental health and general health settings. Its legitimacy is further contested within the specialist adolescent mental health setting. In this setting, clinicians face a quandary regarding the application of adult diagnostic criteria to an adolescent population, aged less than 18 years. This article presents an analysis of interviews undertaken with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) clinicians in two publicly funded Australian services, about their use of the BPD diagnosis. In contrast with notions of primacy of diagnosis or of transparency in communications, doctors, nurses and allied health clinicians resisted and subverted a diagnosis of BPD in their work with adolescents. We delineate specific social and discursive strategies that clinicians displayed and reflected on, including: team rules which discouraged diagnostic disclosure; the lexical strategy of hedging when using the diagnosis; the prohibition and utility of informal 'borderline talk' among clinicians; and reframing the diagnosis with young people. For clinicians, these strategies legitimated their scepticism and enabled them to work with diagnostic uncertainty, in a population identified as vulnerable. For adolescent identities, these strategies served to forestall a BPD trajectory, allowing room for troubled adolescents to move and grow. These findings illuminate how the contest surrounding this diagnosis in principle is expressed in everyday clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Chronic renal failure in lithium-using geriatric patients: effects of lithium continuation versus discontinuation--a 60-month retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Lithium remains an important treatment in bipolar disorder. Although lithium is often discontinued because of signs of renal failure, it is unclear if this alters the course of renal function in the majority of patients. We hypothesize that in geriatric patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), who have a high burden of medical illness, lithium continuation does not significantly impact renal function (glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)).\nWe conducted a retrospective study of tertiary-care geriatric psychiatry outpatients with a history of lithium use and evidence of CRF (eGFR \u2264 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 on \u2265 2 occasions in \u2265 3 months). The 27 patients who met these criteria were divided into lithium 'continuers' (continued use \u2265 2 years following CRF) and 'discontinuers'. Mean eGFR and creatinine were followed at 21 and 60 months after developing CRF.\nMean serum eGFR and creatinine were not significantly different between groups at any time during follow-up. When comparing renal function at 60 months to baseline, a trend towards increased creatinine was seen in continuers (p = 0.06) but not in discontinuers. Changes in eGFR in continuers and discontinuers after 60 months did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.35 and 0.98). However, clinically important decreases in eGFR occurred in the majority of continuers but in none of the discontinuers.\nThere was a trend towards declining renal function in lithium continuers at 60-month follow-up. Future prospective longitudinal studies will be needed to confirm our findings. We suggest vigilance and close monitoring of renal function when continuing CRF patients on lithium for extended periods."}, {"Title": "Polymorphisms of the drug transporter gene ABCB1 predict side effects of treatment with cabergoline in patients with PRL adenomas.", "Abstract": "Treatment with dopamine agonists in patients with prolactin (PRL) adenomas and Parkinson's disease is associated with central side effects. Central side effects may depend on a substance's ability to pass the blood-brain barrier, which can be actively controlled by transporter molecules such as the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by the ABCB1 gene.\nWe aimed to determine whether cabergoline is transported by the P-gp and whether polymorphisms of its encoding ABCB1 gene predict central side effects of cabergoline therapy in patients with PRL adenomas. i) In an experimental mouse model lacking the homologues of the human ABCB1 gene (Abcb1ab double knockout mouse model), we examined whether cabergoline is a substrate of the P-gp using eight mutant and eight wild-type mice. ii) In a human case-control study including 79 patients with PRL adenomas treated with cabergoline at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, we investigated the association of four selected ABCB1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1045642, rs2032582, rs2032583 and rs2235015), with the occurrence of central side effects under cabergoline therapy.\ni) In the experimental mouse model, we observed that brain concentrations of cabergoline were tenfold higher in the mutant mice compared with their wild-type littermates, implying that cabergoline is indeed a substrate of the transporter P-gp at the blood-brain barrier level. ii) In the human study, we observed significant negative associations under cabergoline for the C-carriers and heterozygous CT individuals of SNP rs1045642 with two central side effects (frequency of fatigue and sleep disorders) and for the G-carriers of SNP rs2032582 with the enhancement of dizziness. For the SNPs rs2235015 and rs2032583, no associations with central side effects under cabergoline were found.\nThis is the first study demonstrating that individual ABCB1 gene polymorphisms, reflecting a different expression and function of the P-gp, could predict the occurrence of central side effects under cabergoline.

A qualitative study.", "Abstract": "To explore the practice of cooperation in mental health care across services and identify conditions that promote and inhibit cooperation.\nFocus groups with relevant service providers were conducted in four exemplary regions in Germany (rural/ urban and East/West). The discussions were content analysed.\nSeven central categories were deduced: (1) involved service providers, (2) comprehension, (3) reasons, (4) instruments for cooperation, (5) promoting and inhibiting conditions, (6) interdisciplinarity, and (7) regional and personal networks. Cooperation is practiced in networks, rather than defined relations. Who is involved in cooperation depends on patients/clients needs and may vary from case to case. Service providers do not have theoretical concepts of cooperation. Cooperation relies not only on personal contacts and knowledge between services but also on time, financial reimbursement and the social capital of the environment. In particular, cooperation with physicians was considered to be difficult by non-medical professionals. Physician's role models do not seem to include cooperation with other disciplines as a core task.\nTo improve cooperation, regional and sustainable mental health networks have to be systematically implemented by providing leadership, time and reimbursement for network meetings.

Still, it has not yet received much attention in psychiatry, and particularly in alcohol-dependence. The present study investigates the cerebral correlates of crossmodal integration deficits in alcohol-dependence to assess whether these deficits are due to the mere accumulation of unimodal impairments or rather to specific alterations in crossmodal areas.\nTwenty-eight subjects [14 alcohol-dependent subjects (ADS), 14 paired controls] were scanned using fMRI while performing a categorization task on faces (F), voices (V) and face-voice pairs (FV). A subtraction contrast [FV-(F+V)] and a conjunction analysis [(FV-F) \u2229 (FV-V)] isolated the brain areas specifically involved in crossmodal face-voice integration. The functional connectivity between unimodal and crossmodal areas was explored using psycho-physiological interactions (PPI).\nADS presented only moderate alterations during unimodal processing. More centrally, in the subtraction contrast and conjunction analysis, they did not show any specific crossmodal brain activation while controls presented activations in specific crossmodal areas (inferior occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule). Moreover, PPI analyses showed reduced connectivity between unimodal and crossmodal areas in alcohol-dependence.\nThis first fMRI exploration of crossmodal processing in alcohol-dependence showed a specific face-voice integration deficit indexed by reduced activation of crossmodal areas and reduced connectivity in the crossmodal integration network.

In India, little is known about the extent, severity and unmet need of treatment mental disorders. Thus, there was a need to carry out rigorously implemented general population surveys that estimate the prevalence of mental disorders among urban population at Pune, Maharashtra. The study attempted to address unmet need and to form a basis for formulating the mental health need of the community.\nThe study was undertaken to estimate the lifetime prevalence and 12 month prevalence of specific mental disorders in urban population, socio-demographic correlates of mental disorders and to assess the service utilization in individuals with mental disorders.\nThe study was undertaken among adults aged 18 years and above living in house hold and in geographical area of Pune , Maharashtra.

Although this effort is ongoing, the current situation of the molecular genetics of SCZ seems disappointing or rather perplexing. Furthermore, a prominent discrepancy between persistence of the disease at a relatively high prevalence and a low reproductive fitness of patients creates a paradox. Heterozygote advantage works to sustain the frequency of a putative susceptibility gene in the mitochondrial genome model (MGM) but not in the NGM.\nWe deduced a criterion that every nuclear susceptibility gene for SCZ should fulfill for the persistence of the disease under general assumptions of the multifactorial threshold model. SCZ-associated variants listed in the top 45 in the SZGene Database (the version of the 23rd December, 2011) were selected, and the distribution of the genes that could meet or do not meet the criterion was surveyed.\n19 SCZ-associated variants that do not meet the criterion are located outside the regions where the SCZ-associated variants that could meet the criterion are located. Since a SCZ-associated variant that does not meet the criterion cannot be a susceptibility gene, but instead must be a protective gene, it should be linked to a susceptibility gene in the NGM, which is contrary to these results. On the other hand, every protective gene on any chromosome can be associated with SCZ in the MGM. Based on the MGM we propose a new hypothesis that assumes brain-specific antioxidant defenses in which trans-synaptic activations of dopamine- and N-methyl-d-aspartate-receptors are involved. Most of the ten predictions of this hypothesis seem to accord with the major epidemiological facts and the results of association studies to date.\nThe central paradox of SCZ genetics and the results of association studies to date argue against the NGM, and in its place the MGM is emerging as a viable option to account for genomic and pathophysiological research findings involving SCZ."}, {"Title": "[Clinical analysis of patients with acute and severe mental disorders complicated with hypokalemia].", "Abstract": "To study the occurrence and characteristics of hypokalemia to the patients with acute and severe mental disorders, and analyze its influencing factors.\nThere were 815 patients with actue and severe mental disorder admitted into our psychiatry department from June 2009 to May 2010, who all received the examination of potassium concentration routinely at the admission.

In a more recent study, over a large period of 24 years, continuity of psychopathology was found from childhood into adulthood; anxious/ depressed and other problems in childhood were core predictors for adult psychopathology. Other studies also show that there is substantial continuity, morbidity, and potential mortality from suicide into adulthood in patients with adolescent-onset major depressive disorder. Formerly depressed adolescents are at higher risk for recurrence of major depressive disorder during young adulthood; more specifically, depressed adolescents are at 2-7 times increased odds of being depressed as adults, compared with non-depressed controls. In addition, recent studies indicate that symptoms of depression in adolescence strongly predict an episode of major depression, suicidal ideation and rates for treatment for depression in adulthood, even among adolescents without major depression. The Maudsley long-term follow-up of child and adolescent depression showed that adolescent depression carries an elevated risk of adult depression irrespective of comorbidity, and that comorbid conduct disorder in childhood is associated with raised rates of other psychiatric outcomes. Personality disorders, i.e. of dependent, antisocial, passive-aggressive, and histrionic type, may represent alternative pathways of continuity for major depressive disorder and other Axis I disorders across the child-adult transition. Bipolar disorder in childhood is often found to be associated with long delays to first treatment. Studies have shown that both childhood onset and treatment delay are associated with a persistently more adverse course of illness in adulthood. Earlier and more effective treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents would result in a more benign illness and a better prognosis in adulthood. Lastly, parental depression is a strong and consistent risk factor for offspring major depression and anxiety disorder. When offspring mature into young adulthood, effects of parental depression and family discord persist. Because child and especially adolescent mood disorders are likely to continue into adulthood, early identification, assessment and treatment are warranted; capacity for treatment of children at earlier stages of risk and disorder needs to be developed in other public sectors, such as primary health care and schools. In addition, continuity of care from childhood and adolescence to adulthood is needed."}, {"Title": "[Awareness of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Greece].", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopment disorder of childhood that persists into adulthood in the majority of cases. In adults, the clinical picture of ADHD is complex and comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is the rule. The documentation that the disorder had a childhood onset and the various comorbid symptomatologies present both in childhood and adult life represent the most influential obstacles for the accurate clinical diagnosis of the disorder. In 75% of cases with adult ADHD there is at least one coexisting comorbid disorder, with anxiety and mood disorders as well as substance abuse and impulse control disorders being the most prevalent ones. Adult psychiatrists have limited experience in the diagnosis, treatment and overall management of the disorder. Greece is a member of the European Network Adult ADHD (ENAA), founded in 2003, aiming to increase awareness of the disorder and to improve knowledge and patient care for adults with ADHD across Europe. A clinic where diagnosis as well as treatment recommendations are given after a thorough assessment of adult ADHD patients, is hosted at the First Department of Psychiatry of the Athens National and Kapodistian University. The clinic is in close collaboration with ENAA. The diagnosis of ADHD is given after a detailed evaluation of the patient, based on history taken, self-administered questionnaires and a specific psychiatric interview. The reliable trace of the symptoms' onset back in early childhood, current symptomatology, as well as its impact on at least two major areas of functioning (school, home, work or personal relationships) are pivotal for the assessment procedure. Special attention should be paid in the distinction of symptoms often coexisting with the core symptoms of the ADHD, such as emotional liability, incessant mental activity, avoidance of situations like queuing, especially when there is also frustration, from those indicating a comorbid disorder, e.g. bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders or personality disorders. Its coexistence with substance abuse requires special attention, as ADHD is quite prevalent in this group. In order to treat an ADHD patient the rule is a multidimensional intervention. Comorbid psychiatric disorders must be treated first. Psychoeducation of the patient is needed in most of the cases as well as the admin istration of specific for the ADHD psychotropic medication. Coaching, Cognitive Therapy and family interventions are proved to be the most efficacious psychosocial treatments. In the context of our university outpatients' clinic an observation study for exploring the occurrence of ADHD among patients with anxiety and depressive disorders took place. 15% of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders received for the first time in their lives the diagnosis of ADHD. The above mentioned indicate the need for further training psychiatrists in the recognition and treatment of adult ADHD."}, {"Title": "[Continuities and discontinuities of psychopathology from childhood to adulthood].", "Abstract": "Important data about possible continuities and discontinuities of psychopathology from childhood to adulthood have been provided by findings from well scheduled prospective longitudinal studies of community-based samples. Findings from clinical populations have contributed as well. This presentation relies on data from selected studies of reference. An effort is made to combine results demonstrating the extent of continuity at a more general level with those indicating continuities or discontinuities concerning disorders commonly presented in clinical practice. These disorders are those included in the internalizing (anxiety and mood disorders) and externalizing (ADHD, oppositional, conduct disorder-antisocial personality disorder) domains of psychopathology. Discontinuities do exist, however findings also suggest considerable longitudinal links between childhood-adolescence and adulthood. Reports from the Dunedin longitudinal study showed that half of those with psychiatric diagnoses at the age of 26 had met criteria for psychiatric disorder by the age of 15, and that figure approached 75% by the age of 18. Homotypic continuity is the most prominent. There are also heterotypic continuities, while homotypic and heterotypic continuities may co-occur. Among common disorders, findings suggest continuity tendencies even for anxiety disorders and for subclinical cases with obsessive and compulsive symptoms as well. Comorbidity between different anxiety disorders (strict homotypic continuity) as well as between them and depression (broad homotypic continuity) is very common. In the externalizing domain, longitudinal links between conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder, including adverse consequences in psychosocial functioning, have been repeatedly found. Childhood onset subtype of conduct disorder is more prone to this adverse outcome, however all cases with conduct disorder need early recognition and intervention. During the course of conduct disorder, substance use is now recognized as a kind of homotypic continuity. About half of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cases continue into adulthood. These individuals usually face problems in several aspects of their adult life, such as interpersonal relationships, educational and occupational functioning. In ADHD cases, the emergence of conduct disorder worsens the adverse outcome; therefore prevention of this complication is of significant importance for intervention. There are indications that oppositional disorder cases may be heterogeneous and that this may explain the heterotypic continuities that have been found so far. Many aspects are open to further study, particularly those concerning the possible mechanisms involved in continuities or discontinuities in various disorders. Data suggesting the extent of continuities are important for both child psychiatry and psychiatry. Attention should be focused on early intervention, services provision and cooperation. The latter is of vital importance during the transition from child to adult services."}, {"Title": "Is the neo-Kraepelinian paradigm in a phase of crisis?", "Abstract": "The neo-Kraepelinian paradigm has been the dominant paradigm in psychiatry since the introduction of DSM-III in 1980. Though successful in achieving reliability and in some other respects, it also has limitations. Lately, it has been argued that a paradigm shift is needed in psychiatric diagnosis. The aim of this paper is to review evidence of the limitations of DSM and to determine whether our classification system is in a phase of crisis in the Kuhnian sense. The most important criticisms raised since the early eighties include: the psychodynamic objection, the descriptive approach criticism, the criticism of poor diagnostic validity, and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk's critique. The author concludes that these old objections are not a real threat. In particular, problems stemming from the descriptive approach and low diagnostic validity are not attributable to DSM but are due to under-achievements in psychiatry. On the other hand, the new problems seem more serious and may be considered signs of crisis. These include high rates of false positives, high levels of pseudo-comorbidity, and other deficiencies attributed to the categorical approach. However, because of the advantages of this approach and the lack of a serious candidate available to replace it, a paradigm shift seems highly unlikely. The real source of the problem is not the categorical model but the low validity of some of our categories. If our etiopathological understanding of all the categories were to reach that of medical disorders, no paradigm shift would seem necessary."}, {"Title": "Clinicians' perspectives on a Web-based system for routine outcome monitoring in old-age psychiatry in the Netherlands.", "Abstract": "In health care, the use of physical parameters to monitor physical disease progress is common. In mental health care, the periodic measurement of a client's functioning during treatment, or routine outcome monitoring, has recently become important. Online delivery of questionnaires has the potential to reduce clinicians' resistance to the implementation of routine outcome monitoring. Online delivery enables clinicians to receive results on a questionnaire in a graphic directly after data entry. This gives them insight into the progress of a client at a single glance.\nTo explore clinicians' perspectives on a routine outcome monitoring procedure where questionnaires and feedback on scores were delivered online. Questionnaires could also be filled out on paper and then entered into the online system by a research assistant.\nIn 2009 we sent an online survey, consisting of five yes-or-no questions and six open-ended questions, to all clinicians in the 14 mental health care organizations working with the routine outcome monitoring system in the Netherlands. Of the 172 clinicians contacted, 80 (47%) opened the link and 70 of these 80 (88%) clinicians completed the survey.\nClinicians seldom used the graphical feedback from the Web-based system, which indicates that direct feedback on scores did not enhance the implementation of routine outcome monitoring. Integration into the electronic patient record and more training on interpretation and implementation of feedback in daily practice were seen as the primary points for further improvement. It was mainly the availability of a research assistant that made the routine outcome monitoring procedure feasible.\nWithout a research assistant and training in the interpretation of outcomes, software programs alone cannot ensure effective implementation of monitoring activities in everyday practice."}, {"Title": "Attitudes toward concordance in psychiatry: a comparative, cross-sectional study of psychiatric patients and mental health professionals.", "Abstract": "Concordance and Shared Decision-Making (SDM) are considered measures of the quality of care that improves communication, promotes patient participation, creates a positive relationship with the healthcare professional, and results in greater adherence with the treatment plan.\nThis study compares the attitudes of 225 mental health professionals (125 psychiatrists and 100 psychiatry registrars) and 449 psychiatric outpatients towards SDM and concordance in medicine taking by using the \"Leeds Attitude toward Concordance Scale\" (LATCon).\nThe internal consistency of the scale was good in all three samples (Cronbach's \u03b1: patients\u2009=\u20090.82, psychiatrists\u2009=\u20090.76, and registrars\u2009=\u20090.82).

Based on their respective experience in psychology and child psychiatry, the authors will focus their analysis on creative potential. First, relationships between creativity (literary, artistic, or scientific creativity) and melancholy (\"melancholy\" comes from the Greek words for \"black\" (\"melas\") and \"bile\" (\"khole\")) will be examined from antiquity to modern times. Aristotle introduced a quantitative factor, asserting that levels of melancholy and black bile are positively correlated; however, under a given threshold of black bile, it can give rise to an exceptional being. Second, the case study of Blaise Pascal (scientific and philosophical creativity associated with major depressive episodes from childhood) will be presented and discussed. This case study sheds light on the paradoxical role of depression in the overinvestment in intellectual and creative spheres as well as on the impact of traumatic events on high intellectual potential. Third, observations will be reported based on a study conducted on 100 children with high intellectual potential (6-12 years old). Finally, based on these different levels of analysis, it appears that heterogeneity of mental functioning in children with high intellectual potential is at the center of the creative process and it has related psychological vulnerability."}, {"Title": "Organ extracts and the development of psychiatry: hormonal treatments at the Maudsley Hospital 1923-1938.", "Abstract": "The use of organ extracts to treat psychiatric disorder in the interwar period is an episode in the history of psychiatry which has largely been forgotten. An analysis of case-notes from The Maudsley Hospital from the period 1923-1938 shows that the prescription of extracts taken from animal testes, ovaries, thyroids, and other organs was widespread within this London Hospital. This article explores the way in which Maudsley doctors justified these treatments by tying together psychological theories of the unconscious with experimental data drawn from laboratory studies of human organs. It explores the logic behind these treatments and examines beliefs about their efficacy. The connection between this historical episode and current research in endocrinology and psychology is explored."}, {"Title": "When is irritable bowel syndrome not irritable bowel syndrome? Diagnosis and treatment of chronic functional abdominal pain.", "Abstract": "Functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) is a distinct chronic gastrointestinal (GI) pain disorder characterized by the presence of constant or frequently recurring abdominal pain that is not associated with eating, change in bowel habits, or menstrual periods. The pain experience in FAPS is predominantly centrally driven as compared to other chronic painful GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic pancreatitis where peripherally acting factors play a major role in driving the pain. Psychosocial factors are often integrally associated with the disorder and can pose significant challenges to evaluation and treatment. Patients suffer from considerable loss of function, which can drive health care utilization. Treatment options are limited at best with most therapeutic regimens extrapolated from pain management of other functional GI disorders and chronic pain conditions. A comprehensive approach to management using a biopsychosocial construct and collaboration with pain specialists and psychiatry is most beneficial to the management of this disorder."}, {"Title": "Mobile psychiatry: towards improving the care for bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Mental health has long been a neglected problem in global healthcare. The social and economic impacts of conditions affecting the mind are still underestimated. However, in recent years it is becoming more apparent that mental disorders are a growing global concern and there is a necessity of developing novel services and researching effective means of providing interventions to sufferers. Such novel services could include technology-based solutions already used in other healthcare applications but are yet to make their way into standard psychiatric practice.\nThis manuscript proposes a system where sensors are utilised to devise an \"early warning\" system for patients with bipolar disorder. The system, containing wearable and environmental sensors, would collect behavioural data independent from the patient's self-report. To test the feasibility of the concept, a prototype system was devised, which was followed by trials including four healthy volunteers as well as a bipolar patient.\nThe sensors utilised in the study yielded behavioural data which may be of significant use in detecting early effects of a bipolar episode. Basic processing performed on particular data inputs provided information about activity patterns in areas, which are usually strongly influenced by the course of Bipolar Disorder.\nThe manuscript discusses the basic usage issues and other barriers which are to be tackled before technology-based approaches to mental care can be successfully rolled out and their true value appraised."}, {"Title": "[Patient education in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "A nursing team from the day hospital of the Paris association for mental health assistance has been providing multi-disciplinary care to patients presenting serious personality disorders.

An informal survey of our residents suggests that residents find the templates useful, though they have advantages and disadvantages.

Part of the insufficient access to treatment is a function of relatively low levels or professional experts in addiction medicine. Part of the low levels of professional addiction experts is the result of inadequate addiction medicine training of medical students and residents. This article outlines deficits in addiction medicine training among medical students and residents, yet real change in the addiction medicine training process will always be subject to the complexity of producing alterations across multiple credentialing institutions as well as the keen competition between educators for \u201cmore time\u201d for their particular subject. Other hurdles include the broad-based issue of stigma regarding alcoholism and other substance abuse that likely impact all systems that regulate physician addiction medicine training. As noted in the discussion of psychiatry residency, even psychiatry residents manifest stigma regarding substance abusing patients. Five currently active processes may allow for fundamental change to the inertia in physician addiction medicine training while also potentially impacting stigma: 1. We appear to be at the beginning of the integration of addiction into traditional medicine through the formation of a legitimized addiction medicine subspecialty. 2. The training of primary care trainees and practitioners in the use of SBIRT is accelerating, thus creating another process of addiction integration into traditional medicine. 3. The PCMH is being established as a model for primary care 4. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) became effective for group health care plan years beginning on or after July 1, 2010; thereby, substance abuse benefits and cost are to be the same as general medical or surgical benefits. 5. The equalizer is prescription drug abuse, which is increasing recognition of addiction among populations where it was previously ignored or denied. The first three activities will create a medical office \u201cexperience\u201d that is largely unknown but carries the power to change the perception of addiction: patients visiting their primary care physicians, who then screen them for addiction problems and give the same attention to treatment and prevention of addiction problems as they might give to treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and other medical issues. The personal experience of the aforementioned medical scene by members of US society may also provide a very positive impact on psychiatrists, including those who specialize in addiction medicine. It is quite possible that the recognition of addiction medicine as a traditional medical subspecialty as well as the integration of addiction throughout medicine will precede any substantive change in the integration of mental health care with the rest of medicine. Yet, any integration of addiction within the entire field of medicine may open a path for mental health to follow. Psychiatrists, including those who are addiction experts, need to be a part of this new medical integration process. Being a part of new treatment models is why we proposed six future skillsets for psychiatrists who specialize in addiction. The selection of these proposed skillsets anticipates an integrated health care team utilizing some form of a patient-centered approach-three are skillsets that are already required, while the last three address new skillsets that will be helpful in working with the integrative health care team model. Whatever form the future of addiction care takes, psychiatrists who specialize in addiction medicine can provide positive and core contributions as expert addiction and mental health consultants including: 1. How does one screen for major depression and/or an anxiety disorder and also determine a diagnosis? 2. In prescribing, what constitutes legitimate follow-up of patients on antidepressants and antianxiety agents, including how to avoid additional substance abuse problems when prescribing sedative-hypnotics? 3. When and how should patients be referred to a psychiatrist? Finally, it is important to note that any of the potential changes described in this article need to influence only 10% of the approximately 17 million current heavy drinkers to seek treatment to equal the approximately 1.7 million heavy drinkers who are now in treatment, let alone any of the approximately 50 million current at-risk drinkers, virtually none of whom are in treatment. Among other social changes that will alter the future of addiction treatment, the integration of addiction into traditional medicine may go a long way in altering the current ratios of who seeks treatment and is willing to participate in treatment."}, {"Title": "Serotonergic hallucinogens and emerging targets for addiction pharmacotherapies.", "Abstract": "Only time will tell if serotonergic hallucinogen-assisted psychotherapy treatment paradigms for SUDs will prove to be safe and effective in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. If they are, they would truly constitute a novel psychopharmacologic-psychosocial treatment paradigm to treat addictive disorders, although the risk of adverse psychological events would have to be controlled through a careful screening process and the risk of misuse of the substances or developing use syndromes would have to be considered, although the overall risk would be low because, as mentioned, SHs are unlike all other drugs of abuse in that they do not appear to produce dependence syndromes. There effects on the NA and DA range from inhibition to slight activation, all this without producing addiction. The ability of these medicinal tools to treat a range of addictive, psychiatric, and existential disorders is remarkable in scope and possibility.

Although I concur with Bonnie's historical analysis, as well as with his underlying moral approach, I suggest that, to attain a broader view of the contribution of forensic psychiatry, it is important to be open to additional narratives of its development. The supplemental narrative that I offer highlights values other than those that were highlighted by Bonnie that are deeply rooted and equally inherent in the practice of forensic psychiatry.

Many psychiatrists would be likely to advocate that the practice of covert medication in emergency psychiatry is not clinically, ethically, or legally acceptable. This article explores whether there may be exceptions to this stance that would be ethical. We first review the standard of emergency psychiatric care. Although we could identify no published empirical studies of covert administration of medicine in emergency departments, we review the prevalence of this practice in other clinical settings. While the courts have not ruled with respect to covert medication, we discuss the evolving legal landscape of informed consent, competency, and the right to refuse treatment. We discuss dilemmas regarding the ethics involved in this practice, including the tensions among autonomy, beneficence, and duty to protect. We explore how differences between cultures regarding the value placed on individual versus family autonomy may affect perspectives with regard to this practice. We investigate how consumers view this practice and their treatment preferences during a psychiatric emergency. Finally, we discuss psychiatric advance directives and explore how these contracts may affect the debate over the practice."}, {"Title": "[Knowledge derived from studies on crack: an incursion into Brazilian dissertations and theses].", "Abstract": "This is a systematic review based on the integrative review method, which sought to analyze the characteristics of knowledge produced by studies on crack, in Brazilian Master's and Doctoral courses.

Research interviews are designed to improve diagnostic reliability and validity, but vary in how they incorporate DSM-IV-TR criteria for pediatric BD.\nWe examined DSM-IV-TR criteria and the descriptive text for a manic episode and the mania sections of six commonly used pediatric diagnostic research interviews focusing on the following: interpretation of DSM-IV-TR, recommendations for administration, and scoring methods.\nThere are differences between the DSM-IV-TR manic episode criteria and descriptive text. Instruments vary in several ways including in their conceptualization of the mood criterion, whether symptoms must represent a change from the child's usual state, and whether B-criteria are required to co-occur with the A-criterion. Instruments also differ on recommendations for administration and scoring methods.\nGiven the differences between DSM-IV-TR manic episode criteria and explanatory text, it is not surprising that there is considerable variation between diagnostic instruments based on DSM-IV-TR.

However, potential study participants are often receiving psychotropic medications which can possibly confound imaging data. To better interpret the results of neuroimaging studies in BD, it is important to understand the impact of medications on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nTo better understand the impact of medications on imaging data, we conducted a literature review and searched MEDLINE for papers that included the key words bipolar disorder and fMRI, sMRI, or DTI. The search was limited to papers that assessed medication effects and had not been included in a previous review by Phillips et al. (Medication effects in neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder. Am J Psychiatry 2008; 165: 313-320). This search yielded 74 sMRI studies, 46 fMRI studies, and 15 DTI studies.\nMedication appeared to influence many sMRI studies, but had limited impact on fMRI and DTI findings. From the structural studies, the most robust finding (20/45 studies) was that lithium was associated with increased volumes in areas important for mood regulation, while antipsychotic agents and anticonvulsants were generally not. Regarding secondary analysis of the medication effects of fMRI and DTI studies, few showed significant effects of medication, although rigorous analyses were typically not possible when the majority of subjects were medicated. Medication effects were more frequently observed in longitudinal studies designed to assess the impact of particular medications on the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. With a few exceptions, the observed effects were normalizing, meaning that the medicated individuals with BD were more similar than their unmedicated counterparts to healthy subjects.\nThe effects of psychotropic medications, when present, are predominantly normalizing and thus do not seem to provide an alternative explanation for differences in volume, white matter tracts, or BOLD signal between BD participants and healthy subjects. However, the normalizing effects of medication could obfuscate differences between BD and healthy subjects, and thus might lead to type II errors."}, {"Title": "The functional neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder: a consensus model.", "Abstract": "Functional neuroimaging methods have proliferated in recent years, such that functional magnetic resonance imaging, in particular, is now widely used to study bipolar disorder. However, discrepant findings are common. A workgroup was organized by the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH, USA) to develop a consensus functional neuroanatomic model of bipolar I disorder based upon the participants' work as well as that of others.\nRepresentatives from several leading bipolar disorder neuroimaging groups were organized to present an overview of their areas of expertise as well as focused reviews of existing data. The workgroup then developed a consensus model of the functional neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder based upon these data.\nAmong the participants, a general consensus emerged that bipolar I disorder arises from abnormalities in the structure and function of key emotional control networks in the human brain. Namely, disruption in early development (e.g., white matter connectivity and prefrontal pruning) within brain networks that modulate emotional behavior leads to decreased connectivity among ventral prefrontal networks and limbic brain regions, especially the amygdala. This developmental failure to establish healthy ventral prefrontal-limbic modulation underlies the onset of mania and ultimately, with progressive changes throughout these networks over time and with affective episodes, a bipolar course of illness.\nThis model provides a potential substrate to guide future investigations and areas needing additional focus are identified."}, {"Title": "Epistemology of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In historical and epistemological terms, psychiatry is a new discipline born during the 19th century. Rooted in both the natural and social sciences, psychiatric objects of inquiry, namely mental symptoms and mental disorders, are hybrid, constituted by the blending of components arising from disparate sources of knowledge ranging from the biological to the semantic in its widest sense. This poses problems for psychiatric research and therapy. Whilst conventional pluralism may be a convenient approach to manage aspects of psychiatric practice, it lacks the capacity to analyse psychiatric objects in their entirety. For the latter, psychiatry demands a new, tailored regional epistemology. This paper outlines the main features of an epistemology specific to the needs of psychiatry. It highlights the relational approach that needs to be taken and illustrates the usefulness of this approach by analysing the structure of psychiatric objects, exploring the manner in which they may be inscribed in the brain, and identifying the need to periodically recalibrate the language of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "An ethical framework for assessments of criminal responsibility: applying Susan Wolf's account of sanity to forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Within the context of an ethical theory of responsibility, Susan Wolf has argued that people can only be considered fully responsible for their actions when they are sane.

The goal of this paradigm would be to diminish the sense of failure and inadequacy felt by many psychiatrists who experience the suicide of a patient and to increase understanding of the unique biopsychosocial profile of those whose suicides appear to be inevitable. The author stresses that this proposed paradigm should not be misconstrued as therapeutic nihilism but rather should serve to stimulate efforts to treat this patient population more effectively. Risk factors that place individuals at high risk for suicide are reviewed, including presence of a mental illness, genetic predisposition, and factors such as a history of abuse, divorce, unemployment, male gender, recent discharge from a psychiatric hospital, prior suicide attempts, alcohol or other substance abuse, a history of panic attacks, and persistent suicidal thoughts, especially if coupled with a plan. The author notes that, in those suicides that appear to have been inevitable, risk factors are not only numerous but at the extreme end of profound pathology. The example of Ernest Hemingway is used to illustrate how such a combination of risk factors may have contributed to his eventual suicide. Psychiatrists, like other doctors, may have to acknowledge that some psychiatric disorders are associated with a high mortality rate as a natural outcome. This could lead to heightened vigilance, a more realistic view of what can and cannot be achieved with therapy, and efforts to improve the quality of life of patients at high risk for suicide with the goal of reducing this risk and prolonging their lives.

The author contends that the psychosocial knowledge and psychotherapeutic skills of the psychiatrist must be integral to those paradigms. Abandoning crude, descriptive diagnostic categories in favor of discrete, dimensional measures that personalize selective neurobiological treatment for each individual is part of one proposed paradigm-but psychotherapy, especially psychodynamic therapies, have provided personalized therapy for over a century, using nature's own resources (human relationships and communication) to modulate the patient's unique, fixed patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior regardless of DSM diagnosis. Similarly, beyond the genetic core, the role of development and experience in shaping mental health and illness includes both neurobiological and interpersonal processes that dynamically modulate neural networks and their mental epiphenomena. Psychosocial interventions, using natural pathways, are vital for both prevention and treatment. Another proposed paradigm embraces closer coordination of psychiatric services with primary care in organized systems, which would probably include non-medical psychotherapists as well. Psychiatrists cannot effectively oversee, supervise, partner, or consult with other physicians or therapists if they have no psychotherapeutic awareness. Even when the primary mode of treatment is biological, skilled handling of the doctor-patient relationship is vital to adherence, to helping the patient manage his or her personal life, and even to effectiveness of medication at recommended doses. There is no substitute for instruction and extensive first-hand experience in learning to conduct psychotherapy or psychologically informed patient care. In a psychiatric residency curriculum that is likely to contain greatly increased attention to clinical neuroscience, time for the psyche must be preserved. The new paradigm might require a lengthened residency or additional fellowship years, which must include appropriate attention to psychosocial learning and psychotherapeutic expertise."}, {"Title": "Does age moderate the effect of personality disorder on coping style in psychiatric inpatients?", "Abstract": "To examine age-related differences in the relationship between personality and coping strategies in an Australian population of psychiatric inpatients.\nConsenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and non-English speaking patients were excluded).\nOlder adults reported less symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies.\nThis study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age.

As drugs have become the more dominant treatment in psychiatry and primary care, this approach is increasingly criticized as limited in scope, lacking in robust outcomes and too heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. Our objective is to show that recent advances in neurobiology are clarifying that learning and environmental experiences, such as psychotherapy, change brain circuits as do drugs. The leading notion of how therapeutic effects occur in psychiatric disorders is that they happen when symptoms are reduced by improving the efficiency of information processing in hypothetically malfunctioning brain circuits.\nWith this formulation of psychiatric symptoms and their relief, it is not surprising that both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology can be clinically effective for treating psychiatric disorders, or indeed that combining them can be therapeutically synergistic. Psychotherapy, including a new spinoff of cognitive behavioural therapy called trial-based therapy, like many other forms of learning, can hypothetically induce epigenetic changes in brain circuits that can enhance the efficiency of information processing in malfunctioning neurons to improve symptoms in psychiatric disorders, just like drugs.\nPsychotherapies can be conceptualized as epigenetic 'drugs', or at least as therapeutic agents that act epigenetically in a manner similar or complementary to drugs. These findings are leading to a paradigm shift in psychiatry such that psychotherapy is experiencing a come-back as various standardized, brief, goal-directed psychotherapies are being integrated with drug treatment of psychiatric disorders by psychopharmacologists who have traditionally relied on a drugs-only approach."}, {"Title": "Effects of methylphenidate on basic and higher-order oculomotor functions.", "Abstract": "Eye movements are sensitive indicators of pharmacological effects on sensorimotor and cognitive processing.

Participants performed visually-guided saccades, sinusoidal smooth pursuit, predictive saccades and antisaccades one hour post-capsule administration. Heart rate and blood pressure were assessed prior to capsule administration, and again before and after task performance. Visually-guided saccade latency decreased with MPH (p<0.004). Smooth pursuit gain increased on MPH (p<0.001) and number of saccades during pursuit decreased (p<0.001). Proportion of predictive saccades increased on MPH (p<0.004), specifically in conditions with predictable timing. Peak velocity of predictive saccades increased with MPH (p<0.01).

We close by explaining one of the statistical reasons why heuristics are accurate, and by pointing to psychiatry as one area for future research on heuristics in health care."}, {"Title": "Struggle for life, struggle for love and recognition: the neglected self in social cognitive neuroscience.", "Abstract": "In the following article we present a view that social cognition and social neuroscience, as shaped by the current research paradigms, are not sufficient to improve our understanding of psychopathological phenomena. We hold that the self, self-awareness, and inter-subjectivity are integral to social perception and actions. In addition, we emphasize that the self and self-awareness are, by their very nature and function, involved over the entire lifespan with the way the individual is perceived in the social environment. Likewise, the modes of operation and identification of the self and self-awareness receive strong developmental contributions from social interactions with parental figures, siblings, peers, and significant others. These contributions are framed by a competitive and cooperative struggle for love and recognition. We suggest that in humans social cognitive neuroscience should be informed by a thoughtful appreciation of the equal significance of the struggle for \"life\" and that for love and recognition. In order to be better positioned to improve the research agenda and practice of clinical psychiatry, we propose that cognitive and social neurosciences explicitly incorporate in their models phenomena relative to the self, self-awareness, and inter-subjectivity."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic relationship in the context of perceived coercion in a psychiatric population.", "Abstract": "The relationship between patient and therapist in mental health care is one of the most important treatment factors. It is a reliable predictor of treatment outcome, regardless of diagnosis, setting or of the type of therapy used. On the other hand, influence and coercion occur in patient-physician relationships in psychiatry. We investigated the associations between patients' perceived coercion and the therapeutic relationship. A total of 116 psychiatric patients, who have been admitted to the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich, were interviewed using a structured interview. Data were collected by using Scale To Assess the Therapeutic Relationship (STAR) (therapeutic relationship) and Mac Arthur Admission Experience Survey (AES) (perceived coercion). Associations were investigated using bivariate and multivariate methods. Perceived coercion predicts the patients' appraisal of the therapeutic relationship. We found a moderate relation between the patients' and the clinicians' view of their relationship. Perceived coercion is related to a higher symptom level and a lower level of global functioning at admission, and higher perceived coercion is related to a more negative patient-therapist relationship rated by the patient. Perceived loss of autonomy goes hand in hand with a more negative relationship between the patient and the clinician. This phenomenon has to be impeded, regarding the unambiguous impact relationship quality has on treatment outcome."}, {"Title": "Callous-unemotional traits as a cross-disorders construct.", "Abstract": "Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are currently viewed as the defining signs and symptoms of juvenile psychopathy. It is unclear, however, whether CU traits have validity only in the context of conduct disorder (CD) as proposed by Frick and Moffitt (A proposal to the DSM-V childhood disorders and the ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders work groups to include a specifier to the diagnosis of conduct disorder based on the presence of callous-unemotional traits, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC, 2010), or also outside CD, either in combination with other forms of psychopathology or as a stand-alone construct.\nThe current review systematically studied the existent literature on CU traits in juveniles to examine their validity inside and outside CD according to the framework regarding the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis provided by Robins and Guze (Am J Psychiatry 126:983-987, 1970).\nInside youth with conduct problems, and CD specifically, it seems that CU traits meet the Robins and Guze criteria. As many of the reviewed studies included youth with ODD and ADHD as well, there are indications the same might be true for ODD and ADHD, although probably to a lesser extent. In other disorders, CU traits may be present as well, but their role is not firmly established. As stand-alone construct, data are lacking or are scarce on all of the above-mentioned criteria.\nCU traits are a useful specifier in CD, and possibly also in disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) more generally. High CU traits outside DBDs exist but it is as yet unknown if there is a clinical need for defining CU traits as a stand-alone construct."}, {"Title": "Supervision in psychiatry: terra incognita?", "Abstract": "Supervision is accepted as a part of postgraduate psychiatric training programmes (at least in the western world). However, despite its ubiquity, it is little researched. The purpose of this review was to synthesize research on supervision in psychiatry in the last 3 years (2009-2011). Given the dearth of such research, the boundary was extended to include general medicine and other mental health professions.\nThe lack of research into supervision in psychiatry was confirmed by a comprehensive search of literature. The few articles published specific to psychiatry did, however, reflect the position of psychiatry, bridging medicine and the psychotherapies. Thus, they span from the impact of workplace-based assessments and reframing the theories of learning applicable to psychiatric training, through to the learning of psychotherapy by psychiatric trainees.The literature on supervision in general medicine is dominated by the impact of competency-based training, with its associated methods of assessment, and issues around the decision to entrust trainees with various professional activities.The psychotherapy supervision literature has been notable for two disparate themes: the centenary of psychotherapeutic supervision in 2009 prompted a number of scholars to write reflective pieces capturing advances and areas for further research; whereas the development of evidence-based clinical supervision has given rise to a considerable body of work.\nResearch into supervision in psychiatry remains largely a terra incognita. If supervision is to continue to occupy a role as a key component of psychiatric training, research to justify that is needed urgently."}, {"Title": "[Results of the MMPI-2 test among patients suffer from depressive disorders and organic depressive disorders].", "Abstract": "The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is a psychological tool used in the diagnosis of various disorders and a helpful tool in determining the direction of the planned psychotherapeutic interactions.

By explaining a large portion of variability in individual drug metabolism, pharmacogenetics offers a diagnostic tool in the burgeoning era of personalized medicine. This review updates existing evidence on the influence of pharmacogenetic variants on drug exposure and discusses the rationale for genetic testing in the clinical context. Dose adjustments based on pharmacogenetic knowledge are the first step to translate pharmacogenetics into clinical practice. However, also clinical factors, such as the consequences on toxicity and therapeutic failure, must be considered to provide clinical recommendations and assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic treatment strategies. DME polymorphisms are relevant not only for clinical pharmacology and practice but also for research in psychiatry and neuroscience. Several DMEs, above all the cytochrome P (CYP) enzymes, are expressed in the brain, where they may contribute to the local biochemical homeostasis. Of particular interest is the possibility of DMEs playing a physiological role through their action on endogenous substrates, which may underlie the reported associations between genetic polymorphisms and cognitive function, personality and vulnerability to mental disorders. Neuroimaging studies have recently presented evidence of an effect of the CYP2D6 polymorphism on basic brain function. This review summarizes evidence on the effect of DME polymorphisms on brain function that adds to the well-known effects of DME polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics in explaining the range of phenotypes that are relevant to psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Symptom levels and initial appraisal of hospital treatment in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The initial appraisal of treatment by inpatients with schizophrenia has been found to be a significant predictor of clinical outcomes. The study aim was to examine whether specific types of symptoms are associated with the initial appraisal of treatment after controlling other patient characteristics. Data of 2105 inpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20-9) were pooled from three national and international multi-centre studies. Patients were interviewed within the first week of their inpatient admission. Higher levels of manic and positive symptoms were significantly associated with a less favourable initial appraisal of treatment, whilst no association was found with depression/anxiety and negative symptoms. Detained patients had more negative initial treatment appraisals, and the association with manic symptoms was significantly stronger in detained patients compared to those admitted voluntarily. Whilst patient-reported outcomes in psychiatry are usually associated with mood symptoms, this appears not to be the case for the initial appraisal by inpatients with schizophrenia. The association with manic and positive symptoms may be explained by the influence of such symptoms on the hospital experience. Focusing on the initial management of mania and positive symptoms might improve patients' appraisal of treatment in the inpatient environment."}, {"Title": "Cortisol and depression: three questions for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Cortisol plays a multifaceted role in major depression disorder (MDD). Diurnal rhythms are disturbed, there is increased resistance to the feedback action of glucocorticoids, excess cortisol may induce MDD, basal levels may be higher and the post-awakening cortisol surge accentuated in those at risk for MDD. Does this suggest new avenues for studying MDD or its clinical management?\nThe relevant literature was reviewed.\nCortisol contributes to genetic variants for the risk for MDD and the way that environmental events amplify risk. The corticoids' influence begins prenatally, but continues into adulthood. The impact of cortisol at each phase depends not only on its interaction with other factors, such as psychological traits and genetic variants, but also on events that have, or have not, occurred previously.\nThis review suggests that the time is now right for serious consideration of the role of cortisol in a clinical context. Estimates of cortisol levels and the shape of the diurnal rhythm might well guide the understanding of subtypes of MDD and yield additional indicators for optimal treatment. Patients with disturbed cortisol rhythms might benefit from restitution of those rhythms; they may be distinct from those with more generally elevated levels, who might benefit from cortisol blockade. Higher levels of cortisol are a risk for subsequent depression. Should manipulation of cortisol or its receptors be considered as a preventive measure for some of those at very high risk of future MDD, or to reduce other cortisol-related consequences such as long-term cognitive decline?"}, {"Title": "A confidence interval approach to sample size estimation for interobserver agreement studies with multiple raters and outcomes.", "Abstract": "Studies measuring interobserver agreement (reliability) are common in clinical practice, yet discussion of appropriate sample size estimation techniques is minimal as compared with clinical trials.

Potential application areas include: pathology, psychiatry, dentistry, and physical therapy.\nThis technique is illustrated using two examples. The first considers a pilot study in oral radiology, whose authors studied the reliability of the mandibular cortical index as measured by three dental professionals. The second example examines the level of interobserver agreement among four nurses with respect to five triage levels used in the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale.\nThis method should be useful in the planning stages of an interobserver agreement study in which the investigator would like to obtain a prespecified level of precision in the estimation of \u03ba.

A dialectical behavioral treatment program for BPD was implemented in an outpatient forensic clinic in The Netherlands. Sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected from ten male, and nineteen female forensic BPD patients, and compared with corresponding data from fifty-eight non-forensic BPD patients. The results show that it is possible to implement dialectical behavior therapy in an outpatient forensic clinic. The data indicate that the exclusion of forensic patients, and especially female forensic patients, from evidence-based treatment is unjustified given the highly comparable clinical and etiological characteristics they share with female BPD patients from general mental health settings."}, {"Title": "Voluntary and involuntary care: three-year study of demographic and diagnostic admission statistics at an inner-city adult psychiatry unit.", "Abstract": "Individuals with mental disorders can, under specific circumstances, be detained and treated against their wishes. In 2009, there were 1633 involuntary admissions in Ireland, accounting for 8.1% of all psychiatric admissions. We examined demographic and diagnostic factors associated with involuntary admission in a general adult psychiatry service in Dublin's north inner-city over a retrospective three-year period. The overall admission rate was 450.5 admissions per 100,000 population per year (deprivation-adjusted rate: 345.7), which is lower than the national rate (476.3). The involuntary admission rate was 67.7 (deprivation-adjusted rate: 51.9), which is higher than the national rate (38.5). Fifteen per cent of admissions were involuntary (for all or part of the admission), which is higher than the national proportion (8.1%) but the same as that reported in another inner-city psychiatry service (15.7%). The proportion of admissions that was involuntary was higher amongst individuals from outside Ireland (33.9%) compared to those from Ireland (12.0%) (p<0.001). Country of origin was, however, related to diagnosis: 53.2% of admissions of individuals from outside Ireland were with schizophrenia, compared to 18.5% of admissions of individuals from Ireland (p<0.001). Diagnosis was, in turn, related to admission status: 37.5% of admissions with schizophrenia were involuntary compared to 15% overall (p<0.001). On multi-variable testing, diagnosis was the only independent predictor of admission status (p=0.01) (R(2)=35.2%); country of origin was not an independent predictor of admission status. Deprivation accounts for part, but not all, of the high rate of involuntary admission in Dublin's inner-city. Diagnosis accounts for one third of the variance in admission status between individuals. Further study is required to determine what factors account for the remaining two thirds (e.g. symptoms, insight) and to clarify better the relationships between admission status, diagnosis and country of origin.

The project is designed to evaluate the process of changes in clinical practice due to the implementation of two interventions. The interventions to be implemented are a standardised Family Assessment Form and the intervention called Child Talks. The family assessment form is an intervention to identify children of mentally ill parents and their needs. The intervention Child Talks is a health-promoting and preventive intervention where the mental health workers talk with the family about the situation of the children and their needs.\nThere are two groups of participants in this study: (1) mental health workers in the clinic (N=220) and (2) patients who are parents (N=200) receiving treatment in the clinic. (1) In the evaluation of clinical practice, the authors use a pre-test, post-test and 1-year follow-up design. At pre-test, the authors evaluate status quo among mental health workers in the clinic regarding knowledge, attitudes, collaborative routines and clinical practice related to families with parental mental illness. After the pre-test is finished, the project move on to implement the interventions Family Assessment Form and Child Talks in the clinic. At post-test and 1-year follow-up, the authors evaluate the impact of implementing the Family Assessment Form in terms of how many children were identified and offered Child Talks in the clinic or referred to other services for additional support.

Part IV: Psychiatry and psychology.", "Abstract": "We present a short historical review on the major institutions and figures who contributed to make Paris a renowned centre of physiology and neurology during the XIXth and the first half of the XXth century. We purposely chose to focus on the period 1800-1950, as 1800 corresponds to the actual beginning of neurosciences, and as 1950 marks their exponential rise. Our presentation is divided into four chapters, matching the main disciplines that have progressed and contributed most to the knowledge we have of the brain sciences: anatomy, physiology, neurology, and psychiatry-psychology. The present article is the fourth of the four parts of this review, which deals with the chapter on psychiatry and psychology. When the French Revolution occurred, only a few institutions were taking care of the mentally ill. In the Paris area, these included Maison Royale de Charenton, Les Petites Maisons, and one of the departments of larger hospitals such as H\u00f4tel-Dieu, the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital and Bic\u00eatre Hospital. One of the founders of psychiatry in Paris at that time and thereafter was Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) who was the first to distinguish insane/alienated patients from misfits, beggars, and other vagabonds. During the first half of the XIXth century, his student Jean-\u00c9tienne Esquirol (1772-1840) also played a major role with his treatise on mental diseases and the 1838 law and the creation of asylums in all parts of France. Alienists were in general caregivers and learned by themselves. In contrast, at the academic level, the emerging disciplines psychiatry and neurology were very close to each other in the second half of the XIXth century, the best example being Jules Baillarger (1809-1890). The actual development of psychiatry and psychology and the foundation of psychoanalysis later in the XIXth century and in the first half of the XXth century owed much to several European doctors and scientists, particularly those from British institutions and from German-speaking universities in Central Europe. In France, important advances were once again initiated in Paris by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) and some of his pupils who renewed the concept of hysteria and the use of hypnosis. Sainte-Anne Hospital was created in 1867. This new institution located in the southern part of Paris became (and is still) one of the most important places in France for the treatment, research and teaching of mental diseases. Thereafter started new disciplines such as clinical psychology and neuropsychology; the scientific basis of psychology and notably the psychopathology hypothesis were established. A major revolutionary step occurred in Paris in the early 1950s with the discovery of neuroleptics and the birth of psychopharmacology. Here we present the biographical sketches of the most important Parisian scientists of these disciplines from that era, Philippe Pinel, Jean-\u00c9tienne Esquirol, Th\u00e9odule Armand Ribot, Pierre Janet, Henri Louis Charles Pi\u00e9ron, Henry Ey, Jean Delay, Henri Laborit and Henri H\u00e9caen."}, {"Title": "Applicability and fairness of the oral examination in undergraduate psychiatry training in South Africa.", "Abstract": "There are several methods of evaluating medical students' performance, such as written examination, oral examination and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Many studies have focused on the reliability and validity of these methods but few studies have explored comparison between these methods. Psychiatry is the only subject at the University of Stellenbosch where the final assessment consists of solely an oral component. The aim of the study was to compare students' final overall and discipline specific examination marks (i.e. in the other subjects) with the examination marks in psychiatry, and to determine if content or structure (e,g. oral, written or OSCE format) of examination impacts more on the student performance in the examination.\n343 final year medical students were included. All undertook their psychiatry rotation at the University of Stellenbosch, South Africa during 2008 and 2009. Data of marks obtained in all the disciplines during 2008 and 2009 were collected and class marks were compared with their final examination marks across all disciplines. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the level of agreement between the class and examination marks. Cases below the lower threshold were compared to all other cases across all disciplines. The odds ratio for group status was calculated for gender distribution of examiners.\nThe psychiatry class mark and final oral examination mark provided similar measures within a width of 31.5. Cases below the threshold had poorer performance in two other disciplines. The gender distribution of the examiners (female-female) significantly increased the odds ratio for poorer performance in the oral examination.\nThe results suggest that a group of students underperform in their final examination independent of method of evaluation and that the gender of examiners impacts on examination marks. Therefore future research should focus on identifying and modifying factors (including choice of examiner combinations) that contribute to the poor performance of medical students in their final examination, in order to help students perform better. Gender distribution of examiners should also be considered when examinations are structured and designed."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy in Brazil after the \"psychiatric reform\": a public health problem--example from a university service.", "Abstract": "The Brazilian public health system does not provide electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is limited to a few academic services.

Major reasons for referral were to obtain recommendations regarding medications and assessing non-responsive patients. While PCPs expressed higher levels of confidence in making appropriate referrals, they were much less confident in their knowledge and skills in managing mental health problems.

This study documents perceptions of changes in child and youth mental health (CYMH) services following the reform, as well as facilitators and obstacles to collaboration and partnership in CYMH services, and the specific challenges related to collaboration and partnership when servicing multi-ethnic populations.\nThis qualitative participatory research study collected data using semi-structured individual interviews, focus groups and participant observation in community-based health and social service institutions. Thematic analysis was performed.\nThe reform process encountered challenges in building a common culture of care within and between institutions, while collaboration and partnership evolved in a positive direction throughout the study. Study results highlighted the importance of fostering communication at all levels. Collaboration and partnership was facilitated by opportunities for clinical discussions, dialogue on models of care, harmonizing administrative and clinical priorities, and involving key actors and structures. The results revealed difficulties in implementing multidisciplinary work and in negotiating partners' responsibilities. Quality of partnership and collaboration appeared particularly crucial in providing optimal care to vulnerable families, including migrants.\nThe PASM reform involved a major and challenging transformation in CYMH services.

In World War I this condition (then known as shell shock or 'neurasthenia') was such a problem that 'forward psychiatry' was begun by French doctors in 1915. Some British doctors tried general anaesthesia as a treatment (ether and chloroform), while others preferred application of electricity. Four British 'forward psychiatric units' were set up in 1917. Hospitals for shell shocked soldiers were also established in Britain, including (for officers) Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh; patients diagnosed to have more serious psychiatric conditions were transferred to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. Towards the end of 1918 anaesthetic and electrical treatments of shell shock were gradually displaced by modified Freudian methods psychodynamic intervention. The efficacy of 'forward psychiatry' was controversial. In 1922 the War Office produced a report on shell shock with recommendations for prevention of war neurosis. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, this seemed to have been ignored. The term 'combat fatigue' was introduced as breakdown rates became alarming, and then the value of pre-selection was recognised. At the Maudsley Hospital in London in 1940 barbiturate abreaction was advocated for quick relief from severe anxiety and hysteria, using i.v. anaesthetics: Somnifaine, paraldehyde, Sodium Amytal. 'Pentothal narcosis' and 'narco-analysis' were adopted by British and American military psychiatrists. However, by 1945 medical thinking gradually settled on the same approaches that had seemed to be effective in 1918. The term PTSD was introduced in 1980.

The aim of the present study was to study the risk of pelvic organ dysfunction in major depression.\nTwo hundred and twenty-four depression patients in the psychiatry clinic (97 men, 127 women; average age 42 years; 128 drug-na\u00cfve, 96 medicated) and 391 age-matched local individuals who were undergoing an annual health survey underwent a questionnaire devised for neurologic and psychiatric cohorts.\nCompared with control, in the drug-na\u00cfve group the frequency of dysfunction was significantly higher for urinary urgency (20.9% of the women, 25.9% of the men, P < 0.01), urinary incontinence (9.1%, women), retardation in initiating urination (13.1%, men); constipation (23.8%, 14.8%), diarrhea (20.3%, 21.8%); decrease in libido (42%, men), sexual intercourse (70.7%, 78.7%) orgasm (63.6%, 65.0%), erection (92.7% of the men); and quality of life indices. No difference was found in the frequency of all three items between the drug-na\u00cfve group and the medicated group.\nThe results of the present study suggest that major depression is a risk for all bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, and it significantly worsens quality of life in patients. This finding presumably reflects that pelvic organ function is under emotional control.

This paper presents a summary of the goals, methods, and recent findings on the epidemiology of substance use and disorders in the general population of adults and adolescents and describes the methods and findings on the genetic epidemiology of drug use disorders. The high 12-month prevalence rates of substance dependence in US adults (about 12\u00a0% for alcohol and 2-3\u00a0% for illicit drugs) approximate those of other mental disorders as well as chronic physical disorders with major public health impact. New findings from the nationally representative samples of US youth reveal that the lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorders is approximately 8\u00a0% and illicit drug use disorders is 2-3\u00a0% (Merikangas et al. in J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 49(10):980-989, 2010; Swendsen et al. in Arch Gen Psychiatry 69(4):390-398, 2012; SAMHSA in Results from the 2010 national survey on drug use and health: summary of national findings, vol NSDUH, Series H-41, HHS Publication No. (SMA) 11-4658.

The striking increase in prevalence rates from ages 13 to 18 highlight adolescence as the key period of development of SUDs. The application of genetic epidemiological studies has consistently demonstrated that genetic factors have a major influence on progression of substance use to dependence, whereas environmental factors unique to the individual play an important role in exposure and initial use of substances. Identification of specific susceptibility genes and environmental factors that influence exposure and progression of drug use may enhance our ability to prevent and treat SUDs."}, {"Title": "Translating whole-body cryotherapy into geriatric psychiatry--a proposed strategy for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, constitutes one of the leading causes of disability and mortality in aging societies. Currently recommended medications used in treating AD include cholinesterase inhibitors and the NMDA antagonist--memantine, but poorly counteract progression of the disease. According to current knowledge, the neuropathological process underlying the etiology of AD begins many years, if not decades, before the development of overt symptoms of dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as the first detectable manifestation of cognitive decline. Nowadays, there is a general consensus that vascular alterations, oxidative stress and inflammatory response contribute to the development of AD. Following these mechanisms and tracing the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of cryostimulation, we postulate that whole-body cryotherapy (WBCT) might be utilized as a means of preventing AD. WBCT is a relatively safe and cost-effective procedure, which is widely applied in various medical specialties. Thus, there is an urgent necessity to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of WBCT in the prevention of AD in patients with MCI and healthy individuals."}, {"Title": "Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in primary care.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are frequently under-diagnosed conditions in primary care, although they can be managed effectively by general practitioners.\nThis paper is a short and practical summary of the World Federation of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for the treatment in primary care.

The wake-promoting effect of NPS is consistent with a marked lengthening in latency to sleep onset, a decrease in the number of state transitions from wakefulness to lSWS, and a delayed lSWS compensatory response. Interestingly, NPS significantly enhanced waking EEG theta oscillations and slow wave activity during dSWS.\nThe findings suggest that NPS enhanced a consolidated waking associated with a subsequent compensatory EEG slow-wave homeostatic drive rather than rebound sleep duration. The characteristics of NPS-induced waking coupled with enhanced EEG theta oscillations without rebound in sleep are desirable therapeutic features in wake-promoting agents."}, {"Title": "Affective spectrum disorders in an urban Swedish adult psychiatric unit: a descriptive study.", "Abstract": "Background.

Out of 180 consecutive patients 94 were included after clinical investigations and ICD-10 diagnostics. Further investigations included well-known self-evaluation instruments assessing psychiatric symptoms, personality disorders, psychosocial stress, adaptation, quality of life, and global level of functioning. A neuropsychological screening was also included. Results. The patients were young, had many young children, were well educated, and had about expected (normal distribution of) intelligence. Sixty-one percent were identified as belonging to the group of AfSD. Conclusion. The study identifies a large group of patients that presents much suffering and failure of functioning. This group is shared between the levels of medical care, between primary care and psychiatry. The term AfSD facilitates identification of patient groups that share common traits and identifies individuals clinically, besides the referred patients, in need of psychiatric interventions."}, {"Title": "Primum non nocere: an evolutionary analysis of whether antidepressants do more harm than good.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment for people meeting current diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. Most antidepressants are designed to perturb the mechanisms that regulate the neurotransmitter serotonin - an evolutionarily ancient biochemical found in plants, animals, and fungi. Many adaptive processes evolved to be regulated by serotonin, including emotion, development, neuronal growth and death, platelet activation and the clotting process, attention, electrolyte balance, and reproduction. It is a principle of evolutionary medicine that the disruption of evolved adaptations will degrade biological functioning. Because serotonin regulates many adaptive processes, antidepressants could have many adverse health effects. For instance, while antidepressants are modestly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, they increase the brain's susceptibility to future episodes after they have been discontinued. Contrary to a widely held belief in psychiatry, studies that purport to show that antidepressants promote neurogenesis are flawed because they all use a method that cannot, by itself, distinguish between neurogenesis and neuronal death. In fact, antidepressants cause neuronal damage and mature neurons to revert to an immature state, both of which may explain why antidepressants also cause neurons to undergo apoptosis (programmed death). Antidepressants can also cause developmental problems, they have adverse effects on sexual and romantic life, and they increase the risk of hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood plasma), bleeding, stroke, and death in the elderly. Our review supports the conclusion that antidepressants generally do more harm than good by disrupting a number of adaptive processes regulated by serotonin. However, there may be specific conditions for which their use is warranted (e.g., cancer, recovery from stroke). We conclude that altered informed consent practices and greater caution in the prescription of antidepressants are warranted."}, {"Title": "Cognitive and mood assessment in stroke research: focused review of contemporary studies.", "Abstract": "International guidelines recommend cognitive and mood assessments for stroke survivors; these assessments also have use in clinical trials.

It has developed from the earlier terms individualised or personalised medicine and refers to the use of genetic and/or endophenotypic measures to allow better targeting of treatments. The best exemplar is HER2 positivity in breast cancer to determine the efficacy of Herceptin. Clinical trials of this anti-cancer drug were initially unpromising, but once the HER2 positive subgroup was identified it was found, in this subgroup only, to be highly effective. It is presumed that similar subgroups will be found for many common disorders not just cancers, and that these will lead to much better targeted treatments. Such an advance may be necessary to develop new treatments in certain fields where the development of broad-spectrum/blockbuster treatments appears to have reached the end of the road; a particular example of this is in psychiatry. In this paper we discuss this issue in relation to psychiatry using a new and interesting example of how genotyping might help rescue an apparently failed novel treatment in anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of children and adolescents in the Dutch national in- and outpatient mental health service for deaf and hard of hearing youth over a period of 15 years.", "Abstract": "In this study socio-demographic, deafness-related and diagnostic characteristics of hearing impaired children and adolescents referred to a national mental health service for deaf and hard of hearing children and adolescents were examined. Socio-demographic and diagnostic characteristics were compared to corresponding characteristics of hearing referred peers with identified mental health problems. The difference in characteristics between them and hearing referred peers with identified mental health problems was analyzed. A total of 389 deaf and hard of hearing and 3361 hearing children and adolescents was extracted from a database, all first referrals of patients of a center for child and adolescent psychiatry over a 15-year period. With deaf and hard of hearing patients we found higher rates of environmental stress, as indicated by conditions such as more one parent families (38.6% versus 25.8%), and more parents with a low educational level (44.2% versus 31.1%). Moreover, deaf and hard of hearing patients were older at their first referral (10.8 versus 9.4 years) and had higher rates of pervasive developmental disorders (23.7% versus 12.3%) and mental retardation (20.3% versus 3.9%). Within the target group of deaf and hard of hearing patients, most patients were deaf (68.9%; 22.3% was severely hard of hearing), relatively few (13.7%) had a non-syndromal hereditary hearing impairment, and more (21.3%) had a disabling physical health condition, especially those with a pervasive developmental disorder (42.6%). These findings illustrate both the complexity of the problems of deaf and hard of hearing children and adolescents referred to specialist mental health services, and the need for preventive interventions aimed at early recognition."}, {"Title": "Do benzodiazepines still deserve a major role in the treatment of psychiatric disorders? A critical reappraisal.", "Abstract": "Discovered in the late 1950s by Leo Sternbach, the first benzodiazepine (BZD) chlordiazepoxide was followed by several congeners, which rapidly constituted one of the largest and most widely prescribed classes of psychotropic compounds. After 50 years, BZDs are still routinely utilized not only in psychiatry but, more generally, in the whole of medicine. Despite their high therapeutic index which makes BZDs safer than other compounds like barbiturates, as well as their rapidity of onset, psychiatrists and family physicians are well aware about the controversy that surrounds the wide use - often not adequately based on scientific evidence - of BZDs in many psychiatric disorders. In this overview of international treatment guidelines, systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials, the aim was to provide a critical appraisal of the current use and role of BZDs in psychiatric disorders and their disadvantages, with specific emphasis on anxiety and affective disorders, sleep disorders, alcohol withdrawal, violent and aggressive behaviours in psychoses, and neuroleptic-induced disorders. In addition, specific emphasis has been given to the extent of usage of BZDs and its appropriateness through the assessment of available international surveys. Finally, the entire spectrum of BZD-related adverse effects including psychomotor effects, use in the elderly, paradoxical reactions, tolerance and rebound, teratologic risk, dependence, withdrawal and abuse issues was examined in detail."}, {"Title": "Intervention, causal reasoning, and the neurobiology of mental disorders: Pharmacological drugs as experimental instruments.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, pharmacological drugs play an important experimental role in attempts to identify the neurobiological causes of mental disorders. Besides being developed in applied contexts as potential treatments for patients with mental disorders, pharmacological drugs play a crucial role in research contexts as experimental instruments that facilitate the formulation and revision of neurobiological theories of psychopathology. This paper examines the various epistemic functions that pharmacological drugs serve in the discovery, refinement, testing, and elaboration of neurobiological theories of mental disorders. I articulate this thesis with reference to the history of antipsychotic drugs and the evolution of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia in the second half of the twentieth century. I argue that interventions with psychiatric patients through the medium of antipsychotic drugs provide researchers with information and evidence about the neurobiological causes of schizophrenia. This analysis highlights the importance of pharmacological drugs as research tools in the generation of psychiatric knowledge and the dynamic relationship between practical and theoretical contexts in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The emergence of Nervennahrung: Nerves, mind and metabolism in the long eighteenth century.", "Abstract": "Morphological assumptions concerning the form, structure and internal life of the brain and nervous system profoundly influenced contemporary physiological concepts about nerve actions throughout the 'long eighteenth century'. This article investigates some early theories of mind and metabolism. In a bottom-up fashion, it asks how eighteenth-century theories regarding the physiological actions of the body organs shaped the conceptions of the structure of the brain and nervous tissue themselves. These proposed that a healthy Nervennahrung (the German word for 'nerve nutrition', which might be rendered as brain food in modern English), not only guaranteed the integrity and stability of neuronal structures in the body, but also explained the complex texture of the brain and spinal cord in physiological terms. Eighteenth-century nerve theories already embodied a Leitmotiv of neurology and brain psychiatry from the later nineteenth century: 'Without phosphorus there is no thought!'"}, {"Title": "[Autism spectrum disorders--a syndrome on the rise: risk factors and advances in early detection and intervention].", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders [ASD] are complex neurobehavioraL disorders defined by social and communication deficits and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. The current estimated prevalence of ASD is approximately 1:100, which reflects a 15-fold increase from studies published a half-century ago. ASD is a highly heritable disorder, however, the exact cause of ASD is still unknown. ASD is associated with altered functional and structural connectivity patterns in the frontal and temporo-limbic brain regions that occur early in life. It is now believed that environmental factors may modulate phenotypical expression of ASD that are associated with the genetic predisposition. Several possible risk factors for ASD were investigated and included advanced parental age, birth complications, prematurity, Low birth weight and assisted conception. Numerous epidemioLogical reports have failed to confirm any association between immunizations and MMR specifically or thimerosaL exposure and risk for ASD. The diagnosis of ASD can be reLiably made in the second year of Life and appears to be relatively stable over time. However, diagnosis of very young children can be quite complex due to their clinical heterogeneity and varying patterns of onset that can differ from the typical autism symptoms of an older child. It is further challenging to distinguish between developmental and/or speech delay and ASD at this early age. Standardized tests for ASD diagnosis, developmental level and adaptive skiLls have been successfully used for accurate diagnosis of ASD. Research has recently focused on possible basic measures and/or biological markers that can assist with early diagnosis of ASD. Recent studies suggest that substantial gains can be achieved by intensive behavioral intervention initiated prior to 24 months, as neural plasticity is increased and chaLLenging behaviors are less prominent. Effective early intervention should begin soon after the diagnosis is made, and be individualized, intensive, and comprehensive and should include parent education, and behavioral intervention. It is highly important for pediatricians and experts in child neurology, development and child psychiatry to recognize the early signs of ASD, diagnostic tools and effective intervention methods."}, {"Title": "[Methodological approach to inter \"guideline\" variability in the management of bipolar disorders].", "Abstract": "In recent decades, an increasing number of pharmacologic agents have become available in bipolar disorder treatment. These therapeutic advances provide a new challenge for clinicians in the choice of medication for patients with bipolar disorder. In this context, tools have been developed for making medical decisions in the management of bipolar disorder: guidelines.\nGuidelines for bipolar disorder were compared on the basis of their construction methodology (evidence-based treatment guidelines or consensus-based treatment guidelines), results and recommendations for clinical practice.\nThere are differences between guidelines for treating bipolar disorder. For the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the severity of the manic episode is a primary endpoint of the decision-making tree for the choice of therapy. On the other hand, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that the choice of the initial treatment, in the case of manic episode, should be based first on the current patient's treatment (history of anti-manic therapy) while the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) emphasizes the clinical classification of the type of mania. The sequencing of medication in the guidelines may vary according to the construction methodology, the date of elaboration, the geocultural context and experts' position. Recent guidelines consider the last randomized controlled trials (RCT) as those of aripiprazole in the treatment of mania, recommending it in first line as anti-manic agent. The recent updated WFSBP guidelines changed in its construction methodology taking into account the negative studies or those showing non-superiority compared to placebo. Thus, a recent study of non-superiority of lithium monotherapy compared to placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression downgraded lithium from level of evidence B to D. During recent years, a large number of RCT have demonstrated superior efficacy (particularly in mania treatment) of lithium or valproate combined with second-generation antipsychotic compared with lithium or valproate monotherapy. Consequently, according to geocultural context or experts' position, some guidelines recommended medication combinations in first line (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment) and other guidelines considered monotherapy in first line (except for particular cases) to promote tolerance and good therapeutic alliance (WFSBP). Malhi et al. recommended a sequencing of medication based on the benefit risk ratio for the management of each phase of bipolar disorder. These differences between guidelines may cause difficulties for clinicians in choosing clinical practice guidelines.\nWhile there are a large number of guidelines for bipolar disorder, the recommendations may vary depending on multiple factors. It seems interesting to conduct a comparative study of guidelines for bipolar disorder on the basis of a validated scale (AGREE) or completed by other items such as date of elaboration and number of proposed recommendations. However, the methodological understanding of guidelines remains the central element for practitioners in their choice of guidelines. Thus, the initial objective of guidelines \"to develop statements to assist clinician and patient decisions about the most appropriate health care for specific clinical situations\" could be implemented in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Symptom profile of delirium in children and adolescent--does it differ from adults and elderly?", "Abstract": "The objective was to evaluate the phenomenology, etiology and outcome of delirium in children and adolescents (8-18 years of age) seen in a consultation-liaison psychiatric service in India.

The concept, structure, and function of the family unit vary considerably across different cultures; however, its role continues to be imperative to the development of individuals and their psychological make-up. All societies have a concept of 'family', its relative importance, structure, and functions; however, this varies according to the particular culture. In the Arabic culture, as well as other collectivistic cultures, the extended family is often regarded as the basic unit. The family is the foundational and basic social unit that fosters the stability, well-being and sustainability of society. The quality of family relationships shapes and influences the social, psychological, and biological development and functioning of its members. This may be especially relevant to individuals with mental health problems. The people of ancient Egypt valued family life highly, and this is the case even now. They treasured children and regarded them as a great blessing. If a couple had no children, they would pray to the gods and goddesses for help. They would also place letters at the tombs of dead relatives asking them to use their influence with the gods. The importance of family has not changed dramatically even though the structures are beginning to.

Zuclopenthixol acetate is said to have these properties.\nTo estimate the clinical effects of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of acute aggression or violence thought to be due to serious mental illnesses, in comparison to other drugs used to treat similar conditions.\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia's Group Trials Register (July 2011). We supplemented this by citation searching and personal contact with authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies.\nAll randomised clinical trials involving people thought to have serious mental illnesses comparing zuclopenthixol acetate with other drugs.\nTwo review authors extracted and cross-checked data independently. We calculated fixed-effect relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data. We analysed by intention-to-treat. We used mean differences (MD) for continuous variables.\nWe found no data for the primary outcome, tranquillisation. Compared with haloperidol, zuclopenthixol acetate was no more sedating at two hours (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34). People given zuclopenthixol acetate were not at reduced risk of being given supplementary antipsychotics (n = 134, 3 RCTs, RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.30) although additional use of benzodiazepines was less (n = 50, 1 RCT, RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47).

We found no data on more episodes of aggression or harm to self or others. One trial (n = 148) reported no significant difference in adverse effects for people receiving zuclopenthixol acetate compared with those allocated haloperidol at one, three and six days (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.27). Compared with haloperidol or clotiapine, people allocated zuclopenthixol did not seem to be at more risk of a range of movement disorders (< 20%). Three studies found no difference in the proportion of people getting blurred vision/dry mouth (n = 192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70). Similarly, dizziness was equally infrequent for those allocated zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol (n = 192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.88). There was no difference between treatments for leaving the study before completion (n = 522, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.31). One study reported no difference in adverse effects and outcome scores, when high dose (50-100 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate was compared with low dose (25-50 mg/injection) zuclopenthixol acetate.\nRecommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. Use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses.

The views of young patients and their parents in relation to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for adolescent depression have not been previously studied.\nWe sought to (1) describe the experience, knowledge, and attitudes regarding rTMS among young people who had been treated with rTMS for depression as adolescents; (2) report the views of their parents; and (3) compare these to opinions about pharmacotherapy among a group who had been treated with fluoxetine for adolescent depression.\nEight of 9 subjects who had participated in an open-label rTMS study, 13 of their parents, and an age-matched group of 8 subjects who had been treated with fluoxetine for depression as adolescents were assessed using detailed questionnaires.\nRepetitive TMS recipients and their parents found rTMS largely acceptable in terms of adverse effects and treatment experience, but most considered it ineffective. In contrast, most patients who had been treated with fluoxetine viewed their treatment as effective.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation is relatively well tolerated by depressed adolescents, but it is also perceived as mostly unhelpful by them and their parents. This is at odds with emerging studies suggesting that rTMS can be an effective and safe treatment in this age group, indicating that further research is required to confirm our findings and understand reasons for any disparity."}, {"Title": "Merging of three hospitals into one university hospital.", "Abstract": "The merging of hospitals into health enterprises ensued from the Norwegian hospital reform of 2002.

In addition to validating neuropsychiatric spectrum disorder nosologies by calling for similar methodological shifts in gene-environment-interaction studies, Br\u00fcne's position elevates the importance of environmental contexts - inclusive of socio-cultural variables - as mechanisms that contribute to clinical presentation.

Emotional regulation is an essential process involved in neuropathophysiology and therapeutic efficacy in many psychiatric disorders. Yet, traditional psychiatric therapeutic has focused on symptomatic rather than neurophysiological criteria. Therefore, it was proposed to teach patients to modify their own brain activity directly, in order to obtain a therapeutic effect. These techniques, which are named neurofeedback, were originally developed using electroencephalography. Recent technical advances in fMRI enable real-time acquisition, and open opportunities to its utilization in neurofeedback. This seems particularly interesting in emotion regulation, which, at a neurofunctional level, lies on cortico-limbic pathways that, in great parts, were previously identified by traditional fMRI paradigms. This emotion regulation plays a central role in the etiopathogeny psychiatric, especially depressive and anxious, disorders. It is possible to devise new therapeutic strategies and research approach for addressing directly the neurophysiological processes of emotion regulation by integrating the neurofunctional activities of a subject.

In a number of investigations, hippocampal neurochemicals were evaluated in the patients with bipolar disorder who were on their first episode or euthymic periods. However, we did not meet any investigation in which only patients with bipolar depression were examined. As a consequence, the objective of the present study was to examine both sides of hippocampus of patients with bipolar disorder in depressive episode and healthy controls using (1)H-MRS. Methods. Thirteen patients with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder, most recent episode depressed, were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry at Firat University School of Medicine. We also studied 13 healthy comparison subjects who were without any DSM-IV Axis I disorders recruited from the hospital staff. The patients and controls underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) of their hippocampus. NAA, CHO, and CRE values were measured. Results. No significant effect of diagnosis was observed for NAA/CRE ratio. For the NAA/CHO ratio, the ANCOVA with age, gender, and whole brain volume as covariates revealed that the patients with bipolar depression had significantly lower ratio compared to healthy control subjects for right and for left side. As for the CHO/CRE ratio, the difference was statistically significant for right side, with an effect diagnosis of F = 4.763, P = 0.038, and was very nearly significant for left side, with an effect diagnosis of F = 3.732, P = 0.064.

The traditional interpretation of antidepressant-placebo difference in randomized controlled trials on major depression has been also challenged previously from at least five points of view but all leading to a conclusion that currently prevailing opinions concerning relative placebo and antidepressant response rates overestimate placebo response, and thereby underestimate efficacy of antidepressant drugs. In our present paper we propose another method for calculating placebo and antidepressant response rates which may shed new light on an overlooked aspect of the efficacy of these drugs.\nWe contend that opinions on the effectiveness of antidepressants should be reconsidered, and comparisons with placebo should be more carefully applied. Interpretation of the placebo response is of crucial importance for establishing the efficacy of antidepressive medications, and psychiatry should not become the hostage of placebo."}, {"Title": "Interprofessional psychiatric teams: is multidimensionality evident in treatment conferences?", "Abstract": "Interprofessional teamwork is practised when the care needs of patients are complex. Little is known about the extent to which team competence really determines patient interventions. The aim of the study was to examine the degree of multidimensionality in patient discussions in psychiatry, and to how different professions contribute. Psychiatric teams were observed during 30 team meetings. A content analysis was used to examine the amount of attention given to medical, psychological and social aspects. The results indicated difficulties in achieving multidimensionality in patient discussions during team meetings. The descriptive element of the discussion was dominated by the social aspect, to which all professions contributed. The analytical element was dominated by the psychological aspect, also to which all the professions contributed. In suggesting interventions, medical interventions were emphasized, principally by the physicians. Decisions on interventions concerned equally medical, social and psychological aspects. An interprofessional composition of teams offers no guarantee that interventions will be of a multidimensional nature. The results are discussed in relation to previous research and practical implications."}, {"Title": "The bereavement exclusion and DSM-5.", "Abstract": "Pre-DSM-III (where DSM is Diagnostic and Statistical Manual), a series of studies demonstrated that major depressive syndromes were common after bereavement and that these syndromes often were transient, not requiring treatment. Largely on the basis of these studies, a decision was made to exclude the diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE) if symptoms could be \"better accounted for by bereavement than by MDE\" unless symptoms were severe and very impairing. Thus, since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, the official position of American Psychiatry has been that recent bereavement may be an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of an MDE. This review article attempts to answer the question, \"Does the best available research favor continuing the 'bereavement exclusion' (BE) in DSM-5?\" We have previously discussed the proposal by the DSM-5 Mood Disorders Work Group to remove the BE from DSM-5.\nPrior reviews have evaluated the validity of the BE based on studies published through 2006. The current review adds research studies published since 2006 and critically examines arguments for and against retaining the BE in DSM-5.\nThe preponderance of data suggests that bereavement-related depression is not different from MDE that presents in any other context; it is equally genetically influenced, most likely to occur in individuals with past personal and family histories of MDE, has similar personality characteristics and patterns of comorbidity, is as likely to be chronic and/or recurrent, and responds to antidepressant medications.\nWe conclude that the BE should not be retained in DSM-5."}, {"Title": "A comparison of facial emotion processing in neurological and psychiatric conditions.", "Abstract": "Patients suffering from various neurological and psychiatric disorders show different levels of facial emotion recognition (FER) impairment, sometimes from the early phases of the disease. Investigating the relative severity of deficits in FER across different clinical and high-risk populations has potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases, and could also allow us to understand the neurobiological mechanisms of emotion perception itself. To investigate the role of the dopaminergic system and of the frontotemporal network in FER, we reanalyzed and compared data from four of our previous studies investigating FER performance in patients with frontotemporal dysfunctions and/or dopaminergic system abnormalities at different stages. The performance of patients was compared to the performance obtained by a specific group of matched healthy controls using Cohen's d effect size. We thus compared emotion and gender recognition in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the mild dementia stage, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease treated by l-DOPA (PD-ON) or not (PD-OFF), remitted schizophrenia (SCZ-rem), first-episode schizophrenia treated by antipsychotic medication (SCZ-ON), and drug-na\u00efve first-episode schizophrenia (SCZ-OFF), as well as in unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia (SIB). The analyses revealed a pattern of differential impairment of emotion (but not gender) recognition across pathological conditions. On the one hand, dopaminergic medication seems not to modify the moderate deficits observed in SCZ and PD groups (ON vs. OFF), suggesting that the deficit is independent from the dopaminergic system. On the other hand, the observed increase in effect size of the deficit among the aMCI, AD, and FTD groups (and also among the SIB and SCZ-rem groups) suggests that the deficit is dependent on neurodegeneration of the frontotemporal neural networks. Our transnosographic approach combining clinical and high-risk populations with the impact of medication provides new information on the trajectory of impaired emotion perception in neuropsychiatric conditions, and on the role of the dopaminergic system and the frontotemporal network in emotion perception."}, {"Title": "Data sharing in neuroimaging research.", "Abstract": "Significant resources around the world have been invested in neuroimaging studies of brain function and disease. Easier access to this large body of work should have profound impact on research in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry, leading to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disease. A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging."}, {"Title": "[Health related quality of life and disease burden of patients with schizophrenia in Hungary].", "Abstract": "According to the international literature disease burden of schizophrenia is substantial, however data from Eastern Central Europe is scarce. Our aim was to assess the quality of life and costs of patients with schizophrenia in Hungary.\nA cross sectional questionnaire survey was performed in 3 hospital based psychiatry centres involving patients with schizophrenia. Demographics, disease severity (Clinical Global Impression, CGI), functional ability (Global Assessment of Functioning, GAF) and general health status (EQ-5D) was assessed. Health care utilisation and aids were surveyed for the past 12 months. Costing was performed from the societal perspective and human capital approach was applied.\nAltogether 78 patients (female 43.6%) were involved with a mean age of 44.2 (SD=13.1) years, disease duration was >10 years at 49 (62.8%) cases, 66 (84.6%) patients were disability pensioners. Distribution between CGI 3-4-5-6 levels were 12 (16%), 33 (43%), 21 (28%), 10 (13%) patients, respectively, mean GAF was 52.6 (SD=13.9). The average EQ-5D score was 0.64 (SD=0.3) and it was significantly worse than the age-matched general population's score in Hungary (p < 0.01). Mean yearly cost was 13 878 Euros/patient (conversion 1 Euro=280.6 HUF), the rate of direct medical,direct non-medical and indirect costs was 28.5%, 5.4% and 66.1%, respectively. Among direct costs hospitalisation and drug costs were dominant. Total cost correlates with disease severity (CGI).\nSchizophrenia leads to notable deterioration in health related quality of life and induce high costs to society, mainly due to the productivity loss of the patients. Nevertheless disease related costs in Hungary are lower than in economically more developed European countries.

Research in this area in the mental health field h as burgeoned with the development and widespread use of standard assessment instruments and the mapping out of the clinical and neuropsychological correlates of insight and its loss. There has been a growing appreciation of the multi-faceted nature of the concept and of the different 'objects' of insight, such as the general awareness that one is ill, to more specific metacognitive awareness of individual symptoms, impairments and performance. This in turn has led to the notion that insight may show modularity and may fractionate across different domains and disorders, supported by work that directly compares metacognition of memory deficits and illness awareness in patients with SCZ, Alzheimer's disease and brain injury. The focus of this paper will be on the varieties of metacognitive failure in psychiatry, particularly the psychoses. We explore cognitive models based on self-reflectiveness and their possible social and neurological bases, including data from structural and functional MRI.

This posed a considerable challenge for the military and medical authorities and resulted in an active discussion on the etiology and treatment of these disorders. Current historiography is reliant on published physician accounts, and this represents the first study of treatment approaches based on original case notes. We analyzed patient records from two leading departments of academic psychiatry in Germany, those at Berlin and Jena, in conjunction with the contemporaneous medical literature. Treatment, which can be broadly classified into reward and punishment, suggestion, affective shock, cognitive learning, and physiological methods, was developed in the context of the emerging fields of animal learning and neurophysiology. A further innovative feature was the use of quantitative methods to assess outcomes. These measures showed good response rates, though most cured patients were not sent back to battle because of their presumed psychopathic constitution. While some treatments appear unnecessarily harsh from today's perspective and were also criticized by leading psychiatrists of the time, the concentration of effort and involvement of so many senior doctors led to the development of psychotherapeutic methods that were to influence the field of psychiatric therapy for decades to come."}, {"Title": "[Encephalitis associated to anti-NMDA receptor antibodies: a description of two cases in the child/youth population].", "Abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of encephalitis due to anti-glutamate receptor N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antibodies (anti-NMDA encephalitis) is made more complex by the fact that psychiatric clinical features are usually predominant in the early stages. This can lead to a delay in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease.\nWe report on two clinical cases attended by the Child/Youth Psychiatry Section of our hospital, in collaboration with the Paediatric and Neurology services. Case 1: a 4-year-old male who was referred owing to behavioural alterations and the regression of previously acquired skills. Case 2: a 13-year-old female who was admitted due to a behavioural disorder within the context of a possible initial psychotic episode. In both cases appropriate complementary tests were performed, including lumbar puncture and anti-NMDA antibodies, which were positive. Once the diagnosis of anti-NMDA encephalitis had been reached, treatment was started: in the first case, with intravenous perfusion of corticoids and immunoglobulins, while in the second rituximab had to be associated. Both patients progressed towards clinical improvement.\nOver the last two years there has been an increase in the number of cases of anti-NMDA encephalitis diagnosed in the child/youth population. It is a neuropsychiatric, autoimmune condition, which can correspond to a paraneoplastic syndrome. Follow-up and transvaginal ultrasonography as well as thoracoabdominal computerised axial tomography scans are recommended for at least two years after diagnosis.

SBIRT project faculty in the internal medicine (traditional, primary care internal medicine, medicine/pediatrics), psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and pediatrics programs were trained in performing and teaching SBIRT. The SBIRT project faculty trained the residents in their respective disciplines, accommodating discipline-specific implementation issues and developed a SBIRT training Web site. Post-training, residents were observed performing SBIRT with a standardized patient. Measurements included number of residents trained, performance of SBIRT in clinical practice, and training satisfaction. One hundred and ninety-nine residents were trained in SBIRT: 98 internal medicine, 35 psychiatry, 18 obstetrics and gynecology, 21 emergency medicine, and 27 pediatrics residents. To date, 338 self-reported SBIRT clinical encounters have occurred. Of the 196 satisfaction surveys completed, the mean satisfaction score for the training was 1.60 (1 = very satisfied to 5 = very dissatisfied). Standardized patient sessions with SBIRT project faculty supervision were the most positive aspect of the training and length of training was a noted weakness. Implementation of a graduate medical education SBIRT curriculum in a multispecialty format is feasible and acceptable.

We examined this effect in college students of African descent. Students recruited at a Historically Black University (n = 564) completed web-based measures of past-year stressful life experiences and daily reports of drinking and heavy drinking over a 30-day period. Participants were genotyped for the tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and dichotomized as low-activity S' allele carriers or high-activity L' homozygotes. Generalized linear models were used to examine the effects of life stress, genotype, and their interaction on the two drinking measures. In students who completed 15 or more daily surveys (n = 393), there was a significant interaction of past-year stressful events, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and gender on the number of drinking days (P = 0.002). Similar findings were obtained in relation to heavy drinking days (P = 0.007). Men showed a main effect of past-year stressful events on both drinking outcomes (P's < 0.001), but no main or moderator effects of genotype. In women, the S' allele moderated the impact of past-year life stressors on the frequency of drinking and heavy drinking days (P's < 0.001). In college students of African descent, past-year stressful events were associated with more frequent drinking and heavy drinking, an effect that was moderated by the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.

This practice has been criticised by the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture. The objective of this initiative was to reduce the use of seclusion within the prison and to improve the care of vulnerable and mentally ill prisoners within the prison.\nThe prison studied is a committal centre for sentenced prisoners with an official bed capacity of 630. The forensic mental health in-reach team, in co-operation with the prison health service followed the 'spiral' of planning, action and fact finding about the results of the action. In December 2010 a 10 bed High Support Unit (HSU) was established within the prison. During the first year, 96 prisoners were admitted. A third (35%) reported psychotic symptoms, 28% were referred due to the immediate risk of self-harm, 17% were accommodated for medical treatments and increased observation, 13% received specialised treatment by the Addiction Psychiatry team, 6% presented with emotional distress. One prisoner was accommodated on the HSU due to the acute risk he posed to others. A major mental illness was diagnosed in 29%, 20% required short-term increased support for crisis intervention and were found not to have a mental illness. A further 10% were deemed to be feigning symptoms of mental illness to seek refuge in the HSU. 7% had personality disorder as their primary diagnosis and 4% had a learning disability. Stratifying risk within the prison population through the provision of the HSU decreased the total episodes of seclusion in the prison by 59% (p < 0.001) in addition to providing a more effective psychiatric in-reach service to the prison. Pathways between the prison and the forensic psychiatric hospital saw no change in activity but improved continuity of care.\nThe next step is to further stratify risk by establishing a low support unit to serve as a step-down from the high support unit."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the relatives of patients with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "We hypothesized that relatives of bipolar patients would have increased rate of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and subsyndromal manifestations compared to demographically matched relatives of healthy controls.\nForty consecutive patients with bipolar disorder were recruited from inpatient and outpatient units of Sisli Etfal Teaching and Research Hospital, Psychiatry Department.

However, imperfect understanding of the aetiology of these heterogeneous syndromes has been associated with poor treatment outcomes for many individuals. Growing evidence suggests that oxidative stress, inflammation, changes in glutamatergic pathways and neurotrophins play important roles in many psychiatric illnesses including mood disorders, schizophrenia and addiction. These novel insights into pathophysiology allow new treatment targets to be explored. Minocycline is an antibiotic that can modulate glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Given that these mechanisms overlap with the newly understood pathophysiological pathways, minocycline has potential as an adjunctive treatment in psychiatry. To date there have been promising clinical indications that minocycline may be a useful treatment in psychiatry, albeit from small trials most of which were not placebo controlled. Case reports of individuals with schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms and bipolar depression have shown serendipitous benefits of minocycline treatment on psychiatric symptoms. Minocycline has been trialled in open-label or small randomized controlled trials in psychiatry. Results vary, with findings supporting use in schizophrenia, but showing less benefit for nicotine dependence and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Given the limited data from rigorous clinical trials, further research is required.

It is highly applied for improving patient treatment. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and complex disorder resulting from genetic and environmental interactions. Less than 40% of patients with MDD achieve remission, and even after several treatment trials, one in three patients do not fully recover from MDD. Many clinical and genomic association studies suggested that the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene region was an important genetic locus for psychiatric disorders, because of the proposed relationship between its function in catecholaminergic neurotransmission and individual response to antidepressants, and vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. Although a number of COMT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed, the Val108/158Met (rs4680) polymorphism in exon 4 resulted in a change in the enzyme structure which has been intensively investigated in relation to its role of enzyme activity and processes of prefrontal cortex functions in cognition.

However, the mechanistic heterogeneity that potentially underlies the existing classification scheme might limit discovery of etiology for most developmental psychiatric disorders. Another, perhaps less palpable, reality may also be interfering with progress-heterogeneity in typically developing populations. In this report we attempt to clarify neuropsychological heterogeneity in a large dataset of typically developing youth and youth with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using graph theory and community detection. We sought to determine whether data-driven neuropsychological subtypes could be discerned in children with and without the disorder. Because individual classification is the sine qua non for eventual clinical translation, we also apply support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify how well ADHD status in individual children can be identified as defined by the community detection delineated subtypes. The analysis yielded several unique, but similar subtypes across both populations. Just as importantly, comparing typically developing children with ADHD children within each of these distinct subgroups increased diagnostic accuracy. Two important principles were identified that have the potential to advance our understanding of typical development and developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. The first tenet suggests that typically developing children can be classified into distinct neuropsychological subgroups with high precision. The second tenet proposes that some of the heterogeneity in individuals with ADHD might be \"nested\" in this normal variation."}, {"Title": "Acute kidney injury and mortality in hospitalized patients.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its relation with mortality among hospitalized patients.\nAnalysis of hospital discharge and laboratory data from an urban academic medical center over a 1-year period.

However, the use of fMRI to probe intervention effects in psychiatry is associated with unique methodological considerations, including the psychometric properties of repeated fMRI scans, how to assess potential relations between the effects of an intervention on symptoms and on specific brain activation patterns, and how to best make causal inferences about intervention effects on brain function. Additionally, the study of treatment effects in neurodevelopmental disorders presents additional unique challenges related to brain maturation, analysis methods, and the potential for motion artifacts. We review these methodological considerations and provide recommendations for best practices for each of these topics."}, {"Title": "Changes in physical fitness, bone mineral density and body composition during inpatient treatment of underweight and normal weight females with longstanding eating disorders.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine changes in aerobic fitness, muscular strength, bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition during inpatient treatment of underweight and normal weight patients with longstanding eating disorders (ED). Twenty-nine underweight (BMI < 18.5, n = 7) and normal weight (BMI \u2265 18.5, n = 22) inpatients (mean (SD) age: 31.0 (9.0) years, ED duration: 14.9 (8.8) years, duration of treatment: 16.6 (5.5) weeks) completed this prospective naturalistic study. The treatment consisted of nutritional counseling, and 2 \u00d7 60 min weekly moderate intensive physical activity in addition to psychotherapy and milieu therapy. Underweight patients aimed to increase body weight with 0.5 kg/week until the weight gain goal was reached. Aerobic fitness, muscular strength, BMD and body composition were measured at admission and discharge. Results showed an increase in mean muscular strength, total body mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage, but not aerobic capacity, among both underweight and normal weight patients. Lumbar spine BMD increased among the underweight patients, no changes were observed in BMD among the normal weight patients. Three out of seven underweight patients were still underweight at discharge, and only three out of nine patients with excessive body fat (i.e., >33%) managed to reduce body fat to normal values during treatment. These results calls for a more individualized treatment approach to achieve a more optimal body composition among both underweight and normal to overweight patients with longstanding ED."}, {"Title": "The level of alexithymia in alcohol-dependent patients does not influence outcomes after inpatient treatment.", "Abstract": "The inability of individuals with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) to recognize and describe their feelings and cravings may be due to alexithymia. Previous researches have shown evidence for a negative influence of alexithymia on treatment outcomes in patients with AUD. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high alexithymic patients with AUD would benefit less from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with low alexithymic patients.\nOne hundred alcohol-dependent inpatients (DSM IV) were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for psychiatric disorders, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and the European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI). Baseline alexithymia, as a categorical and continuous variable, was used to compare or relate baseline demographic and addiction characteristics, time in treatment, abstinence, and differences in addiction severity at 1-year follow-up. Analyses were performed using \u03c7(2) test, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis, paired t-tests or Wilcoxon's signed rank tests, multivariate logistic, and linear regression models, as appropriate.\nThe prevalence of high alexithymia (TAS-20 > 61) was 45%. The total TAS-20 score correlated negatively with years of education (r = -.21; p = .04) and positively with the psychiatry domain of the EuropASI (r = .23; p = .04). Alexithymia showed no relation to abstinence, time in treatment, or change in severity of alcohol-related problems on the EuropASI.\nHigh alexithymic patients with AUD do benefit equally from inpatient CBT-like treatment as low alexithymic patients with AUD.\nMultimethod alexithymia assessments with an observer scale have been advised to judge the relationship with resulting outcome in CBT."}, {"Title": "Morris B. Parloff (1918-2011).", "Abstract": "Morris B. Parloff was considered an elder statesman in the field of psychotherapy research, and his wisdom and stewardship were of enormous benefit to several generations of psychotherapy researchers. Parloff received his bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University (1940), a degree in psychiatric social work from the University of Chicago (1942), and a doctorate in psychology from Western Reserve University (1953). Parloff spent most of his career (from 1953 until his retirement in 1983) as a researcher and administrator at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). He was also on the senior faculty of the Washington School of Psychiatry, taught or consulted at a number of universities, and maintained a private practice of psychotherapy. In the NIMH intramural program, Parloff was chief of the Section on Personality in the Laboratory of Psychology. There he conducted a major longitudinal study on the personality characteristics of adolescent and adult scientists. In the NIMH extramural program, he served as chief of the Psychotherapy and Behavioral Intervention Section in the Clinical Research Branch (1972-1980), after which he became chief of the new Psychosocial Treatments Research Branch. Throughout his career, from his pioneering teaching and research on group psychotherapy through his 30 years at NIMH, Parloff provided researchers and practitioners with a broad understanding of the field of psychotherapy research, the complexity of its subject matter, and its relationship to the \"real world.\" Often ahead of others in the field, Parloff dealt with many topics that retain their importance today, including the need to carefully define criteria for improvement in psychotherapy, the transmission of values in psychotherapy, the concepts of the placebo and of common factors in psychotherapy research, and the role of the patient-therapist relationship (in both individual and group therapy) and its impact on the outcome of therapy. Starting with a 1979 article in the American Psychologist (\"Can Psychotherapy Research Guide the Policymaker? Vol. 34, pp. 296-306), Parloff wrote extensively about the relationship among practitioners, psychotherapy researchers, and policymakers. To promote the systematic use of clinical trials and address methodological issues in the field, Parloff obtained support to fund the first NIMH multisite collaborative outcome study in the field of psychotherapy. He and the first author (I. E.) then designed and launched the NIMH Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program. This study would serve as a model for future collaborative research by independent investigators.

Disasters change patterns of thinking and the concept of security among members of a community, which highlights the importance of mental rehabilitation in disaster psychiatry. Mental rehabilitation is not only a short-term intervention, but also involves long-term follow-up and referral of cases to regular psychiatric management. We used PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) to search for papers related to the Chi-Chi Earthquake and the Morakot Typhoon published between January 2001 and November 2011. We found that 33 articles are involved in seven topics. The most common disaster-related psychiatric diagnoses were major depressive episodes and posttraumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder ranged from 8.0% to 34.3% in Taiwan after the 1999 Earthquake. However, lifetime and current prevalence for psychiatric disorders ranged from 1% to 74%, affecting women twice more than men.

It also examined the relationship between the students' characteristics and their attitudes in details.\nPre and post-surveys using Likert-type scales were conducted versus 106 medical students of Ahwaz Jondishapour University who entered psychiatric attachment between spring 2007 and spring 2010. They completed a demographic form and an \"attitude toward psychiatry\" questionnaire with two excess questions which measured their intention to pursue psychiatry as a career in future.\nThe majority of students appeared to have favorable attitudes before the attachment which improved during the course; but they didn't show significant change in their intention to pursue psychiatry as a prospective career. There was a significant correlation between age and change in attitudes. Also the career intention was significantly correlated with their attitudes.\nThe study confirms previous reports that training can change students' attitudes toward psychiatry, but contrasting with them suggests that negative attitudes are not likely to be the main cause of the low career intention to psychiatry. Thus, teaching psychiatry can get the students rid of their negative attitudes but is not enough to encourage them to pursue psychiatry as a career. The authors suggest it is based on poor opportunities for postgraduates in the field and social stigma attached to psychiatry, which needs further studies."}, {"Title": "Use and avoidance of seclusion and restraint: consensus statement of the american association for emergency psychiatry project Beta seclusion and restraint workgroup.", "Abstract": "Issues surrounding reduction and/or elimination of episodes of seclusion and restraint for patients with behavioral problems in crisis clinics, emergency departments, inpatient psychiatric units, and specialized psychiatric emergency services continue to be an area of concern and debate among mental health clinicians. An important underlying principle of Project BETA (Best practices in Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation) is noncoercive de-escalation as the intervention of choice in the management of acute agitation and threatening behavior. In this article, the authors discuss several aspects of seclusion and restraint, including review of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines regulating their use in medical behavioral settings, negative consequences of this intervention to patients and staff, and a review of quality improvement and risk management strategies that have been effective in decreasing their use in various treatment settings. An algorithm designed to help the clinician determine when seclusion or restraint is most appropriate is introduced. The authors conclude that the specialized psychiatric emergency services and emergency departments, because of their treatment primarily of acute patients, may not be able to entirely eliminate the use of seclusion and restraint events, but these programs can adopt strategies to reduce the utilization rate of these interventions."}, {"Title": "The psychopharmacology of agitation: consensus statement of the american association for emergency psychiatry project Beta psychopharmacology workgroup.", "Abstract": "Agitation is common in the medical and psychiatric emergency department, and appropriate management of agitation is a core competency for emergency clinicians.

Traditional methods of treating agitated patients, ie, routine restraints and involuntary medication, have been replaced with a much greater emphasis on a noncoercive approach. Experienced practitioners have found that if such interventions are undertaken with genuine commitment, successful outcomes can occur far more often than previously thought possible. In the new paradigm, a 3-step approach is used. First, the patient is verbally engaged; then a collaborative relationship is established; and, finally, the patient is verbally de-escalated out of the agitated state. Verbal de-escalation is usually the key to engaging the patient and helping him become an active partner in his evaluation and treatment; although, we also recognize that in some cases nonverbal approaches, such as voluntary medication and environment planning, are also important. When working with an agitated patient, there are 4 main objectives: (1) ensure the safety of the patient, staff, and others in the area; (2) help the patient manage his emotions and distress and maintain or regain control of his behavior; (3) avoid the use of restraint when at all possible; and (4) avoid coercive interventions that escalate agitation.

Nonetheless, emergency clinicians must perform an initial mental status screening to begin this process as soon as the agitated patient presents to an emergency setting. For this reason, the psychiatric evaluation of the agitated patient can be thought of as a 2-step process. First, a brief evaluation must be aimed at determining the most likely cause of agitation, so as to guide preliminary interventions to calm the patient. Once the patient is calmed, more extensive psychiatric assessment can be completed. The goal of the emergency assessment of the psychiatric patient is not necessarily to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Rather, ascertaining a differential diagnosis, determining safety, and developing an appropriate treatment and disposition plan are the goals of the assessment. This article will summarize what components of the psychiatric assessment can and should be done at the time the agitated patient presents to the emergency setting. The complete psychiatric evaluation of the patient whose agitation has been treated successfully is beyond the scope of this article and Project BETA (Best practices in Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation), but will be outlined briefly to give the reader an understanding of what a full psychiatric assessment would entail.

Data were collected by a questionnaire including items on work organization, team climate and time allocation that was responded to by 226 professionals from 44 interprofessional teams. An additional sample of 139 professionals from 18 teams responded to the same questionnaire except for the item on time allocation. The teams worked within occupational health care, psychiatry, rehabilitation and school health care. On average, team members spent about 22% of their available work time on internal meetings/consultations and they perceived their collaboration as fairly interdependent. No correlation was found between, on the one hand, time invested in meetings and informal consultations within the team and, on the other hand, degree of team interdependence. Instead, interdependence was predicted by team climate, followed by manager coordination and self-regulation. However, there may be a lower limit: all 44 teams allocated at least about 10% of their work time to internal meetings and consultations.

Off-label prescribing (i.e. prescribing a drug for an indication outside of that for which it is licensed) is legal and an integral part of medical practice. In psychiatry, off-label prescribing is common and gives clinicians scope to treat patients who are refractory to standard therapy or where there is no licensed medication for an indication. However, efficacy or safety of such off-label use may not be established. There is a growing list of licensed indications for atypical antipsychotics (AAP) beyond schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, and also more evidence for other indications where pharmaceutical companies have not obtained a license. Pharmaceutical companies have promoted AAPs for off-label indications to increase sales and consequently have been fined by the US FDA for this.

Given that an increasing percentage of the population is being treated with these agents, off-label prescribing of AAPs is a cause for concern; they have a propensity to cause significant side effects and their efficacy and long-term safety for most off-label indications remains largely unknown, and therefore the risks and benefits of their use should be carefully weighed up prior to prescribing these agents off-label."}, {"Title": "Can we address the shortage of psychiatrists in the correctional setting with exposure during residency training?", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residents at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center were surveyed to investigate their attitudes towards inmates, towards various aspects of correctional psychiatry and whether rotating at the local jail is associated with these attitudes. The overall opinion towards correctional psychiatry was fairly neutral though significantly more negative than towards inpatient psychiatry. While citing a high need for psychiatrists at correctional facilities, residents reported they are not likely to work there when they complete residency. No statistical differences were found between those residents who had rotated at the local jail and those who had not.

By 2005, North American professional medical associations of Psychiatry, Diabetes, and Endocrinology responded by recommending continuous metabolic monitoring for this population to control complications from obesity and diabetes. However, these recommendations do not identify the types of effective treatment for people with schizophrenia who have type II diabetes. To fill this gap, this systematic evidence review identifies effective lifestyle interventions that enhance quality care in individuals who are suffering from type II diabetes and schizophrenia or other schizoaffective disorders.\nA systematic search from Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ISI Web of Science was conducted. Of the 1810 unique papers that were retrieved, four met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were analyzed.\nThe results indicate that diabetes education is effective when it incorporates diet and exercise components, while using a design that addresses challenges such as cognition, motivation, and weight gain that may result from antipsychotics.\nThis paper begins to point to effective interventions that will improve type II diabetes management for people with schizophrenia or other schizoaffective disorders."}, {"Title": "Peritransplant psychiatric evaluation of patients with fanconi anemia.", "Abstract": "Patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) referred for stem cell transplantation (SCT) have multiple psychosocial risk factors and often present in distress in the peritransplant period.

Capgras syndrome was present at a significantly higher rate in the parricide group than in the stranger group. Drug compliance at the time of the offence was low in both groups.\nUntreated psychotic symptoms such as Capgras syndrome, living with elderly parents, especially mothers, and conflicts caused by victims' scolding, threatening forced hospitalisation, and forcing medication on the patients are associated with parricide among homicide offenders with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Shining light on wakefulness and arousal.", "Abstract": "Alterations in arousal states are associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders, addiction, schizophrenia, and depression. Therefore, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms controlling the boundaries between arousal, hyperarousal, and hypoarousal is a crucial endeavor in biological psychiatry. Substantial research over several decades has identified distinct arousal-promoting neural populations in the brain; however, how these nuclei act individually and collectively to promote and maintain wakefulness and various arousal states is unknown. We have recently applied optogenetic technology to the repertoire of techniques used to study arousal.

These PESs in EDs should be treated according to standards comparable to medically disabled patients. Thus it is necessary to learn more about the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities in EDs, about the procedures and the decision-making process whether these patients are transferred to further outpatient or inpatient treatment.\nA survey was conducted in EDs throughout Germany and 1,073 were contacted and asked to participate. The questionnaire consisted of questions concerning the size of the ED and of the hospital (e.g. number of patients and physicians), the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, standard procedures for dealing with PES and the method of care in six typical case reports.\nA total of 74 EDs participated (76% interdisciplinary EDs) with an average of 22,827 \u00b1 12,303 patients per year in the ED.

Patients with chronic tinnitus had a stronger SOC and better subjective mood, stronger commitment, and less anger and anxious depression than the patients with chronic pain, chronic asthma or atopic dermatitis. However, in patients with higher tinnitus annoyance, psychological comorbidity was similar to that found in patients with other chronic diseases.\nBesides collecting medical and social history, special psychometric instruments should be used for the diagnosis of tinnitus patients.

To address the increasing needs, psychiatric hospitals of various size and quality were gradually opened all over the country. Psychiatry as a field of science emerged in Latvia after the Declaration of Independence in 1918. Active and progressive development of services and the academic environment took place between the World Wars. During the Soviet regime, psychiatric services were rebuilt within the frameworks and guidelines of the existing system. Following the restoration of Independence in 1991, a number of rapid and positive changes took place. There was a gradual decrease in the number of hospital beds, outpatient services were developed and modern treatment methods were established. Policy documents in the field of mental health were developed and legislation improved. Active collaboration with other, particularly Scandinavian, countries was developed. Academic education continued and specialist training was provided following European standards. The role of the psychiatric professional organization was strengthened.\nMany positive changes in the mental healthcare in Latvia have taken place, but there are still some aspects to be addressed.

The design was a 16-week single-center randomized, open label trial of interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or antidepressant medication, with a 12-month naturalistic follow-up, conducted at a university psychiatry center in Canada. The main outcome measure was Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores at treatment end point. Childhood maltreatment was assessed at the completion of treatment using an interview-based contextual measure of childhood physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Multiple imputation was adopted to estimate missing values.\nPatients with severe maltreatment were significantly less likely to respond to interpersonal psychotherapy than to cognitive-behavioral therapy or medication (OR = 3.61), whereas no differences among treatments were found in those with no history of maltreatment (ORs < 1.50). Furthermore, maltreatment significantly predicted a shorter time to recurrence over follow-up across treatment conditions (OR = 3.04). These findings were replicated in the sample with complete case data.\nPatients with a history of childhood abuse may benefit more from antidepressant medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy than from interpersonal psychotherapy.

The relative role of biological, psychogenic and socialization-related factors varies with the individual case. Another well-known fact is that parents play a very important role in influencing whether their child gets the right treatment when it is necessary. In this paper we highlight the complex links between childhood and adulthood through the presentation of three psychiatric cases. The first story starts with a lactation psychosis of a mother and ends when the daughter who became psychotic at the age of 15 enters adulthood. During these 18 years several psychiatrically relevant episodes happened in the family. During our care, step by step, in relation to emerging psychological problems, the family revealed more and more secrets, explaining past events, and offering a possibility for psychoeducation and psychotherapy. Knowledge concerning the life and psychiatric history of parents, in spite of the fears of the family, largely contributed to evaluating the symptoms of the daughter, reaching a diagnosis, initiating and maintaining therapy and achieving the present balanced state. The next two cases present the stories of two boys with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). One of the children was 6 years old when the family sought professional help, and now he is 11, the other child was 8 years old when the parents sought help and he is 15 now.

The WEB condition consisted of monthly telepsychiatry sessions at the CHC for 6 months provided by one of two Hispanic psychiatrists using an online virtual meeting program. TAU patients received their care from their providers. Acceptability was assessed by comparing appointment keeping for primary care versus telepsychiatry, patients' perceived working alliance with their provider, visit satisfaction, and antidepressant use. Feasibility was assessed using depression outcomes, functional days (unproductive or days lost), and whether WEB and TAU patients differed in their appointment keeping.\nWEB patients did not differ in the proportion of completed primary care versus telepsychiatry appointments and rated their working alliance with the psychiatrist and their visit satisfaction significantly higher than the TAU patients with their provider. Significantly more WEB than TAU patients used antidepressants. Although depression severity decreased faster among WEB than TAU patients, no differences were found in the overall depression score.

However, the institution of psychiatry maintains an ambivalent attitude to the incorporation of religion and spirituality into psychiatric practice. This is despite the fact that many patients, especially those from underserved and underprivileged minority backgrounds, are devotedly religious and find much solace and support in their religiosity. I use the case of mental health of African Americans as an extended example to support the argument that psychiatric services must become more closely attuned to religious matters. I suggest ways in which this can be achieved. Attention to religion can aid in the development of culturally competent and accessible services, which in turn, may increase engagement and service satisfaction among religious populations."}, {"Title": "The modification of criminogenic factors on addicted offenders.

Because, our psychiatric reforms over 17 years, that reduced the average duration of hospitalization from about 2156 days to 61 days, has attained by deployment of various psycho-social approaches based on \"therapeutic community model\" and \"psychodynamic team treatment\". Furthermore, it has done by the affinity, continuity and complementarities of \"psychodynamic team treatment\" and psychosocial approaches with following special features. That is, since psycho-social approaches is 1. techniques to acquire the social life skill and to prevent re-hospitalization, 2. the group psychotherapy by facilitating the patient's mutual help capability, 3. based on \"acceptance of the disease\" by \"noticing the diagnosis\". Even if the therapeutic orientation or assumption of the psychiatric hospital does not comprehend above all of 1-3, it is important whether it is in the same direction or not.

Our hospital is for short term hospitalization and in focus on the outpatient treatment with \"psychodynamic team treatment\" based on \"therapeutic community model\". That is why our hospital has a potential advantage to take in and utilize the psycho-social approaches. On the other hand, there is the same reason why it is difficult for the traditional psychiatric hospital for long term hospitalization with higher hierarchical \"physical medicine model\" based on the descriptive psychiatry.

Therefore, these outreach services are completely different from traditional monitoring based outreach services. These supports require skills which are different from those in psychiatric hospitals. Those differences would be visible in terms of skills because staff will be exposed to \"life\" of patients. Furthermore, those differences in skills would come up from necessity of facing negative feeling of people who receive outreach services often have toward medical care and support. Based on this standpoint, the author proposed tentative plan which divided necessary skills for outreach into five phases from the viewpoint of the training as follows: Level 1: Shifting perspectives from illness management to community living based, Level 2: Knowing their living situations and strengths. Building trusting relationship as staying present to the person. Level 3: Staying on top of skills in strength model, case management, and psychoeducation. Level 4: Being able to work in a team setting smoothly. Level 5: Even if the paternalism is necessary in the particular situation, staff needs to be able to face that situation without escaping.

Only 21% of adults in Mexico achieve the equivalent of a high school education. We examined the relationship between school dropout and self-reported psychiatric symptoms in a middle school in a suburb of Mexico City. We used binomial logistic regression to examine the odds ratio (OR) of school dropout associated with students' self-reported psychopathology. Two-hundred thirty-seven students participated in the study. Psychosis [OR\u2009=\u20098.0 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-37.2)], depression [OR\u2009=\u20094.7 (95% CI: 2.2-9.7)], tic disorders [OR\u2009=\u20093.7 (95% CI: 1.4-9.5)], ADHD [OR\u2009=\u20093.2 (95% CI: 1.5-6.4)], and social phobia [OR\u2009=\u20092.6 (95% CI: 1.2-5.8)] were associated with increased risk of school dropout after controlling for age and gender as covariates. Our study suggested that students' self-reported psychopathology is associated with increased school dropout in Mexico. ADHD and depression may be particularly useful childhood psychiatric disorders to target with public health interventions because they explain the greatest amount of the variance in school dropout of child psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "How biomarkers will change psychiatry: from clinical trials to practice. Part I: introduction.", "Abstract": "Part I of this series defines biomarkers and discusses their research utility and potential application in clinical practice. To provide a frame of reference, biomarkers commonly used in general medicine are reviewed, with a focus on low density lipoprotein as a biomarker for risk of developing atherosclerosis. The use of biomarkers in research on psychiatric illnesses is then reviewed. While biomarkers currently have only a limited role in psychiatric care, their use has improved our ability to assess potential efficacy and safety of investigational new drugs. For example, positron emission tomography can be used to measure dopamine D2 receptor occupancy (relevant for antipsychotic effects) or serotonin transporter occupancy (relevant for antidepressant effects), to establish whether an agent reaches and to what extent it affects a specific target in the brain. In the future, biomarkers are likely to become an integral component of psychiatric treatment, providing information concerning a patient's odds of developing an illness, diagnosis, severity of illness, and level of response to therapeutic interventions. The second part of this series will discuss research on derivatives of the inflammatory biomarker thromboxane and depression."}, {"Title": "Medical countertransference and the trainee: identifying a training gap.", "Abstract": "Although consultation-liaison (CL) psychiatrists are implicitly expected to recognize and consider interpersonal dynamics in clinical settings when offering recommendations, few guiding principles have been established, strongly suggesting the presence of a training gap.\nTrainees in psychiatry residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) were invited to complete an Internet-based, 20-item, Likert scale questionnaire assessing practices and opinions concerning countertransference management and training.\nOf 192 respondents, 162 (84%) reported having participated in a rotation on the CL service for at least some period of time and were eligible to complete the survey; 136 (71%) reported having completed at least 2 months of CL rotations. Approximately 80% identified a frequent need to address countertransference reactions when working with primary medical/surgical teams, but less than a quarter reported doing so regularly. The motivation for addressing such issues in over half of the respondents was the belief that it would be \"clinically beneficial\" to patients, although 40% of respondents also feared that this practice could \"worsen the relationship between the CL consultant and the primary team.\" Regarding training, 95% of respondents felt didactics addressing counter-transference would be \"clinically beneficial\"; however, three fifths of the respondents reported that \"very few\" to none of their didactics explored this issue.\nResults of this study suggest that discrepancies exist between trainee perceptions of the utility of countertransference management in CL psychiatry and actual training in this area. The authors discuss possible explanations for these discrepancies and advocate for the establishment of formal guidelines in training CL residents in such aptitudes.

Biographical and clinical factors, e.g., the number of prior offences, type of offence, and psychiatric diagnosis, count among the factors that influence the treatment duration and the likelihood of discharge. The aims of the current study were threefold: (1) to provide an estimate of the German forensic psychiatric patient population with a low likelihood of discharge, (2) to replicate a set of personal variables that predict a relatively high, as opposed to a low, likelihood of discharge from forensic psychiatric hospitals, and (3) to describe a group of other factors that are likely to add to the existing body of knowledge. Based on a sample of 899 patients, we applied a battery of primarily biographical and other personal variables to two subgroups of patients. The first subgroup of patients had been treated in a forensic psychiatric hospital according to section 63 of the German legal code for at least ten years (long-stay patients, n=137), whereas the second subgroup had been released after a maximum treatment period of four years (short-stay patients, n=67). The resulting logistic regression model had a high goodness of fit, with more than 85% of the patients correctly classified into the groups. In accordance with earlier studies, we found a series of personal variables, including age at first admission and type of offence, to be predictive of a short or long-stay. Other findings, such as the high number of immigrants among the short-stay patients and the significance of a patient's work time before admission to a forensic psychiatric hospital, are more clearly represented than has been observed in previous research."}, {"Title": "[Psychopharmacology and oral psychosomatic disorder].", "Abstract": "It is uncommon to encounter patients presenting with medically and psychiatry unexplained oral symptoms like pain or discomfort. These symptoms have been called \"oral psychosomatic disorders (OPSD)\" in general. From a clinical point of view, OPSD may be due to several biochemical disorders involving neurotransmitters in the brain, incomplete connections between oral region and undefined complaints due to cognitive processes in higher centers of the brain. The main psychosomatic treatment is psychopharmacological therapy with antidepressants, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), and other antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine)\". The proper use of these antidepressants is extremely important for the successful treatment of OPSD."}, {"Title": "Key stakeholder perceptions regarding acute care psychiatry in distressed publicly funded mental health care markets.", "Abstract": "The role of acute care inpatient psychiatry, public and private, has changed dramatically since the 1960s, especially as recent market forces affecting the private sector have had ripple effects on publicly funded mental health care. Key stakeholders' experiences, perceptions, and opinions regarding the role of acute care psychiatry in distressed markets of publicly funded mental health care were examined. A qualitative research study was conducted using semi-structured thematic interviews with 52 senior mental health system administrators, clinical directors and managers, and nonclinical policy specialists. Participants were selected from markets in six regions of the United States that experienced recent significant closures of acute care psychiatric beds. Qualitative data analyses yielded findings that clustered around three sets of higher order themes: structure of care, service delivery barriers, and outcomes. Structure of care suggests that acute care psychiatry is seen as part of a continuum of services; service delivery barriers inhibit effective delivery of services and are perceived to include economic, regulatory, and political factors; outcomes include fragmentation of mental health care services across the continuum, the shift of mental health care to the criminal justice system, and market-specific issues affecting mental health care. Findings delineate key stakeholders' perceptions regarding the role acute care psychiatry plays in the continuum of care for publicly funded mental health and suggest that public mental health care is inefficacious. Results carry implications for policy makers regarding strategies/policies to improve optimal utilization of scarce resources for mental health care, including greater focus on psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Are Psychiatric Diagnoses an Obstacle for Research and Practice? Reliability, Validity and the Problem of Psychiatric Diagnoses. The Case of GAD.", "Abstract": "The present article focused on the problem of validity, reliability and specificity of psychiatric diagnoses.The authors moved by the concept of syndrome, defined by Sydenham in the 18th century as a constellation of several interrelated symptoms, showing a stable, characteristic structure and a peculiar prognosis, in order to analyse the peculiarity of the current psychiatric nosology. In our opinion, the current nosographic system based on DSM-IV criteria, prevents psychiatry from benefiting of the significant technological progress that has led the rest of medical sciences to important clinical achievements in the last 20 years. The case of Generalized Anxiety Disorder was taken as an example of a disease characterized by unstable diagnostic criteria, high rate of comorbidity and uncertain boundaries. An analysis of the data from the Sesto Fiorentino study was performed to investigate the presence of common mood and anxiety symptoms across the most represented DSM IV diagnoses, in order to evaluate the specificity of these symptoms.The results supported the hypothesis of a low specificity of these symptoms, suggesting the need for psychiatry to find new and more specific markers and instruments."}, {"Title": "Alcohol and drug misuse, risk of re-admission to a general hospital and psychiatric contact.", "Abstract": "Patients with physical problems related to the use of alcohol or drugs often present to general hospitals in an unplanned, emergency fashion. In 2005, the Kerr report concluded that fundamental changes were needed in our approach, shifting the emphasis from a reactive to a more proactive, prevention-based model in the treatment of acute medical conditions. We studied patients who had at least one alcohol- or drug-related emergency admission, whose most recent admission was to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and who, using the Scottish Patients at Risk of Re-admission and Admission (SPARRA) All Ages Tool, were thought to be at high risk of further emergency admission. We examined data sets derived from the National Health Service National Services Scotland Information Services Division, a Liaison Psychiatry database, data from the local psychiatric Patient Information Management System and data collected by the hospital alcohol liaison nurse to examine this group of patients further and consider the scope for any future intervention. Patients who have an alcohol- or drug-related emergency admission to the general hospital are at increased risk of re-admission. A substantial proportion of these patients has come into contact with the psychiatric services, often attracting a substance misuse and/or personality disorder diagnosis. A significant proportion also presents in the context of self-harm. In conclusion, this group of frequent hospital attenders may be difficult to engage but may benefit from more proactive intervention, a more joined-up management approach and the development of an enhanced general hospital alcohol liaison service."}, {"Title": "Mentally challenged patients in a forensic hospital: a feasibility study concerning the executive functions of forensic patients with organic brain disorder, learning disability, or mental retardation.", "Abstract": "The past years have seen an increasing number of patients of lower intelligence or with organic brain disorder being committed into our forensic psychiatry. Our clinic has an ongoing scientific project to investigate the possibilities of reducing costs while at the same time guaranteeing adequate treatment and enforcement practice in forensic hospitals. This current project did not take these kinds of patients into consideration initially. This feasibility study is intended to examine if and to what extent these patients can be part of the scientific project. All patients of forensic psychiatry in Rostock (Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania) with an IQ<80 (learning disorder) or a primary or secondary organic brain dysfunction that have been committed to the clinic since 2009 are included. These patients went through an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Furthermore, the treating psychotherapists had to rate the prognoses for criminal re-offending at discharge. Patients affected by lower intelligence or an organic brain dysfunction achieve lower results in neuropsychological testing than other patients participating in the main project. Nevertheless, participation in neuropsychological testing does not appear to overtax them.

Professionals' recognition that we have complementary, nonoverlapping clinical skills with recognizance of shared and overlapping populations is vital. The beauty of collaboration is the appreciation of the full value of each participant's unique contribution and diversity.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a prenatal program based on a psychosomatic approach on the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) and preterm childbirth.\nControlled clinical trial, randomized and multicenter study. A total of 184 pregnant women identified as vulnerable to PPD who had psychosocial risk factors associated with preterm childbirth were assigned to the experimental group (EG) (n=92) or control group (CG) (n=92), according to a computerized program. The EG participated in the program with a psychosomatic approach (10 sessions (one/week) for 2 h, 15 m) with a phone call between sessions; the objectives implicated the mother, father and baby contemplating pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. Women in the EC made the usual program of the health center (8-10 weekly sessions of 2 hours), with no calls, with targets aimed at delivery. There were 2 evaluations: one in pregnancy and another in postpartum (T(1) and T(2)) including symptoms of depression (EPDS), social support (FSSQ), stress (scale events), the relationship (DAS) and the preterm childbirth.\nThere was a difference of 11.2 in the percentage of cases at risk of PPD (EPDS\u226512): 45.5% (27) in the CG and 34.3% (24) in the EG, without reaching statistical significance (P=.26). The preterm delivery showed significance differences (P=.003), with a decrease in preterm childbirth 4 times lower in the EG.\nOverall, the percentage of mothers at PPD risk was higher (P=.02) in women with preterm childbirth.

Although DSMBs have been used for clinical trials in cardiology, oncology, and infectious disease for decades, it was not until the late 1990s that the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) initially required a DSMB for some of its larger trials. The NIMH mandate expanded during the succeeding decade to require DSMBs for many of the clinical trials in psychiatry. In turn, the need for board members has grown quickly. The objective of this commentary is to consider the purpose of a DSMB and to describe its roles, responsibilities, composition, and implementation. The rationale for a DSMB is to ensure the integrity and validity of the trial and, most importantly, to protect the safety of trial participants. A board conducts comprehensive reviews of accumulating unblinded data for safety and, in some trials, for efficacy. Reviewers examine adverse events and serious adverse events at regular intervals during the course of the trial. In addition, a DSMB monitors recruitment, randomization, retention, adherence, and follow-up in an effort to evaluate the validity of a trial. Because it is unethical to expose a participant to the risks of an experiment that will be unable to answer the scientific question that was postulated, a board should also evaluate the study protocol prior to trial commencement. Ultimately, a DSMB's responsibilities are broader than that of the trial being monitored. It will protect potential study participants and eventually could affect patients seeking clinical treatment for the disorder being studied."}, {"Title": "Is there a difference in subjective experience of cognitive function in patients with unipolar disorder versus bipolar disorder?", "Abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction in unipolar disorder (UD) and bipolar disorder (BD) may persist into remission and affect psychosocial function. Executive and memory deficits during remission may be more pronounced in BD than UD. However, patients' subjective experience of cognitive difficulties is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether BD and UD patients experience different cognitive difficulties.\nTo investigate whether there are differences in the quality and magnitude of subjective cognitive difficulties between UD and BD, and which factors influence the subjective cognitive difficulties in these patients.\nPatients with BD (n =\u200954) or UD (n =\u200945) were referred to the outpatient mood disorder clinic at Department of Psychiatry, Copenhagen University Hospital, following hospital discharge. Affective symptoms and patients' experience of cognitive symptoms were assessed at their initial consultation at the clinic.\nPatients experienced mild to moderate cognitive impairment despite being in partial or full remission, but there were no differences in subjective difficulties between BD and UD. Subjective cognitive dysfunction was predicted by depression severity, anxiety and mania symptoms rather than by diagnosis, age, gender or alcohol misuse.\nThe absence of difference in subjective cognitive difficulties between UD and BD contrasts with evidence of greater objective dysfunction in BD. This highlights a potential discord between subjective and objective measures of cognitive function. Subjective cognitive function was predicted by affective symptoms, perhaps suggesting that this reflects mood symptoms rather than objective deficits. This points to a clinical need for objective assessment of cognitive function in these patient groups."}, {"Title": "[Friedrich Panse: well established in all systems. Psychiatrist in the Weimar Republic, in the Third Reich, and in the Federal Republic of Germany].", "Abstract": "The psychiatrist Friedrich Panse (1899-1973) was a T4 assessor during the Nazi era who sent mentally disabled and mentally ill people to their deaths. In the German Armed Forces he used higher galvanic currents to cure \"war neurotics\" and expose \"malingerers.\" As a National Socialist he was a committed teacher of racial hygiene. Nonetheless, after the end of the Nazi regime many supporters quickly surfaced who were prepared to exonerate Panse. Panse himself was not among those who indignantly repudiated the accusation of any contact with the Nazi Party. He did not deny that he had openly embraced the Nazi measures for preserving the genetic integrity of the populace, but he did let it be known that he had suffered incredibly under the heavy burden. The State Government of North Rhine-Westphalia refused to allow Panse to continue in his capacity as an extraordinary professor.

Autobiographies from three different political systems exist - Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, and postwar Germany in which he constantly reinvented himself. While after 1933 he suddenly emphasized his participation in the civil war turmoil during the early period of the Weimar Republic and his patriotism, he then depicted himself after 1945 as an apolitical person characterized by W\u00fcrttemberg pietism who inwardly rejected the Nazi State but had found himself prepared to accept \"all sorts of humiliating concessions.\" He claimed that he had always remained true to his scientific code of conduct and had distanced himself from psychiatric genetics. In point of fact, Mauz was among those exonerated in the denazification trial in 1946 and was able to pursue his career in the Federal Republic of Germany. However, if the sources are read against the grain, a different picture emerges. Mauz's career stalled in the 1930s, not because he had been politically offensive, but because his scientific work was flimsy and considered lacking originality, particularly since he had chosen constitution research and psychotherapy as his main fields of interest, which were overshadowed by research in genetic psychiatry in the 1930s. Mauz tendered his services to the Nazi policy of genetic health, served as a medical assessor in proceedings based on the \"Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring,\" permitted himself to be recruited for the T4 program as a medical expert, even participated in the deliberations on a future \"Law on Euthanasia,\" and as a consulting psychiatrist for the German Armed Forces contributed to military medicine."}, {"Title": "[Murdering the sick in the name of progress? The Heidelberg psychiatrist Carl Schneider as a brain researcher and \"therapeutic idealist\"].", "Abstract": "The biography of the Heidelberg Professor of Psychiatry Carl Schneider (1891-1946) represents a combination of a quest for psychiatric reform, pronounced interest in brain research, and commitment to the first systematic extermination of a minority during the Nazi era, the murder of psychiatric patients. Guided by a biological concept that included the individual and his environment and thus interpreting the interactive and social sphere from a purely biological viewpoint, Schneider considered cure and extermination as two sides of the same coin. Psychiatric patients should receive intensive \"biological\" therapy, but if they were incurable and could not be integrated into society, they lost their reason for existence also in the biological sense. This can be illustrated by Schneider's research department in Heidelberg (1943/1944) where 52 children and adolescents were subjected to an extensive diagnostic program. Twenty of these children were murdered in the name of research at the Eichberg psychiatric asylum."}, {"Title": "Canadian guidelines for the evidence-based treatment of tic disorders: pharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "This article seeks to provide the practising clinician with guidance on the pharmacological management of tic disorders in children and adults. We performed a systematic review of the literature on the treatment of tic disorders. A multi-institutional group of 14 experts in psychiatry, child psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, and psychology engaged in a consensus meeting. The evidence was presented and discussed, and nominal group techniques were employed to arrive at consensus on recommendations. A strong recommendation is made when the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks and burdens, and can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation. With a weak recommendation, the benefits, risks, and burdens are more closely balanced, and the best action may differ depending on the circumstances. Based on these principles, weak recommendations were made for the use of pimozide, haloperidol, fluphenazine, metoclopramide (children only), risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, topiramate, baclofen (children only), botulinum toxin injections, tetrabenazine, and cannabinoids (adults only). Strong recommendations were made for the use of clonidine and guanfacine (children only). While the evidence supports the efficacy of many of the antipsychotics for the treatment of tics, the high rates of side effects associated with these medications resulted in only weak recommendations for these drugs. In situations where tics are not severe or disabling, the use of a medication with only a weak recommendation is not warranted. However, when tics are more distressing and interfering, the need for tic suppression to improve quality of life is stronger, and patients and clinicians may be more willing to accept the risks of pharmacotherapy."}, {"Title": "Addressing therapeutic boundaries in social networking.", "Abstract": "Facebook is the leading social networking website, with over 500 million users.

He had already published A Monograph on Mental Unsoundness in 1855, the first book of the Treatise in its first edition. Wharton was convinced that many criminals had an inner compulsion to confess or to be caught, explained as divine jurisprudence. His remarks on confessions include a typology spanning psychodynamics to police tactics, using contemporaneous, historical, and literary examples. This remarkable document provides insight into the dynamics of unintended and involuntary confessions and is compatible, in part, with current scholarship.

I applaud Ash for beginning a dialogue on the clinical dimension of this topic, and I appreciate his emphasis on the need for developmentally informed assessment of juvenile defendants. In this commentary, I briefly illustrate how the principles of developmental psychopathology can be used to articulate a developmental-ecological model of criminal culpability for use by forensic clinicians in the assessment of younger defendants, as the courts more broadly accept the concept of mitigation of legal responsibility by reason of developmental immaturity."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive functions in children and adolescents with subclinical hypothyroidism.", "Abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a metabolic condition that can lead to cognitive and behavioral deficits in children and adolescents.

Many articles have concluded that client participation is limited; professionals often still control the participation process and outcomes.\nThe objective of this study is to gain insight into (i) the practice of client participation within a quality improvement collaborative in mental health care and (ii) the consequences of a Foucauldian conceptualization of power in analysing practices of client participation.\nWe used an ethnographic design consisting of observations of national events and improvement team meetings and interviews with the collaborative's team members and programme managers.\nContrary to many studies on client participation, we found both clients and service providers frequently felt powerless in its practice. Professionals and clients alike struggled with the contributions clients could make to the improvement processes and what functions they should fulfil. Moreover, professionals did not want to exert power upon clients, but ironically just for that reason sometimes struggled with shaping practices of client participation. This mutual powerlessness (partly) disappeared when clients helped to determine and execute specific improvement actions instead of participating in improvement teams.\nRecognizing that power is inescapable might allow for a more substantive discussion concerning the consequences that power arrangements produce, rather than looking at who is exerting how much power."}, {"Title": "Recovery as the new medical model for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Treatment grounded in recovery principles is often viewed as not being based on the \"medical model.\" In this Open Forum the author asserts that recovery from mental illness is entirely compatible with concepts of recovery from medical illness and with new approaches to medical treatment. Three ways of conceptualizing recovery are defined: clinical recovery, illness management, and personal recovery. Basing treatment on recovery principles is supported by research that has shown significant remission rates over time among persons with schizophrenia. The author uses examples of public figures and of one family with physical disabilities to illustrate the progress society has made toward accepting and including people with physical illness and disability. Recovery-oriented mental health treatment parallels the move in other medical specialties toward person-centered care. A clinical approach to promote recovery is discussed."}, {"Title": "Figures and institutions of the neurological sciences in Paris from 1800 to 1950. Part III: neurology.", "Abstract": "We present a short historical review of the major figures, their administrative functions and their works that contributed to make Paris a renowned centre of physiology and neurology during the xixth and the first half of the xxth century. We purposely chose to focus on the period 1800-1950, as 1800 corresponds to the actual beginning of neurosciences, and 1950 marks their exponential rise. Our presentation is divided into four chapters, matching the main disciplines which have progressed and contributed the most to the knowledge we have of the brain sciences: anatomy, physiology, neurology, and psychiatry-psychology. The present article is the third of four parts of this review, and deals with neurology. A special credit should be given to Jean-Martin Charcot who founded the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re School of neurology and became one of the world's most important neurologists of the xixth century. We provide below the biographical sketches of Armand Trousseau, Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne, Jean-Martin Charcot, Alfred Vulpian, D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Magloire Bourneville, Paul Richer, Henri Parinaud, Albert Pitres, Jules Joseph Dejerine, Mrs. Augusta Dejerine-Klumpke, \u00c9douard Brissaud, Pierre Marie, Georges \u00c9douard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, Joseph Babinski, Andr\u00e9 Thomas, Georges Marinesco, Achille Alexandre Souques, Georges Guillain and Charles Foix."}, {"Title": "Recovery in the USA: from politics to peer support.", "Abstract": "Efforts to transform the mental health service delivery system to a more consumer-driven and recovery-orientated approach has its roots in a somewhat radical anti-psychiatry and civil-rights movement dating back to the 1970s. This grass-roots effort gained momentum and credibility with Harding's landmark study published in 1988 followed by the work of Anthony et al. from Boston University in beginning to define the term 'recovery'. In 1998 the Office of the US Surgeon General issued its first report on mental health, and this critical view of the shortcomings of the existing service system set the stage for the 2003 President's New Freedom Commission and its recommendations for recovery-orientated systems transformation. The recovery movement has evolved from a more radical view in the early days, to participatory involvement in systems, to returning to alternative models of care that are more independent. Now as more peer specialists work in systems, there is an increased emphasis on non-medical alternatives and the cycle continues. Regardless, recovery, self-determination, choice, etc. are always at the centre. This paper notes the interesting cycles of recovery-orientation and how they spin around the values/tenets of the movement's early roots."}, {"Title": "Alexithymia is not a stable personality trait in patients with substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "The construct of alexithymia as a vulnerability factor for substance use disorders (SUD) is under debate, because of conflicting research results regarding alexithymia as a state or trait phenomenon. The absolute and relative stability of alexithymia were evaluated in a pre-post design as part of a randomised controlled trial, controlling for several co-variates. Assessments were done with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) at baseline and follow-up of a 3-month trial of inpatient Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with or without a Shared Decision Making intervention for 187 SUD patients. Paired sample t-tests and analyses of variance were performed to assess absolute stability, intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for relative stability and multivariate linear regression models were used to evaluate the relation between co-variates and change in alexithymia. Mean level reduction of total TAS-20 and two subfactors demonstrated no absolute stability, but change in alexithymia differed for patients with low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. Relative stability of alexithymia was moderate to high for the total population, but differed according to low, moderate and high alexithymia scores. The EuropASI \"psychiatry\" domain, covering anxiety and depression, was related to alexithymia, but CBT-related variables were not. In conclusion, alexithymia is partly a state-dependent phenomenon, but not a stable personality trait in this SUD population."}, {"Title": "[The placebo effect: general information and specificities in psychiatry (depression and schizophrenia)].", "Abstract": "Placebos, consequences of their use, the placebo effect and the associated negative effects, the nocebo effect, have been widely studied. However, the lack of any consensus definition makes the interpretation and analysis of such findings difficult.\nIn this article, we will review existing definitions and factors affecting the placebo effect in medicine. We will then consider the possible mechanisms of action of the placebo effect, with a view to improving understanding of this issue. Finally, we will analyse data relating to placebos used in psychiatry and, more specifically, for schizophrenic patients. In an extensive review of the literature, we identified the various factors playing a role in the appearance of placebo effects in general medicine. As well as purely factual elements, such as the disorder, the sex of the subject and the treatment given, the placebo effect is strongly correlated with the quality of the relationship between the doctor and patient and with the capacity of the patient to communicate and establish a link. The attitude of the doctor, the temperament of the subject and the expectations and beliefs of each also contribute to the appearance and extent of a placebo effect. We then investigated placebo effects in psychiatry, particularly in depressed patients (the most widely studied condition) where studies have shown particular efficacy. We also addressed the use of placebos in schizophrenia: the placebo effect in patients with this disorder is essentially used as a tool for assessing new molecules to be released onto the market but the phenomenon itself has been little studied, if at all. Thus, it is of particular interest to consider in detail the use of placebos in schizophrenia, to try to gain a deeper understanding of the factors involved. This will allow potential specific effects associated with placebo use in this disorder to be established, improving the integration of placebos into therapy and to optimize the efficacy of treatment prescribed, taking into account mental state; indeed, the placebo effect is present in all treatments, whether involving a placebo or an active compound."}, {"Title": "[Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of dissociative disorders and somatoform disorders in Burkina Faso].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of dissociative and somatoform disorders in the psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Yalgado Ou\u00e9draogo, in Burkina Faso.\nWe carried out a retrospective and descriptive study over five years, from January 2003 to December 2007, of patients admitted in the psychiatric department for dissociative and somatoform disorders. The data were extracted from the medical notes and registers of consultation. After identification of the patients, the medical notes were exploited with a structured collect form for data on sociodemographic characteristics, life events and ICD-10 diagnoses.

The majority of the patients were followed as outpatients (71%). Women were more represented with a sex ratio of four women to one man. The majority of the patients were young with an average age of 30 and mostly single (57.9%). The majority of the patients had a low academic standard, in connection with young age of the population. A striking biographic event was found in the majority of the cases; essentially family difficulties and death. Neurological symptoms were the most frequent in 63% of the cases. According to ICD-1O, dissociative disorders were most frequent (65.6%).

The remission rate using atypical antipsychotic treatment was assessed using survival analysis while the patterns of prescribing atypical antipsychotics were delineated using percentages.\nOf the 18 patients, 15 fulfilled the remission criteria. The mean time to remission was 10.3 weeks (SD 8.4). The incidence-density of the remission rate for bipolar depression treated with atypical antipsychotics was 8.1 per 100 person-weeks (SD 2.4, 95% CI 4.5-13.4). One patient achieved remission using only atypical antipsychotic monotherapy while 17 received a combination of atypical antipsychotics plus one or more of the following: antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics and/or lithium.

On the basis of a clinic-referred sample of 162 children, we examined whether children with and without regulatory symptoms differed in the quality of parent-child relationship and parental mental health, and how often the criteria of the symptom triad were fulfilled in the group of children with regulatory symptoms. In addition, emotional and behavior problems were compared in children with and without regulatory symptoms. Children with regulatory symptoms and children with other psychiatric symptoms did not differ with respect to child-parent relationship quality. However, parents of children with regulatory symptoms scored higher on the Symptom Checklist 90 Items-Revised (G.H. Franke, 2002) than did the other parents. On the Child Behavior Checklist (T.M. Achenbach & L.A. Rescorla, 2000), children with regulatory symptoms tended to show more somatic problems, but they showed significantly less withdrawn behavior than did the other children. Of the 67 children with regulatory symptoms, only 11 (16.4%) fulfilled all three criteria of a regulatory disorder."}, {"Title": "Early intervention in psychosis: Insights from Korea.", "Abstract": "Subjects at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis have been the focus of clinical attention in psychiatry for the last 15 years, leading to the development of valid and reliable diagnostic instruments to detect these individuals early in the course of their illness. These efforts have resulted in research into optimal preventive measures. Our experiences at and data from the Seoul Youth Clinic support the validity of the CHR concept and its underlying neurobiological basis and provide valuable information related to the determination of appropriate clinical interventions. The limitations of the current criteria for CHR, such as the relatively low transition rates to psychosis and the \"false-positive\" problem, are also common critical issues in Korea. Additionally, concerns about social stigmatization and the potential side effects of pharmacotherapy render individuals at CHR reluctant to visit clinical settings. Therefore, further investigations using a combination of predictive markers based on clinical and neurobiological studies of those at CHR are needed to refine the diagnostic criteria, overcome their current limitations including ethical issues, and develop phase-specific and individualized therapeutic interventions."}, {"Title": "Early psychosis in Asia: Insights from Japan.", "Abstract": "The largest task for psychiatry in Japan today is the deinstitutionalization of patients with psychiatric disorders.

At present, however, there is still no category for early intervention in the national health reimbursement schedule. Recent research has shown that the mean duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) at seven university hospitals in Japan was 17.6 months. We present data using case vignettes suggesting that pharmacotherapy might be overused in prodromal cases. The concept of an At-Risk Mental State (ARMS)/prodromal state might not yet be widely recognized among Japanese psychiatrists. We outline early intervention initiatives in Japan; The Japanese Society for Prevention and Early Intervention in Psychiatry (JSEIP), and a representative early intervention facility for young people is the \"Il Bosco\" in Tokyo. There are several leading centers for early intervention research and practice in Japan. Most of them are driven by university departments of psychiatry with respect to both research and clinical activities.

The respondents were based in internal medicine, surgery, emergency medicine, anaesthetics, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and smaller disciplines (ear, nose and throat, ophthalmology, intensive care, radiology, psychiatry and pathology). Knowledge of CPR in this study population was uneven and overall inadequate. Only 51 respondents (59%) knew that basic CPR was a priority over intubation. 72 (83%) knew the correct compression: ventilation ratio for children but only 38 (44%) knew this for adults. 33 (38%) knew the correct compression rate for children and 29 (33%) for adults. 40 (46%) knew the correct compression depth for children and 35 (40%) for adults. 60 (69%) knew the sites for defibrillator pads. Knowledge of types of defibrillator and shockable rhythms was poor: 21 (24%) gave two correct arrhythmias for defibrillation and 44 (51%) gave one. Medical officers in training appeared to have better knowledge than their colleagues in postgraduate training programs. As a group, doctors working in emergency medicine, anaesthetics and intensive care had better knowledge of adult resuscitation than their counterparts in the other adult disciplines and had similar knowledge of paediatric resuscitation to that of their paediatric counterparts, although overall knowledge was incomplete in all groups.

Feedback about positive and negative outcomes of participation in the PMG was determined by open-ended response to three sets of questions; qualitative analysis was performed by an outside research consultant.\nProgram evaluation revealed benefits and undesirable or unintended outcomes. Reported benefits were increased workplace satisfaction; improved social connection; increased professional productivity and personal growth/development through accountability, collaboration, mutual learning, support, and information sharing; synergy, collaboration, and diversity of thought; increased involvement in professional activities; opportunity for peer discussions in a safe environment; and increased accountability and motivation. Undesirable or unintentional outcomes were exclusivity, lack of hierarchy, scheduling of meetings, absence of an intentional curriculum, diverse and competing interests, personal-professional enmeshment, and occasional loss of focus due to overemphasis on personal matters. Every member of the PMG was retained, and scholarly productivity increased, as did collaboration with other group members.\nParticipants in this PMG experienced qualitative benefits and perceived advantages in career advancement and scholarly productivity. Negative consequences did not deter participation in the PMG or outweigh benefits.

Many factors contribute to the current state of psychiatric care. Psychiatry is a shortage specialty, and this will become worse in the near future. In addition, financial pressures have led to decreases in psychiatric inpatient and outpatient services and to shorter lengths of hospitalization for even the sickest patients. This has resulted in fragmented care and an overreliance on polypharmacy. To reach the large number of patients needing psychiatric services, health care systems must change and take advantage of collaborative and integrative care models and new technologies. Psychiatrists must learn to partner more effectively with primary care providers to extend their expertise to the greatest number of patients. Currently, psychiatric diagnosis is based on a criteria-based system that was developed in the 1970s. Advances in systems and molecular neuroscience are beginning to elucidate specific brain systems that are dysfunctional in psychiatric illness. This has the potential to revolutionize psychiatric diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, psychiatry has not yet been successful in incorporating the language of this research into clinically meaningful terminology. If neuroscientific progress is to be translated into clinical advances, this must change. Residency programs must better prepare their graduates to keep up with a psychiatry literature that will increasingly use the language of neural circuits to describe psychiatric symptomatology and treatments."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent depression: psychotherapeutic, ethical, and related nonpharmacologic considerations for general psychiatrists and others who prescribe.", "Abstract": "Depression is a common, recurring disorder affecting millions of youth at some point before they reach mature adulthood. Given the shortage of and uneven distribution of psychiatrists who have completed specialized fellowships in child and adolescent psychiatry, a significant number of depressed youth will receive their pharmacotherapy from general psychiatrists and other prescribers with varying degrees of interest, training, and even willingness to treat children and adolescents. For general psychiatrists who will prescribe antidepressants for minors, knowledge of the training and expertise of nonphysician mental health professionals, the psychotherapies they may employ, and familiarity with school services are essential. Physicians who typically work only with adults will also need familiarity with differing ethical, legal, and regulatory issues and standards applicable to pediatric psychopharmacology.

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between quality of life (QOL) and key indicators for long-term hospital stays among schizophrenia inpatients. A further aim was to elucidate the clinical determinants of QOL among long-stay inpatients. The study sample consisted of 217 inpatients with schizophrenia. Age, duration of illness, duration of hospitalization, years of education, body mass index, neurocognitive function, drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, involuntary movements, psychiatric symptoms, and dose equivalents of antipsychotics and anticholinergic agents were used as index factors. Pearson linear correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between QOL and the above-mentioned factors. Negative symptoms, psychological discomfort, and resistance as rated on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were correlated with all subscale scores of the Japanese version of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (JSQLS). Stepwise regression showed that negative symptoms, psychological discomfort, and resistance predicted the dysfunction of psycho-social activity score and the dysfunction of motivation and energy score on the JSQLS. This study shows that active treatment for negative symptoms, psychological discomfort, and resistance should be recommended to improve QOL among inpatients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Ethical consequences of the diagnosis of psychosis].", "Abstract": "Psychosis is defined by the loss of reality testing. Apart from that, it is rather broadly and vaguely defined. Ethics is the art of defining what is right and what is wrong. Medical ethics apply a diversity of ethical principles to a complex clinical reality after discussion and consideration. In forensic psychiatry the diagnosis of psychosis has vast ethical implications. In the Danish law on psychiatry conditions for coercion and involuntary treatment are stated, and in the law on penalty the principle of treatment instead of penalty is stated. Thus, implications for diagnoses and treatment go far beyond other medical diagnoses."}, {"Title": "The cognitive genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Classification in psychiatry is heavily dependent on clinical symptoms and illness course. This ignores the critical role that cognitive problems play in neuropsychiatric disorders affecting different domains across the lifespan, from ADHD and autism to schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. At this point, it is unclear whether cognitive mechanisms are specific to disorders, whether multiple processes can contribute to the same disorder, or whether aberrant neural processing can result in many different phenotypic outcomes. Understanding this would allow us to better grasp normal as well as pathological brain function. This could inform diagnostics based on understanding of neurophysiological processes and the consequent development of new therapeutics. Genetics, and the development of genomic research, offers real opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms relevant to cognition. This chapter defines and describes the main cognitive phenotypes, which are investigated in psychiatric disorders. We review evidence for their heritability and early progress in the field using cytogenetic, linkage and candidate gene-based research methodologies. With high-throughput genomics it is now possible to explore novel common and rare risk variants for psychiatric disorders and their role in cognitive function at a genome-wide level. We review the results of early genomic studies and discuss the novel insights that they are starting to provide.

We also aimed to determine whether confidence in prescribing mood stabilizers is associated with residents' practice patterns. The residency training directors of 182 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited US psychiatric residencies were solicited for study participation via e-mail. Their chief residents were asked to forward an online survey Web link to all PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents in their program. The survey was a cross-sectional, online questionnaire, evaluating residents' treatment choices for their BD patients in their psychopharmacology clinics during the last academic year (July 1, 2009, to May 1, 2010), along with resident confidence level in using mood stabilizers. The survey Web link was distributed to 769 residents, and 177 (23.0%) responded to the survey. The percentage of residents who did not initiate treatment in the past year with mood stabilizers was 24.5% for lithium, 26.9% for lamotrigine, 36.7% for valproate, and 73.6% for carbamazepine. Confidence in initiating treatment with each of the 4 mood stabilizers was significantly associated with the number of patients treated with each mood stabilizer in the past year. Residents reported having the lowest confidence with carbamazepine followed by lamotrigine, lithium, and valproate. Experience prescribing first-line treatments for BD, such as lithium and valproate, is inadequate for many US psychiatric residents.

The analysis focuses basically on the relationship between pedophilia and the current DSM-IV-TR's definition of mental disorder. Scholars appear not to share numerous basic assumptions ranging from their underlying ideas about what constitutes a mental disorder to the role of psychiatry in modern society, including irreconcilable theories about human sexuality, which interfere with reaching any kind of a consensus as to what the psychiatric status of pedophilia should be. It is questioned if the diagnosis of pedophilia contained in the DSM is more forensic than therapeutic, focusing rather on the dangers inherent in the condition of pedophilia (dangerous dysfunction) than on its negative effects for the subject (harmful dysfunction). The apparent necessity of the diagnosis of pedophilia in the DSM is supported, but the basis for this diagnosis is uncertain."}, {"Title": "'Doing things together': male caregivers' experiences of giving care to patients in forensic psychiatric care.", "Abstract": "Studies into work carried out by male caregivers in a care environment in which male patients and male caregivers constitute a majority are lacking. The purpose of this study was to illuminate the experiences of male caregivers in providing care for patients in forensic psychiatric care. The study has a qualitative design and data were constituted by interviews with six male caregivers at a clinic of forensic psychiatry in a town in central Sweden. The method of analysis chosen was latent content analysis. The results consist of four themes: Activities as a component of care, Social training as the basis of care, Feelings of powerlessness and Seeing the complete person. The experience that comes out most distinctly in the descriptions given by caregivers involves performing activities together with the patients. The activities had different significances and these contribute to creating a more secure care relationship, in which the boundaries between personnel and patients become less clear. Physical activities contribute to recreating the patient's health. Social training appears as a component of the care in which the significance of rules and routines in the operations was integrated. Feelings of powerlessness arise when the caregivers do not experience that the care given on the ward contributes to recreating health for the patients. Seeing the complete person behind the crime constitutes the themes that can be said to summarize the meaning of the work carried out by male caregivers."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in the Deep South: a pilot study of integrated training for psychiatry residents and seminary students.", "Abstract": "The authors describe an interdisciplinary training experience developed for psychiatry residents and seminary students that assessed each group's beliefs and attitudes toward the other's profession.

Residents were most commonly threatened (N=175; 86%), physically intimidated (N=145; 71%) or received unwanted advances (N=118; 58%). One-quarter (N=51; 25%) were physically assaulted. Most of the incidents occurred in inpatient settings (N=92; 45%).\nThis study, like previous studies on this topic, calls attention to the high number of residents that are affected by violence during their training, and it underscores the need to protect the safety of psychiatry residents and to support those who have been victimized."}, {"Title": "Patient suicides in psychiatric residencies and post-vention responses: a national survey of psychiatry chief residents and program directors.", "Abstract": "This report focuses on post-vention measures taken by U.S. psychiatry residencies when a resident-in-training experiences a patient suicide.\nA survey distributed to program directors and chief residents obtained an estimate of the frequency of psychiatric residents' experiencing a patient suicide and the frequency of numerous post-vention activities utilized by psychiatric residencies in 2008. The survey looked at the presence or absence of a post-vention protocol within a program and determined whether there was an effect on the number of patient suicides and the frequency of post-vention activities within a program. The data were compared with the results of a similar survey from 1994 to determine whether there had been significant progress in the practice of supportive post-vention activities within training institutions.\nThere was a 21% response rate from chief residents (N=54) and a 31.1% response rate from program directors (N=94). Chief residents reported 1.44 suicides per residency, and program directors reported 0.88 suicides per residency for the 2008 calendar year. This corresponded to approximately 1 in 20 residents' experiencing a patient suicide in the 12-month period. Both groups reported approximately 1 in 5 psychiatry residency programs with written post-vention protocols, which was unchanged from the 1994 survey. When a protocol was in place, chief residents reported a statistically significant increase in timely notification of the program director, process groups, therapy or counseling, and emergency leave, whereas program directors reported a statistically significant decrease in post-vention therapy or counseling. Further statistical analysis revealed a tendency for programs with post-vention protocols to have more reported suicides.\nPost-vention protocols may be developed by residencies as a need to address residents experiencing a patient suicide. Discrepancies in the reports of chief residents and program directors in post-vention activities may reflect a lack of consensus on post-vention training and education within psychiatric residencies."}, {"Title": "Coping with a patient's suicide: a curriculum for psychiatry residency training programs.", "Abstract": "The suicide of a patient is often experienced as a traumatic event by the clinician involved. Many articles have identified the need for education to guide clinicians through the aftermath of patient suicide; however, little has been published on development of such a curriculum, particularly for residents. This article describes one residency training program's development of an organized curriculum on coping with patient suicide and evaluates the impact of a core aspect of the training on clinicians' knowledge about and confidence with coping with patient suicide.\nThe training includes a biennial half-day workshop for all trainees plus an \"as-needed curriculum\" used after a completed suicide. A total of 42 clinicians (39 psychiatry residents and 3 psychiatry faculty) participated in a workshop on coping with patient suicide. Their attitudes and knowledge about the topic were assessed before and after the training.\nParticipation in the workshop was associated with large and statistically significant increases in knowledge and self-perceptions of competence in coping with patient suicide.\nThe addition of a curriculum on coping with patient suicide has the potential to significantly enhance psychiatric residency training."}, {"Title": "A method for evaluating competency in assessment and management of suicide risk.", "Abstract": "Although health professionals increasingly are expected to be able to assess and manage patients' risk for suicide, few methods are available to evaluate this competency.

The CAI-S structures faculty ratings regarding interviewing and data collection, case formulation and presentation, treatment-planning, and documentation. To evaluate the CAI-S, 31 faculty members used it to rate the performance of 31 learners (26 psychiatric residents and 5 clinical psychology interns) who participated in an OSCE. After interviewing a standardized patient, learners presented their risk-assessment findings and treatment plans. Faculty used the CAI-S to structure feedback to the learners. In a subsidiary study of interrater reliability, six faculty members rated video-recorded suicide risk-assessments.\nThe CAI-S showed good internal consistency, reliability, and interrater reliability. Concurrent validity was supported by the finding that CAI-S ratings were higher for senior learners than junior learners, and were higher for learners with more clinical experience with suicidal patients than learners with less clinical experience.

There was substantial variability in policies, but little variability appeared to be field-specific. Psychiatric journals were more likely to request \"complete\" disclosure, and nonpsychiatric journals to request \"relevant\" disclosure, but medical journals tended to provide more detailed information about what could constitute a potential conflict and asked for broader, potentially relevant funding sources. Nonpsychiatric journals were more likely to give examples in their policies. Psychiatric journals were more likely to publish disclosures.\nThis preliminary study suggests that there are discrepancies in the disclosure and COI information that journals request from authors. By and large, such discrepancies are not substantially different between psychiatric and nonpsychiatric journals. Challenges in codifying COI policies and creating standardized approaches across periodicals and across disciplines may reflect ongoing debates about what exactly constitutes a COI, what needs to be disclosed, and who is responsible for disclosing.

We have carried out a qualitative study to evaluate how this model works out in practice, including its impact on quality of patient care, mental health professionals and primary care.\nWe interviewed doctors, multidisciplinary staff and Trusts managers (19 in total). Transcripts of recorded interviews were coded and analysed thematically using a grounded theory approach.\nOverall, despite teething problems, working in pathways was generally seen as a positive change. It led to more focused interventions being offered, and practitioners being held to account over clear standards of care. It is more cost-effective and allows for active case management and clear clinical leadership. It is recovery focused and encourages social inclusion. The arbitrary time frame, strict criteria and thresholds for different teams can create issues. Improved communication, flexible and patient-centred approach, staff supervision, and increasing support to primary care were felt to be central to this model working efficiently and effectively.\nIntroduction of care pathways is an important step towards effective implementation of PbR for mental health.

Antidepressant drugs can have multiple side effects, so a good choice of drug is important for successful treatment. This study compared the efficacy of nortriptyline with that of fluoxetine in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and assessed related factors, including age, gender, and level of education.\nThe study was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial with a six-month follow-up period. Participants were 120 patients aged 15-60 years with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on a psychiatry interview and the Beck depression rating scale, which were performed at the beginning, middle, and end of the study. The patients were treated with nortriptyline or fluoxetine. The paired t-test, independent t-test, and the k chi-square test were used to analyze the data.\nTwenty-three patients dropped out and 97 remained in the trial. Before intervention, the mean depression score was 32.85 \u00b1 6.23 in the nortriptyline group and 33.12 \u00b1 6.50 in the fluoxetine group. The results of the independent t-test showed a significant difference between depression score means before and after treatment in both groups. Changes at the end of the trial compared with baseline scores were 13.4 \u00b1 4.68 and 16.96 \u00b1 4.96 for nortriptyline and fluoxetine, respectively. Paired t-testing showed a significant difference in the mean depression score for both the nortriptyline and fluoxetine groups. Age, gender, and level of education had no significant effects on the outcome of treatment in the two groups.\nThe present study suggests that both nortriptyline and fluoxetine were effective in the treatment of depression, but that fluoxetine was more effective than nortriptyline after 3 and 6 months of treatment."}, {"Title": "[Pharmaceutical formulations and adherence to pharmacological treatment in psychiatry: the example of oral disintegrating tablet of olanzapine].", "Abstract": "Adherence to treatment in psychiatric as in other chronic or recurrent conditions, is often suboptimal. A high proportion of relapses is due to non-adherence to prescribed treatment. Adherence to treatment is a potent predictor of effectiveness, both in clinical trials and cohort studies, therefore is a very relevant area where any improving tool is looked forward. Orally Disintegrating Tablets (ODT) were developed with the aim to improve patient's compliance due to their fast oral absorption. They are particularly useful in psychiatric patients who often simulate drug assumption or experience difficulties in taking pills. ODT formulations have been developed for many antypsychotics including olanzapine. The ODT formulations of olanzapine show to be significantly different one from the other in the dissolution time, thus having a potential impact on compliance. In this review, the results of different studies consistently highlight the positive risk/benefit profile, the contribution to patient's compliance and their preference while using ODT formulation of olanzapine produced throughout the ZYDIS technology (Velotab). Moreover, the differences between olanzapine ODT (Velotab) and the standard formulation of olanzapine and other antipsychotics are described focusing on in efficacy, safety, patient acceptance and health economic impact. The ODT formulation of olanzapine (Velotab) seems to ameliorate patient's adherence thus improving psychiatrist/caregiver/patient alliance."}, {"Title": "['Vascular depression': a valid diagnosis?].", "Abstract": "The diagnosis 'vascular depression' was reintroduced to old-age psychiatry about 10 years ago. The introduction of advanced imaging techniques has made it possible to link mood symptoms to vascular brain damage. In patients suffering from depression in which cerebrovascular damage plays an important role, different forms of diagnostics and treatment may be necessary. The symptom profiles of various depressive disorders do not differ widely, which makes it difficult to diagnose 'vascular depression' in daily practice. Thus, it does not meet the criteria of a distinct disease entity. However, the prognosis of patients with vascular depression is different and these patients respond less well to the usual therapy.

Early stressful life events and alterations of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function seem to have a significant role in the onset of anxiety. Existing data appear to support the mediating effect of the HPA axis between childhood traumata and posttraumatic stress disorder. Findings on the HPA axis activity at baseline and after stimuli in panic disordered patients are inconclusive, even if stressful life events may have a triggering function in the development of this disorder. Data on the relationship between stress, HPA axis functioning and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are scarce and discordant, but an increased activity of the HPA axis is reported in OCD patients. Moreover, normal basal cortisol levels and hyper-responsiveness of the adrenal cortex during a psychosocial stressor are observed in social phobics. Finally, abnormal HPA axis activity has also been observed in generalized anxiety disordered patients. While several hypothesis have attempted to explain these findings over time, currently the most widely accepted theory is that early stressful life events may provoke alterations of the stress response and thus of the HPA axis, that can endure during adulthood, predisposing individuals to develop psychopathology. All theories are reviewed and the authors conclude that childhood life events and HPA abnormalities may be specifically and transnosographically related to all anxiety disorders, as well as, more broadly, to all psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Selectively bred rodents as models of depression and anxiety.", "Abstract": "Stress related diseases such as depression and anxiety have a high degree of co morbidity, and represent one of the greatest therapeutic challenges for the twenty-first century.

Selectively bred rodents also provide an excellent tool in order to study gene and environment interactions. Although it is generally accepted that genes and environmental factors determine the etiology of mental disorders, precise information is limited: How rigid is the genetic disposition?

Of particular interest is how pharmaceuticals come to constitute in multiple ways what pathology is and what form of life needs to be restored, and how psychiatric medications reconfigure the ambivalence of intimacy in post-socialist China. Following the life of Mei, a female psychiatric patient, for two years, I have made a series of discoveries related to medicine and intimacy in China. Specifically, I show that psychopharmaceuticals indicate a diseased body that threatens the intimate bond. They also highlight a socially suffering subject that is in lack of love from the intimate partner who demands the latter's redemption. I discuss how these multiple and contradicting meanings of psychopharmaceuticals and intimacy are socio-historically situated. Thus, while previous research in medical anthropology criticizes pharmaceuticalization for reducing the socio-political life (bios) to a biological body (zo\u0113), I argue that these life forms co-exist in a pharmaceutical \"zone of indistinction\" (Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life.

The cohort consisted of 286 FEP individuals. Measures included assessments of positive and negative symptoms, depression, substance use, premorbid and current functioning, cognition and duration of untreated psychosis. Disengagement from treatment was defined as leaving the program before the 30 months.\nAt 30 months after treatment, the estimated rate of disengagement from treatment was 31%. Predictors of disengagement were examined via Cox proportional hazards models which revealed that lower ratings on negative symptom scores at baseline (HR=0.946; CI=0.909-0.985), a shorter duration of untreated psychosis (HR=0.997; CI=0.994-0.999), and not having a family member involved in the program (HR=0.310; CI=0.196-0.490) contributed significantly to predicting disengagement from treatment.

These experts asserted that a child's decision to rely on his or her left hand was a reflection of a defiant personality that could best be corrected by forcible switching. The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness. By the late-1940s, the connection between stuttering and retraining evaporated, due in large part to the growing dominance of psychoanalytic psychiatry. Despite robust statistical and clinical evidence, the connection between forced hand switching and stuttering has largely been forgotten.

A sample of 49 schizophrenic patients was compared with three control groups consisting of healthy reference subjects (n=49), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients (n=29), Asperger syndrome (AS) patients (n=13) and drug-induced psychotic patients (n=14). Schizophrenic patients showed significant abnormal laterality of brainstem activity in wave II of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in comparison with all other study groups. Forward masking effects in the superior olive complex were coded significantly differently by schizophrenic patients compared to control groups except for the AS group.

A neglected component of this model pertains to people in the advanced stages of a mental illness, who remain symptomatic and functionally impaired despite treatment. These patients are often high service utilizers, receiving complex multimodal treatments where the balance of risk and benefit shifts perceptibly. In this paper, we argue the need to adopt 'palliative' models of care for some individuals, and consider changing the therapeutic goals to follow care pathways similar to those used in other chronic and refractory medical illnesses.\nData was sourced by a literature search using Medline and a hand search of scientific journals. Relevant articles were selected.\nClinical staging can help us better define subgroups of patients who will benefit from different goals and treatment. In the most advanced stage group, we find patients with persistent symptoms and treatment resistance. In these situations, it may be preferable to follow some of the principles of palliative care, which include the setting of attainable goals, reduction of side-effects, limited symptom control, targeting identified psychological and social problems, and attempting to attain the best quality of life for these patients and their families.\nIt is in the interest of those in the advanced phases of a disorder that clinicians acknowledge the limitations of treatment and actively attempt to plan treatment utilizing alternate models. It is essential to be clear that such approaches do not equate to the abandonment of care, but rather to the reconceptualizing of feasible and personalized treatment goals, a rebalancing of the risks and benefits of intervention, the management of illness behaviour, and the approaches that allow the patient to live gainfully within their limitations."}, {"Title": "Brain anatomy and its relationship to behavior in adults with autism spectrum disorder: a multicenter magnetic resonance imaging study.", "Abstract": "There is consensus that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by differences in neuroanatomy.

Because NIRS can detect only cerebral cortex reactivities with low spatial resolution and may suffer from contaminating signals from the skin and skull, its data should be interpreted as a global index of cerebral cortex reactivities. Within these limitations, the advantages of NIRS over fMRI such as complete non-invasiveness, small measurement apparatus, high time resolution, and natural examination setting, makes it the preferred method in studies of brain substrates of subjective feelings of sleepiness and fatigue, personality, conversation, and psychiatric disorders. Two-thirds of the original articles on NIRS applications in psychiatry have been published by Japanese researchers. NIRS examination of psychiatric disorders using a verbal fluency task of only 3 minutes demonstrated their characteristics of frontal lobe function: depression was characterized by smaller activation, bipolar depression by comparable but delayed activation, and schizophrenia by reduced activation followed by re-activation during the post-task period. These characteristics can also be identified in individual NIRS data using 2 automatically calculated parameters. Based on these results, NIRS application in psychiatry has been approved as one of the Advanced Medical Technologies in 2009 as an aid for differential diagnosis of depressive symptoms.

Biological as well as psychosocial knowledge is required to elucidate the mechanism underlying dementia. Although the molecular mechanism underlying the pathological features of AD has not yet been fully elucidated, it can be placed under the concept of the AD-FTLD spectrum, in which loss of function of an important gene may result in accumulation of insoluble proteins inside and outside neurons.

However, its problems have become increasingly apparent, particularly for clinical practice. An alternative approach, designed to maximize clinical utility, is prototype matching. Instead of counting symptoms of a disorder and determining whether they cross an arbitrary cutoff, the task of the diagnostician is to gauge the extent to which a patient's clinical presentation matches a paragraph-length description of the disorder using a simple 5-point scale, from 1 (\"little or no match\") to 5 (\"very good match\"). The result is both a dimensional diagnosis that captures the extent to which the patient \"has\" the disorder and a categorical diagnosis, with ratings of 4 and 5 corresponding to presence of the disorder and a rating of 3 indicating \"subthreshold\" or \"clinically significant features\". The disorders and criteria woven into the prototypes can be identified empirically, so that the prototypes are both scientifically grounded and clinically useful. Prototype diagnosis has a number of advantages: it better captures the way humans naturally classify novel and complex stimuli; is clinically helpful, reliable, and easy to use in everyday practice; facilitates both dimensional and categorical diagnosis and dramatically reduces the number of categories required for classification; allows for clinically richer, empirically derived, and culturally relevant classification; reduces the gap between research criteria and clinical knowledge, by allowing clinicians in training to learn a small set of standardized prototypes and to develop richer mental representations of the disorders over time through clinical experience; and can help resolve the thorny issue of the relation between psychiatric diagnosis and functional impairment."}, {"Title": "Baclofen overdose mimicking brain death.", "Abstract": "Brain death guidelines should be used with caution in patients with drug intoxication.

Baclofen was found to be the responsible overdose. The patient had absent brain stem reflexes and was intubated and in the ICU for several days.

Kleppur Hospital for the mentally insane was built in 1907; hence the development was approximately 150 years later than in comparable countries. Only two doctors contributed significantly to policy making in Icelandic psychiatry until 1959 and they were very different personalities. Dr Th\u00f3rdur Sveinsson was famous for his interest in hydrotherapy and Dr Helgi T\u00f3masson for his prohibition of all physical restraints like straitjackets, restraining straps and belts. He was also known for his decision to prohibit his patients undergoing ECT and lobotomy; hence such methods were never practiced at Kleppur Hospital. In other respects, it may be said that the history of Icelandic psychiatry is similar to that in the other Nordic countries."}, {"Title": "Norwegian psychiatry and the trial of Vidkun Quisling.", "Abstract": "After the Nazi occupation, there was a determination to deal with collaborators, coming to the fore with the trial of the traitor Vidkun Quisling. This became as much a contest between psychiatrists as a legal tussle. Norwegian psychiatrists supported the public opinion that collaborationists were mentally ill or intellectually handicapped, and this was evident in the reports they prepared.\nNorwegian psychiatry, their distinguished stand during the war notwithstanding, was caught up in the emotion and controversy of the Quisling trial and the treatment of collaborators. Later, there was tacit agreement that their stand had been less than objective, sharing the public repulsion towards collaborators and influenced by still-prevailing eugenic views."}, {"Title": "Weight stigma, addiction, science, and the medication of fatness in mid-twentieth century America.", "Abstract": "Obesity and overweight are today recognised as subject to harmful stigma. Through an analysis of discussions of obesity in major American newspapers, the medical literature, and pharmaceutical advertising in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, I document a significant shift in medical thinking about overweight and obesity based in psychiatry, and explore the relationship of that shift to changes in popular understandings of fatness after the Second World War. I argue that the psychiatrically-oriented postwar medical thinking about obesity was more stigmatising as compared with the endocrinologically-oriented thinking of the interwar period, in that the newer biomedical theory linked fatness to the already stigmatised condition of addiction and authorised attribution of moral blame to the fat. I further argue that the pharmaceutical industry cannot be assigned the lead role in medicalisation in this period that some authors attributed to it. These events cast doubt on the received view of fatness as subject to decreasing stigma and increasing medicalisation over the course of the twentieth century, and call for exploration of the social factors influencing specific forms of medicalisation."}, {"Title": "Managerial reforms and specialised psychiatric care: a study of resistive practices performed by mental health practitioners.", "Abstract": "Throughout Western Europe, psychiatric care has been subjected to 'modernisation' by the implementation of various managerial reforms in order to achieve improved mental health services. This paper examines how practitioners resist specific managerial reforms introduced in Finnish outpatient clinics and a child psychiatry clinic. The empirical study involves documentary research and semi-structured interviews with doctors, psychologists, nurses and social workers. The analysis draws on notions of Foucault's conception of resistance as subtle strategies. Three forms of professional resistance are outlined: dismissive responses to clinical guidelines; a critical stance towards new managerial models; and improvised use of newly introduced information and communications technologies (ICTs). Resistance manifests itself as moderate modifications of practice, since more explicit opposition would challenge the managerial rhetoric of psychiatric care which is promoted in terms of positive connotations of client-centredness, users' rights, and the quality of the care. Therefore, instead of strongly challenging managerial reforms, practitioners keep them 'alive' and ongoing by continuously improvising, criticising and dismissing reforms' non-functional features. In conclusion it is suggested that managerial reforms in psychiatric care can only be implemented successfully if frontline practitioners themselves modify and translate them into clinical practice. The reconciliation between this task and practitioners' therapeutic orientation is proposed for further study."}, {"Title": "Automated classification of fMRI during cognitive control identifies more severely disorganized subjects with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The establishment of a neurobiologically based nosological system is one of the ultimate goals of modern biological psychiatry research. Developments in neuroimaging and statistical/machine learning have provided useful basic tools for these efforts. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of fMRI as input data for the classification of schizophrenia, but none, to date, has used fMRI of cognitive control for this purpose. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of an unbiased classification method on fMRI data from a large cohort of subjects with first episode schizophrenia and a cohort of age matched healthy control subjects while they completed the AX version of the Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT). We compared these results to classifications based on AX-CPT behavioral data. Classification accuracy for DSM-IV defined schizophrenia using fMRI data was modest and comparable to classifications conducted with behavioral data. Interestingly fMRI classifications did however identify a distinct subgroup of patients with greater behavioral disorganization, whereas behavioral data classifications did not. These results suggest that fMRI-based classification could be a useful tool in defining a neurobiologically distinct subgroup within the clinically defined syndrome of schizophrenia, reflecting alterations in discrete neural circuits. Independent validation of classification-based phenotypes using other biological data such as genetics would provide a strong test of this hypothesis."}, {"Title": "National survey of geriatric psychiatry fellowship programs: comparing findings in 2006/07 and 2001/02 from the American Geriatrics Society and Association of Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs' Geriatrics Workforce Policy Studies Center.", "Abstract": ": To document the development of geriatric psychiatry (GP) fellowship training in the United States through 2008.\n: A cross-sectional survey of the 56 U.S. GP fellowship programs was conducted in summer 2007.

Because clinical phenotypes for psychiatric disorders are often ill defined, considerable effort has been made to relate genetic polymorphisms to underlying physiological aspects of schizophrenia (so called intermediate phenotypes), that may be more reliable. Given the polygenic etiology of schizophrenia, the aim of this work was to form a measure of cumulative genetic risk and study its effect on neural activity during working memory (WM) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neural activity during the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm was measured in 79 schizophrenia patients and 99 healthy controls. Participants were genotyped, and a genetic risk score (GRS), which combined the additive effects of 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 34 risk genes for schizophrenia, was calculated. These risk SNPs were chosen according to the continuously updated meta-analysis of genetic studies on schizophrenia available at www.schizophreniaresearchforum.org. We found a positive relationship between GRS and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inefficiency during WM processing. GRS was not correlated with age, performance, intelligence, or medication effects and did not differ between acquisition sites, gender, or diagnostic groups. Our study suggests that cumulative genetic risk, combining the impact of many genes with small effects, is associated with a known brain-based intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. The GRS approach could provide an advantage over studying single genes in studies focusing on the genetic basis of polygenic conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Medical diagnosis of legal culpability: the impact of early psychiatric testimony in the 19th century English criminal trial.", "Abstract": "Fast-paced developments in psychiatry, neuroscience and emerging neuroimaging technologies place continual pressure on the legal recognition of mental illness and disease across jurisdictional boundaries. Nevertheless, the Canadian legal definition of exculpatory mental disease in the context of criminal liability has remained largely static, sheltered from the immediate influence of medical theory and advancements. In order to effectively reflect on the intersection of mental health and criminal justice systems in this area, it is important to understand its historical development and the English common law origins of the current approach. Specifically turning to the early 19th century, documented history and accounts of early medical witness testimony on the mental state of the accused provide a unique opportunity to understand the initial collision between fundamental concepts of moral and legal culpability and new scientific understandings of mental function and disease. In this article, I suggest that early psychiatric testimony to the accused's mental state challenged the evolving criminal law of 19th century England to reconcile its restrictive definition of \"insanity\" with expanding scientific reasoning and accounts of mental disease. The trial of Edward Oxford, an attempted royal assassination case of 1840, is examined as a symbolic height in this conflict prior to the first common law pronouncement of the current approach in 1843. As debate continues on the role of medical advancement in the identification of exculpatory medical disorders in law, this historical perspective may serve as a touchstone in balancing the enforcement of legal culpability with our society's greater appreciation for mental illness."}, {"Title": "Delusional infestation: clinical presentation in 147 patients seen at Mayo Clinic.", "Abstract": "Delusional infestation is the conviction that one's skin is infested with foreign organisms or materials despite contradictory objective evidence.\nTo delineate clinical characteristics of patients presenting with delusional infestation.\nWe performed a retrospective study of patients meeting delusional infestation criteria who were seen for diagnosis and treatment in our tertiary care academic medical center (2001-2007).

The federally funded WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (WTCMMTP) provides medical monitoring and occupational medicine treatment as well as counseling regarding entitlements and benefits to the workers and volunteers who participated in the WTC response. A major component of the WTCMMTP is the WTC Mental Health Program (WTCMHP), which offers annual mental health assessments and ongoing treatment for those found to have 9/11 associated mental health problems.

To illustrate the types of issues that arise in treating this diverse patient population, the authors first present a representative case involving a Polish asbestos worker with an alcohol use disorder. They then discuss how accepted alcohol treatment modalities can and often must be modified in providing psychiatric treatment to Polish responders, in particular, and to foreign-born patients in general.

Achieving safe and effective prescribing practices in mental health care requires an understanding of the elements that contribute to a patient's successful discharge from an inpatient unit.

The purpose of these models is to augment the current diagnostic categories that utilize a \"snapshot\" approach to describing mental states. We hope to convey to researchers and clinicians that non-linear dynamics can provide an additional useful longitudinal framework to understand mental illness. Psychiatric phenomena are complex processes that evolve in time, similar to many other processes in nature that have been successfully described and understood within deterministic chaos and non-linear dynamic computational models. Dynamical models describe mental processes and phenomena that change over time, more like a movie than a photograph, with multiple variables interacting over time. The use of these models may help us understand why and how current diagnostic categories are insufficient. They may also provide a new, more descriptive and ultimately more predictive approach leading to better understanding of the interrelationship between psychological, neurobiological, and genetic underpinnings of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based psychotherapies for preschool children with psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The field of child and adolescent psychiatry is increasingly aware of the existence of psychiatric disorders in preschool-aged children.

Most patients undergoing a procedure report these results post-operatively. The success of any procedure is measured in patient satisfaction. In order to optimize patient satisfaction, literature suggests careful pre-operative patient preparation including a discussion of the risks, benefits, limitations and expected results for each procedure undertaken. As a general rule, the patients that are motivated to surgery by a desire to align their outward appearance to their body-image tend to be the most satisfied. There are some psychiatric conditions that can prevent a patient from being satisfied without regard aesthetic success. The most common examples are minimal defect/Body Dysmorphic Disorder, the patient in crisis, the multiple revision patient, and loss of identity. This paper will familiarize the audience with these conditions, symptoms and related illnesses. Case examples are described and then explored in terms of the conditions presented. A discussion of the patient's motivation for surgery, goals pertaining to specific attributes, as well as an evaluation of the patient's understanding of the risks, benefits, and limitations of the procedure can help the physician determine if a patient is capable of being satisfied with a cosmetic plastic surgery procedure. Plastic surgeons can screen patients suffering from these conditions relatively easily, as psychiatry is an integral part of medical school education. If a psychiatric referral is required, then the psychiatrist needs to be aware of the nuances of each of these conditions."}, {"Title": "Figures and institutions of the neurological sciences in Paris from 1800 to 1950.

This review concentrates on the prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of depression, anxiety, apathy and psychosis. The pathophysiology of these disorders is complex, reflecting the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology in PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. The diagnosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular affective disorders, is challenging because of the overlap of somatic features of psychiatric disorders and underlying movement disorder. The pathogenesis is likely to differ considerably from non-PD patients, and treatments used in general psychiatry services may not be as effective in PD and will require clearer clarification in well-designed clinical studies. Management strategies include adjustment of dopaminergic medication, use of psychotropic treatments and behavioural and psychological approaches. However, the future challenge will be to develop treatments developed specifically for the pathogenesis of these disorders in PD."}, {"Title": "Recognition rights, mental health consumers and reconstructive cultural semantics.", "Abstract": "Those in mental health-related consumer movements have made clear their demands for humane treatment and basic civil rights, an end to stigma and discrimination, and a chance to participate in their own recovery. But theorizing about the politics of recognition, 'recognition rights' and epistemic justice, suggests that they also have a stake in the broad cultural meanings associated with conceptions of mental health and illness.\nFirst person accounts of psychiatric diagnosis and mental health care (shown here to represent 'counter stories' to the powerful 'master narrative' of biomedical psychiatry), offer indications about how experiences of mental disorder might be reframed and redefined as part of efforts to acknowledge and honor recognition rights and epistemic justice. However, the task of cultural semantics is one for the entire culture, not merely consumers. These new meanings must be negotiated. When they are not the result of negotiation, group-wrought definitions risk imposing a revision no less constraining than the mis-recognizing one it aims to replace. Contested realities make this a challenging task when it comes to cultural meanings about mental disorder. Examples from mental illness memoirs about two contested realities related to psychosis are examined here: the meaninglessness of symptoms, and the role of insight into illness. They show the magnitude of the challenge involved--for consumers, practitioners, and the general public--in the reconstruction of these new meanings and realities.\nTo honor recognition rights and epistemic justice acknowledgement must be made of the heterogeneity of the effects of, and of responses to, psychiatric diagnosis and care, and the extent of the challenge of the reconstructive cultural semantics involved."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacological enhancement: a conceptual framework.", "Abstract": "The availability of a range of new psychotropic agents raises the possibility that these will be used for enhancement purposes (smart pills, happy pills, and pep pills). The enhancement debate soon raises questions in philosophy of medicine and psychiatry (eg, what is a disorder?), and this debate in turn raises fundament questions in philosophy of language, science, and ethics. In this paper, a naturalistic conceptual framework is proposed for addressing these issues. This framework begins by contrasting classical and critical concepts of categories, and then puts forward an integrative position that is based on cognitive-affective research. This position can in turn be used to consider the debate between pharmacological Calvinism (which may adopt a moral metaphor of disorder) and psychotropic utopianism (which may emphasize a medical metaphor of disorder). I argue that psychiatric treatment of serious psychiatric disorders is justified, and that psychotropics are an acceptable kind of intervention. The use of psychotropics for sub-threshold phenomena requires a judicious weighing of the relevant facts (which are often sparse) and values."}, {"Title": "A brief historicity of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: issues and implications for the future of psychiatric canon and practice.", "Abstract": "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association, currently in its fourth edition and considered the reference for the characterization and diagnosis of mental disorders, has undergone various developments since its inception in the mid-twentieth century. With the fifth edition of the DSM presently in field trials for release in 2013, there is renewed discussion and debate over the extent of its relative successes - and shortcomings - at iteratively incorporating scientific evidence on the often ambiguous nature and etiology of mental illness. Given the power that the DSM has exerted both within psychiatry and society at large, this essay seeks to analyze variations in content and context of various editions of the DSM, address contributory influences and repercussion of such variations on the evolving landscape of psychiatry as discipline and practice over the past sixty years. Specifically, we document major modifications in the definition, characterization, and classification of mental disorders throughout successive editions of the DSM, in light of shifting trends in the conceptualization of psychopathology within evolving schools of thought in psychiatry, and in the context of progress in behavioral and psychopharmacological therapeutics over time. We touch upon the social, political, and financial environments in which these changes took places, address the significance of these changes with respect to the legitimacy (and legitimization) of what constitutes mental illness and health, and examine the impact and implications of these changes on psychiatric practice, research, and teaching. We argue that problematic issues in psychiatry, arguably reflecting the large-scale adoption of the DSM, may be linked to difficulties in formulating a standardized nosology of psychopathology. In this light, we highlight 1) issues relating to attempts to align the DSM with the medical model, with regard to increasing specificity in the characterization of discrete mental disease entities and the incorporation of neurogenetic, neurochemical and neuroimaging data in its nosological framework; 2) controversies surrounding the medicalization of cognition, emotion, and behavior, and the interpretation of subjective variables as 'normal' or 'abnormal' in the context of society and culture; and 3) what constitutes treatment, enablement, or enhancement - and what metrics, guidelines, and policies may need to be established to clarify such criteria."}, {"Title": "Working towards a new psychiatry - neuroscience, technology and the DSM-5.", "Abstract": "This Editorial introduces the thematic series on 'Toward a New Psychiatry: Philosophical and Ethical Issues in Classification, Diagnosis and Care' http://www.biomedcentral.com/series/newpsychiatry."}, {"Title": "The challenges and promise of neuroimaging in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging is central to the quest for a biological foundation of psychiatric diagnosis but so far has not yielded clinically relevant biomarkers for mental disorders.

However, relatively little is known about their role in other cognitive or emotional functions. We measured both D1 and D2 receptors in the brain using positron emission tomography in healthy subjects, with the aim of elucidating how regional D1 and D2 receptors are differentially involved in cognitive and emotional functions beyond working memory. We found an inverted U-shaped relation between prefrontal D1 receptor availability and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance, indicating that too little or too much D1 receptor stimulation impairs working memory or set shifting. In addition, variability of D1 receptor availability in the amygdala and striatum was related to individual differences in emotional responses and decision-making processes, respectively. These observations suggest that the variability of available D1 receptors might be associated with individual differences in brain functions that require phasic dopamine release.

Successful analgesia demands a comprehensive appreciation for the etiologies of pain, vigilant clinical assessment, and personalized treatments. For the critically ill, frequent threats to mental and bodily integrity magnify the experience of pain, challenging clinicians to respond swiftly and thoughtfully. Because pain is difficult to predict and physiologic correlates are not specific, self-report remains the gold standard assessment. When communication is limited by intubation or cognitive deficits, behavioral pain scales prove useful. Patient-tailored analgesia aspires to mitigate suffering while optimizing alertness and cognitive capacity. Mindfulness of the neuropsychiatric features of pain helps the ICU clinician to clarify limits of traditional analgesia and identify alternative approaches to care. Armed with empirical data and clinical practice recommendations to better conceptualize, identify, and treat pain and its neuropsychiatric comorbidities, the authors (psychiatric consultants, by trade) reinforce holistic approaches to pain management in the ICU.

Besides hypothesis generation in earlier phases of the research, qualitative methods can be employed in questionnaire design, diagnostic criteria establishment, feasibility studies, as well as studies of attitude and beliefs. Animal models are another area that qualitative methods can be employed, especially when naturalistic observation of animal behavior is important. However, since qualitative results can be researcher's own view, they need to be statistically confirmed, quantitative methods. The tendency to combine both qualitative and quantitative methods as complementary methods has emerged over recent years. By applying both methods of research, scientists can take advantage of interpretative characteristics of qualitative methods as well as experimental dimensions of quantitative methods."}, {"Title": "The birth of convulsive therapy revisited: a reappraisal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Meduna's first cohort of patients.", "Abstract": "The introduction of convulsive therapy (COT) was undoubtedly one of the milestones in the history of psychiatry. Its originator, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Meduna, has become one of the founding fathers of biological psychiatry.\nIn his first major publication on COT, Meduna described the short-term treatment outcome of the first 26 schizophrenia patients who underwent camphor- or cardiazol-induced COT; 10 improved significantly, 3 appeared slightly improved, and 13 were unimproved. The original medical notes of 23 of the 26 patients were recently recovered and the patients re-diagnosed by the authors employing ICD-10 criteria.\nThe diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed in 15 cases (all but two of them involving prominent catatonic symptomatology), while 2 cases met diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorder, 3 for Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD) with psychotic features, 1 for psychotic depression, and 1 for Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder (ATPD). In a final case, the most probable diagnosis was schizophrenia. Scrutiny of the notes revealed that 4 schizophrenia patients evidenced slight improvement on COT and in one case the improvement was only transient. A limitation of this study is that the quality of the original files varied considerably and the re-evaluation was done retrospectively.\nA very broad concept of schizophrenia in the 1930s explains the discrepancy between the original and the revised results. In line with the current views on the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy, catatonic symptoms, but not the core schizophrenic process, showed some improvement while all ATPD, BAD and depressed patients responded to COT."}, {"Title": "Integrative Mental Health (IMH): paradigm, research, and clinical practice.", "Abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the rapidly evolving paradigm of \"Integrative Mental Health (IMH).\" The paradigm of contemporary biomedical psychiatry and its contrast to non-allopathic systems of medicine is initially reviewed, followed by an exploration of the emerging paradigm of IMH, which aims to reconcile the bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model with evidence-based methods from traditional healing practices. IMH is rapidly transforming conventional understandings of mental illness and has significant positive implications for the day-to-day practice of mental health care. IMH incorporates mainstream interventions such as pharmacologic treatments, psychotherapy, and psychosocial interventions, as well as alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal and nutritional medicine, dietary modification, meditation, etc. Two recent international conferences in Europe and the United States show that interest in integrative mental health care is growing rapidly. In response, the International Network of Integrative Mental Health (INIMH: www.INIMH.org) was established in 2010 with the objective of creating an international network of clinicians, researchers, and public health advocates to advance a global agenda for research, education, and clinical practice of evidence-based integrative mental health care.

Since then, PBD diagnoses, predominantly in the United States, have increased dramatically, and the diagnosis has attracted significant controversy. During the same period, psychiatric theory and practice has become increasingly biological. The aim of this paper is to examine the rise of PBD in terms of wider systemic influences.\nIn the context of literature referring to paradigm shifts in psychiatry, we reviewed the psychiatric literature, media cases, and information made available by investigative committees and journalists.\nSocial historians and prominent psychiatrists describe a paradigm shift in psychiatry over recent decades: from an era of \"brainless psychiatry,\" when an emphasis on psychodynamic and family factors predominated to the exclusion of biological factors, to a current era of \"mindless psychiatry\" that emphasizes neurobiological explanations for emotional and behavioral problems with limited regard for contextual meaning. Associated with this has been a tendency within psychiatry and society to neglect trauma and attachment insecurity as etiological factors; the \"atheoretical\" (but by default biomedical) premise of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd and 4th eds.); the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in research, continuing medical education, and direct-to-consumer advertising; and inequality in the U.S. health system that favors \"diagnostic upcoding.\" Harm from overmedicating children is now a cause of public concern.\nIt can be argued that PBD as a widespread diagnosis, particularly in the United States, reflects multiple factors associated with a paradigm shift within psychiatry rather than recognition of a previously overlooked common disorder."}, {"Title": "Traumatic experiences in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder.", "Abstract": "Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are excessively concerned about perceived defects in their appearance (e.g., blemishes on their skin).

Recently, investigators have begun to explore variables that might function as risk factors in the development of BDD, such as traumatic experiences (e.g., Child Abuse Negl 2006;30:1105-1115). As such, one of the goals of the current study was to examine the role of early-life sexual, physical, or emotional abuse in BDD. Specifically, the Traumatic Stress Institute Life Event Questionnaire (Treat Abuse Today 1992;2:9-11) was used to examine whether individuals with BDD (n = 18) self-reported having experienced more traumatic events than mentally healthy controls (n = 19). The BDD group reported more retrospective experiences of sexual and physical abuse in childhood or adolescence than did healthy controls. Surprisingly, there was no significant group difference in reports of emotional abuse in early life.

In parallel, the evolution of the science of decision-making has revealed human beings' universal tendency to make biased judgments and systematic errors in their evaluation of information and choices. As a result of numerous psychological biases, randomized clinical trials are more prone to error, misinterpretation, and faulty judgment than is often acknowledged. Interdisciplinary fields of experimental psychology, economics, and social science are drawn upon to examine psychological biases in the interpretation of clinical evidence. A number of these are postulated to be important, both for the investigators generating clinical evidence and for the clinical observers interpreting clinical trials.

Yet aggression is a normal component of the innate behavior repertoire of most vertebrate animal species as well as of many invertebrates. Progress in understanding the etiology of disorders of aggressive behavior, whether genetic or environmental in nature, therefore requires an understanding of the brain circuitry that controls normal aggression. Efforts to understand this circuitry at the level of specific neuronal populations have been constrained by the limited resolution of classical methodologies, such as electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesion. The availability of new, genetically based tools for mapping and manipulating neural circuits at the level of specific, genetically defined neuronal subtypes provides an opportunity to investigate the functional organization of aggression circuitry with cellular resolution. However, these technologies are optimally applied in the mouse, where there has been surprisingly little traditional work on the functional neuroanatomy of aggression. Here we discuss recent, initial efforts to apply optogenetics and other state-of-the-art methods to the dissection of aggression circuitry in the mouse. We find, surprisingly, that neurons necessary and sufficient for inter-male aggression are located within the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, a structure traditionally associated with reproductive behavior. These neurons are intermingled with neurons activated during male-female mating, with approximately 20% overlap between the populations. We discuss the significance of these findings with respect to neuroethological and neuroanatomical perspectives on the functional organization of innate behaviors and their potential implications for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Analysis of the anatomy of the Papez circuit and adjoining limbic system by fiber dissection techniques.", "Abstract": "Fiber dissection techniques were used to study the limbic system, in particular the Papez circuit. The course, length and anatomical relations of the structures that make up the Papez circuit were delineated. Ten previously frozen and formalin-fixed cadaveric human brains were used, and dissected according to the fiber dissection techniques of Klingler et al. (Schweiz Arch Neurol Psychiatry 1935;36:247-56). The primary dissection tools were thin and curved wooden and metallic spatulas with tips of varying sizes. We found that the Papez circuit (mean length: 350 mm) begins in the hippocampus and continues into the fornix to reach the mamillary body. From there, the mamillothalamic tract continues to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn connects to the cingulum by means of anterior thalamic radiations (mean length: 30 mm). The cingulum courses around the corpus callosum to end in the entorhinal cortex, which then projects to the hippocampus, thus completing the circuit. The average length and breadth of the mamillothalamic tract was 18 mm and 1.73 mm respectively. The average length of the cingulum was 19.6 cm and that of the fornix was 71 mm. The entire circuit was anatomically dissected first in situ in the hemisphere and was then reconstructed outside after removing its various components using fine fiber dissection under a surgical microscope. We found that fiber dissection elegantly delineates the anatomical subtleties of the Papez circuit and provides a three-dimensional perspective of the limbic system.

I believe that this movement presents not only the greatest challenge to psychiatry, but also the greatest opportunity. As it becomes more organised and influential this movement is starting to play a major role in shaping the sort of questions that are being asked about mental health services and their priorities. Yet there is limited reflection in our profession about how we, as doctors, might engage positively with it. It seems that while we are comfortable working with individuals and organisations who accept the medical framing of mental problems, we are less willing to contemplate working with critical service users. These are people who reject the medical model because they feel harmed by a system that describes their problems using the language of psychopathology. If we are serious about having an inclusive debate on mental health we will have to overcome this impasse. We need to entertain the idea that people who reject the medical framing of their problems are nevertheless legitimate stakeholders. It is time that we learned how to talk to them and to listen to their ideas. The user movement, with its substantial critical component, is not going to go away. One of the most important elements of the relationship between psychiatric services and the people who use them is the reality of psychiatric power. Many critical service users accept that legally sanctioned interventions may be necessary when individuals lose capacity to care for themselves and perhaps put themselves or others at risk.

The idea of 'threshold concepts' is currently widely discussed by educationalists. Threshold concepts are described as areas of knowledge without which the learner cannot progress, and which, when grasped, lead to a transformation in the learner's perspective and understanding. Threshold concepts have been criticised on conceptual grounds, and there is a lack of clarity as to how to identify them empirically. While they may represent a fruitful approach to the task of engaging medical students in psychiatry teaching, it is suggested that further development of the idea is required before it could be usefully applied.

The most significant finding of the study was the increase in number of students choosing psychiatry (17%) as a possible career upon completion of the attachment as compared to before (4%). The majority of the students considered psychiatry as a mainstream specialty with little change in this perception pre and post attachment. Almost all of the students believed that a psychiatry posting would improve their communication skills when dealing with patients. Approximately half of students chose medical subspecialties as career choice prior to their psychiatry posting but this declined afterwards. There was a small increase in the number of students wanting to become GPs and those who were undecided about their potential career choice. With regards to deterrents to doing psychiatry, the principal one was the belief that psychiatry was too depressing and stressful.

Demographic changes show change in the population pyramid and the high incidence of chronic diseases, including mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, which have led to a high demand for psychiatric care at different levels. The health system, with its deep crisis, and the lack of response of the education sector in human resource training show a lack of social responsibility with regards to Psychiatric specialty in the country. We have an educational process that ensures that medical graduates respond appropriately to people who require service. However, our graduate programs do not meet the health needs and the number of specialists are not qualified as specialists and do not meet the needs in this region. The high costs of mental health services (eg, consultation and medicines) and lack of access to these services are proof that Colombia does not have a timely and effective response to the epidemiological situation of mental illness.

Association was found between the purpose of not specializing in Psychiatry with the fact of having taken said course (Fisher's exact test, p=0,042). Most students would not specialize in psychiatry because they are interested in other areas. Before the course, students made emphasis on the biological aspects of mental disease. After the course, they also directed their attention to other factors. The two groups believe that the management of these patients is mainly pharmacological. The incurable character of mental illness was also highlighted together with the risk of getting ill and the stigma it entails.\nPsychiatry is perceived as a medical specialization with emphasis on pharmacological treatment.

The utility of these studies lies in the fact that for the most part these sleep disorders can be treated, and the PTSD can then subsequently respond to appropriate treatment, or be resolved as sleep normalizes. There's a lot more that can be done--I'd like to end on some words from the American poet, Robert Frost, whose lines \"I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep; and miles to go before I sleep\" seem to herald the current situation in which sleep medicine and psychiatry are making a tentative beginning to explore a new realm of study."}, {"Title": "Stigmatizing attitudes in relatives of people with schizophrenia: a study using the Attribution Questionnaire AQ-27.", "Abstract": "Family members of people with mental disorders can contribute to stigmatization.

Furthermore, family members may also suffer from self-stigma, experiencing a decrease in their own self-esteem and self-worth.\nTo evaluate the presence of stigmatizing attitudes towards patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in a group of relatives of patients with this disorder.\nIn this exploratory study, we surveyed 40 family members of patients with schizophrenia seen at the Community Psychiatry Unit of the Psychiatry Department at Centro Hospitalar de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (CHSJ), in Porto, Portugal, using a preliminary version of the Attribution Questionnaire AQ-27 in Portuguese.\nThe questionnaire dimensions with the highest mean scores were help, pity, and coercion, followed by segregation, anger, avoidance, dangerousness, responsibility, and fear. These results suggest that relatives do not see people with schizophrenia as responsible for their illness and that they show concern and willingness to help. They avoid but do not fear people with schizophrenia and neither consider them dangerous.\nThe participants expressed positive, little stigmatizing attitudes towards people with schizophrenia, probably as a result of their familiarity with severe mental disorder, an adequate attribution process, and low levels of perceived dangerousness. However, the high scores of coercion, pity, and segregation may reflect concealed stigmas that may influence the self-determination of the mentally ill, suggesting the need for psychoeducational interventions aimed at family members."}, {"Title": "[Women and madness in the Eneid].", "Abstract": "The article presents female cases of madness in Latin Vergilian Literature, comparing the Greek Dyonisian divine possession of the Maenads and Bacchae with the madness of Dido and Amata.

Already in 1967, in a period dominated by silence over the past of psychiatry, Jervis affirmed the importance of history for the critique of the present. His warning remained crucial in the following years; as the psychiatry looked at the past mostly in order to condemn it, Jervis emphasised the importance of understanding historical change, both in the distant and recent past.

Most countries of the region have developed national and local initiatives to improve delivery of mental health services over the last 22 years, following the technical leadership of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). It is especially notable that PAHO/WHO facilitated the development of national policies and plans, as well as local programs, to deliver specialized community care for persons with severe mental disorders. Nevertheless, at present, the majority of Latin American countries maintain a model of services for severe mental disorders based primarily on psychiatric hospitals that consume most of the national mental health budget. To accelerate the pace of change, this article emphasizes the need to develop cross-country regional initiatives that promote mental health service development, focusing on severe mental disorders. As one specific example, the authors describe work with RedeAmericas, which has brought together an interdisciplinary group of international investigators to research regional approaches and train a new generation of leaders in public mental health. More generally, four regional strategies are proposed to complement the work of PAHO/ WHO in Latin America: 1) to develop multi-country studies on community services, 2) to study new strategies and interventions in countries with more advanced mental health services, 3) to strengthen advocacy groups by cross-country interchange, and 4) to develop a network of well-trained leaders to catalyze progress across the region."}, {"Title": "Nutritional status in patients with major depressive disorders: a pilot study in tabriz, iran.", "Abstract": "This study was conducted to assess the nutritional status in Iranian major depres\u00acsive disorder patients.

Unlike other authors of pregnancy tests, Abderhalden claimed that his \"defense ferments reaction\" (Abwehrfermentsreaktion), if performed according to his methodology, was 100% specific and sensitive for pregnancy, even in its first weeks. Abderhalden's test raised much interest worldwide. Within the first few years from its first announcement, several hundred papers on the evaluation of the test's reliability were published, most of them enthusiastic. Variations of Abderhalden's test were hoped to work effectively as diagnostic tools in psychiatry, oncology, and internal diseases. Many clinicians believed that thanks to Abdehalden's method a wide range of conditions, such as schizophrenia, depression or cancers, could be unequivocally diagnosed with one serum test. In 1928, Abderhalden's reaction as a pregnancy test was replaced with the biological test developed by Aschheim and Zondek. In psychiatry, however, Abderhalden's test was used and evaluated as a diagnostic tool up till the 1930s.

Also, the use of maladaptive defense mechanisms (both neurotic and immature) in FD patients significantly was higher than healthy individuals (P<0.001).\nPsychiatric symptoms, alexithymia, and maladaptive defense play significant role in the emergence of FD symptoms.

However, in cases of paraphilia associated with sexual offences, reducing paraphilic behavior is critical in an approach to preventing sexual violence and reducing victimization. This review will focus on this specific population.\nWe discuss the recently published recommendations for the treatment of paraphilias of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry which were based on a review of the available literature about pharmacological treatment of paraphilias (1970-2010).\nAntiandrogens, and mostly GnRH analogues, significantly reduce the intensity and frequency of deviant sexual arousal and behavior, although informed consent is necessary in all cases. GnRH analogue treatment constitutes the most promising treatment for sex offenders at high risk of sexual violence, such as pedophiles or serial rapists. SSRIs remain an interesting option in adolescents, in patients with depressive or OCD disorders, or in mild paraphilias such as exhibitionism. Pharmacological interventions should be part of a more comprehensive treatment plan including psychotherapy and, in most cases, behavior therapy."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of antidepressant monotherapy in a naturalistic outpatient setting.", "Abstract": "To assess a representative sample of clinically depressed outpatients during acute treatment with antidepressant medication monotherapy to determine clinical outcomes and evaluate relationships between outcomes and selected baseline/treatment features.\nThis naturalistic study examined data on outpatients at the Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, from January 2000 through December 2010. Eligible patients (N = 1,722) had a diagnosis of clinical depression (major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or depressive disorder not otherwise specified as defined in DSM-IV-TR). Sociodemographic/clinical data were gathered at study entry (date of first treatment). The Clinical Global Impressions-improvement (CGI-I) and -severity of illness (CGI-S) scales were administered at entry and at study exit (end of follow-up) after 1 to 9 weeks of treatment. Analysis of variance, F tests, and t tests determined relationships between outcomes and treatment duration, baseline severity, and sociodemographic/clinical features.\nThirty-nine percent of participants reported substantial improvement (CGI-I score = 1 or 2) from entry to exit, 33% reported minimal improvement (CGI-I score = 3), 22% reported no change, and approximately 7% reported worsened illness. Greater improvement (CGI-I score) and greater reduction in depressive severity (CGI-S score) were associated with greater baseline depressive severity and longer treatment duration (all P < .001). Participants with greater baseline depressive severity experienced larger reductions in depressive severity but reported worse CGI-I scores at exit. Less improvement in CGI-I scores was seen in women compared to men (P = .018). Less improvement in CGI-I scores and less reduction in CGI-S scores were seen in participants \u2264 60 years of age (P = .040 and P = .025, respectively) and those with comorbid substance abuse (P < .001 and P = .010, respectively) or anxiety (P = .018 and P < .001, respectively) disorders.\nMost depressive symptom improvement occurred within the first 4 to 6 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy.

The hypothesis is that the application of the ICF in the field of psychiatry has not been yet much explored. Therefore, the objective of this article was to provide reasons to explain the difficult implementation of the ICF in this field, which in turn, might account for the lack of studies. A literature search was conducted using the terms ICF AND mental illness OR mental disorders OR psychiatry in titles, abstracts, and key words of articles collected in the databases ISI Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect and Medline from 2001 to 2010. A total of 64 full-length articles were retrieved and reviewed, and among them, 13 were eventually included in this review because they were related to the ICF in psychiatry. Of the 13 studies identified concerning the ICF and mental disorders, 7 focus on the implementation of the ICF in the clinical practice, and 6 are theoretical papers discussing the potential benefits of the ICF for the field of psychiatry. A number of reasons can be suggested to explain the paucity of studies on the use of the ICF in psychiatry in the last 10 yrs: (1) the novelty of the ICF and the dominance of the medical model, (2) the belief that disability is just about physical conditions, (3) the influence of medication on capacity and performance, (4) the complex structure of the ICF, (5) the intrinsic limitations of the ICF, and (6) limitations in the accessibility of the ICF to some medical professionals."}, {"Title": "Specialized inpatient psychiatry units for children with autism and developmental disorders: a United States survey.", "Abstract": "A cross sectional survey was performed to obtain the characteristics of specialized inpatient psychiatry units exclusively serving children with autism and other developmental disorders in the United States.

Fifty two, age and gender matched healthy volunteers (42 males and 10 females, mean age of 30 \u00b1 6 yrs) were also enrolled in this study. Immunoglobulin levels were measured by turbidimetry method using immunoglobulin kits. It was found that the mean serum immunoglobulin concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA of panic disorder patients were 0.999\u00b10.26 (g/L), 0.1\u00b10.028 (g/L) and 0.194\u00b10.066 (g/L) respectively whereas the values were 1.24\u00b1 0.39 ( g/L ), 0.096\u00b10.022 ( g/L) , 0.194\u00b10.053 (g/L) in healthy volunteers. IgG level in panic disorder patient was found significantly (p <0.05) lower than that of the controls but the change in concentration of IgM and IgA were not significant (p=0.497, p=0.962).

Faced with an empty drug pipeline and numerous failures of potential new drugs in clinical trials, many large pharmaceutical companies have been shrinking or even closing down their research divisions that focus on central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this paper, we argue that many of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack of robustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There are two main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lack of replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which we argue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriate selection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is the frequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallel results in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome by developing new behavioral tests for non-human animals that have predictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present these translational difficulties as a \"grand challenge\" to researchers from comparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methods for testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These new experimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust and target behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for better connection with human CNS disorders. Our hope is that this downturn in industrial research may represent an opportunity to develop new protocols that will re-kindle the search for more effective and safer drugs for CNS disorders."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive endophenotypes of impulsivity and compulsivity: towards dimensional psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A key criticism of the main diagnostic tool in psychiatry, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-IV), is that it lacks a biological footing.

Indeed, his approach was extremely naive, simplistic and uncritical, aimed at irrefutably demonstrating the hypotheses that he championed, without exercising the methodological caution that was already beginning to characterize scientific research in his day. However, we must acknowledge that his biological theories of crime are undergoing new developments as a result of the recent success of biological psychiatry. On the other hand we should recognize that his work was not limited to his biological central theory; rather, it covered a range of cues and concepts, for the most part ignored, that demonstrate his interest in the economic, cultural and social factors that impact on crime.

Herein, we report that fMRI in rats can provide key information regarding brain areas underlying anxiety behavior. Perfusion as surrogate for neuronal activity was measured by means of arterial spin labeling-based fMRI in various brain areas of high anxiety F344 rats and control Sprague-Dawley rats. In one of these areas, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), c-Fos labeling was compared between these two strains with immunolabeling. The effects of a neurotoxic ibotenic acid lesion of the dmPFC in F344 rats were examined in a social approach-avoidance anxiety procedure and fMRI. Regional brain activity of high anxiety F344 rats was different in selective cortical and subcortical areas as compared to that of low anxiety Sprague-Dawley rats; the largest difference (i.e. hyperactivity) was measured in the dmPFC. Independently, c-Fos labeling confirmed that F344 rats show increased dmPFC activity. The functional role was confirmed by neurotoxic lesion of the dmPFC that reversed the high anxiety-like behavior and partially normalized the brain activity pattern of F344 rats. The current findings may have translational value as increased activity is reported in an equivalent cortical area in patients with social anxiety, suggesting that pharmacological or functional inhibition of activity in this brain area should be explored to alleviate social anxiety in patients."}, {"Title": "All professionals are equal but some professionals are more equal than others?

In this study, to investigate frequency of encounter workers with PDD with poor mental health status and support for them in workplaces, a field survey in the occupational field was conducted among psychiatrists having experience of occupational medicine.\nA mail-in survey was sent to 122 psychiatrists who belonged to the Department of Psychiatry, University of Occupational and Environmental Health.\nFifty-six psychiatrists responded (response rate 45.9%), among whom 36 had the experience of occupational medicine. Seven psychiatrists (20.0%) had experience of treating persons with poor mental health status who were diagnosed as having PDD, and 15 psychiatrists (42.9%) had experience of taking care of persons with poor mental health status who had not been diagnosed as having PDD, but they suspected it. Three psychiatrists (8.6%) had experience of taking care of both types of persons, while 19 psychiatrists (54.6%) had experience of taking care of one of the two types. Most frequent support in workplaces was \"advice and consultation for supervisors\" and \"change in job content\". Supports in the workplace were taken more for persons with poor mental health status who were diagnosed as having PDD than for persons who had not been diagnosed as having PDD. It was 10.5% which is utilizing the social resources of the community to support for PDD.\nHalf of the psychiatrists having the experience of occupational medicine had experience of taking care of persons diagnosed as having or suspected of having PDD, indicating that it is not rare to encounter workers with PDD in the occupational field.

In addition, an attempt was made to study the factor structure of symptoms using principal components analysis.\nThe case notes of 109 elderly patients referred to psychiatry liaison services were reviewed.\nThe mean age of the sample was 73.35 years (SD: 7.44; range 65-95 years) and two-thirds of the sample had hospital emergent delirium. The mean DRS-R98 severity score was 18.77 and the DRS-R98 total score was 24.81. In 15 patients the DRS-R98 scores were in the subsyndromal range. Among the various symptoms present, most patients had sleep-wake cycle disturbance, disturbance in orientation, attention and short-term memory impairments, fluctuation of symptoms, temporal onset of symptoms and a physical disorder. Principal components analysis identified three factors which explained 43.5% of variance of symptomatology and it yielded a three-factor structure. Endocrine/metabolic disturbances were the commonest associated etiological category with delirium. The mean hospital stay after being referred to psychiatry referral services was 8.89 days, after which delirium improved in 58.7% of cases.

This study aimed to investigate attitudes of staff towards various containment measures in the field of adolescent psychiatry. The sample comprised 128 Finnish nurses and doctors working in closed wards with 13- to 17-year-old patients. The attitudes were studied using the Attitude to Containment Measures Questionnaire. The three methods with the most approval were as-needed medication, transfer to specialist locked wards and mechanical restraint. The method with the least approval was the net bed. Total approval scores for the various containment measures were very similar among nurses and doctors. The differences appeared in attitudes towards mechanical restraint and constant observation, doctors showing a more critical attitude. Women tended to be more critical than men, but only intramuscular medication and mechanical restraint reached statistical significance.

Levels of available evidence were found to vary according to the addressed issue. Although the concept of bipolar type VI could be criticized for subsuming under one single heading all the four other issues, this concept may be of pragmatic value in helping clinicians to orientate both diagnosis process and treatment decisions.

We analysed 100 randomly selected case files of German servicemen admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of the Charit\u00e9 Medical School of Berlin University during WWI and classified them according to contemporaneous and retrospective modern diagnoses. We compared the clinical presentations with accounts in the German and British medical literature of the time. Most patients obtained the contemporaneous diagnosis of 'psychopathic constitution' or hysteria reflecting the general view of German psychiatrists that not the war but an individual predisposition was the basis for the development of symptoms. The clinical picture was dominated by pseudoneurological motor or sensory symptoms as well as pseudoseizures. Some soldiers relived combat experiences in dream-like dissociative states that partly resemble modern-day post-traumatic stress disorder. Most servicemen were classified as unfit for military service but very few of them were granted compensation. Severe functional disorders of a neurological character could develop even without traumatic exposure in combat, which is of interest for the current debate on triggers of stress disorders. The high incidence of pseudoseizures accords with the psychiatric literature of the time and contrasts with accounts of war-related disorders in Britain.

Patients also show baseline respiratory abnormalities and a higher rate of comorbid and antecedent respiratory diseases. Panic attacks are also precipitated by infusion of sodium lactate and inhalation of 5% CO\u2082 in predisposed patients but not in healthy volunteers or patients without panic disorder. Accordingly, Klein [Klein (1993) Arch Gen Psychiatry 50:306-317] suggested that clinical panic is the misfiring of an as-yet-unidentified suffocation alarm system. In rats, selective anoxia of chemoreceptor cells by potassium cyanide (KCN) and electrical and chemical stimulations of periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) produce defensive behaviors, which resemble panic attacks. Thus, here we examined the effects of single or combined administrations of CO\u2082 (8% and 13%) and KCN (10-80 \u03bcg, i.v.) on spontaneous and PAG-evoked behaviors of rats either intact or bearing electrolytic lesions of PAG. Exposure to CO\u2082 alone reduced grooming while increased exophthalmus, suggesting an arousal response to non-visual cues of environment. Unexpectedly, however, CO\u2082 attenuated PAG-evoked immobility, trotting, and galloping while facilitated defecation and micturition. Conversely, KCN produced all defensive behaviors of the rat and facilitated PAG-evoked trotting, galloping, and defecation. There were also facilitatory trends in PAG-evoked exophthalmus, immobility, and jumping. Moreover, whereas the KCN-evoked defensive behaviors were attenuated or even suppressed by discrete lesions of PAG, they were markedly facilitated by CO\u2082. Authors suggest that the PAG harbors an anoxia-sensitive suffocation alarm system which activation precipitates panic attacks and potentiates the subject responses to hypercapnia."}, {"Title": "Developing a dimensional model for successful cognitive and emotional aging.", "Abstract": "There is currently a lack of consensus on the definition of successful aging (SA) and existing implementations have omitted constructs associated with SA.

The SA-related variables we included in the model were self-rated successful aging, depression severity, physical and emotional functioning, optimism, resilience, attitude towards own aging, self-efficacy, and cognitive ability. After adjusting for age, education and income, we fitted an exploratory factor analysis model to the SA-related variables and then, in order to address relationships among these factors, we computed a Bayesian Belief Net (BBN) using rotated factor scores.\nThe SA-related variables loaded onto five factors.

In the BBN, self-rated successful aging emerged as the primary downstream factor and exhibited significant partial correlations with psychosocial protective factors, physical/general status and mental/emotional status but not with cognitive ability.\nOur study represents a step forward in developing a dimensional model of SA.

The high degree of learning-dependent plasticity in these networks-combined with the availability of advanced computerized technology-suggests that we should be able to engineer very specific training programs that drive meaningful and enduring improvements in impaired neural systems relevant to neuropsychiatric illness. However, cognitive training approaches for mental and addictive disorders must take into account possible inherent limitations in the underlying brain 'learning machinery' due to pathophysiology, must grapple with the presence of complex overlearned maladaptive patterns of neural functioning, and must find a way to ally with developmental and psychosocial factors that influence response to illness and to treatment. In this review, we briefly examine the current state of knowledge from studies of cognitive remediation in psychiatry and we highlight open questions. We then present a systems neuroscience rationale for successful cognitive training for neuropsychiatric illnesses, one that emphasizes the distributed nature of neural assemblies that support cognitive and affective processing, as well as their plasticity. It is based on the notion that, during successful learning, the brain represents the relevant perceptual and cognitive/affective inputs and action outputs with disproportionately larger and more coordinated populations of neurons that are distributed (and that are interacting) across multiple levels of processing and throughout multiple brain regions. This approach allows us to address limitations found in earlier research and to introduce important principles for the design and evaluation of the next generation of cognitive training for impaired neural systems. We summarize work to date using such neuroscience-informed methods and indicate some of the exciting future directions of this field."}, {"Title": "Affective norms for 380 Spanish words belonging to three different semantic categories.", "Abstract": "Emotional words are increasingly used in the study of word processing. To elucidate whether the experimental effects obtained with these words are due either to their affective content or to other semantic characteristics, it is necessary to conduct experiments with affectively valenced words obtained from different semantic categories. In the present article, we present affective ratings for 380 Spanish words belonging to three semantic categories: animals, people, and objects. The norms are based on the assessments made by 504 participants, who rated about 47 words either in valence and arousal, by using the Self-Assessment Manikin (Bradley & Lang, Journal of Behavioral Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 25, 49-59. 1994), or in concreteness and familiarity. These ratings will help researchers select stimuli for experiments in which both the affective properties of words and their membership to a given semantic category have to be taken into account.

To evaluate psychopathology we used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; for insight, the Scale of Unawareness of Mental Disorder; and for general cognitive abilities, the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry.\nInsight showed significant and moderate positive correlations with positive and general symptoms but not with negative symptoms. In the subgroup with positive symptomatic profile, awareness of the disorder and of the effects of medication were positively associated with severity of positive and general psychotic symptoms. Awareness of social consequences of the disease was positively associated with positive symptoms. In the subgroup with a negative symptomatic profile, awareness of the disorder and of the effects of medication were positively associated with severity of positive and general psychotic symptoms. In this subgroup, these relationships were significantly affected by general cognitive abilities.\nInsight was not related with the severity of negative psychotic symptoms.

Lynam et al (2006) have developed the UPPS-P, a 59-item scale measuring 5 impulsivity components: negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and sensation seeking. The aim of the present study was to validate a short, 20-item French version of the UPPS-P.\nSix hundred fifty participants filled out the short French UPPS-P. A subgroup of participants (n = 145) took part in a follow-up study and completed the scale twice to determine test-retest stability; another subgroup (n = 105) was screened with other questionnaires also to establish external validity.\nConfirmatory factor analyses supported a hierarchical model comprising 2 higher order factors of urgency (resulting from negative urgency and positive urgency) and lack of conscientiousness (resulting from lack of premeditation and lack of perseverance) as well as a separate factor of sensation seeking. The results indicated good internal consistency and test-retest stability. External validity was supported by relationships with psychopathological symptoms.\nThe short French version of the UPPS-P therefore presents good psychometric properties and may be considered a promising instrument for both research and clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Placebo effect in child and adolescent psychiatric trials.", "Abstract": "Much literature has been written in the field of child psychiatry regarding the placebo as a tool to test drug efficacy in clinical trials, but quite little regarding the placebo effect itself or its clinical use in child psychiatry. In this article, we aim to critically review the literature regarding the placebo effect in children and adolescents with mental disorders, focusing especially on factors influencing the placebo effect and how they may influence the interpretation of clinical trials. The placebo effect seems to be more marked in children than adults, and particularly in children and adolescents with depression, although it is pervasive across ages and is present in non-psychiatric conditions as well. The use of a placebo in clinical trials as a comparator with drugs that have moderate efficacy at most makes it difficult to obtain positive results, and much effort is needed to design very high quality clinical trials that may overcome the limitations of using a placebo. In addition, the placebo effect across ages and clinical conditions must be tested directly (compared with no treatment whenever possible), in order to characterise which placebos work for what and to determine their use in clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Failure to diagnose herniated discs in a depressed 43-year-old woman.", "Abstract": "A high comorbidity is known to exist between psychiatric illness and chronic pain (I.

The analysis charts the shifting understandings of personality disorders associated with antisocial behaviour in the DSM and in US psychiatry more broadly from 1950 to the present day. Memos, letters and minutes produced by the DSM-III committee and held in the American Psychiatric Association (APA) archives ground the discussion. Finally, the article explores more recent constructions of antisocial personality disorder and examines the anticipatory discourse pertaining to the rewriting of this category expected in the forthcoming DSM-5. In presenting an in-depth socio-historical narrative of the development - and potential future - of standards for pathological antisociality, this analysis casts new light on the ASPD construct.

According to this doctrine, understanding is concerned with a person's inner life and consequently, its method consists in putting oneself in the other's position and reliving their experience. Jaspers' concept of understanding - which is regarded as definitive for psychiatry by advocates and opponents alike - is commonly interpreted according to this tradition as well.\nI shall argue here that this position does not stand up to scrutiny. It is a mistake to simplify Dilthey's concept of understanding to a form of mere psychologism. In fact, Jaspers practically tore this position down. In his own account, by contrast, he utilises Max Weber and Rickert to established a third realm in addition to a person's inner life on the one hand and their bodily nature on the other: the realm of the objective products of the human mind. It is this dimension that is essential for understanding. Such a transition from the dichotomy of explaining and understanding to a three-valued logic requires a radical rethinking of the traditional notion of understanding. Jaspers meets this demand but he does so only implicitly and not always consistently so that it might easily be missed. It is nonetheless crucial to see that Jaspers in fact rejects the hermeneutics of empathy which are commonly attributed to him and for which he is often criticised.\nIn conclusion of this essay, I will suggest some implications of this - often overlooked - distinction for psychiatry and psychology."}, {"Title": "Patient and carer participation in old age psychiatry in England.

A consistent multivariate predictor of mental health visits to all types of professionals was psychological distress. Presence of an affective disorder, age, and number of health problems were additional predictors of visiting a GP. Being female, divorced, and exposure to childhood trauma predicted use of a mental health specialist, while rural living was associated with lower use of these services.

The variability of symptoms and the frequency of comorbidities among patients with fibromyalgia make this a difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. New diagnostic criteria are available to improve the diagnosis and care of patients. We propose the first French translation of the new diagnostic criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010. Although the etiology of fibromyalgia remains unclear, evidences suggest that biologic, genetic and environmental factors are involved. This chronic psychophysical suffering state of fibromyalgia adversely affects the patient's quality of life, performance and mood. Studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia that requires careful history and evaluation for the presence of primary or secondary mood disturbances and psychological stress. Despite the absence of strong evidence of the fibromyalgia pathogenesis, evidence base medecine lead us to consider a biopsychosocial model and a multidisciplinary treatment. Treatment of fibromyalgia requires a comprehensive and multidimensional approach with patient education, cognitive behavior therapy, exercise, physical therapy and pharmacological therapy. Today, the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (milnacipran and duloxetine) and the antiepileptic (pregabalin) are the most effective drugs available for the treatment for fibromyalgia.

Because of the similarities between the neuroanatomical changes observed in our mouse model and those described in human survivors of ENA, this novel animal model is potentially useful for studies of human ENA too costly or cumbersome to be carried out in primates.

Studies suggest that personality traits such as perfectionism and neuroticism might be implicated in the aetiology of the disorder. However, to date, no study has investigated behavioural indicators of these factors in a hypothesis-driven manner. In the present study, we assessed punctuality as a behavioural indicator of perfectionism and neuroticism in 635 consecutive clinical patients of the sleep laboratory of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Freiburg Medical Center. The primary aim was to compare primary insomnia patients (n = 148) with another group of patients with other sleep-related diagnoses (n = 487). Primary insomnia patients arrived on average 4 min earlier when compared to other patients (P = 0.041). However, this effect failed to reach statistical significance when correcting for the influence of potential confounding variables. Of note, we found a strong relationship between polysomnographic sleep parameters and punctuality. That is, short sleep duration was associated significantly with early arrival times at the sleep laboratory (P = 0.023). These findings support the proposal that personality traits, which we predict underlie obsessive punctuality, may be involved in the aetiology of objectively defined sleep disturbances.

However, clinical studies with selective NK(3) receptor antagonists in these psychiatric conditions have been disappointing and they were unable to confirm the promising therapeutic potential from animal studies, thereby questioning the therapeutic utility of these compounds for CNS disorders.

Forensic patients appear to have a much lower symptom load (except for cognitive symptoms) than the other groups. Forensic controls had much shorter inpatient times than any other group and never caught up with respect to symptom control, even after 2 years. These differences suggest that the scale is clinically valid.\nPECC has a more robust factor structure than PANSS and is simpler to use.

Preventive interventions during this phase are of great interest because of the impressive clinical benefits. However, available psychopathological criteria employed to define a high risk state for psychosis have low validity and specificity. Consequently there is an urgent need of reliable neurocognitive markers linked to the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie schizophrenia. Neuroimaging techniques have rapidly developed into a powerful tool in psychiatry as they provide an unprecedented opportunity for the investigation of brain structure and function. This review shows that neuroimaging studies of the prodromal phases of psychosis have the potentials to identify core structural and functional markers of an impending risk to psychosis and to clarify the dynamic changes underlying transition to psychosis and to address significant correlations between brain structure or function and prodromal psychopathology. Additionally, neurochemical methods can address the key role played by neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamate during the psychosis onset. To conclude, multimodal neuroimaging may ultimately clarify the neurobiology of the prodromal phases by the integration of functional, structural and neurochemical findings."}, {"Title": "Journals publishing bio-medicolegal research in Europe.", "Abstract": "Fragmentation of bio-medicolegal knowledge has led to a proliferation of ultra-specialised sub-disciplines and branches, often published in 'field-oriented' scientific journals.The aim of this work is to provide an in-depth analytical picture of bio-medicolegal sources of publication, within and outside the traditional conception of legal medicine.

DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes. We conclude the review with a discussion on translational issues in DBS research, medical ethical considerations and recommendations for clinical trials with DBS in patients with addiction."}, {"Title": "Ways of problem solving as predictors of relapse in alcohol dependent male inpatients.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify how remitters and relapsers view their everyday problem solving strategies.\nA total of 128 male alcohol dependent male inpatients who were hospitalized at the Ankara University Psychiatry Clinic, Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Unit were recruited for the study. Subjects demographic status and alcohol use histories were assessed by a self-report questionnaire. Also, patients were evaluated with The Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory (CSI), The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-I-II), and The Problem Solving Inventory (PSI). Patients were followed for six months with monthly intervals after hospital discharge. Drinking status was assessed in terms of abstinence and relapse. Data were assessed with Student t-test, and univariate and multivariate analyses. In the logistic regression analysis, age, marital status, employment status and PSI subscores were taken as the independent variables and drinking state at the end of six months as the dependent variable.\nThere were significant differences in reflective and avoidant styles, and monitoring style of problem solving between abstainers and relapses. It was found that subjects who perceived their problem solving style as less avoidant and less reflective were at greater risk to relapse.\nThe findings demonstrated that active engagement in problem solving like utilizing avoidant and reflective styles of problem solving enhances abstinence. In treatment, expanding the behavior repertoire and increasing the variety of ways of problem solving ways that can be utilized in daily life should be one of the major goals of the treatment program."}, {"Title": "Agreement of informants on emotional and behavioral problems from childhood to adulthood.", "Abstract": "Agreement among informants' ratings of children's and adults' internalizing and externalizing problems is moderate. Each informant contributes unique information about an individual's problems. Thus, it has been advocated to obtain ratings from multiple sources in child psychiatry, whereas adult psychiatry relies mostly on self-reports. Longitudinal studies repeatedly assessing children's psychiatric problems from childhood into adulthood and including reports from multiple informants could serve as benchmarks for studies including only selected time points or informants. We examined the development of agreement among informants' ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems using self-, parent, teacher, and partner reports in a longitudinal study with 7 assessment waves spanning an interval of 24 years and covering an age range of 4 to 40 years. The number of informant pairs is 12,059, who rated 1,875 individuals. The results revealed that correlations among informant ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems depend more on the informant pair than on problem type or age group. Second, differences among informants rating internalizing problems typically become larger when individuals get older. Third, when rating themselves, individuals typically report higher scores than do parents, teachers, or partners. These results were consistent for internalizing and externalizing problems and across age groups. The findings indicate that like in child psychiatry, assessment in adult psychiatry may benefit from a shift to multiple informant reports, as different informants' ratings may contain more information than if informants completely agree."}, {"Title": "'Omic' genetic technologies for herbal medicines in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The field of genetics, which includes the use of 'omic' technologies, is an evolving area of science that has emerging application in phytotherapy. Omic studies include pharmacogenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Herbal medicines, as monotherapies, or complex formulations such as traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, may benefit from omic studies, and this new field may be termed 'herbomics'. Applying herbomics in the field of psychiatry may provide answers about which herbal interventions may be effective for individuals, which genetic processes are triggered, and the subsequent neurochemical pathways of activity. The use of proteomic technology can explore the differing epigenetic effects on neurochemical gene expression between individual herbs, isolated constituents and complex formulae. The possibilities of side effects or insufficient response to the herb can also be assessed via pharmacogenomic analysis of polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or P-glycoprotein. While another novel application of omic technology is for the validation of the concept of synergy in individual herbal extracts and prescriptive formulations. Chronic administration of psychotropic herbal medicines may discover important effects on chromatin remodelling via modification of histone and DNA methylation. This paper focuses on the emerging field of herbomics, and is to our knowledge the first publication to explore this in the area of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Urinary incontinence in inpatient psychiatry: prevalence, change and relationship to length of stay.", "Abstract": "To identify the prevalence of urinary incontinence in inpatient psychiatric settings and its relationship to length of stay.\nUrinary incontinence is a common and disabling condition. Previous work has shown that urinary incontinence is not always considered to be important in inpatient psychiatry.\nRetrospective analysis of provincial database for inpatient psychiatry.\nThe study included all psychiatric inpatients in Ontario assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument Mental Health at both admission and discharge since 1 October 2005. We used sex-based analyses to examine the prevalence of urinary incontinence at admission and change over the inpatient stay. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between urinary incontinence and experiencing an above average length of stay in hospital.\nThe prevalence of urinary incontinence at admission was 5\u00b76%; rates were higher among women and the profiles of afflicted men and women differed. Approximately 35% of psychiatric patients were no longer incontinent at the time of discharge, and new cases of incontinence were reported for 1\u00b72% of patients. Both the presence of urinary incontinence at admission and development of urinary incontinence over the inpatient stay were related to increased likelihood of having a longer than average length of stay. These odds were significant for both sexes, but higher for women for the role of urinary incontinence at admission and higher for men for the role of developing urinary incontinence.\nUrinary incontinence was present among a non-trivial proportion of psychiatric inpatients and persisted for most throughout the inpatient stay. Presence of urinary incontinence was related to increased hospital stay.\nMental health service providers should identify urinary incontinence quickly and pay attention to it; incorporating treatment into the care plan early on in the inpatient stay may help to ensure a more rapid return to the community."}, {"Title": "Making decisions about delirium: a qualitative comparison of decision making between nurses working in palliative care, aged care, aged care psychiatry, and oncology.", "Abstract": "Delirium has a significant impact on nursing practice from diagnosis and management, with under-detection and variable management of delirium being international problems. This study aimed to explore nurses' assessment and management of delirium when caring for people with cancer, the elderly or older people requiring psychiatric care in the inpatient setting.\nParticipants in this qualitative study were nurses working in Australian public hospital inpatient dedicated units in palliative care, aged care (geriatrics), aged care (geriatric) psychiatry and oncology. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore nurses' views about specific areas of delirium assessment and management. Purposive sampling was used and interviews conducted until thematic saturation reached. A thematic content analysis was performed from a grounded theory perspective.\nA total of 40 participants were included in the study. The analysis revealed four broad analytical themes: (1) superficial recognition and understanding of the operational definition of delirium or recognition of delirium as a syndrome; (2) nursing assessment: investigative versus a problem solving approach; (3) management: maintaining dignity and minimizing chaos; and (4) distress and the effect on others.\nNurses have limited knowledge of the features of delirium regardless of their specialty discipline. Delirium was uniformly identified as a highly distressing experience for patients, families and staff alike. The majority of nurses had a superficial understanding of delirium management, and adopted a task-orientated approach aimed at addressing the more noticeable problems. These findings have implications for both education and knowledge translation.

Contrary to clinicians who seek to treat addicted people to become and remain abstinent, researchers seek to make drug-na\u00efve animals addicted to a drug with known addictive properties in humans. The goals of this research are to better understand the neuroscience of drug addiction and, ultimately, to translate this knowledge into effective treatments for people with addiction. The present review will not cover the vast literature that has accumulated over the past 50 years on animal models of drug addiction. It is instead more modestly devoted to recent research spanning the past decade on drug self-administration-based models of addiction in the rat (the animal species most frequently used in the field), with a special focus on current efforts to model compulsive cocaine use as opposed to nonaddictive use. Surprisingly, it turns out that modeling compulsive cocaine use in rats is possible but more difficult than previously thought. In fact, it appears that resilience to cocaine addiction is the norm in rats. As in human cocaine users, only few individual rats would be vulnerable. This conclusion has several important implications for future research on the neuroscience of cocaine addiction and on preclinical medication development."}, {"Title": "A qualitative study of perceptions related to family risk of bipolar disorder among patients and family members from India.", "Abstract": "Over the past decade there have been rapid advances in psychiatry genetics and there is a growing concern about the clinical and practical relevance of this knowledge.

Yet the interactions involved in trying to achieve shared decision-making are relatively unexplored in psychiatry. This study analyses audiotapes of 92 outpatient consultations involving nine consultant psychiatrists focusing on how pressure is applied in shared decisions about antipsychotic medication. Detailed conversation analysis reveals that some shared decisions are considerably more pressured than others. At one end of a spectrum of pressure are pressured shared decisions, characterised by an escalating cycle of pressure and resistance from which it is difficult to exit without someone losing face. In the middle are directed decisions, where the patient cooperates with being diplomatically steered by the psychiatrist. At the other extreme are open decisions where the patient is allowed to decide, with the psychiatrist exerting little or no pressure. Directed and open decisions occurred most frequently; pressured decisions were rarer. Patient risk did not appear to influence the degree of pressure applied in these outpatient consultations."}, {"Title": "Early reactions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in plasma (pBDNF) and outcome to acute antidepressant treatment in patients with Major Depression.", "Abstract": "In Major Depressive Disorder, a growing data base suggests that the onset of antidepressants' action can be detected by improvement of depressive symptoms in the first 10-14 days of treatment. Previous studies showed that the mean concentration of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in blood increases during antidepressant treatment and positively correlates with amelioration of MDD symptoms. We previously showed an association between very early changes of the serum BDNF concentration and treatment outcome (Tadi\u0107 et al., 2011. Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 35, 415-420). However, no study has yet investigated whether BDNF concentration in plasma increases in the early course of treatment and enables the prediction of final treatment outcome. The goal of this study was to investigate in MDD patients, whether the change of pBDNF in the early course of treatment is a specific and sensitive marker for final treatment outcome. For this purpose, we performed a naturalistic pilot study with 39 inpatients with MDD according to DSM-IV. Depression severity and pBDNF were measured in weekly intervals from baseline (EP) to endpoint (EP, max. week six) with the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. According to ROC-analysis, the best cut-off value for the prediction of response at EP is an increase of 338 pg/ml or 126%, respectively, of pBDNF between BL and day 7. The single markers pBDNF change and HAMD-21 improvement from BL-d7 predicted later treatment outcome with moderate to high sensitivity and specificity (pBDNF: 42% and 96%, resp.; HAMD improvement: 83% and 65%, resp.). The combined marker early pBDNF change plus HAMD-21 improvement at day 7 increased the specificity for response to 100%. Our data provide first preliminary evidence that an early change of pBDNF in conjunction with early improvement might be a peripheral marker predictive for treatment outcome in patients with MDD. This has to be confirmed in further investigations.

Although undergraduate nurses are employed as assistants in nursing (AIN) in mental health settings, there is no published research exploring their role, the career trajectory into MHN, or its effectiveness as a recruitment strategy. In this paper, we draw on the literature to delineate factors that might contribute to the desire of AIN to work in MHN. Nine factors were identified: acceptance by nurses, fitting in with the culture, managing the workload, developing a realistic appraisal of the effectiveness and limits of psychiatry, constructive learning from direct interpersonal interactions with clients, practising communication skills, being supported in a structured way, working with positive role models, and the overall quality of the employment setting.

Control, care and cure of the ill have been shaped by social and cultural changes from time to time, e.g. King Gustav Vasa introduced a paradigm shift of care after the Reformation, when he altered Catholic buildings into state hospitals. He also ordered that medical texts should no longer be written in Latin but in Swedish. The first book dealing with mental illnesses was published in 1578. Laypersons ran the mental hospitals for centuries until the medical perspective and doctors were engaged in the 1800 s. To advance the hospital doctors' competence and skill, a Swedish Psychiatric Association was established in 1905. Severely psychotic patients could not be effectively treated until the introduction of chlorpromazine in the 1950s and there is still no cure available. Following the deinstitutionalization, from more than 35,000 beds 50 years ago down to about 4500 today, the request for outpatient treatment increased. Mandatory training in psychotherapies for all psychiatrists started in the 1970s.

The independent psychiatric organizations on District level lasted from the 1920s until 1990. Since then, the formerly independent psychiatry was subordinated to General Hospital administration and the centralized system of state planning and financing of healthcare was gradually decentralized and run down. During the heavy Finnish economic recession of the early 1990 s, the cuts of the public sector were unfortunately focused most heavily on psychiatric services. The main focus of research and teaching has shifted from earlier emphasis on psychoanalytical approach to biological psychiatry since the late 1980s. The administrative position of psychiatry has been repeatedly changing and unstable during the last 20 years. At the level of the contents of the services, however, there have been many very positive and promising developments. Psychiatry has come closer to other specialties from its formerly isolated position, when the separate administrations have been integrated.

With the identification of genetic susceptibility factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, great efforts have been made to generate genetic animal models for major mental illnesses. As these disorders are multifactorial, comparisons among drug-induced (non-genetic) and genetic models are becoming an important issue in biological psychiatry. A major barrier is that the standard mouse strain used in the generation of genetic models is C57BL/6, whereas almost all studies with PCP-induced models have utilized other strains. To fill this technical gap, we systematically compared the behavioural changes upon PCP administration in different mouse strains, including C57BL/6N, C57BL/6J, ddY, and ICR. We observed strain differences in PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and enhanced immobility in the forced swim test (ddY>>C57BL/6N and 6J>ICR). In contrast, there was no strain difference in the impairment of recognition memory in the novel object recognition memory test after withdrawal of chronic PCP administration. This study provides practical guidance for comparing genetic with PCP-induced models of psychosis in C57BL/6.

The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the use of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a widely used standardised questionnaire in general psychiatry, in a well-defined sample of people with borderline intellectual functioning or mild ID diagnosed with one or more psychiatric disorders.\nA total of 224 psychiatric outpatients with either borderline intellectual functioning or mild ID participated in this study. All participants were new patients of Kristal, Centre for Psychiatry and Intellectual Disability in the Netherlands, in the period between 1 April 2008 and 1 October 2009. All participants were assessed by a multidisciplinary team, including a certified psychiatrist. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria were applied. The mean total intelligence quotient was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). The BSI was administered in an assisted fashion. Utility and psychometric properties of the BSI were investigated. Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alphas) were computed. Bivariate correlations between the sub-scales were computed to assess differentiation between the scales. Mean sub-scale scores were compared between different DSM-IV-TR subgroups to investigate the discriminant abilities of the scales. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted.\nThe results suggest that the BSI is practically useful. Internal consistencies ranged from 0.70 to 0.96 and thus are considered good to adequate. Sub-scale inter-correlations showed there is a degree of differentiation between the sub-scales. Discriminant validity was shown for the sub-scales depression, anxiety and phobic anxiety. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the underlying structure of the BSI could be described by the same nine-factor model as reported in previous studies.\nAs a result of the psychometric properties illustrated, this study supports the use of the BSI as a screener for psychopathology and a general outcome measure in people with ID."}, {"Title": "Molecular and cellular sex differences at the intersection of stress and arousal.", "Abstract": "Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sex biases in the prevalence and severity of diseases can advance our understanding of their pathophysiological basis and serve as a guide for developing treatments. A well-established sex difference in psychiatry is the higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females. These disorders share stress as a potential etiological contributor and hyperarousal as a core symptom, suggesting that the distinction between sexes lies at the intersection of stress and arousal systems. This review focuses on the link between the stress axis and the brain norepinephrine arousal system as a key point at which sex differences occur and are translated to differences in the expression of mood disorders. Evidence for a circuit designed to relay emotion-related information via the limbic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system to the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine arousal system is reviewed. This is followed by recent novel findings of sex differences in CRF receptor signaling and trafficking that would result in an enhanced arousal response and a compromised ability to adapt to chronic stress in females. Finally, we discuss the evidence for sex differences in LC dendritic structure that allow for an increased receipt and processing of limbic information in females compared to males. Together these complementary sets of data suggest that in females, the LC arousal system is poised to process more limbic information and to respond to some of this information in an enhanced manner compared to males. The clinical and therapeutic considerations arising from this perspective are discussed.

In this paper we attempt to respond to these problems by streamlining medical education along the following three reforms. First, high school graduates would be eligible for undergraduate medical education programs of 4\u00a0years duration. Second, medical school applicants would be required to commit themselves to a medical specialty and choose one of four undergraduate paths: (1) \"Interventions/consultations\" path that would prepare its graduates for residencies in secondary and tertiary specialties, such as cardiology and surgery, (2) \"continuous patient care\" path for primary care specialties, such as family medicine and psychiatry, (3) \"diagnostic laboratory medicine and biomedical research\" path that would prepare for either laboratory-based careers, such as pathology, biochemistry and bacteriology, or research in e.g., immunology and molecular genetics, and (4) \"epidemiology and public health\" path that would include population-based research, preventive medicine and health care administration. Third, the content of each of these paths would focus on relevant learning outcomes, and medical school graduates would be eligible for residency training only in specialties included in their path. Hopefully, an early commitment to a medical specialty will reduce the duration of medical education, improve the regulation of physicians' workforce and adapt the curricular content to the future job requirements from medical school graduates."}, {"Title": "Informed consent for clinical trials of deep brain stimulation in psychiatric disease: challenges and implications for trial design.", "Abstract": "Advances in neuromodulation and an improved understanding of the anatomy and circuitry of psychopathology have led to a resurgence of interest in surgery for psychiatric disease. Clinical trials exploring deep brain stimulation (DBS), a focally targeted, adjustable and reversible form of neurosurgery, are being developed to address the use of this technology in highly selected patient populations. Psychiatric patients deemed eligible for surgical intervention, such as DBS, typically meet stringent inclusion criteria, including demonstrated severity, chronicity and a failure of conventional therapy. Although a humanitarian device exemption by the US Food and Drug Administration exists for its use in obsessive-compulsive disorder, DBS remains a largely experimental treatment in the psychiatric context, with its use currently limited to clinical trials and investigative studies. The combination of a patient population at the limits of conventional therapy and a novel technology in a new indication poses interesting challenges to the informed consent process as it relates to clinical trial enrollment. These challenges can be divided into those that relate to the patient, their disease and the technology, with each illustrating how traditional conceptualisations of research consent may be inadequate in the surgical psychiatry context. With specific reference to risk analysis, patient autonomy, voluntariness and the duty of the clinician-researcher, this paper will discuss the unique challenges that clinical trials of surgery for refractory psychiatric disease present to the consent process. Recommendations are also made for an ethical approach to clinical trial consent acquisition in this unique patient population."}, {"Title": "Using electronic medical records to enable large-scale studies in psychiatry: treatment resistant depression as a model.", "Abstract": "Electronic medical records (EMR) provide a unique opportunity for efficient, large-scale clinical investigation in psychiatry. However, such studies will require development of tools to define treatment outcome.\nNatural language processing (NLP) was applied to classify notes from 127 504 patients with a billing diagnosis of major depressive disorder, drawn from out-patient psychiatry practices affiliated with multiple, large New England hospitals. Classifications were compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were compared with a clinician-rated gold standard.\nModels incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55). When these cross-sectional visits were integrated to define longitudinal outcomes and incorporate treatment data, 15% of the cohort remitted with a single antidepressant treatment, while 13% were identified as failing to remit despite at least two antidepressant trials. Non-remitting patients were more likely to be non-Caucasian (p<0.001).\nThe application of bioinformatics tools such as NLP should enable accurate and efficient determination of longitudinal outcomes, enabling existing EMR data to be applied to clinical research, including biomarker investigations. Continued development will be required to better address moderators of outcome such as adherence and co-morbidity."}, {"Title": "Global mental health as a component of psychiatric residency training.", "Abstract": "This study seeks to assess the educational value of an international psychiatry elective using a cross section of psychiatric residents. In 2010, a 10-item semi-structured questionnaire was administered to Mount Sinai psychiatric residents who have participated in the Global Health Residency Track of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Authors reviewed the qualitative data and arrived at a consensus regarding trends and deviations regarding residents' experiences of their international field work. Six residents participated in this study. Common themes included exposure to sicker, treatment-na\u00efve patients in resource scarce conditions, enhancement of cross-cultural communications skills, renewed appreciation for psychiatry, empowerment as teachers, and greater awareness of health-care systems. Knowing that an international elective existed would be a significant factor in their choice of residency. Respondents had concerns for the sustainability. Participants felt that the elective was a place to consolidate skills already learned during residency and resulted in increased professional confidence although it did not necessarily alter career paths. International electives can enrich psychiatric residency training in terms of understanding of mental health care systems, cross cultural psychiatry, sharpening diagnostic skills, building professional confidence and communication skills, and reaffirming motivation to practice psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A new meta-analytic method for neuroimaging studies that combines reported peak coordinates and statistical parametric maps.", "Abstract": "Meta-analyses are essential to summarize the results of the growing number of neuroimaging studies in psychiatry, neurology and allied disciplines. Image-based meta-analyses use full image information (i.e. the statistical parametric maps) and well-established statistics, but images are rarely available making them highly unfeasible. Peak-probability meta-analyses such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) or multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) are more feasible as they only need reported peak coordinates. Signed-differences methods, such as signed differential mapping (SDM) build upon the positive features of existing peak-probability methods and enable meta-analyses of studies comparing patients with controls. In this paper we present a new version of SDM, named Effect Size SDM (ES-SDM), which enables the combination of statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates and uses well-established statistics. We validated the new method by comparing the results of an ES-SDM meta-analysis of studies on the brain response to fearful faces with the results of a pooled analysis of the original individual data. The results showed that ES-SDM is a valid and reliable coordinate-based method, whose performance might be additionally increased by including statistical parametric maps. We anticipate that ES-SDM will be a helpful tool for researchers in the fields of psychiatry, neurology and allied disciplines."}, {"Title": "[Use of joint crisis plans in psychiatric hospitals in Germany: results of a nationwide survey].", "Abstract": "Joint crisis plans in psychiatry are consensus-oriented instruments for patients to state their will in case of a crisis.

The number of completed joint crisis plans was low (median 2.7/year per clinic). The demand did not increase according to a majority of the hospitals. The main reason for hospitals to abstain from joint crisis plans was low demand. Hospitals providing the option of joint crisis plans reported positive experiences.\nA theoretical offer of joint crisis plans is widespread in German psychiatric hospitals.

The study measured symptom severity of depression and anxiety, in addition to quality of life pre- and posttreatment.\nThe study examined a new manualized treatment designed to help people anticipate a more positive future. The intervention consists of twenty 90-min group sessions administered twice a week over 10 weeks. The intervention was compared to depressed patients in the same clinic who enrolled in traditional cognitive-based group psychotherapy. Sixteen patients with MDD completed the FDT intervention as part of their outpatient treatment for depression. Seventeen patients with MDD participated in treatment as usual (TAU) cognitive-based group therapy. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Quality-of-Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire short form, self-report instruments were administered prior to and immediately after the completion of therapy.\nPatients treated with FDT demonstrated significant improvements in depression (P = 0.001), anxiety (P = 0.021) and quality of life (P = 0.035), and also reported high satisfaction with the therapy. Compared to the TAU group, patients treated with FDT showed greater improvements in depressive symptoms (P = 0.049).\nFDT may have the potential of becoming an additional treatment option for patients with MDD."}, {"Title": "[Responsible dealing with sexuality.

Currently only quetiapine and the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination are officially approved by the FDA against this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain relatively elusive. We performed a complete and systematic review to identify agents with definite positive or negative results concerning efficacy followed by a second systematic review to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of these agents. The comparison of properties suggests that the stronger predictors for antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression were norepinephrine alpha-1, dopamine D1 and histamine antagonism, followed by 5-HT2A, muscarinic and dopamine D2 and D3 antagonism and eventually by norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 5HT-1A agonism. Serotonin reuptake which constitutes the cornerstone in unipolar depression treatment does not seem to play a significant role for bipolar depression. Our exhaustive review is compatible with a complex model with multiple levels of interaction between the major neurotransmitter systems without a single target being either necessary or sufficient to elicit the antidepressant effect in bipolar depression."}, {"Title": "Assessing reliability, validity, and clinical utility of the BEST-Index in measuring living skills among forensic inpatients.", "Abstract": "The assessment of behavioral change as a result of inpatient treatment in forensic psychiatry is an important precondition for violence risk prediction in forensic psychiatry.

We hypothesized that because of psychiatry's lack of direct laboratory tests to distinguish dysfunction from normal-range distress, the context in which symptoms occur (eg, lack of imminent danger in a panic attack) is often essential to determining whether symptoms are caused by a dysfunction. If this is right, then the DSM diagnostic criteria should include many contextual criteria added to symptom syndromes to prevent dysfunction false positives. Despite their potential importance, such contextual criteria have not been previously reviewed. We, thus, systematically reviewed DSM categories to establish the extent of such uses of contextual criteria and created a typology of such uses.\nOf 111 sampled categories, 68 (61%) used context to prevent dysfunction false positives. Contextual criteria fell into 7 types: (1) exclusion of specific false-positive scenarios; (2) requiring that patients experience preconditions for normal responses (eg, requiring that individuals experience adequate sexual stimulation before being diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions); (3) requiring that symptoms be disproportionate relative to circumstances; (4) for childhood disorders, requiring that symptoms be developmentally inappropriate; (5) requiring that symptoms occur in multiple contexts; (6) requiring a substantial discrepancy between beliefs and reality; and (7) a residual category.\nMost DSM categories include contextual criteria to eliminate false-positive diagnoses and increase validity of descriptive criteria.

The novel combination of economic decision theory and neuroscience has the potential to better examine the interactions of social, psychological and neural factors with regard to motivational forces that may underlie psychiatric problems. Game theory will provide psychiatry with computationally principled measures of cognitive dysfunction. Given the relatively high heritability of these measures, they may contribute to improving phenotypic definitions of psychiatric conditions. The game-theoretical concepts of optimal behavior will allow description of psychopathology as deviation from optimal functioning. Neuroeconomists have successfully used normative or near-normative models to interpret the function of neurotransmitters; these models have the potential to significantly improve neurotransmitter theories of psychiatric disorders.

In modern psychiatry, it is considered a culture-bound syndrome (CBS). This paper considers the formation and development of psychiatric conceptions of koro and related genital retraction syndromes from the 1890s to the present. It does so by examining the different explanations of koro based on shifting conceptions of mental illness, and considers the increased recognition of the role culture has to play in psychiatric concepts. Conceptions of culture (deriving from colonial psychiatry as well as from anthropology) actively shaped the ways in which psychiatrists conceptualized koro. Cases under consideration, additional to the first Dutch descriptions of koro, include the ways in which koro was identified in white western cases, and the 1967 Singaporean koro epidemic. Following a number of psychiatrists and psychologists who have addressed the same material, attention is also paid to the recent genital-theft panics in sub-Saharan Africa, considering the implications of the differences between koro and other genital-theft panics. Finally, the paper addresses the role played by koro in the development of the concept of CBSs, which was first presented in the DSM IV in 1994. This is explored against the backdrop of emerging ideas about culture and psychiatry from the late colonial period, especially in Africa, which are central to modern ideas about transcultural psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Kraepelin's concept of manic-depressive insanity: one hundred years later.", "Abstract": "Kraepelin's work is frequently cited and repeatedly interpreted as groundwork for the categorical classification of mental disorders.

At week 12, tolerability was rated as good or excellent by 90% and 83% of the clinicians and patients, respectively.\nOur results suggest that pregabalin is an efficacious and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal."}, {"Title": "Examining the interpersonal model of binge eating and loss of control over eating in women.", "Abstract": "This study examined the interpersonal model of binge eating (Wilfley et al., Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Group, New York: Basic Books, 2000; Wilfley et al., Arch Gen Psychiatry, 8, 713-721, 2002; Elliott et al., Behav Res Ther, 48, 424-428, 2010) which posits that interpersonal problems lead to negative affect which, in turn, triggers disordered eating.\nThe model was tested using data from 350 women obtained via an internet assessment method. Analyses examined direct and indirect effects, via depressive/negative affect, of interpersonal problems, including domains of affiliation and dominance on loss of control over eating, binge eating, and eating disorder psychopathology.\nInterpersonal problems showed significant effects on binge eating and eating disorder psychopathology that were statistically mediated by depressive/negative affect. Affiliation showed significant effects on binge eating and eating disorder psychopathology with low affiliation effects statistically mediated by depressive/negative affect and high affiliation effects independent of depressive/negative affect.\nThese findings support the interpersonal model of binge eating and highlight the importance of examining specific types of interpersonal problems in understanding heterogeneity of individuals with eating disorder psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Evolutionary psychiatry and depression: testing two hypotheses.", "Abstract": "In the last few decades, there has been a genuine 'adaptive turn' in psychiatry, resulting in evolutionary accounts for an increasing number of psychopathologies. In this paper, I explore the advantages and problems with the two main evolutionary approaches to depression, namely the mismatch and persistence accounts. I will argue that while both evolutionary theories of depression might provide some helpful perspectives, the accounts also harbor significant flaws that might question their authority and usefulness as explanations."}, {"Title": "[Schizophrenic disorders. The development of immunological concepts and therapy in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Immunological changes reported in patients with schizophrenia may play an aetiological role in these disorders. Further, immunomodulatory medications can influence the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Antipsychotic agents such as clozapine may act therapeutically through the modulation of the immune system and also lead to side effects in that domain.Both the understanding and factual foundations of immunological concepts and immunological therapies of schizophrenic disorders have changed throughout the history of medicine. These are important considerations in psychiatry where diagnostic, nosological and therapeutic complexity is the norm. The article exemplarily presents publications of the psychiatrists such as Julius Wagner von Jauregg, Lewis Campbell Bruce and Friedrich Ostmann as well as neuropathologist Hermann Lehmann-Facius and haematologist William Dameshek."}, {"Title": "No-show at a forensic psychiatric outpatient clinic: risk factors and reasons.", "Abstract": "Nonattendance for and late cancellations of scheduled appointments, that is no-show, is a well-known phenomenon in psychiatric outpatient clinics. Research on the topic of no-show for initial and consecutive appointments in the field of forensic psychiatry is scarce. This study therefore aims to determine the prevalence and causes of no-show and to explore reasons for nonattendance. The study was carried out in an outpatient clinic in northern Netherlands. Telephone interviews were administered to 27 no-show clients, 84 follow-up no-show clients, and 41 attendees of 18 years and older. A no-show rate of 24.9% and a follow-up no-show rate of 9.8% was found. The majority of appointments missed were in the beginning phase of clinic contact. No-show clients were younger than their attending counterparts and more often dropped out from clinic contact. Also, less family social support was experienced by nonattendees. Reasons for nonattendance were having forgotten about appointment and work commitments."}, {"Title": "Magnetic resonance imaging predictors of treatment response in first-episode schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Identifying neurobiological predictors of response to antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia is a critical goal of translational psychiatry. Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between indices of brain structure and treatment response in the context of a controlled clinical trial. In this study, we sought to identify magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of the brain that predict treatment response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia. Structural MR imaging scans were acquired in 39 patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia with minimal or no prior exposure to antipsychotics participating in a double-blind 16-week clinical trial comparing the efficacy of risperidone vs olanzapine. Twenty-five patients were classified as responders by meeting operationally defined treatment response criteria on 2 consecutive study visits. Fourteen patients never responded to antipsychotic medication at any point during the clinical trial. MR imaging scans were also acquired in 45 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Cortical pattern matching methods were used to compare cortical thickness and asymmetry measures among groups. Statistical mapping results, confirmed by permutation testing, indicated that responders had greater cortical thickness in occipital regions and greater frontal cortical asymmetry compared with nonresponders. Moreover, among responders, greater thickness in temporal regions was associated with less time to respond. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity and cortical thickness may be more preserved in responders and that MR imaging may assist in the prediction of antipsychotic drug response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Pathways to psychiatric care in Bangladesh.", "Abstract": "The pattern of care seeking of psychiatric patients is important for service and policy issues. We conducted a study in 2008 in Bangladesh to find out the referral patterns, delays to reach mental health professional (MHP), diagnoses and treatment received before reaching psychiatric care etc.\nWe interviewed 50 consecutive new patients at the Psychiatry outpatient department of a tertiary hospital using the translated version of WHO pathway encounter form.\n84% of the patients we interviewed consulted other carers before they arrived at a MHP (2.5-3.1 steps were needed to reach MHP) and the range of delay was 8-78\u00a0weeks (indirect pathway). 16% of the patients came directly to a MHP with mean delay of 10.5\u00a0weeks from onset of mental illness (direct pathway). Among the patients who took the indirect pathway 44% first visited the Individual Private practitioners (PP), 22% first visited native or religious healers (NRH) and 12% rural medical practitioners (RMP). Patients reaching NRH or RMP made the least delay (2-2.5\u00a0weeks) and the shortest pathway to MHP (4.5-7\u00a0weeks). Most delay occurred from PP to MHP/General Hospital (22-31\u00a0weeks). About a third of patients were informed of diagnosis with poor concordance with the diagnosis made by MHP. 70 and 40% of patients with mental illness who attended General Hospital and PP were referred to MHP, respectively.\nIn the study we found four major pathways to mental health care in Bangladesh. They are direct pathway and referrals from PP, general hospitals and NRH. PP did not play a pivotal role in reaching MHP. Family members had a significant role on the decision to seek help from health service."}, {"Title": "Handedness, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and bulimic disorders.", "Abstract": "Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) research in psychiatry mostly excludes left-handed participants. We recruited left-handed people with a bulimic disorder and found that stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex may result in different effects in left- and right-handed people. This highlights the importance of handedness and cortex lateralisation for rTMS."}, {"Title": "'Missing persons': technical terminology as a barrier in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Several fields contributing to psychiatric advances, such as psychology, biology, and the humanities, have not yet met to produce a cohesive and integrated picture of human function and dysfunction, strength and vulnerability, etc., despite advances in their own areas. The failure may have its roots in a disagreement on what we mean by the human person and his or her relationship with the world, for which the incommensurate language of these disciplines may be partly to blame. Turns taken by western philosophy over the past 400 years may help to explain this. Language is such an important tool for psychiatrists, that examination of it may afford an insight into the reasons for divisions in the field. This paper aims to examine and compare psychologies (and hence psychiatries) derived from modern western philosophy, with similar concepts in other cultures, through the study of developments in terminology, in terms of the simplest facts about what it means to be human. Terminology used in mental health in western cultures is examined, with particular consideration of the term \"self\" as it has come to be used in a technical sense. Analogous terms from non-English speaking European languages, and some non-western cultures are studied. Western philosophy and psychology have evolved a meaning for the term \"self\" which is quite different from equivalent terms in non-western cultures. It is a moot point whether or not the development in western psychiatry of what are now technical terms to describe normal human experience has become needlessly obscure and ambiguous. It is not evident that this \"new\" language represents a genuine advance in understanding; it distances mental health professionals from those who are not familiar with it; and it makes transcultural dialogue difficult."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric and somatic health in relation to experience of parental divorce in childhood.", "Abstract": "The outcome of studies about the experience of parental divorce and its effects on mental and physical health differs, a result possibly caused by the use of different questionnaires and instruments, varying length of time since the divorce and divergent drop-out of participants.\nTo study the presence of psychiatric records and number of diagnosed somatic and mental healthcare visits in a group of young adults with childhood experience of parental divorce in comparison to a group without this experience.\nThe presence of records at public psychiatric clinics and 10 years of administrative healthcare data (somatic and mental) were checked for both groups.\nSignificantly more persons from the divorce group appeared in child and adolescent psychiatric care; this was most pronounced in females. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the number of persons seeking adult psychiatry or in the number of psychiatric consultations. Experience of parental divorce was not found to be an indicator of larger somatic health problems.\nExperience of parental divorce in childhood is not an indicator of adult psychiatric or somatic need of care."}, {"Title": "Routine outcome monitoring and feedback on physical or mental health status: evidence and theory.", "Abstract": "Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) is an important quality tool for measuring outcome of treatment in health care. The objective of this article is to summarize the evidence base that supports the provision of feedback on ROM results to (mental) health care professionals and patients. Also, some relevant theoretical aspects are considered.\nLiterature study (Pubmed, Medline, PsychINFO, Embase Psychiatry, 1975-2009) concerning randomized controlled trials (RTC's) of ROM and feedback on physical or mental health status of patients of all ages. Main search terms were routine outcome monitoring/measurement, feedback, health status measurement, patient reported outcome measures.\nIncluded were 52 RCT's concerning ROM and feedback with adult or older patients: of these seven RCT's were exclusively focused on physical health and 45 RCT's (also) on the mental health of the patient, although not always in a mental health care setting or as primary outcome measure. There appears to be a positive impact of ROM on diagnosis and monitoring of treatment, and on communication between patient and therapist. Other results were less clear. There were no published RCT's on this topic with children or adolescents.\nROM appears especially effective for the monitoring of patients who are not doing well in therapy. Further research into this topic and the clinical-and cost-effectiveness of ROM is recommended, especially in mental health care for both adults and children. Also, more theory-driven research is needed with relevant conceptualizations such as Feedback Intervention Theory, Therapeutic Assessment."}, {"Title": "Shell shock, trauma, and the First World War: the making of a diagnosis and its histories.", "Abstract": "During the First World War, thousands of soldiers were treated for \"shell shock,\" a condition which encompassed a range of physical and psychological symptoms. Shell shock has most often been located within a \"genealogy of trauma,\" and identified as an important marker in the gradual recognition of the psychological afflictions caused by combat. In recent years, shell shock has increasingly been viewed as a powerful emblem of the suffering of war. This article, which focuses on Britain, extends scholarly analyses which question characterizations of shell shock as an early form of post-traumatic stress disorder. It also considers some of the methodological problems raised by recasting shell shock as a wartime medical construction rather than an essentially timeless manifestation of trauma. It argues that shell shock must be analyzed as a diagnosis shaped by a specific set of contemporary concerns, knowledges, and practices. Such an analysis challenges accepted understandings of what shell shock \"meant\" in the First World War, and also offers new perspectives on the role of shell shock in shaping the emergence of psychology and psychiatry in the early part of the twentieth century. The article also considers what relation, if any, might exist between intellectual and other histories, literary approaches, and perceptions of trauma as timeless and unchanging."}, {"Title": "[In memory of the life and work of Helmut Rennert (1920-1994)].", "Abstract": "To mark the 90th anniversary of the birth of Helmut Rennert (1920-1994) in 2010 an overview of his biography and scientific work will be given to highlight his important contribution to the classification of psychoses. He rose to prominence above all with his model of the universal genesis of endogenous psychosis in which Rennert advocated the idea of unitary psychosis. The lively discussion regarding nosological, categorical, syndromatological and dimensional approaches for the further development of classification systems of mental disorders illustrates the prevailing relevance of his ideas. For the first time it was possible to access the archival sources in the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the University of Halle (Saale) for this purpose. In addition, the personal experiences of former staff members and representatives in the field of psychiatry assisted in compiling a comprehensive picture of Rennert as a teacher and colleague who contributed a great deal to the development of psychiatry in East Germany."}, {"Title": "A screening tool to medically clear psychiatric patients in the emergency department.", "Abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently called on to medically clear patients presenting with a psychiatric complaint. There is limited guidance on how to conduct this clearance.\nThis study evaluated the usefulness of a screening tool in ruling out serious organic disease in emergency department (ED) patients with psychiatric complaints.\nA retrospective chart review was performed on 500 consecutive adult ED patients with primarily psychiatric complaints who were evaluated using the tool, and then subsequently transferred to a psychiatric crisis center. The screening tool consists of a series of historical and physical examination criteria derived from the literature intended to identify patients who have a psychiatric manifestation of an organic disease. The physician filled out the screening form and if the proper conditions were met, the patient was transferred to Psychiatry without further laboratory or imaging studies. We reviewed the charts of both the ED visit and the psychiatric crisis center visit to determine if any of the patients required further medical treatment or a medical admission rather than a psychiatric admission.\nFive hundred consecutive ED patient charts were reviewed. Fifteen of the corresponding charts from the psychiatric center could not be found. Of the remaining 485 patients, 6 patients were sent back to the ED for further evaluation. After laboratory work and imaging, none of these 6 patients required more than an outpatient prescription.\nThe screening tool proved useful in determining if a psychiatric patient needed further medical evaluation beyond a history and physical examination before transfer for a psychiatric evaluation."}]
