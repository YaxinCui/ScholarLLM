[{"Title": "Pharmacological aspects of antiseizure medications: From basic mechanisms to clinical considerations of drug interactions and use of therapeutic drug monitoring.", "Abstract": "Antiseizure medications (ASMs) are the cornerstone of treatment for patients with epilepsy. Several new ASMs have recently been introduced to the market, making it possible to better tailor the treatment of epilepsy, as well as other indications (psychiatry and pain disorders). For this group of drugs there are numerous pharmacological challenges, and updated knowledge on their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties is, therefore, crucial for an optimal treatment outcome. This review focuses on educational approaches to the following learning outcomes as described by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE): To demonstrate knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug interactions with ASMs and with concomitant medications, and appropriate monitoring of ASM serum levels (therapeutic drug monitoring, TDM). Basic principles in pharmacology, pharmacokinetic variability, and clinically relevant approaches to manage drug interactions are discussed. Furthermore, recent improvements in analytical technology and sampling are described. Future directions point to the combined implementation of TDM with genetic panels for proper diagnosis, pharmacogenetic tests where relevant, and the use of biochemical markers that will all contribute to personalized treatment. These approaches are clinically relevant for an optimal treatment outcome with ASMs in various patient groups."}, {"Title": "The Importance of Sibling Relationships for Children in Foster Care.", "Abstract": "There are approximately 500,000 children in the foster care system in the United States of America. With exposure to chronic and cumulative trauma, they constitute a population with an increased risk of developing mental health concerns and adverse outcomes in later life, including contact with the forensic system. Legislative frameworks that have been developed to facilitate improved outcomes are outlined, although these vary between states, and the focus is often on the parental relationship. Several studies have emphasized the importance of sibling relationships and that placing siblings in the same foster home is associated with higher rates of placement stability, reunification, adoption and guardianship, and fostering positive sibling relations. The multifaceted role of the clinician in promoting recovery from trauma, enhancing resiliency, and thoughtfully prescribing and advocating for familial relationships is discussed."}, {"Title": "Theory Driven Analysis of Natural Language Processing Measures of Thought Disorder using Generative Language Modeling.", "Abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) holds promise to transform psychiatric research and practice. A pertinent example is the success of NLP in automatic detection of speech disorganization in formal thought disorder (FTD). However, we lack an understanding of what precisely common NLP metrics measure and how they relate to theoretical accounts of FTD. We propose tackling these questions by using deep generative language models to simulate FTD-like narratives by perturbing computational parameters instantiating theory-based mechanisms of FTD.\nWe simulated FTD-like narratives using GPT-2 by either increasing word selection stochasticity or limiting the model's memory span. We then examined the sensitivity of common NLP measures of derailment (semantic distance between consecutive words or sentences) and 'tangentiality' (how quickly meaning drifts away from the topic) in detecting, and dissociating, the two underlying impairments.\nBoth parameters led to narratives characterized by greater semantic distance between consecutive sentences. Conversely, semantic distance between words was increased by increasing stochasticity, but decreased by limiting memory span. An NLP measure of tangentiality was uniquely predicted by limited memory span. The effects of limited memory span were non-monotonic, in that 'forgetting' the global context resulted in sentences that were semantically closer to their local, intermediate, context. Finally, different methods for encoding the meaning of sentences varied dramatically in performance.\nThis work validates a simulation-based approach as a valuable tool for hypothesis generation and mechanistic analysis of NLP markers in psychiatry. To facilitate dissemination of this approach, we accompany the paper with a hands-on Python tutorial."}, {"Title": "Collaborating With Service Users to Select Psychiatry Residents Committed to Health Equity and Social Justice.", "Abstract": "Advocates have called for health services to be delivered equitably to all. Academic psychiatry must play a role in this work, given its history of creating and perpetuating the marginalization of people experiencing mental health issues. While medical educators have started teaching concepts such as structural competency and cultural safety, careful consideration of who enters the medical workforce and what values they bring is also important.\nThe authors report on the first 5 years (2016-2021) of a collaboration with individuals who have used mental health or addiction services or identify as having lived experiences of mental health and/or substance use issues (i.e., service users) to select residents to the general adult psychiatry residency program at the University of Toronto who are committed to working toward health equity and social justice and who bring diverse personal, academic, and community-based experiences. Starting in 2016, a working group of service users and faculty iteratively refined the selection process to add personal letter and interview day writing sample prompts centered on social justice and advocacy.\nThe working group, coled by service users since 2019, defined the problem (lack of attention to health equity and social justice in resident selection) and codesigned the solution by revising writing prompts used in the selection process and their assessment rubrics to emphasize these missing areas. Further, service users directly participated in the implementation by reviewing candidates' personal letters and interview day writing samples alongside faculty and residents. This work serves as an example of meaningful service user engagement in action.\nTo ensure the needs of service users are prioritized, future work must aim for long-term institutional commitment to strengthen service user involvement and power sharing with service user communities in resident selection and at other points along the medical education pathway."}, {"Title": "Artificial Intelligence Can Generate Fraudulent but Authentic-Looking Scientific Medical Articles: Pandora's Box Has Been Opened.", "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced substantially in recent years, transforming many industries and improving the way people live and work. In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers.\nThis proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles.\nThe study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references.\nThe study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing."}, {"Title": "A natural language processing approach reveals first-person pronoun usage and non-fluency as markers of therapeutic alliance in psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "It remains elusive what language markers derived from psychotherapy sessions are indicative of therapeutic alliance, limiting our capacity to assess and provide feedback on the trusting quality of the patient-clinician relationship. To address this critical knowledge gap, we leveraged feature extraction methods from natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of artificial intelligence, to quantify pronoun and non-fluency language markers that are relevant for communicative and emotional aspects of therapeutic relationships. From twenty-eight transcripts of non-manualized psychotherapy sessions recorded in outpatient clinics, we identified therapists' first-person pronoun usage frequency and patients' speech transition marking relaxed interaction style as potential metrics of alliance. Behavioral data from patients who played an economic game that measures social exchange (i.e. trust game) suggested that therapists' first-person pronoun usage may influence alliance ratings through their diminished trusting behavior toward therapists. Together, this work supports that communicative language features in patient-therapist dialogues could be markers of alliance."}, {"Title": "Service Use as a Predictor of Change in Mental Health Problems Among Children: A Prospective Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial interventions for children's mental health problems typically differ in several characteristics, such as therapist training, content, motivation for treatment, and extent of comorbid conditions among patients, depending on whether the interventions take place in clinical research studies or in real-life settings. Accordingly, the effects found in research studies may not be generalizable to typical service provision. The authors sought to examine the potential associations between receiving usual care and later psychiatric symptoms, impairment, and potential improvements in social skills.\nParticipants (N=996) drawn from the 2003-2004 birth cohorts in Trondheim, Norway, included children who received usual care and those who did not receive any services (as a control group). The children were assessed with biennial clinical interviews from ages 4 to 14 years. Random intercept, cross-lagged panel models were combined with propensity scoring to adjust for measured time-varying and all unmeasured time-invariant confounders.\nUsual care was not associated with alterations in social skills or impairment due to mental health problems. Similarly, usual care provided to 7- to 12-year-olds did not predict changes in the number of symptoms of psychiatric disorders. However, usual care received at ages 0-4 and 5-6 predicted a slight increase in the number of psychiatric symptoms 2 years later. No significant associations between usual care and improved outcomes were detected.\nThese observational findings reveal the need to implement existing evidence-based approaches in usual care and to develop evidence-based approaches to the complex cases often seen in specialty and community care systems."}, {"Title": "Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of online interpretation bias intervention on stress reactivity in the children of parents with depression: the CoCo study.", "Abstract": "Current preventive interventions for the children of parents with depression demonstrate modest effects on depression incidence. This may be because existing interventions tend to comprise general psychotherapeutic tools, rather than targeting the specific mechanisms underlying familial transmission. Improved theoretical models of familial transmission could enhance the development of targeted interventions. Although existing models assume that cognitive and biological vulnerability factors influence one another, the precise mechanisms are unknown. This project is the first to experimentally test whether negative interpretation bias has an impact on cortisol response in children of parents with depression. This study protocol reports a randomised controlled trial of an interpretation bias intervention which aims to shift participants' interpretation bias in a more positive direction and thereby alter their stress response.\nChildren aged 10-14\u00a0years who have i) one parent with a current or previous depression diagnosis, with at least one episode occurring during the child's lifetime and ii) do not have a current or previous psychiatric diagnosis themselves, will be assigned to one of two conditions: an interpretation bias intervention (n\u2009=\u200950) or a structurally similar placebo intervention (n\u2009=\u200950). The interpretation bias intervention consists of a short lab-based cognitive reappraisal of interpretations training, a four-week app-based Cognitive Bias Modification of Interpretations intervention and interpretation bias specific if-then plans. Interpretation bias will be assessed before and after the intervention using the Scrambled Sentences Task. The effect of the intervention on participants' stress response will be assessed by salivary cortisol collected at five different time points: from immediately before until 45\u00a0min after administering the Trier Social Stressor Test for Children. Stress reactivity will be measured via baseline to peak cortisol and stress recovery will be measured via the 45\u00a0min cortisol marker. We hypothesise that children who participate in the interpretation bias intervention will display a positive shift in interpretation bias and this, in turn, will alter their stress response. Children who receive the placebo intervention are expected to show a smaller positive shift in interpretation bias and stress reactivity.\nThe findings of the present study will contribute to models of familial depression transmission as well as informing preventive interventions. If training a more positive interpretation bias subsequently alters participants' stress response, then incorporating such tools may increase the efficacy of existing preventive interventions.\nDeutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS00028842.

Clinical trials for both MDMA-assisted and psilocybin-assisted therapies have shown to be highly efficacious for post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression. Recent research trials for psychedelic-assisted therapies (PAT) have demonstrated that although they are resource-intensive, their effects are rapid-acting, durable and cost-effective. These results have generated enthusiasm among researchers seeking to investigate psychedelic therapies in active-duty service members of the US military, particularly those with treatment refractory mental health conditions. At the same time, psychedelics remain in early stages of clinical investigation, have not yet achieved regulatory approval for general clinical use and may confer unique psychological and neurobiological effects that could raise novel ethical considerations when treating active-duty service members. Should psychedelics achieve regulatory approval, military relevant considerations may include issues of access to these treatments, appropriate procedures for informed consent, confidentiality standards, and possible unanticipated mental health risks and other psychological sequelae. A service member's deployability, as well as their ability to return to full military duty following PAT, may also be of unique concern. The authors argue that MDMA-assisted therapy currently represents a promising treatment that should be more rapidly investigated as a clinical therapy for service members while still taking a measured approach that accounts for the many military-specific uncertainties that remain."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale among people with epilepsy in Jimma University Medical Center, Neurology Clinic, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020: cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "It is crucial to use clinically validated instruments to detect and treat depression in people with epilepsy.

Diagnoses were retained by 92.6% of patients at their first discharge diagnosis, ranging from 100% for disorders of psychological development to 16.3% for unspecified mental disorders. About 33.9% of diagnostic conversions were to bipolar disorder in patients having inconsistent diagnoses. However, among rehospitalizations, the diagnostic stability notably dropped to 71.3%. For rehospitalizations, mood disorders and schizophrenia spectrum disorders were relatively stable diagnoses categories, with 72.6% to 76.7% of patients receiving the same diagnosis, although results of specified diagnoses within these categories ranged from 5.9% to 91.0%.

Feasibility of intensive longitudinal case studies in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Physical exercise interventions improve quality of life in people with mental disorders and improve abstinence and cravings in substance use disorders patients in both the short term and long term. In people with mental illness, physical exercise interventions significantly reduce psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia and symptoms of anxiety. For forensic psychiatry, there is little empirical evidence supporting mental health-enhancing effects of physical exercise interventions. Interventional studies in forensic psychiatry deal mainly with three problems: heterogeneity of the individuals, a small sample size, and a low compliance rate. Intensive longitudinal case studies could be a suitable approach to address these methodological challenges in forensic psychiatry. This study uses an intensive longitudinal design to determine whether forensic psychiatric patients are content to complete several data assessments per day over the course of several weeks. The feasibility of this approach is operationalized by the compliance rate. Additionally, single-case studies examine the effects of sports therapy (ST) on momentary affective states (energetic arousal, valence, and calmness). The results of these case studies reveal one aspect of feasibility and offer insights into the effects of forensic psychiatric ST on the affective states among patients with different conditions. The patients' momentary affective states were recorded before (PRE), after (POST) and 1 h after (FoUp1h) ST by questionnaires. Ten individuals (M<sub>age</sub>\u2009=\u200931.7, SD\u2009=\u200911.94; 60% male) participated in the study. A total of 130 questionnaires were completed. To perform the single-case studies, data of three patients were considered. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed for the individual affective states to test for main effects of ST. Due to the results, ST has no significant effect on none of the three affect dimensions.

It is known from the literature that rates of coercive measures differ greatly between hospitals within a country. Studies on that topic also showed large Hawthorne effects. Therefore, it is important to collect valid baseline data for the comparison of similar wards and controlling for observer effects.\nFifty five psychiatric wards in Germany treating voluntary and involuntary patients were randomly allocated to an intervention or a waiting list condition in matched pairs. As part of the randomized controlled trial, they completed a baseline survey. We collected data on admissions, occupied beds, involuntarily admitted cases, main diagnoses, the number and duration of coercive measures, assaults and staffing levels. We applied the PreVCo Rating Tool for each ward. The PreVCo Rating Tool is a fidelity rating, measuring the degree of implementation of 12 guideline-linked recommendations on Likert scales with a range of 0-135 points covering the main elements of the guidelines. Aggregated data on the ward level is provided, with no patient data provided. We performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank-test to compare intervention group and waiting list control group at baseline and to assess the success of randomization.\nThe participating wards had an average of 19.9% involuntarily admitted cases and a median 19 coercive measures per month (1 coercive measure per occupied bed, 0.5 per admission). The intervention group and waiting list group were not significantly different in these measurements. There were 6.0 assaults per month on average (0.3 assaults per occupied bed and 0.1 per admission). The PreVCo Rating Tool for guideline fidelity varied between 28 and 106 points.

The lack of consensus regarding the theoretical grounds of psychiatry as a discipline has its epicenter in the discussion about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). A growing number of academics considers the manual broken and a growing number of patients voice concern. Despite the huge body of critique, 90% of Randomized Trials are based on DSM definitions of mental disorder. Therefore, the question regarding the ontology of mental disorder remains: what is a mental disorder, exactly?\nWe aim to identify ontologies that live among patients and clinicians, evaluate the degree of consistency and coherence between clinician and patient views and contribute to the establishment of a novel ontological paradigm of mental disorder that is aligned with patients' and clinicians' perspectives.\nEighty participants (clinicians/patients/clinicians with lived experience) were interviewed using a semi-structured interview, exploring their ideas on the ontology of mental disorder. This question was approached from different angles which led to comprising the interview schedule into different topics: \"concept of disorder,\" \"representation by DSM,\" \"what is treated,\" \"what is recovered,\" and \"the right outcome measure.\" Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive Thematic Analysis.\nFrom all subthemes and main themes, a typology was constructed in which six, not necessarily mutually exclusive, ontological domains were identified: mental disorder as (1) disease, (2) functional impairment, (3) loss of adaptation, (4) existential problem, (5) highly subjective phenomenon, and (6) deviation from social norms. Common ground for the sample groups was that mental disorder is about functional impairment. Although about a fourth of sample clinicians holds an ontological concept of disease, only a small percentage of patients and none of the clinicians with lived experience adhered to an ontological concept of disease. The sample clinicians most often understand mental disorder to be a highly subjective phenomenon, and individuals with lived experience (patients and clinicians) most often understand mental (dis)order to be adaptational in nature: an (im)balance of burden in relation to strengths, skills, and recourses.\nThe ontological palette is more diverse than what is taught about mental disorder in dominant scientific and educational discourse. There is a need to diversify the current, dominant ontology and make room for other ontologies. Investment is required in the development, elaboration and coming of age of these alternative ontologies, allowing them to reach their full potential and act as drivers of a landscape of promising novel scientific and clinical approaches."}, {"Title": "COVID-19 psychosis versus psychosis due to cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum (CLOCC): A case report and review.", "Abstract": "Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum syndrome (CLOCC) is an inflammatory disorder caused by various etiologies such as medications, malignancies, seizure, metabolic abnormalities, and infections, especially COVID-19.

Studies selected needed to have a qualitative design reporting on the war and conflict experiences of participants aged 18\u2009years or older from Arab countries in the Middle East. The review protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO (Ref: CRD42022314108). We identified 27 studies to be included in the final review. Four overarching themes were included in the meta-synthesis: War and conflict as life-defining experiences, experiences of hardship, coping with war and conflict, and positives out of a painful experience. Participants in the included studies reported significant distress and losing their sense of self, as well as resilience and positive growth. This review and meta-synthesis revealed the particular culturally informed experiences of individuals from Arab countries in the Middle East in processing their conflict experiences. These experiences highlight the need for culturally sensitive interventions for a population that has been under significant war-related stressors."}, {"Title": "Moving beyond the mother-child dyad: a commentary on Oppenheim et al. (2023).", "Abstract": "The research presented by Oppenheim et\u00a0al. (J Child Psychol Psychiatry, 2023) breaks important new ground by moving beyond the mother-child dyad and investigating the coparenting alliance between mothers and fathers of young children with autism. By integrating family systems thinking, developmental science, and research on autism spectrum disorder, this line of research is bound to improve our understanding of how family systems influence the social emotional development of young children with autism, how children's development and learning can be optimized, and how parents' marital relationship and mental health can be strengthened. Future research should investigate the coparenting alliance across a range of family functions aside from triadic play (e.g. caregiving, teaching, attachment, and behavior management) and move beyond nuclear family structures to capture the lived experiences of families within industrialized countries more adequately and embrace cultural differences across the globe."}, {"Title": "Adages, Aphorisms, and Proverbs in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy: Tools for Assessment and Treatment.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to examine how adages, aphorisms, and proverbs arise in psychiatric management and psychotherapy and how they might be used to assist assessment and treatment.\nA selective narrative literature review was conducted to supplement clinical observations and case vignettes.\nAdages appear to act as heuristic cognitive structures that serve as shortcuts for assessing situations, educating, persuading, aiding emotional self-regulation, and influencing courses of action. Some types of psychotherapy-such as dialectical behavior therapy, rational emotive behavior therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy-and self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous routinely utilize adages. The extent to and contexts in which adages spontaneously arise during general psychiatric and psychotherapeutic interactions have not been systematically studied. Clinicians can ascertain patients' favorite adages and appraise how patients respond to other sayings through exploratory questioning and by evoking responses to stock series of adages. As therapeutic tools, adages may help patients more easily conceptualize clinicians' interpretations and insights and may serve as encouraging affirmations.\nConsidering the potential utility of adages as therapeutic cognitive scaffolds, how patients and clinicians spontaneously use adages, how adages are used therapeutically, and the adages most suitable for particular patients in particular circumstances deserve further study. In psychiatric management and psychotherapy, clinicians' sensitivity to timing and patients' circumstances, culture, and receptivity may determine whether introducing a particular aphorism or proverb will have a positive impact or come across as a vapid and potentially harmful platitude."}, {"Title": "Prosodic signatures of ASD severity and developmental delay in preschoolers.", "Abstract": "Atypical prosody in speech production is a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) that can impact everyday life communication. Because the ability to modulate prosody develops around the age of speech acquisition, it might be affected by ASD symptoms and developmental delays that emerge at the same period. Here, we investigated the existence of a prosodic signature of developmental level and ASD symptom severity in a sample of 74 autistic preschoolers. We first developed an original diarization pipeline to extract preschoolers' vocalizations from recordings of naturalistic social interactions. Using this novel approach, we then found a robust voice quality signature of ASD developmental difficulties in preschoolers. Furthermore, some prosodic measures were associated with one year later outcome in participants who had not acquired speech yet. Altogether, our results highlight the potential benefits of automatized diarization algorithms and prosodic metrics for digital phenotyping in psychiatry, helping clinicians establish early diagnosis and prognosis."}, {"Title": "Medical students' attitude towards psychiatry: a comparison of past and present.", "Abstract": "Attitude to psychiatry influences motivation for medical students to successfully achieve in studying psychiatry. With a new generation of students, it would be interesting to investigate how attitudes have changed. This study aimed to compare the attitude of fifth-year medical students toward psychiatry in recent and in the past 24\u00a0years. Two samples of fifth-year medical students at Chiang Mai University completed the 30-item attitude to psychiatry (ATP-30); 118 students completed it in 1996, whereas 242 medical students completed it in 2019. Rasch analysis was employed for examining the differences between the total score and individual item scores between the two groups. The total score of ATP in the 2019 group was significantly higher than that in the 1996 group. After misfitting individuals and biased items were removed, only 15 items were valid and useful for a comparison. Of 15 items, 11 were found highly significantly different between two groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Negatively worded items, e.g., no strong evidence indicating effectiveness, became easier to score items (increased positive attitude) whereas some positively worded items, e.g., I would like to be a psychiatrist. Nine items, became more difficult (less positive attitude) comparing between 1996 and 2019. In a comparison between the two methods using the traditional t-test and Rasch analysis, only 5 of 30 items (16.7%) agreed with each other. The overall attitude to psychiatry was significantly higher at the present compared with that in the past. Most items did not differ between the two times. Further studies regarding improving the attitude scale using item response theory such as Rasch should be encouraged."}, {"Title": "Tackling childbirth-related intrusive memories with a single-session behavioural intervention involving a visuospatial task: protocol for a single-blind, waitlist-controlled randomised trial.", "Abstract": "Approximately 12.3% of mothers experience childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms (CB-PTSS). However, evidence-based interventions to treat CB-PTSS are lacking. Intrusive memories (IM), a key CB-PTSS, are distressing and can trigger other PTSS by reliving the traumatic event. Emerging evidence shows that a behavioural intervention involving a visuospatial task (BI-VT) can reduce the number of IM and PTSS, supposedly by interfering with the reconsolidation of the trauma memory. This study aims to test the efficacy of a single-session BI-VT targeting IM to reduce the number of childbirth-related (CB-)IM and PTSS, in comparison to a waitlist control group (WCG).\nIn this multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial being undertaken at one regional and one university hospital in Switzerland, 60 participants will be allocated to the Immediate Intervention Group (IIG), receiving the immediate intervention on day 15, and 60 participants to the WCG receiving the delayed intervention on day 30. All participants will report their CB-IM during the 2\u2009weeks preimmediate and postimmediate intervention in diaries. The IIG will additionally report their CB-IM over weeks 5 and 6 postimmediate intervention. Self-report questionnaires will assess CB-PTSS at 2\u2009weeks preimmediate and postimmediate intervention in both groups, and at 6\u2009weeks postimmediate intervention in the IIG. A feedback questionnaire will evaluate the intervention acceptability. The primary outcome will be group differences in the number of CB-IM between the 2\u2009weeks preimmediate and postimmediate intervention. Secondary outcomes will be CB-PTSS at 2 and 6\u2009weeks postimmediate intervention, the number of CB-IM at weeks 5 and 6 postimmediate intervention, and intervention acceptability.\nEthical approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Canton of Vaud (study number 202200652). Participants will provide an informed consent before study participation. Results will be presented in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences.\nNCT05381155."}, {"Title": "Altered responsiveness to glutamatergic modulation by MK-801 and to repeated stress of immune challenge in female dopamine transporter knockout rats.", "Abstract": "Chronic stress is a key factor in psychiatric and neurological disorders often worsening disease symptoms. In this study, a unique animal model, the dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rat exhibiting behavioral signs resembling those occurring in mania, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder was used. We have tested the hypothesis that the hyperdopaminergic state in DAT-KO rats (i) modulates behavioral response to the NMDA antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) and (ii) leads to abnormal endocrine and immune activation under subchronic stress induced by an immune challenge. Glutamatergic modulation with MK-801 induced a different behavioral pattern. While the WT rats responded to MK-801 injection with a robust rise in their locomotor activity, the hyperactive DAT-KO rats exhibited reduced locomotion. Signs of chronic stress including increased basal corticosterone and aldosterone but blunted anxiety were demonstrated in rats lacking the DAT. Repeated injections of increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5\u202fdays) did not modify plasma prolactin concentrations which were however significantly lower in DAT-KO than in WT rats. Concentrations of plasma high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein were significantly higher in LPS-treated DAT-KO than in WT rats. The gene expression of interleukin-6 in the anterior pituitary increased under the stress induced by the immune challenge in the WT but not the DAT-KO rats. The most evident differences between the genotypes were revealed in the spleen. The splenic gene expression of interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and HMGB1 was lower and that of ferritin was higher in DAT-KO compared to WT rats. Obtained results emphasize the functional interaction of the endocrine and immune systems with monoamine and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mechanisms leading to behavioral alterations and psychiatric disorders associated with dopamine dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Focus Group Study of Medical Stakeholders to Inform the Development of Resilient Together for Dementia: Protocol for a Postdiagnosis Live Video Dyadic Resiliency Intervention.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) are increasingly common conditions that disrupt the lives of persons living with dementia and their spousal care partners. At the time of ADRD diagnoses, many couples experience challenges that produce emotional distress and relationship strain. At present, there are no interventions to address these challenges early after diagnoses to promote positive adjustment.\nThe study protocol described here is part of the first phase of a larger program of research that aims to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of Resilient Together for Dementia (RT-ADRD), a novel dyadic skills-based intervention to be delivered over live video early after diagnosis, with the goal of preventing chronic emotional distress. This study will elicit and systematically summarize perspectives of ADRD medical stakeholders to inform the procedures (eg, recruitment and screening methods, eligibility, timing of intervention, and intervention delivery) of the first iteration of RT-ADRD prior to pilot-testing.\nWe will recruit interdisciplinary medical stakeholders (eg, neurologists, social workers, neuropsychologists, care coordinators, and speech language pathologists) from academic medical center clinics in the departments treating persons living with dementia such as neurology, psychiatry, and geriatric medicine via flyers and word-of-mouth referrals from clinic directors and members of relevant organizations (eg, dementia care collaboratives and Alzheimer disease research centers). The participants will complete electronic screening and consent procedures. Consenting individuals will then participate in a 30- to 60-minute qualitative virtual focus group, held either via telephone or Zoom, using an interview guide designed to assess provider experiences with postdiagnosis clinical care and to gather feedback on the proposed RT-ADRD protocol. The participants will also have the opportunity to participate in an optional exit interview and web-based survey to gather additional feedback. Qualitative data will be analyzed using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach and the framework method for thematic synthesis. We will conduct approximately 6 focus groups with 4-6 individuals in each group (maximum N=30 individuals; until saturation is reached).\nData collection began in November 2022 and will continue through June 2023. We anticipate that the study will be completed by late 2023.\nThe results from this study will inform the procedures of the first live video RT-ADRD dyadic resiliency intervention focused on the prevention of chronic emotional and relational distress in couples shortly after ADRD diagnoses. Our study will allow us to gather comprehensive information from stakeholders on ways to best deliver our early prevention-focused intervention and gain detailed feedback on study procedures prior to further testing.\nDERR1-10.2196/45533."}, {"Title": "Masturbatory insanity: the history of an idea, revisited.", "Abstract": "In the eighteenth century, masturbation was extended from the moral to the medical sphere and conceptualized as being the cause of various deteriorative physical illnesses. In the nineteenth century, psychiatrists accepted that difficult to control masturbation was a feature of many mental disorders. They also believed that masturbation could play a casual role in a specific type of insanity with a distinctive natural history. In 1962, E.H. Hare published an article on the concept of masturbatory insanity that became an important explication of the masturbation and mental illness relationship in the history of psychiatry. Historical research published subsequent to Hare's article suggests several updates to his analysis. Hare did not note that the masturbation and mental illness relationship was promoted to the general public by quacks peddling quick cures. Hare emphasized psychiatrists' condemnatory language only, neglecting the aspiration of psychiatrists to treat disorders caused by excessive masturbation, not punish the sin of masturbation. Hare recognized the importance of hebephrenia and neurasthenia to this history but attributed the decline of masturbation related mental illness in part to the rejection of an irrational, unscientific hypotheses about masturbation's causal role. As an alternative, we suggest that before the causal role of masturbation was widely abandoned, the concepts of hebephrenia and neurasthenia gained a competitive advantage and became primary diagnoses for cases that once would have been conceptualized as masturbatory insanity."}, {"Title": "Evidence versus expectancy: the development of psilocybin therapy.", "Abstract": "Although the development of psilocybin therapy has come as a surprise to many, modern research with the drug has been ongoing for 25 years. Psilocybin therapy is composed of psilocybin dosing sessions embedded within a wider process of psychoeducation, psychological support and integration. Early phase clinical trial evidence is promising, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. However, masking probably fails and expectancy effects may be a part of the mechanism of change. Disambiguating between drug and expectancy effects is a necessary part of the development process, yet this is difficult if masking fails. Hitherto, masking and expectancy have not been routinely measured in psilocybin or other medication trials. Doing so represents an opportunity for research and may influence psychiatry more widely. In this opinion piece I summarise the clinical development process of psilocybin therapy thus far, discussing the hope, the hype, the challenges and the opportunities along the way."}, {"Title": "Revisiting the Use of Ulysses Contracts in Xenotransplantation.", "Abstract": "Xenotransplantation clinical trials may begin soon. A persistent risk of xenotransplantation, known for decades, is the possibility that a xenozoonotic infection could be transferred from a xenograft to its recipient and then to other human contacts. Because of this risk, guidelines and commentators have advocated for xenograft recipients to agree to either long-term or lifelong surveillance mechanisms.\nFor the past few decades, one solution that has been proposed to ensure that xenograft recipients will comply with surveillance protocols is the use of a heavily modified Ulysses contract, which we review.\nThese contracts are most often used in psychiatry, and their application to xenotransplantation has been espoused several times with minimal criticism.\nIn this article, we argue against the applicability of Ulysses contracts in xenotransplantation based upon (1) the telos of the advance directive that may not be applicable to this clinical context, (2) the suspect nature of enforcing Ulysses contracts in xenotransplantation, and (3) the ethical and regulatory hurdles that such enforcement would require. Although our focus is on the US regulatory landscape in preparation for clinical trials, there are applications globally."}, {"Title": "Lamotrigine in mood disorders: Flash survey on prescribing habits and blood tests practices.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring for lamotrigine is poorly documented in bipolar and depressive disorders. In order to evaluate its use among French psychiatrists, we explored prescribing habits, therapeutic monitoring and dosage adjustment of lamotrigine through a flash survey.\nA survey was broadcasted by the network of Expert Centers for Bipolar Disorder and Resistant Depression and by the Collegial of Psychiatry of the Assistance publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris. Questions concerned the frequency of prescribing depending on the mood disorder, the frequency of plasma levels, therapeutic monitoring, dosage adjustment and the limitation represented by dermatological risk.\nOf the 99 hospital psychiatrists who responded, 66 practiced in a university hospital and 62 for more than 5years. Overall, lamotrigine was more frequently prescribed for type 2 bipolar disorder (often: 51%) than for type 1 bipolar disorder (often: 22%). Dermatotoxicity was a major barrier to prescribing for 15% (n=13) of respondents. Nearly two-thirds of prescribers (61%, n=59) measured lamotrigine, of which 50% (n=29) systematically. However, 40% of them did not have an opinion on the optimal plasma concentration. In total, 22% (n=13) always adjusted the dosage according to the result. The first argument for dosage adjustment was clinical response for 80% (n=47) of prescribers, adverse effects for 17% (n=10) and plasma levels for only 4% (n=2).\nWhile many psychiatrists report using plasma dosage of lamotrigine, few use the plasma level result to adapt dosage and many have no opinion of the target values for plasma concentrations. This illustrates the lack of data and recommendations regarding the use of therapeutic pharmacological monitoring of lamotrigine in bipolar and depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "Opening the black box of hospitalizations in French high-secure psychiatric forensic units.", "Abstract": "Basic epidemiological data are rare concerning the activity of specialized forensic psychiatric facilities in France.

The aim of this study was to explore the heterogeneity of symptoms experienced by those with MDD to characterize phenotypic presentations.\nCross-sectional data (N\u202f=\u202f10,158) from a large telemental health platform were used to identify subtypes of MDD. Symptom data, gathered from both clinically-validated surveys and intake questions, were analyzed via polychoric correlations, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis.\nPrincipal components analysis (PCA) of baseline symptom data revealed 5 components, including anxious distress, core emotional, agitation/irritability, insomnia, and anergic/apathy components. PCA-based cluster analysis resulted in four MDD phenotypes, the largest of which was characterized by a prominent elevation on the anergic/apathy component, but also core emotional. The four clusters differed on demographic and clinical characteristics.\nThe primary limitation of this study is that the phenotypes uncovered are limited by the questions asked. These phenotypes will need to be cross validated with other samples, potentially expanded to include biological/genetic variables, and followed longitudinally.\nThe heterogeneity in MDD, as illustrated by the phenotypes in this sample, may explain the heterogeneity of treatment response in large-scale treatment trials. These phenotypes can be used to study varying rates of recovery following treatment and to develop clinical decision support tools and artificial intelligence algorithms. Strengths of this study include its size, breadth of included symptoms, and novel use of a telehealth platform."}, {"Title": "A systematic mapping review identifying key features of restraint research in inpatient pediatric psychiatry: A human rights perspective.", "Abstract": "Restraints, a highly regulated and contentious measure in pediatric psychiatry, have significant negative impacts on children. The application of international human rights standards, such as the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), has spurred global efforts to reduce or eliminate the use of restraints. However, a lack of consensus on definitions and terminology, as well as quality indicators in this field, hinders the ability to compare studies and evaluate interventions consistently.\nTo systematically map existing literature on restraints imposed upon children in inpatient pediatric psychiatry against a human rights perspective. Specifically, to identify and clarify gaps in literature in terms of publication trends, research approaches, study contexts, study participants, definitions and concepts being used, and legal aspects. These aspects are central to assess whether published research is contributing to achieve the CRPD and the CRC in terms of interpersonal, contextual, operational, and legal requirements of restraints.\nA systematic mapping review based on PRISMA guidelines was conducted, adopting a descriptive-configurative approach to map the distribution of available research and gaps in the literature about restraints in inpatient pediatric psychiatry. Six databases were searched for literature reviews and empirical studies of all study designs published between each database's inception and March 24, 2021, manually updated on November 25, 2022.\nThe search yielded 114 English-language publications, with a majority (76%) comprising quantitative studies that relied primarily on institutional records. Contextual information about the research setting was provided in less than half of the studies, and there was an unequal representation of the three main stakeholder groups: patients, family, and professionals. The studies also exhibited inconsistencies in the terms, definitions, and measurements used to examine restraints, with a general lack of attention given to human rights considerations. Additionally, all studies were conducted in high-income countries and mainly focused on intrinsic factors such as age and psychiatric diagnosis of the children, while contextual factors and the impact of restraints were not adequately explored. Legal and ethical aspects were largely absent, with only one study (0.9%) explicitly referencing human rights values.\nResearch on restraints of children in psychiatric units is increasing; however, inconsistent reporting practices hinder the understanding of the meaning and frequency of restraints. The exclusion of crucial features, such as the physical and social environment, facility type, and family involvement, indicates inadequate incorporation of the CRPD. Additionally, the lack of references to parents suggests insufficient consideration of the CRC. The shortage of quantitative studies focusing on factors beyond patient-related aspects, and the general absence of qualitative studies exploring the perspectives of children and adolescents regarding restraints, suggest that the social model of disability proposed by the CRPD has not yet fully penetrated the scientific research on this topic."}, {"Title": "The Need for Psychiatric Treatment among Polish Users of Psychoactive Substances Is Increasing: This and Other Results from the Newest PolDrugs Survey.", "Abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: PolDrugs is the largest Polish naturalistic nationwide survey to present basic demographic and epidemiological data that could potentially prevent harm from illicit substances intake in drugs users.

While this study generated much enthusiasm and high expectations in the field of biological psychiatry, subsequent studies produced equivocal results, leading to the test being rejected by the American Psychiatric Association. The scientific reasons leading to the rise and fall of the DST are assessed in this review, suggestions are provided as to how the original test can be improved, and its potential applications in clinical psychiatry are discussed. An improved, standardized, and validated version of the DST would be a biologically meaningful and useful biomarker in psychiatry, providing a tool for clinicians caring for depressed patients in the areas of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, and predicting the risk of suicide. Additionally, such a test could be a crucial part in the generation of biologically homogenous patient cohorts, necessary for the successful development of new psychotropic medications."}, {"Title": "Influence of Clinical Factors on the Quality of Life in Romanian People with Epilepsy-A Follow-Up Study in Real-Life Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the influence of various clinical factors on the quality of life perception of patients with epilepsy over a follow-up period in current clinical practice.\nThirty-five PWE evaluated via video-electro-encephalography in the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology in Brasov, Romania, were included, and the quality of life was assessed using the Romanian version of the QOLIE-31-P questionnaire.\nAt baseline, the mean age was 40.03 (\u00b114.63) years; the mean duration of epilepsy was 11.46 (\u00b112.90) years; the mean age at the first seizure was 28.57 (\u00b118.72); and the mean duration between evaluations was 23.46 (\u00b17.54) months.

In some countries, the initial limitation of E/PAS to cases of severe physical illness with poor prognosis in the short term has been overcome, as it was considered discriminatory; thus, E/PAS has also been made available to subjects suffering from mental disorders. This decision has raised significant ethical questions regarding the capacity and freedom of self-determination; the family, social, and economic contexts; the social consideration of the sense of dignity and the pressure on the judgment of one's personal value; the contextual therapeutic possibilities; the identification of figures involved in the validation and application; as well as the epistemological definitions of the clinical conditions in question. To these issues must be added the situation of legislative vacuum peculiar to different countries and the widespread lack of effective evaluation and control systems. Nonetheless, pessimistic indicators on global health status, availability of care and assistance, aging demographics, and socioeconomic levels suggest that there may be further pressure toward the expansion of such requests. The present paper aims to trace an international overview with the aim of providing ethical support to the debate on the matter.

However, there is still uncertainty about the prevalence of physical impairment in these patients and whether there is a link between physical and cognitive function. The aim was to assess the prevalence of physical impairment and investigate the association with cognition in patients assessed in a post-COVID-19 clinic. In this cross-sectional study, patients referred to an outpatient clinic \u2265 3 months after acute infection underwent screening of their physical and cognitive function as part of a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment. Physical function was assessed with the 6-Minute Walk Test, the 30 s Sit-to-Stand Test and by measuring handgrip strength. Cognitive function was assessed with the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry and the Trail Making Test-Part B. Physical impairment was tested by comparing the patients' performance to normative and expected values. Association with cognition was investigated using correlation analyses and the possible explanatory variables regarding physical function were assessed using regression analyses. In total, we included 292 patients, the mean age was 52 (\u00b115) years, 56% were women and 50% had been hospitalised during an acute COVID-19 infection. The prevalence of physical impairment ranged from 23% in functional exercise capacity to 59% in lower extremity muscle strength and function. There was no greater risk of physical impairment in previously hospitalised compared with the non-hospitalised patients. There was a weak to moderate association between physical and cognitive function. The cognitive test scores had statistically significant prediction value for all three outcomes of physical function. In conclusion, physical impairments were prevalent amongst patients assessed for post-COVID-19 condition regardless of their hospitalisation status and these were associated with more cognitive dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Genetic Predictors of Antipsychotic Efflux Impairment via Blood-Brain Barrier: Role of Transport Proteins.", "Abstract": "Antipsychotic (AP)-induced adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a current problem of biological and clinical psychiatry. Despite the development of new generations of APs, the problem of AP-induced ADRs has not been solved and continues to be actively studied. One of the important mechanisms for the development of AP-induced ADRs is a genetically-determined impairment of AP efflux across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We present a narrative review of publications in databases (PubMed, Springer, Scopus, Web of Science E-Library) and online resources: The Human Protein Atlas; GeneCards: The Human Gene Database; US National Library of Medicine; SNPedia; OMIM Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man; The PharmGKB. The role of 15 transport proteins involved in the efflux of drugs and other xenobiotics across cell membranes (P-gp, TAP1, TAP2, MDR3, BSEP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, MRP6, MRP7, MRP8, MRP9, BCRP) was analyzed. The important role of three transporter proteins (P-gp, BCRP, MRP1) in the efflux of APs through the BBB was shown, as well as the association of the functional activity and expression of these transport proteins with low-functional and non-functional single nucleotide variants (SNVs)/polymorphisms of the <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>ABCC1</i> genes, encoding these transport proteins, respectively, in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs). The authors propose a new pharmacogenetic panel \"Transporter protein (PT)-Antipsychotic (AP) Pharmacogenetic test (PGx)\" (PTAP-PGx), which allows the evaluation of the cumulative contribution of the studied genetic biomarkers of the impairment of AP efflux through the BBB. The authors also propose a riskometer for PTAP-PGx and a decision-making algorithm for psychiatrists. Conclusions: Understanding the role of the transportation of impaired APs across the BBB and the use of genetic biomarkers for its disruption may make it possible to reduce the frequency and severity of AP-induced ADRs, since this risk can be partially modified by the personalized selection of APs and their dosing rates, taking into account the genetic predisposition of the patient with SSD."}, {"Title": "The Cytokine, Chemokine, and Growth Factor Network of Prenatal Depression.", "Abstract": "Neuro-immune pathways are engaged in antenatal and postpartum depression.\nTo determine if immune profiles influence the severity of prenatal depression above and beyond the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACE), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and current psychological stressors.\nUsing the Bio-Plex Pro human cytokine 27-plex test kit, we assayed M1 macrophage, T helper (Th)-1, Th-2, Th-17, growth factor, chemokine, and T cell growth immune profiles as well as indicators of the immune inflammatory response system (IRS) and compensatory immunoregulatory system (CIRS) in 120 pregnant females in the early (<16 weeks) and late (>24 weeks) pregnancy. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to assess severity of antenatal depression.\nCluster analyses showed that the combined effects of ACE, relationship dissatisfaction, unwanted pregnancy, PMS, and upregulated M1, Th-1, Th-2, and IRS immune profiles and the ensuing early depressive symptoms shape a stress-immune-depression phenotypic class. Elevated IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-15, IL-17, and GM-CSF are the cytokines associated with this phenotypic class. All immune profiles (except CIRS) were significantly associated with the early EPDS score, independent of the effects of psychological variables and PMS. There was a shift in immune profiles from early to late pregnancy, with an increase in the IRS/CIRS ratio. The late EPDS score was predicted by the early EPDS score, adverse experiences, and immune profiles, mainly the Th-2 and Th-17 phenotypes.\nActivated immune phenotypes contribute to early and late perinatal depressive symptoms above and beyond the effects of psychological stressors and PMS."}, {"Title": "Research and Diagnostic Algorithmic Rules (RADAR) and RADAR Plots for the First Episode of Major Depressive Disorder: Effects of Childhood and Recent Adverse Experiences on Suicidal Behaviors, Neurocognition and Phenome Features.", "Abstract": "Recent studies have proposed valid precision models and valid Research and Diagnostic Algorithmic Rules (RADAR) for recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD). The aim of the current study was to construct precision models and RADAR scores in patients experiencing first-episode MDD and to examine whether adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and negative life events (NLE) are associated with suicidal behaviors (SB), cognitive impairment, and phenome RADAR scores. This study recruited 90 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in an acute phase, of whom 71 showed a first-episode MDD (FEM), and 40 controls. We constructed RADAR scores for ACE; NLE encountered in the last year; SB; and severity of depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and physiosomatic symptoms using the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales and the FibroFatigue scale. The partial least squares analysis showed that in FEM, one latent vector (labeled the phenome of FEM) could be extracted from depressive, anxiety, fatigue, physiosomatic, melancholia, and insomnia symptoms, SB, and cognitive impairments. The latter were conceptualized as a latent vector extracted from the Verbal Fluency Test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and ratings of memory and judgement, indicating a generalized cognitive decline (G-CoDe). We found that 60.8% of the variance in the FEM phenome was explained by the cumulative effects of NLE and ACE, in particular emotional neglect and, to a lesser extent, physical abuse. In conclusion, the RADAR scores and plots constructed here should be used in research and clinical settings, rather than the binary diagnosis of MDD based on the DSM-5 or ICD."}, {"Title": "Valproate-Induced Metabolic Syndrome.", "Abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) and its salts (sodium calcium magnesium and orotic) are psychotropic drugs that are widely used in neurology and psychiatry. The long-term use of VPA increases the risk of developing adverse drug reactions (ADRs), among which metabolic syndrome (MetS) plays a special role. MetS belongs to a cluster of metabolic conditions such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high serum triglycerides, and low serum high-density lipoprotein. Valproate-induced MetS (VPA-MetS) is a common ADR that needs an updated multidisciplinary approach to its prevention and diagnosis. In this review, we consider the results of studies of blood (serum and plasma) and the urinary biomarkers of VPA-MetS. These metabolic biomarkers may provide the key to the development of a new multidisciplinary personalized strategy for the prevention and diagnosis of VPA-MetS in patients with neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, and addiction diseases."}, {"Title": "The Benefit of a Retrospective Pregnancy Anamnesis in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: The Reliability of Maternal Self-Report during Childhood Development.", "Abstract": "Pregnancy anamnesis is a crucial part of child and adolescent psychiatry diagnostics. In previous works, the reliability of retrospective maternal self-report on perinatal characteristics was heterogeneous. This prospective longitudinal study aimed to evaluate women's recall of prenatal events in a within-subject design. A sample of 241 women gave a self-report on prenatal alcohol, smoking, partnership quality, pregnancy satisfaction, and obstetric complications during the 3rd trimester (t0), childhood (t1, 6-10 y), and adolescence (t2, 12-14 y). The intra-individual agreement was examined. The t0-t1-(t2) agreement was poor to substantial; this was highest for smoking and worst for obstetric complications, followed by alcohol (Fleiss' \u03ba = 0.719 to -0.051). There were significant t0-t1-(t2) differences for all pregnancy variables (<i>p</i> < 0.017), except for 3rd trimester satisfaction (<i>p</i> = 0.256). For alcohol (t0 25.8%, t1 17.4%, t2 41.0%) and smoking (t0 11.9%, t1 16.4%, t2 22.6%), the highest self-reported rates were found during adolescence. During childhood, fewer obstetric complications (t0 84.9%, t1 42.2%) and worse partnerships were reported (t0 M = 8.86, t1 M = 7.89). Thought to be due to social stigmata and memory effects, pregnancy self-reports cannot be precisely reproduced.

This review outlines the conceptual narrative behind this treatment modality, starting with theory developed by Charles Darwin. We develop the concept of emotional proprioception and discuss how the muscles of facial expression play an important role in relaying valenced information to the brain's emotional neuroanatomical circuit. We review the role of facial frown musculature as the brain's barometer and transmitter of negatively valanced emotional information. The direct connections between the corrugator muscles and the amygdala are reviewed, and these provide a neuroanatomical circuit that is a logical target for treatment with BoNT/A. The centrality of amygdala dysfunction in the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders, and the evidence that BoNT/A modulates amygdala activity, provides the mechanistic link between BoNT/A and its antidepressant activity. Animal models of BoNT/A's antidepressant effects confirm the evolutionary conservation of this emotional circuit. The clinical and theoretical implications of this evidence, as it relates to the potential treatment of a broad range of psychiatric disorders by BoNT/A, is discussed. The ease of administration, long duration, and favorable side effect profile of this therapy is reviewed in the context of existing antidepressant treatments."}, {"Title": "Inhibiting neuronal AC1 for treating anxiety and headache in the animal model of migraine.", "Abstract": "Migraines are a common medical condition. From a basic science point of view, the central mechanism for migraine and headache is largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that cortical excitatory transmission is significantly enhanced in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-a brain region which is critical for pain perception. Biochemical studies found that the phosphorylation levels of both the NMDA receptor GluN2B and AMPA receptor GluA1 were enhanced in ACC of migraine rats. Both the presynaptic release of glutamate and postsynaptic responses of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors were enhanced. Synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) was occluded. Furthermore, behavioral anxiety and nociceptive responses were increased, which were reversed by application of AC1 inhibitor NB001 within ACC. Our results provide strong evidence that cortical LTPs contribute to migraine-related pain and anxiety. Drugs that inhibit cortical excitation such as NB001 may serve as potential medicines for treating migraine in the future."}, {"Title": "Validation of the neuroconnective endophenotype questionnaire (NEQ): a new clinical tool for medicine and psychiatry resulting from the contribution of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.", "Abstract": "The link between anxiety disorders and joint hypermobility syndrome (now under hypermobility spectrum disorders, which include hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) has been widely replicated over the past 30 years and has grown beyond the initial nosological limits. To integrate clinical and research progress in this field, a new neuroconnective endophenotype (NE) and its corresponding instrument, the Neuroconnective Endophenotype Questionnaire (NEQ), have been developed. This new clinical construct, created with the active participation of patients, includes both somatic and psychological dimensions and symptoms and resilience items.\nThe NE includes five dimensions: (1) sensorial sensitivity, (2) body signs and symptoms, (3) somatic conditions, (4) polar behavioral strategies, and (5) psychological and psychopathological dimensions. The NEQ information is collected through four self-administered questionnaires (sensorial sensitivity, body signs and symptoms, polar behavioral strategies, and psychological characteristics) and a structured diagnostic part that should be completed by a trained observer. This hetero-administered part incorporates (a) psychiatric diagnoses (using structured criteria, e.g., MINI), (b) somatic disorders diagnosis, using structured criteria, and (c) assessment of joint hypermobility criteria.\nIn a sample of 36 anxiety cases with 36 matched controls, the NEQ obtained high scores for test-retest, inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency. As for predictive validity, cases and controls significantly differed in all five dimensions and hypermobility measurements.\nWe can conclude that the NEQ has achieved acceptable reliability and validity values and, therefore, is ready to be used and tested in different samples.

In recent years, deep TMS (dTMS) has shown promise as an enhanced form of TMS able to stimulate deeper brain structures and target broader networks. Various magnetic Hesed-coil (H-coil) designs-a novel feature of dTMS-have been used to stimulate brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of specific psychiatric and cognitive disorders, thereby producing therapeutic effects. Given the novelty of dTMS in psychiatry, little is known about the clinical efficacy of dTMS across psychiatric and cognitive disorders-that is, whether dTMS performs superiorly to sham or control.\nIn this paper, we outline a protocol for a systematic review investigating the clinical efficacy of dTMS. The primary objective is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on dTMS for psychiatric and cognitive disorders and, if feasible, a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of active dTMS versus sham/control for psychiatric disorders. Dementia and related cognitive disorders will also be examined. A secondary objective will be to examine subgroup differences (by age, sex, H-coil design, and dTMS parameters [ie, pulses per session, percentage of motor threshold, etc]) to evaluate whether dTMS differentially influences clinical outcomes based on these factors.\nA comprehensive search of the APA PsycINFO, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases will be conducted using keywords such as \"H-coil\" and \"dTMS.\" Two authors (AD and MD) will be responsible for screening relevant articles, assessing article eligibility (according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria), and data extraction. All included articles will undergo a quality and risk of bias assessment. Data from included articles will be summarized qualitatively in a systematic review. If a sufficient number of equivalent studies are available, a meta-analysis will be performed to (1) determine the effect of active versus sham dTMS (or another control arm) across psychiatric and cognitive disorders, and (2) examine subgroup effects of clinical outcomes.\nThe preliminary search rendered a total of 1134 articles from the APA PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. After full-text screening, 21 eligible articles remained. One additional article was identified from the references section of an existing systematic review. In total, 22 eligible articles were included.

This shows that 'small' effect sizes can in some contexts be large and impactful."}, {"Title": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for chronic noncancer pain and prescription opioid use disorder: A qualitative pilot study of its feasibility and the perceived process of change.", "Abstract": "Mindfulness-based interventions have a positive impact on pain, craving, and well-being in both patients with chronic pain and those with opioid use disorder (OUD). Although data are limited, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) might be a promising treatment for patients with chronic noncancer pain combined with OUD. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the feasibility and process of change during MBCT in this particular population.\nIn this qualitative pilot study, 21 patients who were hospitalized for rotation to buprenorphine/naloxone as agonist treatment for chronic pain and OUD were offered MBCT. Semistructured interviews were conducted to explore experienced barriers and facilitators to MBCT. Patients who participated in MBCT were also interviewed on their perceived process of change.\nOf 21 patients invited to participate in MBCT, 12 initially expressed interest but only four eventually participated in MBCT. The timing of the intervention, group format, somatic complaints, and practical difficulties were identified as the main barriers to participation. Facilitating factors included having a positive attribution toward MBCT, an intrinsic motivation to change, and practical support. The four MBCT participants mentioned several important mechanisms of change, including reduction of opioid craving and improved coping with pain.\nMBCT offered in the current study was not feasible for the majority of patients with pain and OUD. Changing the timing of MBCT by providing it at an earlier stage of the treatment and offering MBCT in an online format may facilitate participation."}, {"Title": "Investigating the role of relationship satisfaction and paternal psychological distress during pregnancy on offspring health in early life.", "Abstract": "The research on the role of father in the foetal programming of health and behaviour has received increasing attention. However, the influences of paternal depressive symptoms and couple relationship satisfaction during pregnancy - potentially mediated via maternal well-being - on the offspring's risk of infections in early life is still seldom assessed.\nThe aim was to investigate if paternal psychological distress during pregnancy is associated with elevated risk of recurrent respiratory infections (RRIs) for offspring at 12 months of age, and whether maternal distress mediates the association between paternal distress and offspring RRIs.\nThe study population was drawn from the nested case-control cohort of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Children with RRIs (<i>n</i> = 50) were identified by maternal reports at the age of 12 months, whereas mothers did not report RRIs for the comparison group (<i>n</i> = 716). Parental depressive symptoms were measured with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and couple relationship satisfaction was measured with the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale.\nThe association between paternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and offspring RRIs was mediated by maternal prenatal depressive symptoms. Additionally, paternal poorer relationship satisfaction was associated with child RRIs independently of maternal distress.\nThe results suggest different pathways through which paternal distress during pregnancy may contribute to elevated risk of offspring RRIs, and more research is needed to study their underlying mechanisms. Paternal distress and couple relationship satisfaction during pregnancy should be assessed and screened as a contributor to offspring health."}, {"Title": "Bayesian network analysis of antidepressant treatment trajectories.", "Abstract": "It is currently difficult to successfully choose the correct type of antidepressant for individual patients. To discover patterns in patient characteristics, treatment choices and outcomes, we performed retrospective Bayesian network analysis combined with natural language processing (NLP). This study was conducted at two mental healthcare facilities in the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted and treated with antidepressants between 2014 and 2020 were included. Outcome measures were antidepressant continuation, prescription duration and four treatment outcome topics: core complaints, social functioning, general well-being and patient experience, extracted through NLP of clinical notes. Combined with patient and treatment characteristics, Bayesian networks were constructed at both facilities and compared. Antidepressant choices were continued in 66% and 89% of antidepressant trajectories. Score-based network analysis revealed 28 dependencies between treatment choices, patient characteristics and outcomes. Treatment outcomes and prescription duration were tightly intertwined and interacted with antipsychotics and benzodiazepine co-medication. Tricyclic antidepressant prescription and depressive disorder were important predictors for antidepressant continuation. We show a feasible way of pattern discovery in psychiatry data, through combining network analysis with NLP. Further research should explore the found patterns in patient characteristics, treatment choices and outcomes prospectively, and the possibility of translating these into a tool for clinical decision support."}, {"Title": "Childhood/adolescent Sydenham's chorea in the UK and Ireland: a BPSU/CAPSS surveillance study.", "Abstract": "To conduct the first prospective surveillance study of Sydenham's chorea (SC) in the UK and Ireland, and to describe the current paediatric and child psychiatric service-related incidence, presentation and management of SC in children and young people aged 0-16 years.\nSurveillance study of first presentations of SC reported by paediatricians via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) and all presentations of SC reported by child and adolescent psychiatrists through the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Surveillance System (CAPSS).\nOver 24 months from November 2018, 72 reports were made via BPSU, of which 43 met the surveillance case definition of being eligible cases of suspected or confirmed SC. This translates to an estimated paediatric service-related incidence rate of new SC cases of 0.16 per 100\u2009000 children aged 0-16 per year in the UK. No reports were made via CAPSS over the 18-month reporting period, although over 75% of BPSU cases presented with emotional and/or behavioural symptoms. Almost all cases were prescribed courses of antibiotics of varying duration, and around a quarter of cases (22%) received immunomodulatory treatment.\nSC remains a rare condition in the UK and Ireland but has not disappeared.

The overall frequency of psychotic symptoms ranged from 34 to 63% in dementia conditions of the most varied etiologies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents more delusions and hallucinations and has a higher frequency regarding the presence of misidentifications. On the contrary, Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) seems to present more hallucinations, even auditory, when compared to the other dementias, concomitantly with delusions. Vascular and frontotemporal dementia present fewer psychotic symptoms than DLB and AD.\nWe identified a gap in the literature on the description of the psychotic symptoms of dementia, mainly in those of non-AD etiologies.

This paper applies the concept of epistemic injustice to problems in the therapeutic relationship between psychiatrists and psychiatric patients. To this end, it is necessary to acknowledge psychiatrists as professionals with expertise in treating mental disorders, which impair the patient's rationality, sometimes leading to false beliefs, such as delusions. This paper classifies the characteristic features of the therapeutic relationship in psychiatry into three stages: those of a professional-client relationship, those of a doctor-patient relationship, and those of a psychiatrist-psychiatric patient relationship. Epistemic injustice is prevalent in psychiatric care owing to prejudice against patients with mental disorders. However, it is also predisposed by the roles that psychiatrists play in relation to psychiatric patients.

Although the evidence base for its wide-ranging, unique efficacy continues to expand, clozapine remains alarmingly underutilized in industrialized countries. Analyzing the causes and consequences of this problem is crucial for substantially improving the quality of care for TRS patients.\nClozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for reducing all-cause mortality in TRS. In most cases, treatment resistance emerges during the first psychotic episode. Delaying clozapine treatment has a negative impact on long-term outcome. Patients' experience with clozapine treatment is largely positive despite a comparatively high rate of side effects. Patients prefer clozapine, while psychiatrists regard it as a burden due to concerns regarding safety and side effect management. Shared decision-making (SDM), which increases the likelihood of a clozapine recommendation, is not routinely used, possibly due to stigmatization of TRS patients.\nThe mortality-reducing effects of clozapine alone warrant its regular use. Therefore, psychiatrists must not exclude patients from the decision regarding a clozapine trial by not even offering it. Rather, they have a clear obligation to align their actions more closely with the existing evidence and patients' needs and to facilitate the timely initiation of clozapine."}, {"Title": "The 'lost generation' in adult psychiatry: psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and sociodemographic characteristics of psychiatric patients with autism unrecognised in childhood.", "Abstract": "Patients with 'underlying' autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitute a significant minority in adult out-patient psychiatry.

However, mechanistic insights into these brain systems are a continued challenge. Where prior work describes activation and connectivity, new mechanistic insights into the brain's functional connectome can be derived by removing nodes and quantifying changes in network properties (hereafter referred to as computational lesioning) to characterize connectome resilience and vulnerability. Here, we study the resilience of connectome integration in CU traits by estimating changes in efficiency after computationally lesioning individual-level connectomes. From resting-state data of 86 participants (48% female, age 14.52\u00b11.31) drawn from the Nathan Kline institute's Rockland study, individual-level connectomes were estimated using graphical lasso. Computational lesioning was conducted both sequentially and by targeting global and local hubs. Elastic net regression was applied to determine how these changes explained variance in CU traits. Follow-up analyses characterized modeled node hubs, examined moderation, determined impact of targeting, and decoded the brain mask by comparing regions to meta-analytic maps. Elastic net regression revealed that computational lesioning of 23 nodes, network modularity, and Tanner stage explained variance in CU traits. Hub assignment of selected hubs differed at higher CU traits. No evidence for moderation between simulated lesioning and CU traits was found. Targeting global hubs increased efficiency and targeting local hubs had no effect at higher CU traits. Identified brain mask meta-analytically associated with more emotion and cognitive terms. Although reliable patterns were found across participants, adolescent brains were heterogeneous even for those with a similar CU traits score. Adolescent brain response to simulated lesioning revealed a pattern of connectome resiliency and vulnerability that explains variance in CU traits, which can aid prediction of youth at greater risk for higher CU traits."}, {"Title": "A Comprehensive Examination of Pediatric Behavioral Health Service Demand and Utilization in a Large, Academic Health System from 2019 to 2021.", "Abstract": "Studies of the effects of COVID-19 on youth suggest a worsening in mental health globally.

The aim of our research was thus to present initial pilot data on the long-term clinical course of our patients in an outpatient clinic specializing in autoantibody-associated psychiatric disorders. <b>Methods:</b> Thirty-seven patients were examined clinically in our outpatient clinic at regular intervals over a 1.5-year period. We collected clinical data on their demographics, psychopathology, and cognition, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data as well as the status of neural autoantibodies in blood and/or serum. <b>Results:</b> Our main finding was that affective, psychotic, and cognitive symptoms did not change significantly over the 1.5-year period, thus revealing no progression. We divided the entire cohort of autoantibody-positive patients (n = 32) into subgroups consisting of patients with dementia (n = 14), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 7), psychotic disorders (n = 6), and a CSF profile of Alzheimer's disease (n = 6). Relying on established classification schemes, we identified the following percentages in our autoantibody-positive cohort: 28% with autoimmune encephalitis, 15% with autoimmune psychosis, and 63% with autoimmune psychiatric syndromes. <b>Discussion:</b> These initial pilot results suggest that autoantibody-associated diseases do not show a significantly progressive course in the long-term and are often characterized by impaired verbal memory recall when cognitive impairment progresses to dementia. These initial data need to be verified in larger cohorts.

Jackson in June 2022 reversed precedent which had previously protected abortion prior to fetal viability as a universal right within the United States. This decision almost immediately led to abortion restrictions across 25 states. The resulting lack of access to abortion care for millions of pregnant people will have profound physical and mental health consequences, the full effects of which will not be realized for years to come. Approximately 1 in 5 women access abortions in the U.S. each year. These women are diverse and represent all American groups. The Supreme court decision, however, will affect populations that have and continue to be marginalized the most. Forcing pregnant individuals to carry unwanted pregnancies worsens health outcomes and mortality risk for both the perinatal individual and the offspring. The US has one of the highest maternal mortality rates and this rate is projected to increase with abortion bans. Abortion policies also interfere with appropriate medical care of pregnant people leading to less safe pregnancies for all. Beyond the physical morbidity, the psychological sequelae of carrying a forced pregnancy to term will lead to an even greater burden of maternal mental illness, exacerbating the already existing maternal mental health crisis.

Based on the dementia syndrome entailing signs of CNS inflammation such as pleocytosis and the repeated detection of anti-CARPVIII autoantibodies in serum, we diagnosed autoimmune dementia as a component of mixed dementia with additional vascular dementia components.\nOur finding adds severe cognitive impairment to the spectrum of anti-CARPVIII-associated disease. However, detecting anti-CARPVIII antibodies may also be an incidental finding in conjunction with typical mixed dementia. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relevance of these clinical findings."}, {"Title": "Plasma neurofilament light chain protein is not increased in forensic psychiatric populations: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "Neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) is a fluid biomarker of neural injury measurable in cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Patients with different neurodegenerative disorders and mild traumatic brain injury display elevated levels of NfL. However, so far, elevated levels of NfL have not been demonstrated in persons with psychiatric disorders. To our knowledge, the occurrence of NfL in the blood has not previously been studied in persons undergoing forensic psychiatric assessment or persons treated in forensic mental health services. Supposedly, these persons suffer from experiences and conditions with a higher risk of neural injury than other psychiatric patients.\nIn this pilot study, we investigated plasma levels of NfL in 20 persons undergoing forensic psychiatric assessment and 20 patients at a forensic psychiatric hospital. NfL values were compared with control groups of healthy individuals matched for age and sex.\nThe prevalence of increased NfL in both forensic groups was low and did not differ compared with the controls. However, some persons undergoing forensic psychiatric assessment showed slightly elevated values.\nThe slightly elevated values were observed in the group investigated closer in time to the index crime, when elevated NfL levels could be expected to be more prevalent due to acute conditions from the time of the offense. This gives reason to look further into this group."}, {"Title": "The multimodal Munich Clinical Deep Phenotyping study to bridge the translational gap in severe mental illness treatment research.", "Abstract": "Treatment of severe mental illness (SMI) symptoms, especially negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, remains a major unmet need. There is good evidence that SMIs have a strong genetic background and are characterized by multiple biological alterations, including disturbed brain circuits and connectivity, dysregulated neuronal excitation-inhibition, disturbed dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways, and partially dysregulated inflammatory processes. The ways in which the dysregulated signaling pathways are interconnected remains largely unknown, in part because well-characterized clinical studies on comprehensive biomaterial are lacking. Furthermore, the development of drugs to treat SMIs such as schizophrenia is limited by the use of operationalized symptom-based clusters for diagnosis.\nIn line with the Research Domain Criteria initiative, the Clinical Deep Phenotyping (CDP) study is using a multimodal approach to reveal the neurobiological underpinnings of clinically relevant schizophrenia subgroups by performing broad transdiagnostic clinical characterization with standardized neurocognitive assessments, multimodal neuroimaging, electrophysiological assessments, retinal investigations, and omics-based analyzes of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, to bridge the translational gap in biological psychiatry the study includes <i>in vitro</i> investigations on human-induced pluripotent stem cells, which are available from a subset of participants.\nHere, we report on the feasibility of this multimodal approach, which has been successfully initiated in the first participants in the CDP cohort; to date, the cohort comprises over 194 individuals with SMI and 187 age and gender matched healthy controls. In addition, we describe the applied research modalities and study objectives.\nThe identification of cross-diagnostic and diagnosis-specific biotype-informed subgroups of patients and the translational dissection of those subgroups may help to pave the way toward precision medicine with artificial intelligence-supported tailored interventions and treatment. This aim is particularly important in psychiatry, a field where innovation is urgently needed because specific symptom domains, such as negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, and treatment-resistant symptoms in general are still difficult to treat."}, {"Title": "Unlocking asylum seekers' voices: protocol of a mixed-method clinical study on the use of the cultural formulation interview with asylum seekers in Belgium.", "Abstract": "Despite a high prevalence of mental disorders among asylum seekers, many barriers to mental healthcare exist. Cultural and contextual factors strongly influence the experience and expression of psychological distress, putting asylum seekers at greater risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a useful tool to map out cultural and contextual factors of mental disorders; however, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been investigated in asylum seekers specifically. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the value of the CFI in the psychiatric assessment of asylum seekers. Second, we will describe the themes relevant to psychiatric distress in asylum seekers that are identified by the CFI. In addition, asylum seekers' experience of the CFI will be evaluated.\nThis cross-sectional, mixed-method clinical study aims to recruit a group of 60-80 asylum seekers (age 15-29) with mental health symptoms. Data will be collected using structured (MINI, PCL-5, HDRS-17, WHOQoL-BREF & BSI) and semi-structured (CFI & CFI-debriefing) questionnaires to assess cultural background, contextual factors, and illness severity. Multidisciplinary case discussions will be held after the completion of interviews, following a methodological stepped approach. Combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques, this study aims to generate reliable knowledge on working with the CFI in asylum seekers. Based on the findings, recommendations for clinicians will be developed.\nThis study addresses the knowledge gap on using the CFI in asylum seekers. Compared to prior studies, it will provide new insights into the use of the CFI in the specific context of working with asylum seekers.\nPrior research on the CFI in asylum seekers is limited, partly because of their high vulnerability and low access to care. The study protocol has been tailored in close collaboration with several stakeholders and validated after piloting. Ethical approval has already been obtained. Together with the stakeholders, the results will be translated into guidelines and training materials.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the need for proper monitoring of psychotropic drug prescriptions. This study aims to characterize and find trends in the prescription of psychotropics in a Latin American General Hospital. Methods The study analyzed the dispensation of psychotropic prescriptions to outpatients at three pharmacies in the central headquarters of Hospital Cl\u00ednica B\u00edblica in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica, from 2017 to 2021. Psychotropic drugs were classified by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, and the amount of each medication dispensed was standardized using the defined daily dose per 10,000 population per day metric. Patients' ages were categorized into four groups: under 18 years, 18 to 39 years, 40 to 64 years, and 65 years and above. The prescriptions were categorized according to medical specialty.\u00a0Regression analyses were performed to determine the significance of trends observed in the data Results A total of 5793 psychotropic prescriptions were recorded. The average age of the patients was 58 years. The total consumption of psychotropics decreased by 33.94% from 2017 to 2021, with the most significant decline until 2020. However, there was an increase in consumption in 2021. Clonazepam was the most consumed medication, followed by bromazepam and alprazolam, which was the sole drug to exhibit an escalation in usage between 2017 and 2021.\u00a0Regression analysis showed that only alprazolam and zopiclone had statistically significant trends. The highest number of prescriptions was dispensed to patients aged between 40 and 64 years, followed by those aged over 65 years. Anxiolytics were also the most commonly prescribed group of drugs. General medicine (20.22%),\u00a0psychiatry (19.95%), and internal medicine (12.73%) were the primary specialties that prescribed psychotropic; 38.6% of prescriptions were associated with the 10th decile of patients, and 44.9% of prescriptions were issued by the 10th decile of physicians.\u00a0 Conclusion The consumption of psychotropic drugs decreased from 2017 to 2020 but increased in 2021, with alprazolam being the only drug that showed an increase in consumption throughout the entire period.\u00a0General practitioners and psychiatrists were found to be the specialties that most commonly prescribe these medications.\u00a0The study found significant trends only for the consumption of alprazolam and zopiclone and for prescription patterns among psychiatrists and internal medicine physicians."}, {"Title": "Theophrastus's Anaisthetos Transdiagnostic Presentation: comment on Pehlivanidis and Papanikolaou (2022).", "Abstract": "We were pleased to read Pehlivanidis and Papanikolaou's article1 and see that more colleagues are recognizing Theophrastus' text as the first description of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).2 We agree with the authors' perspective that Theophrastus' description may suggest the presence of more than one neurodevelopmental disorder. In fact, Theophrastus' description aligns with the shared clinical symptoms and underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms of ADHD and Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder (SPCD). It is fascinating that a description from over 2000 years ago already presented prototypical individual transdiagnostic aspects that are compatible with a modern biological view of psychiatry. Indeed, it is not unexpected that heritable traits with clear biological underpinnings should have been perceived since the dawn of medicine. A significant leap forward in the development of this field came a few decades ago when Clements (1966)3 published a NIH-sponsored project entitled 'Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children.' This seminal work prepared the terrain for the ongoing understanding of the grouping of signs, symptoms, and biological factors observed across various neurodevelopmental disorders. This grouping can be present in different spectrums, proportions, and nuances, including children and adults with some impairments that are not solely explained by their cognitive abilities. Thus, the characterization of 'The Obtuse Man' by Theophrastus could be considered a prototypical case of this more integrated and less fragmented view of what we call neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Stigma and discrimination among persons with mental illness in a tertiary care medical institution in Southern India.", "Abstract": "The proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to seeking treatment for persons with mental illness (PMI). Stigma reduction strategies are thus crucial, and for this, there needs to be an understanding of the various factors associated with them. The current study intended to assess stigma and discrimination in PMI visiting the department of psychiatry in a teaching hospital in Southern India and their association with various clinical and sociodemographic factors in them. The index study was a descriptive cross-sectional study involving consenting adults who presented to the department of psychiatry with mental disorders from August 2013 to January 2014. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using a semi-structured proforma, and the Discrimination and Stigma Scale (DISC-12) was used to assess discrimination and stigma. Most of PMI suffered from bipolar disorder, followed by depression, schizophrenia, and other disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorder, and substance use disorder. Discrimination was experienced by 56% of them and 46% had stigmatizing experiences. Both discrimination and stigma were found to be significantly associated with their age, gender, education, occupation, place of residence, and illness duration. While PMI suffering from depression experienced the highest discrimination, those with schizophrenia faced the stronger stigma. Binary logistic regression revealed depression, family history of psychiatric illness, age of less than 45 years, and rural locality of residence to be the significant determinants of discrimination and stigma. The study thus found that stigma and discrimination were associated with multiple social, demographic, and clinical factors in PMI. A rights-based approach to PMI is the need of the hour to tackle stigma and discrimination, which is already included in recent Indian acts and statutes. Implementation of these approaches is the need of the hour."}, {"Title": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for individuals at risk for psychosis or with a first psychotic episode: A qualitative study on patients' perspectives.", "Abstract": "The aim of this qualitative study is to explore patients' perspectives on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for early stages of psychosis. Therefore, we interviewed participants of the INTERACT study, that quantitatively investigated Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Daily Life (ACT-DL) in combination with treatment as usual, for early stages of psychosis, comparing it to treatment as usual.\nWithin 6\u2009months after finishing ACT-DL, we conducted semi-structured, individual interviews with 19 participants. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used for coding and analysis.\nTwo overarching themes were formed: 'the meaning of ACT' and 'what to improve'. Considering the first, participants generally understood and connected with the meaning of ACT, noticing more awareness and acceptance of their thoughts and feelings, and living more in line with their personal values. The second theme included comments on the protocol not being personal or psychosis specific enough and some elements of ACT being too difficult to understand when having active psychotic symptoms.\nThis study suggests that ACT is an acceptable and promising new form of treatment for early stages of psychosis, and it provides relevant information to further develop ACT for this group."}, {"Title": "Burnout Among Psychiatry Residents and One Program's Approach to Creating a Culture of Wellness.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residency training includes unique characteristics that can predispose trainees to burnout, including vicarious traumatization, prevalence of patient suicide and violence in the workplace, and social stigma surrounding mental health.

The authors synthesized data from nearly 20 years of assessments of the trial to determine the overall intervention effect size across time points and developmental domains. The goal was to quantify the overall effect of the foster care intervention on children's outcomes and examine sources of variation in this effect, including domain, age, and sex assigned at birth.\nAn intent-to-treat approach was used to examine the causal effects of the randomized controlled trial for 136 children residing in institutions in Bucharest, Romania (baseline age, 6-31 months) who were randomly assigned to either foster care (N=68) or care as usual (N=68). At ages 30, 42, and 54 months and 8, 12, and 16-18 years, children were assessed for IQ, physical growth, brain electrical activity (EEG), and symptoms of five types of psychopathology.\nParticipants provided 7,088 observations across follow-up waves. Children assigned to foster care had better cognitive and physical outcomes and less severe psychopathology than did those who received care as usual. The magnitude of these effect sizes remained stable across development. The foster care intervention most influenced IQ and disorders of attachment/social relatedness.\nYoung children benefit from placement in families after institutional care. The benefits of foster care for previously institutionalized children were remarkably stable across development."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of psychiatry trainees towards patients with borderline personality disorder: Does the stigma begin during training?", "Abstract": "Research suggests there is a widespread stigma among clinicians towards patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and that this contributes to poor treatment outcomes. Given the influence of learning environments in shaping perceptions, this study investigated the attitude of South Australian psychiatry trainees towards patients with BPD. A questionnaire was distributed to 89 South Australian doctors, from both The Adelaide Prevocational Psychiatry Program (TAPPP) and psychiatry trainees of The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP). This questionnaire investigated the domains of treatment optimism, clinician attitude and empathy towards patients with BPD. Results indicated that psychiatry trainees near the end of training scored significantly lower across all domains, indicating a more negative perception of patients with BPD, when compared to early- and mid-stage trainees. This study identifies a need to understand why trainees closer to qualifying as psychiatrists have increased stigma towards patients with BPD. Improved education and training surrounding patients with BPD is warranted to reduce negative stigma and improve clinical outcomes."}, {"Title": "The revolving door phenomenon in severe psychiatric disorders: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The treatment of psychiatric patients has suffered a major change over the last decades, with long-term hospitalizations being replaced by short-term stays and appropriate aftercare in outpatient services.

Fatigue plays a particularly important clinical role in multiple sclerosis (MS) where it exerts a profound impact on quality of life. Recent concepts of fatigue grounded in computational theories of brain-body interactions emphasise the role of interoception and metacognition in the pathogenesis of fatigue. So far, however, for MS, empirical data on interoception and metacognition are scarce. This study examined interoception and (exteroceptive) metacognition in a sample of 71 persons with a diagnosis of MS. Interoception was assessed by pre-specified subscales of a standard questionnaire (MAIA), while metacognition was investigated with computational models of choice and confidence data from a visual discrimination paradigm. Additionally, autonomic function was examined by several physiological measurements. Several hypotheses were tested based on a preregistered analysis plan. In brief, we found the predicted association of interoceptive awareness with fatigue (but not with exteroceptive metacognition) and an association of autonomic function with exteroceptive metacognition (but not with fatigue). Furthermore, machine learning (elastic net regression) showed that individual fatigue scores could be predicted out-of-sample from our measurements, with questionnaire-based measures of interoceptive awareness and sleep quality as key predictors. Our results support theoretical concepts of interoception as an important factor for fatigue and demonstrate the general feasibility of predicting individual levels of fatigue from simple questionnaire-based measures of interoception and sleep."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behavior among inpatients with severe mental conditions in a public mental health hospital in Uganda.", "Abstract": "Suicidal behaviors are prevalent among inpatients with severe mental conditions and may result in many dying by suicide. Few studies have focused on the burden of suicidal behaviors among these inpatients in low-income settings, despite suicide being consistently higher in lower-income countries such as Uganda. This study, therefore, provides the prevalence and associated factors of suicidal behaviors and suicide attempts among inpatients with severe mental conditions in Uganda.\nThis was a retrospective chart review of all individuals admitted with severe mental conditions to a large psychiatry inpatient unit in Uganda for four years (2018-2021). Two separate logistic regressions were conducted to determine the factors associated with suicidal behaviors or suicidal attempts among the admitted individuals.\nThe prevalence of suicidal behavior and suicidal attempts among 3104 (mean age\u2009=\u200933, Standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200914.0; 56% were males) were 6.12% and 3.45%, respectively.

Assault incident reports and electronic medical records from one psychiatric emergency room and two inpatient psychiatric units were reviewed. Qualitative methods were used to identify precipitants. Quantitative methods were used to describe characteristics of each event, as well as demographic and symptom profiles associated with incidents. During the five-year study period, there were 60 incidents in the psychiatric emergency room and 124 incidents on the inpatient units. Precipitating factors, incident severity, means of assault, and interventions were similar in both settings. Among patients in the psychiatric emergency room, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with manic symptoms (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 27.86) and presenting with thoughts to harm others (AOR 10.94) were associated with an increased likelihood of having an assault incident report. Similarities between assaults in the psychiatric emergency room and inpatient psychiatric units suggest that the broader literature from inpatient psychiatry can be generalized to the psychiatric emergency room setting, although some differences exist.

Individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis often receive inadequate care in emergency departments, boarding for hours or days while awaiting treatment. Such crises also account for a quarter of police shootings and 2 million jail bookings per year, and racism and implicit bias magnify these problems for people of color. Fortunately, the new 988 mental health emergency number compounded with police reform movements have created momentum for building behavioral health crisis response systems that deliver comparable quality and consistency of care as we expect for medical emergencies. This paper provides an overview of the rapidly evolving landscape of crisis services. The authors discuss the role of law enforcement and various approaches to lessening the impact on individuals experiencing behavioral health emergencies, especially for historically marginalized populations. The authors provide an overview of the crisis continuum, including crisis hotlines, mobile teams, observation units, crisis residential programs, and peer wraparound services that can help ensure that linkage to aftercare is successful. The authors also highlight opportunities for psychiatric leadership, advocacy, and strategies for creating a well-coordinated crisis system that meets the needs of the community."}, {"Title": "Safe Spaces: Mitigating Potential Aggression in Acute Care Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Awareness of potential aggression and violence is crucial when treating patients experiencing mental health crises in psychiatric emergency and inpatient settings. To provide a practical overview for health care workers in acute care psychiatry, the authors summarize relevant literature and clinical considerations on this important topic. Clinical contexts of violence in these settings, possible impact on patients and staff, and approaches to mitigating risk are reviewed. Considerations for early identification of at-risk patients and situations, and nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions, are highlighted. The authors conclude with key points and future scholarly and practical directions that may further assist those entrusted with providing psychiatric care in these situations. Although working in these often high-paced, high-pressured settings can be challenging, effective violence-management strategies and tools can help staff optimize the focus on patient care while maintaining safety, their own well-being, and overall workplace satisfaction."}, {"Title": "Updates in the Assessment and Management of Agitation.", "Abstract": "Agitated patients can be dangerous to themselves and others.

Integrating biofeedback into empirically supported treatments provides a way to objectively measure physiological correlates of emotional states, thereby enhancing accurate self-assessment. By using biofeedback, individuals with borderline personality disorder may gain skills to increase self-awareness, improve emotion regulation, and enhance behavioral control. The authors propose that biofeedback can be used to objectively measure fluctuating emotional intensity, thereby facilitating structured self-assessment of emotions and enabling more effective use of interventions for emotion regulation; can be delivered by trained mental health professionals; and may even be considered as a stand-alone intervention replacing alternative, more costly, treatments."}, {"Title": "Legal Considerations in Emergency Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Emergency psychiatry stands at the fulcrum between the general principles of autonomy and liberty balanced against illnesses that both subvert autonomy and amplify risks for violence and suicide.

The authors point out that, in assessing competency, the clinician must consider 1) psychodynamic elements of the patient's personality, 2) the accuracy of the historical information conveyed by the patient, 3) the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed to the patient, 4) the stability of the patient's mental status over time, and 5) the effect of the setting in which consent is obtained. Inattention to these factors can lead to errors in assessment of competency that can have important implications for patient care.

In a hospital setting, their purpose is to introduce a relaxing environment to increase well-being as well as to decrease anxiety and aggressive behaviors. Calm rooms can also be used as a tool to provide self-help through a convenient environment for the patients and, at the same time, strengthen the therapeutic relationship between the patient and the professional. Recent developments in virtual reality (VR) have made virtual calm rooms possible, but these have not yet been evaluated in psychiatric inpatient care.\nThis study aimed to compare the effects of VR and physical calm rooms on self-reported well-being and physiological markers of arousal.\nThe study was conducted in 2 inpatient psychiatric wards specializing in bipolar disorder from March 2019 to February 2021. Patients who were already admitted were asked if they were interested in using a calm room and willing to provide ratings. This study relied on the quasi-randomized allocation of patients to the wards, which either had a physical or VR calm room. Self-assessment scales (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment [MADRS-S], Beck Anxiety Scale, and Clinical Global Impression) were used to determine the participants' baseline level of depressive and anxiety symptoms before their use of the physical or VR calm room. The study determined the state of well-being measured using an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) as well as arousal measured by blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate before and after the use of the calm rooms. The primary end point was self-reported well-being using the VAS.\nA total of 60 participants were included-40 used the VR calm room and 20 used the physical calm room. The mean age of participants was 39 years and the majority were women (35/60, 58%). Analysis of VAS measurement showed improved well-being at the group level from before to after the intervention (P<.05), with no statistically significant difference in effects between the 2 different interventions. Effects were not moderated by baseline depression levels (dichotomized as MADRS-S >20 or \u226420) despite an overall difference in reported well-being between subgroups.\nAlthough the power in this study was low, the findings of this first study indicate comparable effects with respect to well-being and arousal of a VR calm room and a physical calm room. This suggests that a VR calm room can be a viable alternative when the use of a physical calm room is not an option for logistic or other reasons.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03918954; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03918954."}, {"Title": "Suicidal Attempt among Psychiatry Patients Presented to the Department of Emergency of a Tertiary Care Centre: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.", "Abstract": "More than 700, 000 people die due to suicide every year.

BBT trainees were able to see the links and overlap between different specialties and understand the interface between primary and secondary care. They did not perceive that BBT (as compared with single-specialty early-stage training) disadvantaged them, other than in terms of specialty examination preparation. BBT was seen as a way to keep career options open in a system where it is difficult to switch training pathway.\nBBT has the capacity to create doctors who will carry on using their generalist skills to care for patients more holistically, even if they end up working in focused practice areas.

Individual parameter estimates were generated with hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Effects of manipulations were modelled by decomposing parameters into a linear combination of effects on the logit scale.

We dissected longitudinal pathways linking sleep disturbances to psychosis, using multi-layer-network-analysis. 22q11DS was characterized by a non-restorative sleep pattern, combining increased daytime fatigue despite longer sleep duration. Non-restorative sleep combined with OSA symptoms correlated with both emotional and psychotic symptoms. Moreover, a sleep pattern evocative of OSA predicted longitudinal worsening of positive and negative symptoms, by accentuating the effects of emotional dysregulation. These results suggest that sleep disturbances could significantly increase psychosis risk, along an affective pathway.

The evidence supports the value of brief screeners for identifying youths with elevated suicide/self-harm risk and the efficacy of some treatments for suicidal and self-harm behavior. Dialectical behavior therapy currently meets Level 1 criteria (2 independent trials supporting efficacy) as the first well-established treatment for self-harm, and other approaches have shown efficacy in single randomized controlled trials. The effectiveness of some community-based suicide prevention strategies for reducing suicide mortality and suicide attempt rates has been demonstrated.\nCurrent evidence can guide practitioners in delivering effective care for youth suicide/self-harm risk.

Educating youths on depression and suicidal behavior, as well as active out- reach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are under-studied. Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides.\nTraining general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other nonpsychiatrist physi- cian settings. Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change.Reprinted from <i>Am J Psychiatry 2021; 178:611-624</i>, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing.

The objective of this work is to provide evidence and analyze the main gaps in mental health such as: the invisibility of some people with disabilities for the design of policies, legislation, or public programs; the predominance of the medical model, in which the substitution of decision-making in informed consent prevails, which violates the rights of legal personality, equality, freedom, security and respect for personal integrity, among others. This analysis highlights the importance of: a) integrating the legal provisions on health and disability to international standards, and complying with the Human Rights framework of the Political Constitution of the United States of Mexico, especially the pro personae principle and to the conforming interpretation clause; b) reform the General Health Law in matters of mental health and general health, in order to change the paradigm of asylum care to move towards that of community care with a focus on primary health care, adjacent to the services of the National System of Health; c) prohibit the institutionalization of people with mental disorders, as well as coercive measures as containment measures, and instead train and encourage verbal de-escalation techniques."}, {"Title": "Patient and caregiver perspectives on quality of life in dementia: Evidence from a South Asian population.", "Abstract": "Dementia has become a public health priority along with population ageing worldwide. Owing to its chronic progressive nature in the absence of a cure, maintaining the best possible quality of life (QOL) has become the desired outcome for people with dementia. The aim of this study was to compare the Quality of Life (QOL) of patients with dementia in Sri Lanka when assessed based on the patient's and caregiver's perspectives. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 272 pairs of patients with dementia and their primary caregivers recruited systematically from the psychiatry outpatient clinics of tertiary care state hospitals in the district of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The QOL was assessed using the 28-item DEMQOL among patients and the 31-item DEMQOL-proxy among primary caregivers. The total QOL ratings and subscale scores obtained by patients and caregivers were compared and assessed for the significance of the mean scores using the independent t-test and of the mean difference in ratings using the Wilcoxon test. Agreement between patients and their caregivers on the ratings for QOL was also assessed using the Bland Altman plot. The mean overall QOL score according to patient ratings (mean = 79.7; SD = 12.0) was significantly higher than the caregiver ratings (mean = 70.6; SD = 12.3) (p< 0.001). Mean scores for the four subscales (positive emotion, negative emotion, memory, and daily life) were also significantly higher according to the patient's ratings (p<0.001). Total scores obtained by patients and their caregivers showed a positive and significant correlation (r = 0.385; p<0.001). Bland Altman plot demonstrated acceptable agreement between their ratings. The study confirms the ability of dementia patients with mild to moderate severity to successfully rate their own QOL. Furthermore, the caregiver's ratings cannot be substituted for the patient's ratings and vice versa."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of psychometric properties of a leaflet developed for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Patients with severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia may benefit from a variety of patient education materials. Despite the availability of various resources, it is essential to assess the extent to which patients can comprehend the materials provided.\nThis study aims to evaluate the reliability and readability of the patient information leaflet (PIL) for schizophrenia.\nA quasi-experimental study was conducted for a period of 6\u2009months in the departments of psychiatry. Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited for the study. A user-testing questionnaire was developed and validated with the help of an expert committee to assess reliability. Later, translated versions of the questionnaire were then administered to the patients based on their language preference and evaluated by test-retest analysis. The readability was assessed using pre-validated and translated versions of the PIL. Initially, baseline scores of patient knowledge were assessed using a reliable user-testing questionnaire. Later, their responses were reassessed again using the same questionnaire after reading the PIL.\nA total of 45 patients participated in the study. From the total sample, 20 participants were randomly selected for reliability assessment.

Growing research highlights dopaminergic alterations in adult OCD, yet pediatric studies are limited by methodological constraints. This is the first study to utilize neuromelanin-sensitive MRI as a proxy for dopaminergic function among children with OCD. N\u2009=\u2009135 youth (6-14-year-olds) completed high-resolution neuromelanin-sensitive MRI across two sites; n\u2009=\u200964 had an OCD diagnosis. N\u2009=\u200947 children with OCD completed a second scan after cognitive-behavioral therapy. Voxel-wise analyses identified that neuromelanin-MRI signal was higher among children with OCD compared to those without (483 voxels, permutation-corrected p\u2009=\u20090.018). Effects were significant within both the substania nigra pars compacta (p\u2009=\u20090.004, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.51) and ventral tegmental area (p\u2009=\u20090.006, d\u2009=\u20090.50). Follow-up analyses indicated that more severe lifetime symptoms (t\u2009=\u2009-2.72, p\u2009=\u20090.009) and longer illness duration (t\u2009=\u2009-2.22, p\u2009=\u20090.03) related to lower neuromelanin-MRI signal. Despite significant symptom reduction with therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.001, d\u2009=\u20091.44), neither baseline nor change in neuromelanin-MRI signal associated with symptom improvement. Current results provide the first demonstration of the utility of neuromelanin-MRI in pediatric psychiatry, specifically highlighting in vivo evidence for midbrain dopamine alterations in treatment-seeking youth with OCD. Neuromelanin-MRI likely indexes accumulating alterations over time, herein, implicating dopamine hyperactivity in OCD. Given evidence of increased neuromelanin signal in pediatric OCD but negative association with symptom severity, additional work is needed to parse potential longitudinal or compensatory mechanisms. Future studies should explore the utility of neuromelanin-MRI biomarkers to identify early risk prior to onset, parse OCD subtypes or symptom heterogeneity, and explore prediction of pharmacotherapy response."}, {"Title": "[A case of lithium intoxication with reversible parkinsonism].", "Abstract": "A 73-year-old man, who had been treated for bipolar disorder since he was 39 years old, was admitted because he had developed difficulty in walking and moving his hands for the past 2 months. He was suspected of having Parkinson's syndrome. On admission, his blood lithium level was at the upper limit of normal (1.34\u00a0mEq/l), but his food intake gradually decreased and his communication difficulties worsened. On the sixth day of hospitalization, his blood lithium level was in the toxic range (2.44\u00a0mEq/l). His general condition, including motor symptoms, improved after lithium medication was discontinued and infusions (normal saline) were started. On the 24th day of admission, he was transferred to the psychiatry department for a psychotropic medication adjustment. It is important to note that chronic intoxication can occur even at the upper limit of the therapeutic range and that salt reduction at the start of the inpatient diet may be a trigger for intoxication."}, {"Title": "Coping strategies of the incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review protocol of quantitative and qualitative evidence.", "Abstract": "To reduce the transmission of COVID-19, regulations included the use of cloth masks, sanitising regularly, maintaining social distance and having minimal personal contact.

Sleep debt is a term describing the difference between the amount of sleep needed, and the amount of sleep obtained. Sleep debt can accumulate over time, resulting in poor cognitive performance, increased sleepiness, poor mood, and a higher risk for accidents. Over the last 30 years, the sleep field has increasingly focused attention on recovery sleep and the ways we can recover from a sleep debt faster and more effectively. While there are still many unanswered questions and debates about the nature of recovery sleep, such as the exact components of sleep important for recovery of function, the amount of sleep needed to recover and the impacts of prior sleep history on recovery, recent research has revealed several important attributes about recovery sleep: (1) the dynamics of the recovery process is impacted by the type of sleep loss (acute versus chronic), (2) mood, sleepiness, and other aspects of cognitive performance recover at different rates, and (3) the recovery process is complex and dependent on the length of recovery sleep and the number of recovery opportunities available. This review will summarize the current state of the literature on recovery sleep, from specific studies of recovery sleep dynamics to napping, \"banking\" sleep and shiftwork, and will suggest the next steps for research in this field.

We applied the Rank Equity Index (REI) to compare the longitudinal progress of women's academic medicine careers. We hypothesized that women have different rank parity in promotion by specialty based on the proportion of women in the specialty. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Aggregate data by sex for medical students, residents, assistant professors, associate professors, and professors in nine specialties were obtained from the Association of American Medical Colleges for 2019-2020. Specialties were clustered into terciles based on the proportion of women in the field: upper (obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry), middle (internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia), and lower (surgery, urology, and orthopedic surgery). We calculated the percentage representation by sex by specialty and rank to calculate REI. Specialty-specific REI comparisons between each rank were performed to assess parity in advancement. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Only specialties in the upper tercile recruited proportionally more women medical students to residency training. All specialties advanced women for the resident-to-assistant professor with psychiatry, internal medicine, emergency medicine, anesthesia, urology, and orthopedic surgery that promoted women faculty at rates above parity. No specialty demonstrated parity in advancement based on sex for the assistant professor-to-associate professor or associate professor-to-professor transitions. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Gender inequity in advancement is evident in academic medicine starting at the assistant professor-to-associate professor stage, regardless of overall proportion of women in the specialty.

We performed discourse analysis on 12 interviews with Danish mental health practitioners, who had been conducting either transdiagnostic psychotherapy (The Unified Protocol) or standard group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with patients treated for anxiety disorders or major depressive disorder. The purpose of this study was to identify how patients with anxiety and depression were represented by therapists. We identified a \"training discourse,\" within which patients were evaluated through perceived motivation, responsibility, active participation, and progression. We argue that this training discourse can be related to a broader neoliberal order of discourse valuing efficiency and agency. The analysis indicated that patients with anxiety were sometimes \"favorized\" over patients with depression, and it is argued that the neoliberal order of discourse and pre-assumptions related to the diagnoses are contributing to this. The interviews indicate that multiple discourses were applied when describing patients, and ambivalence was often detectable.

The quality of care in the rehabilitation unit was examined using the Quality Indicator for Rehabilitative Care (QuIRC), and the cost analysis was conducted using data obtained from a single-payer government medical service insurance (MSI) billing system.\nOf the 185 patients admitted over the study period, 158 were discharged. There was a significant reduction in readmission rate (64% decrease), LOS (6,585 fewer days spent in hospital), and ER presentations (166 fewer visits) (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), respectively. There were substantial subsequent cost savings in the post-rehabilitation year.\nIn the 3-year study, an inpatient psychiatric rehabilitation service in Nova Scotia, Canada, resulted in the successful discharge of most patients with severe and persistent mental illness to more socially inclusive environments. It also reduced their post-rehabilitation mental health service utilization, hence greatly enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of these services."}, {"Title": "The Role of Circadian Rhythmicity and CLOCK Genes in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations, that perpetuate themselves even in the absence of \"zeitgebers\" (external time cues), with a period of approximately 24\u2009hours. The master pacemaker is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is entrained by environmental factors, particularly light, to the 24-hour light-dark cycle by the Earth's rotation. Peripheral circadian oscillators, located in multiple cell types and tissues, are controlled by signals arising from the SCN and from the environment, particularly food intake, hormonal signals and body-temperature fluctuations.

Its use has been justified as an alternative to prison to reduce recidivism and allowing early release of prisoners, however, the evidence base for this remains mixed. In 2010, it was employed for the first time in a forensic psychiatry setting. A study investigating the effects of EM on leave episodes concluded that EM may improve the speed of patient progress and reduce the length of admission, leading to reduced costs and increased public safety. However, the intervention generated considerable controversy and sparked discussion about ethical concerns. Here, we consider specifically legal and human rights issues that emerge from use of EM in forensic healthcare settings, scrutinising its use in the context of the Mental Health Act and the Human Rights Act. We conclude that EM is legal and justifiable, providing it is used judiciously and with due consideration of concerns for the individual and the given context."}, {"Title": "A commentary on Perlstein et\u00a0al.

Their meta-analysis provides clear and convincing evidence that many treatments that reduce conduct problems in youth are also effective for children with elevated CU traits. However, their findings also indicate that CU traits are a severity indicator, in that youth high on these traits start treatment with more severe behavior problems and, despite improving with treatment, often leave treatment with more severe behavior problems. Such findings provide a clear focus for future research to adapt existing treatments to be more effective for youth with elevated CU traits. Further, the findings from the meta-analysis suggested that while treatments overall were not effective in reducing callous-unemotional traits, high-quality parenting interventions show promise for improving this outcome."}, {"Title": "The importance and challenges of improving early identification of language abilities: a commentary on Gasparini et\u00a0al.

Many patients identified as being at risk do not go on to become violent or aggressive. Efforts to automate the assessment of risk involve training machine learning (ML) models on data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict these behaviours. However, no studies to date have examined which patient groups may be over-represented in false positive predictions, despite evidence of social and clinical biases that may lead to higher perceptions of risk in patients defined by intersecting features (eg, race, gender). Because risk assessment can impact psychiatric care (eg, via coercive measures, such as restraints), it is unclear which patients might be underserved or harmed by the application of ML.\nWe pilot a computational ethnography to study how the integration of ML into risk assessment might impact acute psychiatric care, with a focus on how EHR data is compiled and used to predict a risk of violence or aggression. Our objectives include: (1) evaluating an ML model trained on psychiatric EHRs to predict violent or aggressive incidents for intersectional bias; and (2) completing participant observation and qualitative interviews in an emergency psychiatric setting to explore how social, clinical and structural biases are encoded in the training data. Our overall aim is to study the impact of ML applications in acute psychiatry on marginalised and underserved patient groups.\nThe project was approved by the research ethics board at The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (053/2021).

Psychometric properties of the French VOCI-MC and CTAF were investigated. Results showed that the French versions of the VOCI-MC and the CTAF had high internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, as well as good temporal stability. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed a one-factor structure for the two scales in both non-clinical and OCD samples.

This represents a major health burden with a high mortality and poor prognosis. Reducing alcohol consumption is key to improving health outcomes and long-term mortality. Therefore, various measures have been implemented to aid in the reduction of alcohol consumption. On a population level, this includes minimum unit pricing to reduce alcohol purchases. On a patient level, evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacological therapies aid in achieving and maintaining alcohol abstinence, which will be explored through this case report. A 39-year-old male with a four-year history of alcohol excess was admitted to a regional hospital. He presented with acute onset jaundice and examination findings were consistent with signs of chronic liver disease including abdominal distension and confusion. Investigations supported a diagnosis of severe ARH in this alcohol-dependent patient. Upon discharge, the patient received regular online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions to aid in his abstinence. Psychosocial therapy for alcohol abstinence can be categorized into brief and extended interventions. Brief interventions are short counseling sessions, which may be most effective in non-alcohol-dependent patients, whereas extended therapies including CBT, motivational enhancement therapy, and 12-step facilitation are longer regular therapies that may be more effective for alcohol-dependent patients. Some pharmacotherapies are contraindicated in ARH patients due to their hepatotoxicity and liver metabolism. However, acamprosate and baclofen are appropriate and effective treatments. Combining psychosocial and pharmacological therapy may be more beneficial than individual treatments to achieve and maintain abstinence."}, {"Title": "Safety, tolerability, and clinical and neural effects of single-dose psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover trial.", "Abstract": "Psilocybin may help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Two dimensions of burnout, emotional exhaustion (EE) and declined personal accomplishment (DPA), were assessed using Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI-HSMP), a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess mental health conditions. An unconditional logistic regression model was employed to discern the correlators.\nThere was an overall prevalence of depression (34.9%), anxiety (22.5%), EE (44.6%), and DPA (36.5%) in the participants; the highest prevalence of EE and DPA was discovered in the first wave (47.4% and 36.5%, respectively), then the second wave (44.9% and 34.0%), and the third wave had the lowest prevalence of 42.3% and 32.2%. Depressive symptoms and anxiety were persistently correlated with a higher prevalence risk of both EE and DPA. Workplace violence led to a higher prevalence risk of EE (wave 1: OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.16-1.63), and women (wave 1: OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.00-1.42; wave 3: OR =1.20, 95% CI:1.01-1.44) and those living in a central area (wave 2: OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.20-2.31) or west area (wave 2: OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.26-1.87) also had a higher prevalence risk of EE.

The secondary impacts of the pandemic and our response with respect to pediatric mental health has been a subject of significant discussion in the lay public, media, and decision-maker groups. The initiatives to control SARS-CoV-2 have become politicized. A narrative emerged early that strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus were harming children's mental health. Position statements from professional organizations in Canada have been used to support this claim. The aim of this commentary is to provide a reanalysis of some of the data and research methodology used to support these position statements. Some of the direct claims such as \"online learning is harmful,\" should be supported by a strong evidence base with significant consensus that speaks directly to causality. We find that the quality of the studies and the heterogeneity of the results does not support the strength of the unequivocal claims made by these position statements. In a sample of the current literature examining the issue, we find that outcomes range from improvements to deteriorations. Earlier studies relying on cross-sectional surveys typically have shown stronger negative effects than longitudinal cohort studies, which often have also shown groups of children experiencing no changes to measured mental health characteristics or groups that have experienced improvements. We argue it is imperative that policymakers use the highest quality evidence in making the best decisions.

We used a specifically designed questionnaire to explore possible mediators of the placebo response in 88 participants of the CBA trial who received a placebo and had valid outcome scores. The parents of 67 participants completed the questionnaire. The placebo response was positively associated with the child's comprehension of the treatment purpose (<i>p</i> = 0.037). There was also a trend for participants who had a relative aggravation of symptoms before treatment onset to improve following placebo treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.053). No other domains, including parental expectations, previous positive experience with similar treatments (behavioral conditioning), parental locus of control, quality of the patient-physician relationships, and adherence to study medications were associated with placebo-response.

Within a larger study, two years of ERG sessions have been used as an intervention to stimulate ethical reflection about the use of coercive measures. We studied changes in: employees' attitudes regarding the use of coercion, team competence, user involvement, team cooperation and the handling of disagreement in teams.\nWe used panel data in a longitudinal design study to measure variation in survey scores from multidisciplinary employees from seven departments within three Norwegian mental health care institutions at three time points (T0-T1-T2). Mixed models were used to account for dependence of data in persons who participated more than once.\nIn total, 1068 surveys (from 817 employees who did and did not participate in ERG) were included in the analyses. Of these, 7.6% (N\u2009=\u200962) responded at three points in time, 15.5% (N\u2009=\u2009127) at two points, and 76.8% (N\u2009=\u2009628) once. On average, over time, respondents who participated in ERG viewed coercion more strongly as offending (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

We observed significant differences in outcomes between individuals from different departments, as well as between different professions. Initial significant changes due to frequency of participation in ERG and case presentation in ERG did not remain statistically significant after adjustment for Departments and Professions. Differences were generally small in absolute terms, possibly due to the low amount of longitudinal data.\nThis study measured specific intervention-related outcome parameters for describing the impact of clinical ethics support (CES).

Despite current treatments, more than half of patients relapse within weeks after treatment. In animal models, exposure to environmental enrichment (EE) has been shown to be a promising approach to reduce relapse. However, controlled, multimodal EE is difficult to transpose to humans. To address this gap, this study aims at assessing the effectiveness of exposure to a newly designed EE protocol during AUD treatment in reducing relapse to alcohol use. Our EE will allow an enhancement of the standard intervention, and will combine several promising enrichment factors identified in the literature-physical activity, cognitive stimulation, mindfulness and virtual reality (VR).\nA randomised controlled trial involving 135 participants receiving treatment for severe AUD will be conducted. Patients will be randomised to an intervention enhancement group or a control group. The enhanced intervention will consist of six 40-min sessions of EE spread over 9 days. During the first 20 min of these sessions, patients will practise mindfulness in multisensory VR, in virtual environments designed to practise mindfulness and use it to regulate craving induced by virtual cues or stress. Then, participants will practise indoor cycling combined with cognitive training exercises. The control group will undergo standard management for AUD. The primary outcome is relapse assessed at 2 weeks after treatment, using a questionnaire and biological indicators. Relapse will be defined as drinking at least five drinks per occasion or drinking at least five times a week. It is predicted that the group receiving the EE intervention will have a lower relapse rate than the control group. The secondary outcomes are relapse at 1 month and 3 months after treatment, craving and drug-seeking behaviour, mindfulness skills acquisition and the effect of the intervention enhancement on the perceived richness of the daily environment, assessed by questionnaires and neuropsychological tasks.\nAll participants have to give written informed consent to the investigator.

For Canadian veterans experiencing barriers to accessing healthcare, telehealth may be a promising alternative with comparable effectiveness to in-person services; however, the potential benefits and limitations of telehealth require further examination to determine its long-term utility, and to inform health policy and planning. The goal of the present research was to identify predictors and barriers to telehealth usage in Canadian veterans in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nData were drawn from baseline data of a longitudinal survey examining the psychological functioning of Canadian veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 1144 Canadian veterans aged 18-93 years (M<sub>age</sub>=56.24, SD<i>=</i>12.92; 77.4% men). We assessed reported telehealth use (ie, for mental healthcare, physical healthcare), healthcare access (ie, difficulty accessing care, avoidance of care) and mental health and stress since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, sociodemographic variables and open-ended responses about telehealth experiences.\nFindings suggest that sociodemographic factors and previous telehealth use were significantly associated with telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative evidence highlighted both the benefits (eg, reducing barriers of access) and drawbacks (eg, not all services can be delivered) of telehealth services.\nThis paper provided a deeper understanding of Canadian veterans' experiences with accessing telehealth care during the COVID-19 pandemic. While for some, the use of telehealth mitigated perceived barriers (eg, safety concerns of leaving home), others felt that not all health services could be appropriately carried out through telehealth. Altogether, findings support the use of telehealth services in increasing care accessibility for Canadian veterans. Continued use of quality telehealth services may be a valuable form of care that extends the reach of healthcare professionals."}, {"Title": "Editorial: How Online Treatment Research Can Enrich Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Evidence is accumulating that treatment for psychiatric problems can in some cases be effectively delivered online.<sup>1</sup> Online treatment does not necessarily imply less therapist support (eg, treatment can be delivered through video call), but most online treatments are at least in part self-directed.

Scarce monetary and staff resources impose an ongoing challenge. Therapeutic leaves (TL) are an established clinical tool in psychiatry possibly improving therapy outcome and potentially lowering direct mental healthcare costs in the long term. We thus examined the association between TL and direct inpatient healthcare costs.\nWe analyzed the association between the number of TL and direct inpatient healthcare costs in a sample of 3151 inpatients, using a tweedie multiple regression model, including eleven confounders. Using multiple linear (bootstrap) and logistic regression models we assessed the robustness of our results.\nThe tweedie model showed that the number of TL was associated with lower costs following the initial inpatient stay (B\u00a0=\u00a0-.141, CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a0[-0.225, -.057], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Results of the multiple linear and the logistic regression models matched those of the tweedie model.\nOur findings suggest a link between TL and direct inpatient healthcare costs. TL might lower direct inpatient healthcare costs. In the future RCTs might examine whether an increased utilization of TL leads to a reduction of outpatient treatment costs and evaluate the association of TL with outpatient treatment costs and indirect costs. The systematic use of TL during inpatient treatment could reduce healthcare costs following the initial inpatient stay which is highly relevant due to global rise of mental illness and the associated financial pressure on healthcare systems."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatrists' use, attitudes, and understanding of genetic testing and pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to report current practices and attitudes of child and adolescent psychiatrists (CAP) regarding diagnostic genetic and pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing. We surveyed 958 US-based practicing CAP. 54.9% of respondents indicated that they had ordered/referred for a genetic test in the past 12 months. 87% of respondents agreed that it is their role to discuss genetic information regarding psychiatric conditions with their patients; however, 45% rated their knowledge of genetic testing practice guidelines as poor/very poor. The most ordered test was PGx (32.2%), followed by chromosomal microarray (23.0%). 73.4% reported that PGx is at least slightly useful in child and adolescent psychiatry. Most (62.8%) were asked by a patient/family to order PGx in the past 12 months and 41.7% reported they would order PGx in response to a family request. Those who ordered a PGx test were more likely to have been asked by a patient/family and to work in private practice. 13.8% of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that a PGx test can predict the effectiveness of specific antidepressants. Some respondents also indicated they would make clinical changes based on PGx information even if a medication was currently effective and there were no side effects. Genetic testing has become routine clinical care in child and adolescent psychiatry. Despite this, many providers rate their associated knowledge as poor/very poor. Patient requests were associated with ordering practices and providers misinterpretation of PGx may be leading to unnecessary changes in clinical management.

Cooperating with a psychiatric hospital in Austria, through a transdisciplinary research approach including focus groups and workshops, a framework for an integrated Digital Mental Health Tool was established. The findings leading to the framework show a strong need for patient-empowerment, enhancement of trust in technology and the need for multi-stakeholder cooperation.

Four major themes emerged from the reported studies: the need for addressing information needs on managing BPSD, the role of support systems in managing BPSD, self-care for carers and the role of mHealth applications in providing education and support for carers. In managing BPSD, carers seek knowledge about dementia and BPSD, the roles of the carers and misconceptions about BPSD. One study reported an mHealth application to monitor the behavioural issues of people with dementia.\nInformal carers of people with dementia face a number of challenges when providing care for BPSD of their care recipients. The lack of knowledge on managing BPSD is a significant challenge. Support systems such as professional, social, residential, legal and eHealth have a significant role in managing the BPSD of people with dementia in the community. mHealth interventions are sparse to support BPSD management. These findings can be used in designing an mHealth application that addresses needs related to managing BPSD of informal carers of people with dementia.\nCRD42021238540."}, {"Title": "Feasibility randomised controlled trial of online group Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Functional Cognitive Disorder (ACT4FCD).", "Abstract": "Functional cognitive disorder (FCD) is seen increasingly in clinics commissioned to assess cognitive disorders.

Further, we observed a halving of cases treated for alcohol intoxication. However, we discovered no change for the frequency of psychiatric emergency treatments nationwide. A more detailed analysis revealed that, in areas with a low number of child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient beds, emergency care was prioritized and LoS decreased, whereas in areas with a fair bed-to-inhabitant ratio among minors, there was a trend toward increased LoS, also in pediatric departments.

Suicide was the leading cause of unnatural mortality in patients with schizophrenia receiving homecare CM intervention in Taiwan. We noted the preferred suicide methods, high medical utilization, and comorbidities before suicide. Thus, we suggest that the CM team should assess lethal methods for suicide and ensure that patients adhere to psychiatry treatment for improving the current care model for this specified population."}, {"Title": "Mitochondrial Health Index Correlates with Plasma Circulating Cell-Free Mitochondrial DNA in Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Although mitochondria dysfunction is known to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD), there is a glaring gap in our understanding of how mitochondrial dysfunction can modulate clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to evaluate the composite mitochondrial health index (MHI) in BD subjects and non-psychiatry controls (Non-psychiatry controls). We will also explore whether lower MIH will be related to higher cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) levels and poor clinical outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Fourteen BD-I patients and 16 age- and sex-matched non-psychiatry controls were enrolled for this study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were used to measure the enzymatic activities of citrate synthase and complexes I, II, and IV and mtDNA copy number. ccf-mtDNA was evaluated by qPCR in plasma. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) proteins were evaluated by western blotting. <b>Results:</b> One-Way ANCOVA after controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status showed that patients with BD present a decrease in the MHI compared to non-psychiatry controls, and higher ccf-mtDNA levels, which was negatively correlated with MHI. Because the MQC network is essential to maintain mitochondrial health, we also evaluated the relationship between MQC-related proteins with MHI and ccf-mtDNA. Our results showed that MHI negatively correlated with Fis-1 and positively with Opa-1 and LC3. Moreover, we found a negative correlation between ccf-mtDNA, Opa-1, and LC3 and a positive correlation between cff-mtDNA and Fis-1. Finally, we found that subjects with longer illness duration, higher depressive symptom scores, and worse functional status had lower MHI and higher ccf-mtDNA. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, the present findings corroborate previous studies and provide strong support for the hypothesis that mitochondrial regulation and function are integral parts of the pathogenesis of BD."}, {"Title": "The 100 Top-Cited Studies on Loneliness: A Bibliometric Analysis.", "Abstract": "The present study explores characteristics of the top 100 most-cited articles on loneliness.

This study uses a Life Cycle Assessment with retrospective clinical data from Stanford Health Care (SHC) in 2019-2021 to determine the environmental emissions associated with in-person and virtual clinic visits. SHC saw 13% increase in clinic visits, but due to the rise in telemedicine services, the Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHGs) from these visits decreased 36% between 2019 and 2021. Telemedicine (phone and video appointments) helped SHC avoid approximately 17,000 metric tons of GHGs in 2021. Some departments, such as psychiatry and cancer achieved greater GHG reductions, as they were able to perform more virtual visits.

The paucity of adequately trained practitioners in Interventional Psychiatry further exacerbates inequities in the ability of eligible patients to access and benefit from these approaches. This paper explores the rates of utilization of Interventional Psychiatry treatments, the current state of education in these treatments, and the role that training can play in translating scientific advances in this area to ensure equitable access and maximum impact at a population level. The majority of the discussion is centered on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the most established and available of these treatments, highlighting how enhancing education and training in ECT can reduce barriers to its utilization. It is argued that innovations in pedagogical approaches for disseminating the learning of these procedures are needed to increase the current low rates of competency in these treatments and can facilitate the more rapid dissemination of other Interventional Psychiatry approaches and neurotechnologies, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound."}, {"Title": "Study protocol: how does parental stress measured by clinical scales and voice acoustic stress markers predict children's response to PTSD trauma-focused therapies?", "Abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in youth are influenced by parental anxiety and stress. When parents have high levels of stress or have developed PTSD themselves, children tend to show more anxiety symptoms. Parental stress can affect the severity of children's PTSD and lower the success of recovery. However, the influence of parental stress on the effectiveness of trauma-focused therapies (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing and cognitive behavioural therapy) has not yet been investigated to our knowledge. Hence, we will measure parental stress (using both validated scales and vocal acoustic markers) and investigate how it influences children's PTSD recovery.\nSixty children between the ages of 7 and 15 years who experienced type 1 trauma will be recruited at the Nice Pediatric Psychotrauma Center in France. We plan to measure stress using two different approaches. We will ask parents to answer validated scales of stress and mood in general. Stress will also be measured using vocal acoustic markers. Parents will be recorded while narrating their child's trauma and during the narrative of a positive and neutral recall of events. Child participants will have to complete anxiety, PTSD and depression scales before the beginning of the trauma-focused therapy and after 3\u2009months of treatment.Linear mixed effects models and differential statistics, such as significance testing corrected for multiple testing, will be used to determine the validity of speech features for the proposed hypotheses.

Three hypotheses are proposed that could (partly) explain this increase: 1) Courts' tendency to hand down this decision even in cases involving minor offences. 2) Courts' tendency to hand down this decision despite positive prognoses. 3) Changes in the reporting practices of psychiatric clinics. Overly simple explanations for the increase in temporary placements, therefore, fall short. This makes it more urgent to strengthen the primary-prevention approach. It is imperative that the small percentage of people with mental illness and an increased propensity to violence be identified and treated to prevent violence in the general psychiatric care stage.

This complication causes patients to become impaired, posing safety concerns for both hospital staff and patients. Furthermore, there is an increased risk of worsening functional disability and death. Despite medical advances, DSD provides both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to providers. Identifying at-risk patients and providing personalized medicine and patient care can decrease disease burden in a time-efficient manner. This review delves into bioinformatics-based studies of DSD in order to design and implement a personalized medicine-based approach. Our findings suggest alternative medical treatment methods based on gene-gene interactions, gene-microRNA (miRNA) interactions, gene-drug interactions, and pharmacogenetic variants involved in dementia and psychiatric disorders. We identify 17 genes commonly associated with both dementia and delirium including apolipoprotein E\u00a0(ApoE), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), acetylcholinesterase\u00a0(AChE), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), prion protein (PrP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 1 (SPTLC1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S), superoxide dismutase 1\u00a0(SOD1), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), neurofilament light (NFL), neurofilament heavy, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A), and serpin family A member 3 (ERAP3). In addition, we identify six main genes that form an inner concentric model, as well as their associated miRNA. The FDA-approved medications that were found to be effective against the six main genes were identified. Furthermore, the PharmGKB database was used to identify variants of these six genes in order to suggest future treatment options. We also looked at previous research and evidence on biomarkers that could be used to detect DSD.

Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event-related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error-related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting-state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well-defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial. Finally, it should never be forgotten that, for a biomarker to be actionable, it will need to be clinically predictive at the individual level and viable in clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Evolutionary psychiatry: foundations, progress and challenges.", "Abstract": "Evolutionary biology provides a crucial foundation for medicine and behavioral science that has been missing from psychiatry. Its absence helps to explain slow progress; its advent promises major advances. Instead of offering a new kind of treatment, evolutionary psychiatry provides a scientific foundation useful for all kinds of treatment. It expands the search for causes from mechanistic explanations for disease in some individuals to evolutionary explanations for traits that make all members of a species vulnerable to disease. For instance, capacities for symptoms such as pain, cough, anxiety and low mood are universal because they are useful in certain situations. Failing to recognize the utility of anxiety and low mood is at the root of many problems in psychiatry. Determining if an emotion is normal and if it is useful requires understanding an individual's life situation. Conducting a review of social systems, parallel to the review of systems in the rest of medicine, can help achieve that understanding. Coping with substance abuse is advanced by acknowledging how substances available in modern environments hijack chemically mediated learning mechanisms. Understanding why eating spirals out of control in modern environments is aided by recognizing the motivations for caloric restriction and how it arouses famine protection mechanisms that induce binge eating. Finally, explaining the persistence of alleles that cause serious mental disorders requires evolutionary explanations of why some systems are intrinsically vulnerable to failure. The thrill of finding functions for apparent diseases is evolutionary psychiatry's greatest strength and weakness. Recognizing bad feelings as evolved adaptations corrects psychiatry's pervasive mistake of viewing all symptoms as if they were disease manifestations. However, viewing diseases such as panic disorder, melancholia and schizophrenia as if they are adaptations is an equally serious mistake in evolutionary psychiatry. Progress will come from framing and testing specific hypotheses about why natural selection left us vulnerable to mental disorders. The efforts of many people over many years will be needed before we will know if evolutionary biology can provide a new paradigm for understanding and treating mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Neuroscience-based nomenclature as a teaching tool, introduction and pilot study.", "Abstract": "Neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN) is a pharmacologically-driven nomenclature aiming to replace the current disease-based nomenclature of psychotropics, focusing on pharmacology and mode-of-action to encourage scientifically-minded prescribing.

The onset of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is critically modulated by stressors that may alter the epigenetic pattern, a putative signature marker of exposure to environmental risk factors. In this study, we estimated the age-related epigenetic modifications to assess the differences between young individuals at familial high risk (FHR) and controls and their association with environmental stressors. The sample included 117 individuals (6-17 years) at FHR (45%) and a control group (55%). Blood and saliva samples were used estimate the epigenetic age with six epigenetic clocks through methylation data. Environmental risk was measured with obstetric complications, socioeconomic statuses and recent stressful life events data. Epigenetic age was correlated with chronological age. FHR individuals showed epigenetic age deacceleration of Horvath and Hannum epigenetic clocks compared to controls. No effect of the environmental risk factors on the epigenetic age acceleration could be detected. Epigenetic age acceleration adjusted by cell counts showed that the FHR group was deaccelerated also with the PedBE epigenetic clock.

Existing ethical frameworks for return of individual research results (IRRs) are inadequate to guide researchers for when, if, and how to return this unprecedented number of potentially sensitive results about each participant's real-world behavior. To address this gap, we convened an interdisciplinary expert working group, supported by a National Institute of Mental Health grant. Building on established guidelines and the emerging norm of returning results in participant-centered research, we present a novel framework specific to the ethical, legal, and social implications of returning IRRs in digital phenotyping research. Our framework offers researchers, clinicians, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) urgently needed guidance, and the principles developed here in the context of psychiatry will be readily adaptable to other therapeutic areas."}, {"Title": "Facilitating a safe and caring atmosphere in everyday life in forensic mental health wards - a qualitative study.", "Abstract": "To explore healthcare professionals' experiences with facilitating a safe and caring atmosphere in patients' everyday lives in forensic mental health wards.\nThis qualitative study employed interviews with 16 healthcare professionals working shifts in two forensic mental healthcare wards in Norway. Data were analysed using phenomenological hermeneutic analysis.\nThe findings are presented in terms of two themes. The first theme is \"Creating a calming atmosphere\" and includes the subthemes \"Creating caring surroundings with safety, comfort and trust\" and \"Balancing everyday life activities\". The second theme is \"Facilitating risk assessments and care\" and includes the subthemes \"Acting as a team\", \"Becoming aware of the meaning in signs\" and \"Becoming aware of vulnerability and the window of tolerance\".\nInvolvement in patients' history and lived lives is important both for understanding general social behaviour as well as for assessing signs, symptoms, and changes in patients' conditions; furthermore, it provides valuable information that allows healthcare professionals to become aware of the underlying meanings in signs, which can facilitate examinations and treatment. Acting as a team is essential to solve issues in a calm and safe way when signs of violence occur. In addition, our participants highlighted the need to be aware of individual patients' vulnerability and windows of tolerance to obtain a deeper understanding of patients' lived lives as a whole in the context of providing therapy and care to patients."}, {"Title": "Learning Clinical Reasoning: The Experience of Postgraduate Psychiatry Trainee Doctors in Qatar.", "Abstract": "<b><i>Phenomenon:</i></b> <i>As a core competency in medical education, clinical reasoning</i> is a pillar for reducing medical errors and promoting patient safety. Clinical reasoning is a complex phenomenon studied through the lens of multiple theories. Although cognitive psychology theories transformed our understanding of clinical reasoning, the theories fell short of explaining the variations in clinical reasoning influenced by contextual factors. Social cognitive theories propose a dynamic relationship between learners' cognitive process and their social and physical environments. This dynamic relationship highlights the essential role of formal and informal learning environments for learning clinical reasoning. <b><i>Approach</i></b>: My research aimed to explore the personal experience of learning clinical reasoning in a sample of postgraduate psychiatry trainee doctors using cognitive psychology and social cognitive theories. A stratified convenience sample of seven psychiatry trainee doctors working in the Mental Health Services in Qatar completed semi-structured interviews in 2020. I analyzed the data manually using theoretical thematic analysis. <b><i>Findings:</i></b> I identified three overarching themes with multiple subthemes. The first theme was the hierarchical cultural impact on perceived learning opportunities and learning behavior. The first theme had two subthemes that explored the relationship with team members and the expected hierarchy roles. The second theme was the impact of emotions on the learning and execution of clinical reasoning.The second theme had three subthemes that explored the personal approach to managing emotions related to perceived self-efficacy and professional image. The third theme was characteristics of learning environments and their role in learning clinical reasoning. The last theme included three subthemes that explored stressful, autonomous, and interactive environments. <b><i>Insights:</i></b> The results accentuate the complexity of clinical reasoning. Trainees' experience of learning clinical reasoning was influenced by factors not controlled for in the curricula. These factors constitute a hidden curriculum with a significant influence on learning. Our local postgraduate training programmes will benefit from addressing the points raised in this study for effective and culturally sensitive clinical reasoning learning."}, {"Title": "When radical uncertainty is too much: Clinical aspects of Conviction Narrative Theory.", "Abstract": "We propose extrapolating Conviction Narrative Theory (CNT) to clinical psychology and psychiatry.

However, most of the evidence comes from mothers who are either symptomatic or did not have adequate mental health support. In this context, our objective was to explore if symptom status in mothers and bonding share any significant association with the infants' development and quality of life (QOL), in case of mothers with severe mental illnesses in remission.\nThe study included 41 mother-infant dyads from the outpatient perinatal psychiatry services and the mother-baby unit of the current study center. Symptom status, self-reported bonding, mother-infant interactions, and infants' development and QOL were assessed with Clinical Global Impressions, Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, Pediatric Infant-Parent Exam, Developmental Assessment Scales for Indian Infants, and Pediatric Quality of Life Scale, respectively.\nMost mothers had a complete recovery or minimal symptoms. Nine (22%) infants had a significant developmental delay. Atypical play-based interactions were observed in nine (22%) mothers. Self-reported bonding and bonding as evinced over play-based interactions did not significantly correlate with the QOL or development of the infants. Mothers who have recovered and are functioning well reported good bonding with their infants, though objective assessment revealed specific difficulties. Symptom severity correlated with poor physical QOL in infants.\nThe association between mothers' bonding and infants' mental health is domain-specific and differential than linear and robust. Infants of mothers with severe mental illnesses postpartum should be routinely monitored for mother-infant bonding, development, and quality of life."}, {"Title": "Transcultural skills for early childhood professionals.", "Abstract": "Transcultural skills are especially useful for those involved in the perinatal period, when parents and babies must adapt to one another in a setting of migration a long a focus of transcultural clinical practice.\nThe aim of this article is to provide useful transcultural skills for any health care worker (e.g., psychologists, child psychiatrists, midwives, family doctors, pediatricians, specialized child-care attendants, and social workers) who provide care or support to families during the perinatal period. It highlights the cultural aspects requiring attention in relation to representations of pregnancy, children's needs, obstetric complications, and postnatal problems. Taking into account the impact of culture on clinical evaluation and treatment can enable professionals to distinguish what involves cultural representations of pregnancy, babies, and sometimes of disease from what is associated with interaction disorders or maternal psychopathology.\nAfter explaining the relevance of transcultural clinical practices to provide migrant mothers with better support, we describe 9 themes useful to explore from a transcultural perspective. This choice is based on the transcultural clinical practice in our specialized department.\nThe description of these 9 themes is intended to aid in their pragmatic application and is illustrated with short clinical vignettes for specific concepts. We describe situations that are extreme but often encountered in liaison transcultural clinical practice for maternity wards: perinatal mourning with cultural coding, mediation in refusal of care, cultural misunderstandings, situations of complex trauma and of multiple contextual vulnerabilities, and difficulties associated with acculturation.\nThe transcultural levers described here make it possible to limit cultural misunderstandings and to promote the therapeutic alliance. It presupposes the professionals will concomitantly analyze their cultural countertransference and acquire both the knowledge and know-how needed to understand the elements of cultural, political, and social issues needed to develop clinical finesse.\nThis combined theoretical-clinical article is intended to be pedagogical.

With high prevalence rates around the world and far-reaching, often chronic, individual, and societal implications, CSA and its leading risk factor, pedophilia, have been well investigated. This has led to a wide range of clinical tools and actuarial instruments for diagnosis and risk assessment regarding CSA. However, the neurobiological underpinnings of pedosexual behavior, specifically regarding hands-on pedophilic offenders (PO), remain elusive. Such biomarkers for PO individuals could potentially improve the early detection of high-risk PO individuals and enhance efforts to prevent future CSA.\nTo use machine learning and MRI data to identify PO individuals.\nFrom a single-center male cohort of 14 PO individuals and 15 matched healthy control (HC) individuals, we acquired diffusion tensor imaging data (anisotropy, diffusivity, and fiber tracking) in literature-based regions of interest (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and corpus callosum). We trained a linear support vector machine to discriminate between PO and HC individuals using these WM microstructure data. <i>Post hoc</i>, we investigated the PO model decision scores with respect to sociodemographic (age, education, and IQ) and forensic characteristics (psychopathy, sexual deviance, and future risk of sexual violence) in the PO subpopulation. We assessed model specificity in an external cohort of 53 HC individuals.\nThe classifier discriminated PO from HC individuals with a balanced accuracy of 75.5% (sensitivity = 64.3%, specificity = 86.7%, <i>P</i> <sub>5000</sub> = 0.018) and an out-of-sample specificity to correctly identify HC individuals of 94.3%. The predictive brain pattern contained bilateral fractional anisotropy in the anterior cingulate cortex, diffusivity in the left amygdala, and structural prefrontal cortex-amygdala connectivity in both hemispheres. This brain pattern was associated with the number of previous child victims, the current stance on sexuality, and the professionally assessed risk of future sexual violent reoffending.\nAberrant white matter microstructure in the prefronto-temporo-limbic circuit could be a potential neurobiological correlate for PO individuals at high-risk of reoffending with CSA. Although preliminary and exploratory at this point, our findings highlight the general potential of MRI-based biomarkers and particularly WM microstructure patterns for future CSA risk assessment and preventive efforts."}, {"Title": "Why psychiatry needs an honest dose of gentle medicine.", "Abstract": "The pharmaceutical industry's influence on psychiatric research and practice has been profound and has resulted in exaggerated claims of the effectiveness of psychotropic medications and an under-reporting of harms. After the regulatory approval of fluoxetine, the pharmaceutical industry began promoting (and continues to promote) a chemical imbalance theory of emotional distress. In the last decade, there has been an increased awareness about the limits of this theory and the risks of psychotropic medications. Nonetheless, the medicalization of distress, the sedimented belief in \"magic bullets,\" and the push to \"scale up\" mental health treatment have contributed to the meteoric rise in the prescription of psychiatric drugs and of polypharmacy. A major premise of this paper is that the conceptual framework of medical nihilism can help researchers and clinicians understand and address the harms incurred by inflated claims of the efficacy of psychotropic medications. We propose that psychiatry, and the mental health field more generally, adopt a model of 'gentle medicine' with regard to both the diagnosis of and treatment for mental health conditions and focus greater attention on the upstream causes of distress."}, {"Title": "Preparedness of final year medical students in caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients with mental illness.", "Abstract": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals have a higher prevalence of mental illness compared to the general population.

In addition, the oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in rats' frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus.\nOUA induced mania-like behavior and oxidative stress in rats' brains, but Li could reverse these alterations. FA did not affect behavior parameters; however, it presents an antioxidant effect on the brain structures evaluated.\nThe study was only evaluated male rats and ICV injection is an invasive procedure.\nThese results indicate that even though FA has an effect against the oxidative stress induced by OUA, this effect was not strong enough to interfere with behavior parameters."}, {"Title": "[A sport-health centre open to mental health].", "Abstract": "Physical activity is a determinant of the overall health and well-being of patients with mental disorders.

For both settings, complex needs have been described for the elderly related to age-related changes and frequent somatic disorders as well as mental disorders, primarily depressive symptoms.. One of the biggest challenges are cognitive impairments which have been described for both groups, probably not least due to frequent risk factors (e.g., substance abuse, depressive symptoms). Given that the group of forensic patients has a manifest mental illness, which is usually treated with psychopharmaceuticals, the question arises as to what extent cognitive deficits are more frequent here. For both groups, the detection of cognitive deficits with regard to therapy and release planning is of relevance. In sum, studies on cognitive function in both populations are rare, and the results are hard to compare due to different instruments to assess cognition. Sociodemographic, health-, and incarceration-related data were collected as well as neuropsychological functions using established instruments to evaluate global cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], DemTect), executive function (Frontal Assessment Battery [FAB], and Trail Making Test [TMT]). In the final sample, 57 prisoners and 34 forensic inpatients from North Rhine Westphalia, Germany being 60\u00a0years and older were included. The groups were comparable in age (prisoners: M\u00a0=\u00a066.5\u00a0years, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3; forensic inpatients: M\u00a0=\u00a066.8\u00a0years, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5) and education (prisoners: M\u00a0=\u00a011.47, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.91; forensic inpatients: M\u00a0=\u00a011.39, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.64), but the offenders in forensic psychiatry had spent significantly more time in the correctional setting than prisoners (prisoners: M\u00a0=\u00a08.6, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.8; forensic inpatients: M\u00a0=\u00a015.6\u00a0years, SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.9). In both groups cognitive deficits were frequent. Depending on the tests and population, between 42% and 64% showed impairments in global cognition, and between 22% and 70% were classified with impaired executive functioning. We found no significant differences in global cognition or executive functions assessed with the TMT between the two groups. However, forensic inpatients were significantly more impaired in the FAB compared to the prisoners.

This can bring two problems: (1) the information governance desirability of linkage without sharing direct identifiers, and (2) a requirement to link databases without a common person-unique identifier.\nWe develop a Bayesian matching technique to solve both. We provide an open-source software implementation capable of de-identified probabilistic matching despite discrepancies, via fuzzy representations and complete mismatches, plus de-identified deterministic matching if required. We validate the technique by testing linkage between multiple medical records systems in a UK National Health Service Trust, examining the effects of decision thresholds on linkage accuracy. We report demographic factors associated with correct linkage.\nThe system supports dates of birth (DOBs), forenames, surnames, three-state gender, and UK postcodes. Fuzzy representations are supported for all except gender, and there is support for additional transformations, such as accent misrepresentation, variation for multi-part surnames, and name re-ordering. Calculated log odds predicted a proband's presence in the sample database with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.997-0.999 for non-self database comparisons. Log odds were converted to a decision via a consideration threshold \u03b8 and a leader advantage threshold \u03b4. Defaults were chosen to penalize misidentification 20-fold versus linkage failure. By default, complete DOB mismatches were disallowed for computational efficiency. At these settings, for non-self database comparisons, the mean probability of a proband being correctly declared to be in the sample was 0.965 (range 0.931-0.994), and the misidentification rate was 0.00249 (range 0.00123-0.00429). Correct linkage was positively associated with male gender, Black or mixed ethnicity, and the presence of diagnostic codes for severe mental illnesses or other mental disorders, and negatively associated with birth year, unknown ethnicity, residential area deprivation, and presence of a pseudopostcode (e.g. indicating homelessness). Accuracy rates would be improved further if person-unique identifiers were also used, as supported by the software.

A total of 3505 documents were published between 1952 and 2021, with a trend toward increase in paper/year. The most common documents are original articles (2515, 71.8%), followed by review articles (341, 9.7%). Journal of Genetic Counseling publishes the highest number of genetic counseling articles (587, 16.7%), followed by Clinical Genetics (103, 2.9%) and the South American Journal of Medical Genetics (95, 2.7%). Co-occurrence analysis revealed five research themes: genetic testing, cancer, genetic counselor, prenatal diagnosis, and psychiatry. The genetic counselor theme contained most of the recent keywords, including \"covid-19,\" \"underrepresented population,\" \"service delivery models,\" \"workforce,\" \"disparities,\" \"service delivery,\" \"professional development,\" \"cultural competence,\" \"access,\" \"diversity,\" \"telemedicine,\" and \"health literacy.\" Genetic counseling researchers may use these keywords to find topics pertinent to their future research and practice."}, {"Title": "Do subtle cultural differences sculpt face pareidolia?", "Abstract": "Face tuning to non-face images such as shadows or grilled toasts is termed face pareidolia. Face-pareidolia images represent a valuable tool for investigation of social cognition in mental disorders. Here we examined (i) whether, and, if so, how face pareidolia is affected by subtle cultural differences; and (ii) whether this impact is modulated by gender. With this purpose in mind, females and males from Northern Italy were administered a set of Face-n-Thing images, photographs of objects such as houses or waves to a varying degree resembling a face. Participants were presented with pareidolia images with canonical upright orientation and display inversion that heavily affects face pareidolia. In a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, beholders had to indicate whether each image resembled a face. The outcome was compared with the findings obtained in the Southwest of Germany. With upright orientation, neither cultural background nor gender affected face pareidolia. As expected, display inversion generally mired face pareidolia. Yet, while display inversion led to a drastic reduction of face impression in German males as compared to females, in Italians, no gender differences were found. In a nutshell, subtle cultural differences do not sculpt face pareidolia, but instead affect face impression in a gender-specific way under unusual viewing conditions. Clarification of the origins of these effects requires tailored brain imaging work. Implications for transcultural psychiatry, in particular, for schizophrenia research, are highlighted and discussed."}, {"Title": "New Directions for Cultural Formulations in Forensic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatrists have called for greater attention to cultural and racial topics in assessing examinees. While suggestions for new methods are welcome, they can ignore the extent of scientific progress if existing assessments are not accurately appraised. This article analyzes the arguments of two recent publications in The Journal that mischaracterize the cultural formulation approach. Contrary to the idea that forensic psychiatrists have received little guidance on assessing an examinee's racial identity, the article shows that forensic psychiatrists have contributed to scholarship on assessing racial identifications through cultural formulations that elicit how minoritized ethnoracial examinees interpret their illness experiences and legal involvements. The article also seeks to dispel misunderstandings about the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), which clinicians have used to complete person-centered cultural assessments, including in forensic settings. Conducting research, practice, and educational activities on the cultural formulation can be ways for forensic psychiatrists to combat systemic racism."}, {"Title": "Study protocol of an open-label proof-of-concept trial examining the safety and clinical efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for veterans with PTSD.", "Abstract": "Psilocybin-assisted therapy has shown significant promise in treating the cluster of mood and anxiety symptoms that comprise post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but has yet to be tested specifically in this condition. Furthermore, current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are difficult to tolerate and limited in efficacy, especially in the US Military Veteran (USMV) population. This open-label pilot study will examine the safety and efficacy of two psilocybin administration sessions (15 mg and 25 mg), combined with psychotherapy, among USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD.\nWe will recruit 15 USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. Participants will receive one low dose (15 mg) and one moderate/high dose (25 mg) of psilocybin in conjunction with preparatory and post-psilocybin therapy sessions. The primary safety outcome will be the type, severity and frequency of adverse events and suicidal ideation/behaviour, as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The primary outcome measure for PTSD will be the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-5. The primary endpoint will be 1 month following the second psilocybin administration session, and the total follow-up time will be 6 months.\nAll participants will be required to provide written informed consent.

Understanding the placebo response is essential in accurately estimating the benefits of pharmacological agents; nevertheless, no studies have evaluated the placebo response across these disorders using a lifespan approach.\nWe searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies and international registers from inception to 9 September 2022. The primary outcome was the aggregate measure of internalising symptoms of participants in the placebo arms of randomised controlled trials designed to assess the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) in individuals diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or stress-related disorders. The secondary outcomes were placebo response and remission rates. Data were analysed through a three-level meta-analysis.\nWe analysed 366 outcome measures from 135 studies (n=12 583). We found a large overall placebo response (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-1.11, 95% CI -1.22 to -1.00). The average response and remission rates in placebo groups were 37% and 24%, respectively. Larger placebo response was associated with a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, when compared with panic, social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (SMD range, 0.40-0.49), and with absence of a placebo lead-in period (SMD=0.44, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.78). No significant differences were found in placebo response across age groups. We found substantial heterogeneity and moderate risk of bias.\nPlacebo response is substantial in SSRI and SNRI trials for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and stress-related disorders.

It is often emphasized that attempted suicide is a cry for help, and according to international studies, the pandemic year of 2020 massively impacted the frequency of suicide attempts among children. However, such studies have yet to appear in Poland.\nTo characterize the frequency, circumstances and methods of suicide attempts among children and adolescents, and investigate their relationship with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nThe study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 154 children admitted to the Emergency Department due to suicide attempts between January 2020 and June 2021.\nNo statistical relationship was found between the direct impact of the pandemic and suicide attempts among children and adolescents. However, age and gender influenced the methods used and the frequency of suicide attempts. Females are more likely to attempt suicide than males, and patients as young as 8 tried to take their own lives.\nDue to the increasing frequency of suicide attempts in children and adolescents, people at particular risk of such behaviors should be identified and provided with effective care. Unfortunately, although the vast majority of pediatric patients who attempted suicide had psychiatric consultations in the past, it did not prevent them from actively trying to end their lives. Furthermore, even children of a very young age are at risk of suicide events."}, {"Title": "Offenders and non-offenders with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: Do they really differ in known risk factors for aggression?", "Abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have an elevated risk for aggressive behavior, and several factors contributing to this risk have been identified, e. g. comorbid substance use disorders. From this knowledge, it could be inferred that offender patients show a higher expression of said risk factors than non-offender patients. Yet, there is a lack of comparative studies between those two groups, and findings gathered from one of the two are not directly applicable to the other due to numerous structural differences. The aim of this study therefore was to identify key differences in offender patients and non-offender patients regarding aggressive behavior through application of supervised machine learning, and to quantify the performance of the model.\nFor this purpose, we applied seven different (ML) algorithms on a dataset comprising 370 offender patients and a comparison group of 370 non-offender patients, both with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.\nWith a balanced accuracy of 79.9%, an AUC of 0.87, a sensitivity of 77.3% and a specificity of 82.5%, gradient boosting emerged as best performing model and was able to correctly identify offender patients in over 4/5 the cases. Out of 69 possible predictor variables, the following emerged as the ones with the most indicative power in distinguishing between the two groups: olanzapine equivalent dose at the time of discharge from the referenced hospitalization, failures during temporary leave, being born outside of Switzerland, lack of compulsory school graduation, out- and inpatient treatment(s) prior to the referenced hospitalization, physical or neurological illness as well as medication compliance.\nInterestingly, both factors related to psychopathology and to the frequency and expression of aggression itself did not yield a high indicative power in the interplay of variables, thus suggesting that while they individually contribute to aggression as a negative outcome, they are compensable through certain interventions. The findings contribute to our understanding of differences between offenders and non-offenders with SSD, showing that previously described risk factors of aggression may be counteracted through sufficient treatment and integration in the mental health care system."}, {"Title": "Improving Narrative Feedback for Resident-Led Academic Rounds: The Effects of Assessment Form Design Changes.", "Abstract": "Learners benefit more from narrative feedback than numerical scores on formative assessments, yet they often report that feedback is lacking in quality and quantity.

While various studies have investigated the relationships between temporary nurses' deployment and permanently-employed nurse outcomes, few anywhere, and none in Switzerland, have explored such deployments' relationships with permanently-employed nurses' job satisfaction, burnout, or intent to leave their organization or profession. Furthermore, especially in psychiatric hospitals, research on temporary nurse deployments and their association with permanently-employed nurses' outcomes remains scarce.\nThis secondary analysis is based on the Match<sup>RN</sup> Psychiatry study, which included 79 psychiatric units and 651 nurses. Using descriptive analyses and linear mixed modeling, we assessed the frequency of temporary nurses' deployment and its association with four permanently-employed nurse outcomes: staffing levels, job satisfaction, burnout, and intention to leave their organization or profession.\nRoughly one-quarter of the studied units reported frequently deploying temporary nurses. Nonetheless, no differences in nurse staffing levels were found. Regarding permanently-employed nurses' outcomes, we identified slightly higher levels of intention to leave the profession (beta = 0.18; 95% CI [0.03-0.33]) and burnout (beta = 0.19; 95% CI [0.4-0.33]) on units where temporary nurses were frequently deployed.\nDeploying temporary nurses appears to help units maintain adequate staffing levels. However, additional research will be necessary to better understand whether working conditions are the common cause of temporary nurses' deployment and permanently-employed nurse outcomes. Until more information is available, unit managers should consider alternatives to deploying temporary nurses."}, {"Title": "[Expectations of guideline developers on living guidelines].", "Abstract": "Guidelines are central pillars of high-quality care and care planning.

Furthermore, altered myelination is present in regions subjected to maturation during the developmental time when early adversities are experienced. In this review, studies applying two well-established animal models of early life adversity, namely maternal separation and maternal immune activation, focusing on oligodendrocyte alterations and resulting implications for psychiatric disorders are discussed. Studies revealed that myelination is reduced as a result of altered oligodendrocyte expression. Furthermore, early adversity is associated with increased cell death, a simpler morphology, and inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation. However, these effects seem to be region- specific as some brain regions show increased expression while others show decreased expression of oligodendroglia-related genes, and they occur especially in regions of ongoing development. Some studies furthermore suggest that early adversity leads to premature differentiation of oligodendrocytes. Importantly, especially early exposure results in stronger oligodendrocyte-related impairments. However, resulting alterations are not restricted to exposure during the early pre- and postnatal days as social isolation after weaning leads to fewer internodes and branches and shorter processes of oligodendrocytes in adulthood. Eventually, the found alterations may lead to dysfunction and long-lasting alterations in structural brain development associated with psychiatric disorders. To date, only few preclinical studies have focused on the effects of early adversity on oligodendrocytes. More studies including several developmental stages are needed to further disentangle the role of oligodendrocytes in the development of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Exploring children's formal help-seeking behaviour for violence in Zimbabwe: analysis of national survey and routine service provider data.", "Abstract": "To explore knowledge of formal services and help-seeking behaviour for violence among Zimbabwean children aged 18 years and under.\nWe use cross-sectional data from the 2017 Zimbabwe Violence Against Children Survey (VACS), which is nationally representative and had a 72% response rate for female participants and 66% for males; and anonymised routine data from one of the largest child protection service providers' (Childline Zimbabwe) call database.\nZimbabwe.\nWe analysed data from 13 to 18\u2009year old participants in the 2017 VACS and pertaining to respondents aged 18 years and under from Childline Zimbabwe's call database.\nWe describe characteristics of children, and fit unadjusted and logistic regression models to estimate associations between selected characteristics and help-seeking knowledge and behaviours.\n1339 of 4622 children aged 13-18 years surveyed for the 2017 VACS in Zimbabwe (29.8%) reported experience of lifetime physical and/or sexual violence. Of these, 829 (57.3%) children did not know where to seek formal help, 364 (33.1%) children knew where to seek help but did not, and 139 (9.6%) children knew where to seek help and did seek help. Boys were more likely to know where to seek help, but girls were more likely to actually seek help. During the 6-month period when VACS survey data were being collected, Childline received 2177 calls where the main reason for the call was recorded as violence against someone aged 18 years or under. These 2177 calls contained more reports from girls and children in school, versus the national profile of children who had experienced violence. Few children who did not seek help reported not wanting services. Most children who did not seek help reported that they felt at fault or that their safety would be put at risk by disclosure.\nBoth awareness of services and help-seeking are gendered, suggesting that different strategies may be needed to support boys and girls to access the help they want. Childline in particular may be well placed to expand its outreach to boys and to receive more reports of school-related violence, and should consider efforts to reach out-of-school children."}, {"Title": "A Review of and Roadmap for Data Science and Machine Learning for the Neuropsychiatric Phenotype of Autism.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a neurodevelopmental delay that affects at least 1 in 44 children. Like many neurological disorder phenotypes, the diagnostic features are observable, can be tracked over time, and can be managed or even eliminated through proper therapy and treatments. However, there are major bottlenecks in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and longitudinal tracking pipelines for autism and related neurodevelopmental delays, creating an opportunity for novel data science solutions to augment and transform existing workflows and provide increased access to services for affected families. Several efforts previously conducted by a multitude of research labs have spawned great progress toward improved digital diagnostics and digital therapies for children with autism. We review the literature on digital health methods for autism behavior quantification and beneficial therapies using data science. We describe both case-control studies and classification systems for digital phenotyping. We then discuss digital diagnostics and therapeutics that integrate machine learning models of autism-related behaviors, including the factors that must be addressed for translational use.

The \"epigenetic clocks\" are one avenue of this research, wherein \"biological age\" is estimated using DNA methylation data from specific CpG dinucleotide sites within the human genome. Many iterations of the epigenetic clocks have been developed, but the GrimAge clock continues to stand out for its ability to predict morbidity and mortality. Several studies have now explored associations of stress, PTSD, and MDD with GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA). While stress, PTSD, and MDD are distinct psychiatric entities, they may share common mechanisms underlying accelerated biological aging. Yet, no one has offered a review of the evidence on associations of stress and stress-related psychopathology with GrimAA. In this review, we identify nine publications on associations of stress, PTSD, and MDD with GrimAA. We find that results are mixed both within and across each of these exposures. However, we also find that analytic methods - and specifically, the choice of covariates - vary widely between studies. To address this, we draw upon popular methods from the field of clinical epidemiology to offer (1) a systematic framework for covariate selection, and (2) an approach to results reporting that facilitates analytic consensus. Although covariate selection will differ by the research question, we encourage researchers to consider adjustment for tobacco, alcohol use, physical activity, race, sex, adult socioeconomic status, medical comorbidity, and blood cell composition."}, {"Title": "Efficacious retrial of electroconvulsive therapy for major depressive disorder after a prolonged seizure in an older adult.", "Abstract": "This is a case of a woman in her 70s with treatment-resistant major depression who was admitted psychiatrically for the fifth time in 1.5 years.

It is so deeply rooted that the mention of establishments that make little use of it arouses a form of incredulity. However, the history of psychiatry and the international literature provide numerous examples of a psychiatry that is hardly coercive and numerous experiences of a reduction in the use of seclusion and/or restraint in psychiatric facilities. Today, in France, there are also less coercive establishments, which, for example, do not use mechanical restraint, have all their units open, or have reduced their use of seclusion and restraint. With regard to the stated policy objectives of reducing the use of coercion, it is surprising that most of these facilities receive little attention. PLAID-Care research aims to contribute to the visibility and analysis of these institutions and the factors involved in the reduced use of coercion. While these factors have already been identified in the international literature, the research is based on the multiplication of disciplinary perspectives (nursing, sociology, anthropology, geography) and the mobilization of a multi-level analytical framework that allows us to embrace their multiplicity and better understand their articulation. The originality of the research also lies in its historical dimension, which allows us to understand, on the scale of an institution, how a policy and practices aiming at the least recourse emerge and are consolidated. The project timeline is divided in three tasks: firstly, an inventory of \"low-coercion\" facilities in France; secondly, we will select and research four traditionally \"low-coercion\" facilities in France; thirdly we will focus on recently emerged \"low-coercion\" practices. PLAID-Care aims to revitalize French research on this theme which to date has been relatively lagging behind the numerous international studies. It will bring together and articulate the knowledge, tools and forms of organization and collaboration that contribute to making a policy of lesser use of coercion operational."}, {"Title": "Theories of Consciousness and Psychiatric Disorders - A Comparative Analysis.", "Abstract": "Disorders of consciousness represent an efficient way to test theories of consciousness' (ToCs) predictions. So far, ToCs have mostly focused on disorders of quantitative awareness such as coma, vegetative state, spatial neglect and hemianopia. Psychiatric disorders, by contrast, have received little attention, leaving their contribution to consciousness research almost unexplored. Therefore, this paper aims to assess the relation between ToCs and psychiatric disorders - that is, the extent to which current ToCs can account for psychiatric symptomatology. First, I review direct and indirect evidence linking each ToC to psychiatry disorders. Next, I differentiate ToCs based on their theoretical and methodological ground, highlighting how they distinctively address neural, cognitive and phenomenological aspects of conscious experience, and thereby psychiatric symptoms. Finally, I refer to one specific symptom to directly compare ToCs' explanatory power. Overall, Temporospatial Theory of Consciousness (TTC) appears to provide a more comprehensive account of psychiatric disorders, suggesting that a novel dimension of consciousness (i.e., form of consciousness) may be needed to address more qualitative alterations in conscious experience."}, {"Title": "Thinking clearly about climate change and mental health.", "Abstract": "To examine the quality and strength of evidence for an association between temperature increases caused by climate change and suicide used in policy documents to advocate for radical changes to healthcare systems in pursuit of decarbonisation.\nThe designs of articles collected in a systematic review which concluded that there was an association between climate change and increased rates of suicide were analysed for their capacity to support this conclusion. Complete US data covering temperatures and suicide rates between 1968 and 2004 was aggregated and analysed using linear regression to evaluate evidence for an association between temperature and suicide.\nNone of the articles collected in the review has a design capable of investigating whether there is an association between temperature increases caused by climate change and rates of suicide. At the national level increased annual US temperatures were associated with a decrease in the rate of suicide, and at the state level it was common for high average temperature states to have low rates of suicide and vice versa.\nPolicy recommendations for radical changes in healthcare services have been based on misrepresented evidence.

Best-practice guidelines to help trainees cope have yet to be developed. This study explores perceptions of factors that influence the experience or amount of administrative workload at the personal and workplace level and evaluates the usefulness of a workshop on coping with this workload.\nA workshop was developed based on the Job Demands-Resources model, including a survey on perceptions of administrative workload; presentation on coping at personal (e.g., time management) and workplace (e.g., dealing with institutional rules) levels; personal plan of change during a group discussion; and reflective questionnaire after the session and again after 2\u00a0months. Perceptions of psychiatry trainee participants (N\u2009=\u200948) were collected.\nTrainees estimated they spent half their time on administration (average 50%, SD\u2009=\u200915%). They wanted to spend less time (average 23%, SD\u2009=\u200911%) on most administrative duties, except for health record keeping. Personal factors that trainees experienced as helpful to cope included time management and analytical skills. Perfectionism was perceived as impeding. Supportive job factors included helpful supervisors, competent administrative staff, trust in a team, allocated timeslots, and information technology support. High workload and cumbersome procedures were mentioned as impeding. On average, trainees rated the workshop quality and the likelihood of bringing change to their practice with a 7 out of 10.\nPsychiatry trainees' participation in a workshop on coping with administrative load during their training may be a worthwhile investment in the long term."}, {"Title": "Multiple-Monitored Electroconvulsive Therapy (MMECT) - does it really just belong in psychiatry's past? A case report.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy has been a method used in psychiatry since 1938 and despite its rather turbulent history, it is still the most effective method of treating severe mental disorders. Despite its high efficiency and good safety profile, patients with catatonia usually require a large number of treatments. It entails a long hospitalization time and the necessity to repeatedly induce general anesthesia. In 1966, Blachly proposed to induce more than one seizure during a single anesthesia. According to this method, the patient was to be constantly monitored (ECG, EEG) during a series of electroconvulsions, which consisted of two to even eight treatments. For simplicity, the method is called multiple-monitored ECT (MMECT). The work is based on the medical history of a patient diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia. Due to the insufficient effect of single treatments, we decided to use the MMECT method, which was performed in series of three treatments, twice a week. Thanks to the therapy, catatonic symptoms remitted. Studies in various patient populations have shown that MMECT reduces hospitalization time, the duration of acute symptoms, and the patient's total exposure to anesthetics and muscle relaxants. As the above case shows, MMECT can potentially be considered as a safe treatment alternative in patients that require a large number of treatments, resistant to standard forms of therapy."}, {"Title": "Exploring oral health indicators, oral health-related quality of life and nutritional aspects in 23 medicated patients from a short-term psychiatric ward.", "Abstract": "Patients suffering from psychiatric disorders face many difficulties due to their condition, medications and lifestyle. Oral health and nutrition may be affected, further complicating their lives. Our aim was to provide in-depth information on oral health and nutritional factors in a small group of patients in short-term psychiatric ward.\nTwenty-three patients (mean age 36, average medications five) were recruited during short-term hospitalization in a psychiatric ward. Inclusion criteria: anxiety, psychosis and/or depression, and use of at least one antidepressant or anxiolytic/antipsychotic drug with xerostomia as a known side effect. Subjective oral dryness was evaluated using the Shortened Xerostomia Inventory (SXI). Oral examination included Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS), secretion of unstimulated (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva (SWS), and evaluation of dental, gingival, and periodontal status. Self-reported complaints of oral disorders were recorded. The Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) was used to explore oral health-related quality of life. Nutritional status was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA-SF), and diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean diet score (KIDMED).\nCompared to healthy controls, the patients had significantly higher SXI scores and CODS, and SWS secretion was lower. Complaints of dysgeusia and halitosis were significantly more frequent among patients. Gingivitis was more common in patients. OHIP-14 scores were much higher in the patients, and they reported significantly poorer oral and general health. Most patients lacked a regular meal pattern. Very low diet quality was observed in five patients, while improvements were needed in twelve. \"<i>Dry mouth</i>\" and \"<i>No appetite, just did not feel like eating</i>\" were the most common symptoms preventing patients from eating enough. The PG-SGA-SF symptoms component score showed a strong negative correlation with self-reported oral health, and a strong positive correlation with OHIP-14.\nThis relatively small group of patients in short-term psychiatric ward had both reduced oral health and poor oral health-related quality of life. Furthermore, their nutritional intake was affected by their oral health problems. Although larger groups need to be studied, these findings indicate that oral health and nutrition should be evaluated and adjusted in these patients to improve their overall care."}, {"Title": "The role of telehealth in pediatric emergency care.", "Abstract": "In 2006, the Institute of Medicine published a report titled \"Emergency Care for Children: Growing Pains,\" in which it described pediatric emergency care as uneven at best. Since then, telehealth has emerged as one of the great equalizers in care of children, particularly for those in rural and underresourced communities. Clinicians in these settings may lack pediatric-specific specialization or experience in caring for critically ill or injured children. Telehealth consultation can provide timely and safe management for many medical problems in children and can prevent many unnecessary and often long transport to a pediatric center while avoiding delays in care, especially for time-sensitive and acute interventions. Telehealth is an important component of pediatric readiness of hospitals and is a valuable tool in facilitating health care access in low resourced and critical access areas. This paper provides an overview of meaningful applications of telehealth programs in pediatric emergency medicine, discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these services, and highlights challenges in setting up, adopting, and maintaining telehealth services."}, {"Title": "A cultural-ecosocial systems view for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "While contemporary psychiatry seeks the mechanisms of mental disorders in neurobiology, mental health problems clearly depend on developmental processes of learning and adaptation through ongoing interactions with the social environment. Symptoms or disorders emerge in specific social contexts and involve predicaments that cannot be fully characterized in terms of brain function but require a larger social-ecological view. Causal processes that result in mental health problems can begin anywhere within the extended system of body-person-environment. In particular, individuals' narrative self-construal, culturally mediated interpretations of symptoms and coping strategies as well as the responses of others in the social world contribute to the mechanisms of mental disorders, illness experience, and recovery. In this paper, we outline the conceptual basis and practical implications of a hierarchical ecosocial systems view for an integrative approach to psychiatric theory and practice. The cultural-ecosocial systems view we propose understands mind, brain and person as situated in the social world and as constituted by cultural and self-reflexive processes. This view can be incorporated into a pragmatic approach to clinical assessment and case formulation that characterizes mechanisms of pathology and identifies targets for intervention."}, {"Title": "Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on Patients Taking Clozapine.", "Abstract": "Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are recognized to be among the highest risk patients to experience more severe symptoms of COVID-19, not only due to poor baseline health and associated disparity, but also due to medications prescribed to manage their illness that are known to compromise immunity even further. Clozapine, a gold standard antipsychotic used in the treatment for refractory schizophrenia, is considered to be the antipsychotic with the greatest risk of compromising immunity due to its potential to cause blood dyscrasia, including leukopenia and rarely, but potentially, agranulocytosis. The objective of this study is to determine if there is any potential hematological consequence for the use of COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines or the impact of active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients receiving clozapine therapy. Since there is controversy over the rate of vaccine hesitancy in patients with SMI, we also examined the rate of vaccine acceptance in our subject population.\nThis study was a retrospective chart review conducted at a 160-bed state psychiatric inpatient hospital in upstate New York evaluating the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccine acceptance in patients prescribed clozapine.\nBoth the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection did not appear to significantly influence the hematologic values that are monitored by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure safe use of clozapine. When offered vaccination, most patients hospitalized for SMI were willing to accept it.\nWith the likelihood of COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations becoming a recommended routine vaccination, requiring periodic boosters, patients receiving clozapine therapy have been observed to not be at higher risk of adverse hematological consequences when the mRNA vaccine is administered. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings should be considered an optimal site of vaccination to improve vaccination efforts in our communities."}, {"Title": "Not heading in the right direction: Five hundred psychiatrists' views on resourcing, demand, and workforce across New Zealand mental health services.", "Abstract": "To explore the views of psychiatrists (including trainees) regarding the current state and future direction of specialist mental health and addictions services in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nPsychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists (registrars) in Aotearoa New Zealand were surveyed in August 2021. Of 879 eligible doctors, 540 participated (83% qualified and 17% trainee psychiatrists), a response rate of over 60%. Data were analysed quantitatively and with content analysis.\nPsychiatrists thought specialist mental health and addictions services had been neglected during recent reforms, with 94% believing current resourcing was insufficient, and only 3% considering future planning was heading in the right direction. The demand and complexity of on-call work had markedly increased in the preceding 2\u2009years. Ninety-eight percent reported that people needing specialist treatment were often (85%) or sometimes (13%) unable to access the right care due to resourcing constraints. The pressures were similar across sub-specialties. A key theme was the distress (sometimes termed 'moral injury') experienced by psychiatrists unable to provide adequate care due to resource limitations, <i>'knowing what would be a good thing to do and being unable to do it . . . is soul destroying</i>'. Recommendations were made for addressing workforce, service design and wider issues.\nMost psychiatrists in Aotearoa New Zealand believe the mental health system is not currently fit for purpose and that it is not heading in the right direction.

Therefore, we investigated the gene expression profile of microglial cells in relation to neuronal regulators of microglia activity in well-characterized MDD and control autopsy brains.\nPure, intact microglia were isolated at brain autopsy from occipital cortex grey matter (GM) and corpus callosum white matter (WM) of 13 MDD and 10 age-matched control donors for RNA sequencing. Top differentially expressed genes were validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Since gene expression changes were only detected in GM microglia, neuronal regulators of microglia were investigated in cortical tissue and synaptosomes from the cortex by RT-qPCR and Western blot.\nTranscriptome analysis revealed 92 genes differentially expressed in microglia isolated from GM, but none in microglia from WM in MDD, compared to controls. Of these, 81 genes were less abundantly expressed in GM MDD, including CD163, MKI67, SPP1, CD14, FCGR1A/C, and C1QA/B/C. Accordingly, pathways related to effector mechanisms, such as the complement system and phagocytosis were differentially regulated in GM microglia in MDD. IHC staining revealed significantly lower expression of CD163 protein in MDD. Whole tissue analysis showed an increase in CD200 (p+0.0009) and CD47 (p=0.068) mRNA, and CD47 protein was significantly elevated (p=0.0396) in synaptic fractions of MDD cases.\nTranscriptional profiling indicates an immune-suppressed microglial phenotype in MDD, possibly caused by neuronal regulation."}, {"Title": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychosocial rehabilitation of forensic psychiatric patients in Austria.", "Abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to increased psychological distress and far-reaching restrictions of freedom. In March 2020, Austrian penal authorities enacted various safety and protection measures to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19. While infection rates in penal institutions were low, restrictive conditions of detention limited the forensic care of offenders. This retrospective longitudinal observational study aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the psychosocial rehabilitation in forensic psychiatry. Administrative and clinical data obtained from 97 males treated at an inpatient forensic mental health institution were compared before (January 2019 - mid-March 2020) and after (mid-March 2020 - May 2021) the enactment of pandemic-related restrictive measures.

An eight-year review of escapes and absconds from two high security forensic centers.", "Abstract": "Increasing freedom of movement and community reintegration is a vital part of recovery for forensic service users. Clinical teams realize that risk of unauthorized leave exists when granting leave, tasking them with balancing the recovery-based treatment needs of the patients with the larger obligation to protect the public from undue risk of harm. While considerable literature exists on unauthorized leave from acute psychiatric units, there is still little research specific to unauthorized leave from forensic settings.\nThe aim of this study is twofold. First, to examine the prevalence rates and characteristics of unauthorized leaves (i.e., absconds and escapes) among 654 high security forensic patients. Second, to identify individual patient factors associated with unauthorized leaves. A broad array of risk factors is taken into account, including demographic, clinical, judicial and criminal factors.\nDuring the 8-year period (17th of November 2014 until 17th of November 2022), there were 59 unauthorized leaves, which represents a very low percentage (0.2%) relative to the total number of leaves. Most patients returned to the hospital or were caught within one week. The reasons that led to an unauthorized leave were in more than half of the incidents frustration and in more than a third goal-directed. Only a minority of the unauthorized leaves was associated with subsequent offending, notwithstanding substance use was more frequent. Patients that absconded or escaped more often had a personality and comorbid substance misuse disorder, but less often a paraphilic disorder. They were younger, had more convictions and higher risk scores. After logistic regression, only personality disorder, comorbid substance misuse disorder and number of convictions were independently associated with unauthorized leave.\nThe results of this study indicate that ULs occurred rarely, and in most instances, patients returned within a short period without further incidents. Personality disordered patients with comorbid substance misuse and prior convictions posed the greatest risk to abscond or escape. Overall, the rate of unauthorized leaves and subsequent offending was small relative to the total number of leaves. This suggests that the risk for absconding was assessed in an adequate manner by the clinical teams. The study hopefully adds to reducing the stigma towards leaves from forensic psychiatric hospitals."}, {"Title": "Long-term benzodiazepine prescription in treatment-resistant depression: A national FACE-TRD prospective study.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepine long-term use (BLTU) is a public health challenge.

Clinical evidence indicates that adjunctive NAC may reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).\nA 12-week randomised controlled trial of 2,000 mg/day adjunctive NAC for MDD found no significant improvement at the primary endpoint (week 12) but did see improvements at the post-discontinuation interview (week 16). Within the context of patient-centered treatment, mixed-methods qualitative analysis was also included to explore factors that may determine individual responses to adjunctive NAC treatment. These data were drawn, under blinded conditions, from clinician notes recorded in the case report form. Using the DSM-5 symptom profile for MDD as the initial framework, themes were developed and explored. Frequencies were compared between placebo and NAC groups.\nPer protocol analysis of individual themes across the six interviews revealed group differences in favour of NAC for overall depressive affect, optimism, relationships and reduced functional impairment.\nThis study provides further evidence for the utility of the mixed methods approach complimenting the primary findings using traditional quantitative analyses, as well as being able to capture additional, often more subtle, evidence of individual symptom-level change that reflects improvement in functional abilities in response to NAC supplementation. The use of mixed methods to explore outcomes from psychiatric studies should be considered in future to work towards improved patient-centred care and both confirm quantitative findings and generate novel hypotheses."}, {"Title": "A Primer on Interoception and its Importance in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Interoception is the perception of signals from inside the body.

Recently, interoception has gained more attention in neuropsychiatric research. Anatomical and physiological aspects of interoception like relevant brain areas, the role of the vagus nerve, and the autonomic nervous system are gradually being understood. Different facets of interoception like interoceptive attention, detection, magnitude, discrimination, accuracy, awareness, and appraisal have been proposed and their assessments and importance are being evaluated. Further, interoception is often dysregulated or abnormal in psychiatric disorders. It has been implicated in the psychopathology, etiopathogenesis, clinical features and treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, personality and addiction-related disorders.

The secondary aim was to clarify the impact of type of interventions, their frequency and their targets.\nInclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials, with participants being pregnant women and/or new mothers (with infants up to twelve months), involving telemedicine interventions of any kind (e.g. websites, apps, chats, telephone), and addressing any mental health-related outcomes like depression, postnatal depression, anxiety, stress and others. Search terms were pregnant women, new mothers, telemedicine, RCT (randomised controlled trials), mental stress as well as numerous synonyms including medical subject headings. The literature search was conducted within the databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PsycINFO. Screening, inclusion of records and data extraction were performed by two researchers according to the PRISMA guidelines, using the online tool CADIMA.\nForty four articles were included. A majority (62%) reported significantly improved mental health-related outcomes for participants receiving telemedicine interventions compared to control. In particular (internet-delivered) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy was successful for depression and stress, and peer support improved outcomes for postnatal depression and anxiety. Interventions with preventive approaches and interventions aimed at symptom reduction were largely successful. For the most part there was no significant improvement in the symptoms of anxiety.\nTelemedicine interventions evaluated within RCTs were mostly successful. However, they need to be designed to specifically target a certain mental health issue because there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Further research should focus on which specific interventions are appropriate for which mental health outcomes in terms of intervention delivery modes, content, target approaches, etc. Further investigation is needed, in particular with regard to anxiety."}, {"Title": "Association of mental health status between self-poisoning suicide patients and their family members: a matched-pair analysis.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the relationship of mental health status between self-poisoning suicide patients and their family members, and it also sought to identify potential patient's risk and parental factors for the prediction of suicide attempt, anxiety, and depression.\nIn this study, 151 poisoned patients were prospectively included, and they were matched 1:1 with 151 family members. We gathered information on patient's and their matched family member's demographics, lifestyle choices, mental health status, level of intimacy, and history of psychiatry disease. The relationship of patient's and their family member's mental health state was investigated using a correlation matrix. Multivariable analyses (multiple logistic regression) were conducted among patients and their matched family members, to identify potential risk factors for self-poisoning suicide, anxiety, and depression.\nOf the total patients, 67.55% (102/151) attempted self-poisoning suicide. Poisoned patients had more severe anxiety and depression symptoms than their matched family members, and this difference was even more pronounced among patients with self-poisoning suicide. Generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) score for family members was significantly and favorably correlated with patient's GAD-7 score after eliminating non-suicide patients and their matched family members. The patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score showed a similar pattern, and the family member's PHQ-9 score was strongly and favorably associated with patient's PHQ-9 and Beck hopelessness scale-20 (BHS-20) score. Multivariable analysis showed that married marital status (P\u2009=\u20090.038), quitting smoking (P\u2009=\u20090.003), sedentary time of 1 to 6\u00a0h (P\u2009=\u20090.013), and participation in a sports more than five times per week (P\u2009=\u20090.046) were all significantly associated with a lower risk of suicide by self-poisoning, while a more serious anxiety state (P\u2009=\u20090.001) was significantly associated with a higher risk of self-poisoning suicide. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that, specifically among self-poisoning suicide patients, married marital status (P\u2009=\u20090.011) and no history of psychiatry disease (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were protective factors for anxiety, while divorced or widowed marital status (P\u2009=\u20090.004), a sedentary time of 1 to 3\u00a0h (P\u2009=\u20090.022), and a higher monthly income (P\u2009=\u20090.027) were significant contributors to anxiety. The propensity of additional family-matched characteristics to predict patient's suicidality, anxiety, and depression was also examined.\nSelf-poisoning suicide patients have severe mental health issues. Patients who self-poison have a close connection to their family member's mental health, particularly their levels of anxiety and depression. According to the findings, being married and adopting healthy lifestyle habits, such as quitting smoking and drinking, increasing their physical activity levels, and managing their idle time, are able to help patients with mental health concerns and even suicidal thoughts."}, {"Title": "Group cognitive stimulation therapy versus usual care for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia (CST-IDD) in the UK: protocol for a mixed-methods feasibility randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of dementia is almost five times higher in people with intellectual disabilities compared with the general population. However, evidence-based treatments for this population are lacking, as most randomised controlled trials for dementia interventions have not included people with intellectual disabilities. Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) has a robust evidence base in the general dementia population, consistently showing benefits to cognition, quality of life and being cost-effective. We are conducting a mixed-methods feasibility trial of group CST for people with intellectual disabilities and dementia, to determine if a future definitive randomised controlled trial is feasible.\nFifty individuals with intellectual disabilities and dementia will be randomised to either the intervention arm (14 sessions of group CST plus treatment as usual) or the control arm (treatment as usual). Randomisation will occur after informed consent has been obtained and baseline assessments completed. Each arm will have 25 participants, with the intervention arm divided into five or more CST groups with three to five participants in each. The outcomes will be feasibility of recruitment, acceptability and adherence of the intervention, suitability of study outcome measures and feasibility of collecting resource use data. Quantitative and qualitative approaches, including semistructured interviews with group participants, carers and group facilitators, will be employed to assess these outcomes.\nThis study has been approved by Essex REC (Ref: 21/EE/027) and the HRA ethical approval process through the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS ID: 306\u2009756).

The preventive risk reduction necessitates a high level of coordination of neurology and psychiatry with other disciplines. Also, patients must develop a high level of health competence and summon up self-motivation and adherence. This concept article deals with the question of how mobile everyday-life digital technologies can help to address these challenges. The core prerequisite is the interdisciplinary coordinated structuring of prevention with the focus on cognitive health and cognitive safety. Cognitive health relates to a reduction of risk factors associated with lifestyle. Cognitive safety concerns the avoidance of iatrogenic side effects on cognitive functions. Digital technologies that are relevant in this context are mobile apps based on smartphones or tablets for everyday-life and high-frequency recording of cognitive functions, apps that can coach the implementation of lifestyle changes as companion technologies, apps that can assist in the reduction of iatrogenic risks and those that can improve the health competence of patients and relatives. The state of development of such medical products is at different stages of progress. Therefore, this concept article does not provide a review of existing products but rather deals with the fundamental interplay of potential solutions in the prevention of Alzheimer dementia in the areas of cognitive health and cognitive safety."}, {"Title": "[Transfer rates of the Psychiatric and Neurological University Hospital in Frankfurt am Main during National Socialism].", "Abstract": "During the era of National Socialism around 300,000 people were murdered in the \"euthanasia\" programs. The majority of those killings took place in asylums, whereas no killings in psychiatric and neurological university (PNU) hospitals have so far been identified. Furthermore, there were no deportations from these hospitals to the gassing asylums. Nevertheless, the PNUs took part in the \"euthanasia\" by transferring patients to asylums, where many of them were either killed or deported to gassing asylums. There are only a\u00a0few studies that empirically describe these transfers. In this study the rates of transfers of the PNU Frankfurt am Main are reported for the first time, thus allowing a judgment of the involvement in the \"euthanasia\" programs. The rate of patients transferred to asylums dropped from 22-25% in the years before to around 16% in the years after knowledge about the mass killings in the asylums spread in the PNU Frankfurt. Of the patients transferred between 1940 and 1945, 53% died in the asylums before 1946. The high mortality rate of the transferred patients underlines that the role of the PNUs in the \"euthanasia\" programs should be examined in more detail."}, {"Title": "Psychopathology and Pattern of Remission of Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder.", "Abstract": "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To analyze the psychopathology and pattern of remission in cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with treatment. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This was a prospective cohort study of a group of patients admitted with new-onset psychosis, cannabis use, and no evidence of other drug abuse from January 1 to June 31, 2019, to the psychiatry inpatient department of a multispecialty tertiary care hospital in Kerala, India. Patients were evaluated at admission and after 1 week in the hospital and 1 month after discharge using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of illness scale. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Fifty-six male subjects were recruited for the study. The mean age of the subjects was 22.2 years, and the majority were active smokers of nicotine and cannabis. Total duration of abuse and family history of substance use in first-degree relatives correlated with severity of psychosis. Hostility, excitement, and grandiosity were the predominant positive symptoms, and these symptoms showed a steady reduction toward the end of the study. The most frequent negative symptoms were emotional withdrawal, passive or apathetic social withdrawal, and difficulty in abstract thinking, and these symptoms also showed significant improvement (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001 for all).

One of the factors affecting vaccination is vaccine hesitancy, which is an increasing problem worldwide. Vaccine hesitancy and the vaccination rates of some special groups, such as psychiatric patients and their families, may differ from the general population. The purpose of this study was to identify any vaccine hesitancy to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in adolescents evaluated in a child psychiatry outpatient clinic, as well as to determine the factors influencing vaccination in these adolescents and their families.\nTwo hundred forty-eight adolescents examined in the child psychiatry outpatient clinic were evaluated using a semi-structured psychiatric interview, strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), the fear of COVID-19 scale, and a form about coronavirus vaccine hesitancy. The parents completed the vaccine hesitancy scale and answered the vaccine hesitancy questions.\nThe vaccination rate was higher in patients with anxiety disorders. The patient`s age (odds ratio [OR]:1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.26, 2.02), the parent`s vaccine hesitancy (OR: 0.91; CI:0.87-0.95), the status of chronic disease in a family member (OR: 2.26; CI:1.10, 4.65), and the vaccination status of the adolescent`s parents (OR:7.40; CI:1.39, 39.34) were found to be predictive for adolescent vaccination. While 2.8% of the adolescents said that they were definitely against getting vaccinated, 7.7% were undecided. While the rate of undecided parents was 7.3%, those who were against vaccination was 1.6%.\nAge, parental vaccine hesitancy, and parental vaccination status can affect the vaccination of adolescents admitted to a child psychiatry clinic.

Social media use is the second leading cause of disability among psychiatric disorders. A great deal of literature has tried to establish links between social media exposure and mental health diseases. However, there is a need to discuss the current literature that presents crucial perspectives on social media-induced psychiatric disorders to establish a holistic, evidence-based approach for their prevention and treatment. The use of social networks is strongly correlated with the development of anxiety and other psychological problems such as depression, insomnia, stress, decreased subjective happiness, and a sense of mental deprivation. The majority of the cited literature predicts that the likelihood of social media-induced mental health problems is directly proportional to the amount of time spent on these sites, the frequency of usage, and the number of platforms being used. Various possible explanations have been implicated, including a negative impact on self-esteem through unhealthy comparisons, social media burnout, stress, lack of emotional regulation due to social media preoccupation, and development of social anxiety due to decreased real-life social interactions. It has been postulated that increased social media use is driven by preexisting anxiety and is a coping strategy. This era of progressively increasing digitalization, the recent trend of a dramatic shift toward online social life, and the desire to get social attention is expected to take a gruesome toll on the population's mental health, which therefore warrants more attention to mental health care."}, {"Title": "Gender impact on the outcome of rehabilitation programs in psychiatry: Brief report from a metropolitan residential rehabilitative service.", "Abstract": "Differences based on gender in the presentation and outcome of many psychiatric conditions have been highlighted in the past years.

Methods We conducted this retrospective record-based study using data from the outpatient department register of the Psychiatry Department of Government Bundelkhand Medical College, Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, India. All records from January to December 2022 were included, while duplicate and incomplete records were excluded. Data from 2005 cases were finalized for analysis after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data abstraction was done for age, gender, marital status, family history of any psychiatric disorder, and diagnosis (according to ICD-10) from the records. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Quantitative data were presented as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), whereas qualitative data were presented as frequency and percentages. The chi-square test was applied to determine the association, and p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Results The mean age of the patients was 37.2\u00b116.9 years, where the youngest patient was of four years of age and the eldest was 85 years of age. Most patients were males (50.6%), married (61.1%), and from rural areas (71.8%). Mood (affective) disorder (32.4%) was the most common, followed by schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (20.0%), and neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders (17.4%). Organic mental disorders and substance use disorders were more common in unmarried individuals and males. Females had higher rates of mood disorders and somatoform disorders, with varying age distributions.

Its presence is associated with higher rates of institutionalization, functional disability and mortality. This study aims to evaluate delirium in a hospitalized psychogeriatric population, focusing on which factors predict the appearance of delirium, the impact it generates and the diagnostic concordance between non-psychiatric physicians and psychiatrists. <i>Material and methods:</i> This is an observational, cross-sectional, retrospective, and comparative study. We obtained data from a sample of 1017 patients (\u226565 years) admitted to general hospital and referred from different services to the consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) unit. Logistic regression was performed using delirium as the dependent variable. To estimate the concordance of the diagnoses, the Kappa coefficient was used. To assess the impact of delirium, an ordinal regression, Wilcoxon median test and Fisher's test were performed. <i>Results:</i> Delirium is associated with a higher number of visits, OR 3.04 (95% CI 2.38-3.88), longer length of stay and mortality, OR 2.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 4.10). The model to predict delirium shows that being >75 years old has an OR of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.59-2.79), physical disability has an OR of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.25-2.20), history of delirium has an OR of 10.56 (95% CI, 5.26-21.18) and no use of benzodiazepines has an OR of 4.24 (95% CI, 2.92-6.14). The concordance between the referring physician's psychiatric diagnosis and the psychiatrist CLP unit showed a kappa of 0.30. When analysing depression and delirium, the concordance showed Kappa = 0.46. <i>Conclusions:</i> Delirium is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, but it is still underdiagnosed, with low diagnostic concordance between non-psychiatric doctors and psychiatrists from CLP units.

Impaired circadian rhythms are associated with mental disorders. The evening chronotype, which is linked to circadian misalignment, is a risk factor for severe psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric metabolic comorbidities. Resynchronization of circadian rhythms commonly improves psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, evidence indicates that preventing circadian misalignment may help reduce the risk of psychiatric disorders and the impact of neuro-immuno-metabolic disturbances in psychiatry. The gut microbiota exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, as largely governed by meal timing, which regulates the host's circadian rhythms. Temporal circadian regulation of feeding has emerged as a promising chronotherapeutic strategy to prevent and/or help with the treatment of mental illnesses, largely through the modulation of gut microbiota. Here, we provide an overview of the link between circadian disruption and mental illness. We summarize the connection between gut microbiota and circadian rhythms, supporting the idea that gut microbiota modulation may aid in preventing circadian misalignment and in the resynchronization of disrupted circadian rhythms. We describe diurnal microbiome rhythmicity and its related factors, highlighting the role of meal timing. Lastly, we emphasize the necessity and rationale for further research to develop effective and safe microbiome and dietary strategies based on chrononutrition to combat mental illness."}, {"Title": "Association between Psychopathological Symptoms and Aggression and Selected Biochemical Parameters in Adolescents with Behavioural and Emotional Disturbances.", "Abstract": "Behavioural and emotional disturbances (F92.8) are the most recognized disorders in a developmental psychiatry.

With the QualityRights program, World Health Organisation highlights that one of element founding the quality of services is the respect for users' rights, in the belief that there is no quality of care without respect for human rights and vice versa. To date, studies explored the issue mainly in Europe. In this sense, the purpose of the study is to verify if the perception of respect for patients' rights is a component of organisational well-being for mental health workers in three countries of Latin America (Argentina, Colombia, Peru). A random sample representative of professionals working in three mental healthcare networks in Argentina, Colombia, and Peru was enrolled (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009310). Each health worker completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic data and the Well-Being at work and respect for human rights (WWRR). The WWRR consists of seven items on satisfaction at work, beliefs about users' satisfaction in received care, the satisfaction of work's organisation, respect of users' and staff's human rights, adequacy of resources, and perceived needs of resources in the mental health service. The principal components analysis of the instrument was carried out with Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalisation (including all components with Eigen value > 1). The total explained variance was 67.2%. Item 6 saturated in one single factor, and the first five items saturated in factor 1 with factor loadings ranging from 0.52 to 0.86. Parallel test suggested a one-factor structure as acceptable. The results show in three countries of Latin America that the more workers perceive that the human rights of users are respected, the more satisfied they are of own work.

To this purpose, we conducted a nationally representative field experiment on more than 1500 physicians. We do not find substantial discrimination against the patient of African origin. However, the results indicate that patients with means-tested health insurance coverage are less likely to get an appointment. Differentiating between two types of coverage, we show that the lesser-known coverage (ACS) is more penalized than the other (CMU-C) as poor knowledge of the program increases the physician's expectation of additional administrative tasks and is an important element to explain cream-skimming. We also find that, for physicians who are free to set their fees, the opportunity cost of accepting a means-tested patient increases the penalty. Finally, the results suggest that enrollment in OPTAM, the controlled pricing practice option that incentivizes physicians to accept means-tested patients, reduces cream-skimming."}, {"Title": "Love's place in the spectrum of affect, one of 24 secondary emotions: implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Love is defined and examined as an emotion, using the psychoevolutionary theory of emotions developed by Robert Plutchik and extended to social psychiatry by Henry Kellerman. This theory posits a fourfold ethogram, representing the valanced adaptive reactions to problems of life which define the eight primary emotions. The problem of identity is addressed by acceptance and disgust; temporality, by joy-happiness and sadness. Using a hierarchical classification system, love is defined as a secondary-level emotion, a mixture of joy and acceptance. Examination of the brain infrastructure of these emotions supports their interpretation as basic emotions. In romantic and other forms of love, there is a global acceptance-incorporation, of the other, together with the joy of sexual pair-bonding. This can rise to the level of a clinical disposition that is both histrionic and manic, akin to a Durkheimian collective effervescence. The emotions of acceptance and joy are in everyday life constrained by ego-defense mechanisms: acceptance is constrained by a more critical, less idealised, view of a potential love object; uninhibited joy of sexuality is defended against by sublimation, in which libidinal energy is deflected into an emphasis on correct and proper behaviour, and purposive and productive activities."}, {"Title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Psychosocial Diagnosis and Treatment Before and After Organ Transplantation.", "Abstract": "This new clinical practice guideline concerns the psychosocial diagnosis and treatment of patients before and after organ transplantation. Its objective is to establish standards and to issue evidence-based recommendations that will help to optimize decision making in psychosocial diagnosis and treatment.\nFor each key question, the literature was systematically searched in at least two databases (Medline, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and CENTRAL). The end date of each search was between August 2018 and November 2019, depending on the question. The literature search was also updated to capture recent publications, by using a selective approach.\nLack of adherence to immunosuppressant drugs can be expected in 25-30% of patients and increases the odds of organ loss after kidney transplantation (odds ratio 7.1). Psychosocial interventions can significantly improve adherence. Meta-analyses have shown that adherence was achieved 10-20% more frequently in the intervention group than in the control group. 13- 40% of patients suffer from depression after transplantation; mortality in this group is 65% higher. The guideline group therefore recommends that experts in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry, and psychology (mental health professionals) should be involved in patient care throughout the transplantation process.\nThe care of patients before and after organ transplantation should be multidisciplinary. Nonadherence rates and comorbid mental disorders are common and associated with poorer outcomes after transplantation. Interventions to improve adherence are effective, although the pertinent studies display marked heterogeneity and a high risk of bias. *All of the issuing bodies, authors, and editors of the guideline are listed in eTables 1 and 2."}, {"Title": "Improving measurement-based care implementation in adult ambulatory psychiatry: a virtual focus group interview with multidisciplinary healthcare professionals.", "Abstract": "Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is an evidence-based practice shown to enhance patient care. Despite being efficacious, MBC is not commonly used in practice. While barriers and facilitators of MBC implementation have been described in the literature, the type of clinicians and populations studied vary widely, even within the same practice setting. The current study aims to improve MBC implementation in adult ambulatory psychiatry by conducting focus group interviews while utilizing a novel virtual brainwriting premortem method.\nSemi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with clinicians (n\u2009=\u200918) and staff (n\u2009=\u20097) to identify their current attitudes, facilitators, and barriers of MBC implementation in their healthcare setting. Virtual video-conferencing software was used to conduct focus groups, and based on transcribed verbatin, emergent barriers/facilitators and four themes were identified. Mixed methods approach was utilized for this study. Specifically, qualitative data was aggregated and re-coded separately by three doctoral-level coders. Quantitative analyses were conducted from a follow-up questionnaire surveying clinician attitudes and satisfaction with MBC.\nThe clinician and staff focus groups resulted in 291 and 91 unique codes, respectively. While clinicians identified a similar number of barriers (40.9%) and facilitators (44.3%), staff identified more barriers (67%) than facilitators (24.7%) for MBC. Four themes emerged from the analysis; (1) a description of current status/neutral opinion on MBC; (2) positive themes that include benefits of MBC, facilitators, enablers, or reasons on why they conduct MBC in their practice, (3) negative themes that include barriers or issues that hinder them from incorporating MBC into their practice, and (4) requests and suggestions for future MBC implementation. Both participant groups raised more negative themes highlighting critical challenges to MBC implementation than positive themes. The follow-up questionnaire regarding MBC attitudes showed the areas that clinicians emphasized the most and the least in their clinical practice.\nThe virtual brainwriting premortem focus groups provided critical information on the shortcomings and strengths of MBC in adult ambulatory psychiatry. Our findings underscore implementation challenges in healthcare settings and provide insight for both research and clinical practice in mental health fields.

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) may address this need by providing accessible and high-quality care. Given the necessity for high levels of caregiver and primary care practitioner involvement in addressing ADHD symptoms and behavioral problems, collaborative care interventions that adopt a whole-family approach may be particularly well suited to reduce symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and opposition in children and adolescents.\nThe purpose of this study is to use member (ie, child and adolescent) data from Bend Health, Inc, a collaborative care DMHI that uses a whole-family approach to address child and adolescent mental health concerns, to (1) determine the effects of a collaborative care DMHI on inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional symptoms in children and adolescents and (2) assess whether the effects of a collaborative care DMHI vary across ADHD subtypes and demographic factors.\nCaregivers of children and adolescents with elevated symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or opposition assessed their children's symptom severity approximately every 30 days while participating in Bend Health, Inc. Data from 107 children and adolescents aged 6-17 years who exhibited clinically elevated symptoms at baseline were used to assess symptom severity across monthly assessments (inattention symptom group: n=91, 85.0%; hyperactivity symptom group: n=48, 44.9%; oppositional symptom group: n=70, 65.4%). The majority of the sample exhibited elevated symptoms of at least 2 symptom types at baseline (n=67, 62.6%).\nMembers received care for up to 5.52 months and attended between 0 and 10 coaching, therapy, or psychiatry sessions through Bend Health, Inc. For those with at least 2 assessments, 71.0% (n=22) showed improvements in inattention symptoms, 60.0% (n=9) showed improvements in hyperactivity symptoms, and 60.0% (n=12) showed improvements in oppositional symptoms. When considering group-level change over time, symptom severity decreased over the course of treatment with Bend Health, Inc, for inattention (average decrease=3.51 points, P=.001) and hyperactivity (average decrease=3.07 points, P=.049) but not for oppositional symptoms (average decrease=0.70 points, P=.26). There was a main effect of the duration of care on symptom severity (P<.001) such that each additional month of care was associated with lower symptom scores.\nThis study offers promising early evidence that collaborative care DHMIs may facilitate improvements in ADHD symptoms among children and adolescents, addressing the growing need for accessible and high-quality care for behavioral health problems in the United States.

The literature recommends documenting the presence of language barriers in medical charts. To our knowledge, this mixed methods study is the first to examine language documentation practices in a Canadian inpatient psychiatry setting. The research team interviewed 122 patients admitted to a tertiary care psychiatry ward in Montreal, Canada between 2016-2017 to assess their ability to communicate in the healthcare establishment's languages (English/French). Nineteen participants identified as having a language barrier were selected for a qualitative analysis of the retrospective audit of their medical charts. The presence of a language barrier was reflected in 68% of these charts. When a language barrier was documented, professional interpreters were never used. Our qualitative analysis, informed by literature on medical discourse, aimed to provide clinical, administrative, and organizational recommendations to optimize the utilization of interpreting services in psychiatric wards. Documentation of language data was inconsistently collected, often vague, and shed light on the clinical challenges involved in differentiating language barriers from psychopathology. Normalization of limited care for language diverse patients was reflected in the clinical notes. Findings show that a change of organizational culture is imperative to provide optimal care to language diverse patients. We recommend clinician education and standardization of documentation practices, along with institutional policies supporting the systematic use of professional interpreters in mental healthcare settings, to maximize human rights and patient safety, and to bring medical practices to an acceptable standard of care."}, {"Title": "Focusing on Digital Research Priorities for Advancing the Access and Quality of Mental Health.", "Abstract": "Digital mental health solutions are now well recognized as critical to solving the global mental health crisis.

We included 39 studies with a focus on youth aged 12-25\u00a0years with SEMHP. After critical appraisal, a content analysis and in-depth thematic analysis were conducted. According to the included studies, youth with SEMHP were characterized by severe distress and recurrent comorbid mental health problems, with pervasive suicidality. Further, underlying trauma, family conflicts, peer rejection, deep feelings of hopelessness, and psychosocial malfunctioning characterized SEMHP. It was described that for youth with SEMHP a pervasive pattern of dysfunction in multiple domains is present leading to a detrimental impact. Subsequently, this pattern exerts a reciprocal influence on the mental health problems, causing a vicious circle further worsening SEMHP.

I examine what this notion of 'understanding' amounts to, why it entered and remains influential in psychiatry, and what insights for contemporary psychiatry are buried in the notion.

We observed statistically significant interactions between ADHD-PRS and ERS, suggesting that environmental and genetic factors act synergistically in the development of ADHD symptoms. These effects were not present for depression or anxiety symptoms. No evidence of GxE correlation was detected. Mechanistically, our findings suggest that environmental stressors modulate the genetic risk for ADHD. Future studies should investigate whether the reduction of environmental risks can prevent the development of symptoms of ADHD, especially in children with a family history of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Therapist perceptions of the implementation of a new screening procedure using the ItFits-toolkit in an iCBT routine care clinic: A mixed-methods study using the consolidated framework for implementation research.", "Abstract": "This study investigates the implementation of a new, more automated screening procedure using the ItFits-toolkit in the online clinic, Internet Psychiatry (iPsych) (www.internetpsykiatrien.dk), delivering guided iCBT for mild to moderate anxiety and depressive disorders. The study focuses on how the therapists experienced the process.\nQualitative data were collected from semi-structured individual interviews with seven therapists from iPsych. The interviews were conducted using an interview guide with questions based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Quantitative data on the perceived level of normalization were collected from iPsych therapists, administrative staff, and off-site professionals in contact with the target demographic at 10-time points throughout the implementation.\nThe therapists experienced an improvement in the intake procedure. They reported having more relevant information about the patients to be used during the assessment and the treatment; they liked the new design better; there was a better alignment of expectations between patients and therapists; the patient group was generally a better fit for treatment after implementation; and more of the assessed patients were included in the program. The quantitative data support the interview data and describe a process of normalization that increases over time.\nThe ItFits-toolkit appears to have been an effective mediator of the implementation process.

Treatment of BPD is based on evidence-based psychotherapies (such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Mentalization-Based Therapy, Schema-Focused Therapy or Transference Focused Psychotherapy), which have been shown effective but are poorly available in France. Pharmacological treatments, which are more easily available, are not effective in treating symptoms of the disorder but can be useful in management of comorbidities. In this context, recently called \"generalist\" models have been developed, which every well-trained psychiatrist can implement in their daily practice, combining practical elements from evidence-based psychotherapies and elements of pharmacological management of symptoms and comorbidities. The purpose of this article is to present one of these models, the Good Psychiatric Management (GPM) and its basic principles and its applications, and to provide one of the first French-speaking resources about this model. In addition, beyond the practical elements proposed by the GPM, we discuss the deeper question that it raises, namely the question of a pragmatic integration of different theoretical and clinical models. Indeed, the treatment of BPD patients is at the junction of different conceptualizations of mental pathology (psychopathological, neurobiological) and different modalities of practice (psychotherapy, biological psychiatry). In a French context, that sometimes separates these two models, and in our opinion GPM constitutes an example of clinical collaboration which shows the interest of the combined role of psychiatrist-psychotherapist."}, {"Title": "Free-viewing gaze patterns reveal a mood-congruency bias in MDD during an affective fMRI/eye-tracking task.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been related to abnormal amygdala activity during emotional face processing. However, a recent large-scale study (n\u2009=\u200928,638) found no such correlation, which is probably due to the low precision of fMRI measurements. To address this issue, we used simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking measurements during a commonly employed emotional face recognition task. Eye-tracking provide high-precision data, which can be used to enrich and potentially stabilize fMRI readouts. With the behavioral response, we additionally divided the active task period into a task-related and a free-viewing phase to explore the gaze patterns of MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) and compare their respective neural correlates. Our analysis showed that a mood-congruency attentional bias could be detected in MDD compared to healthy controls during the free-viewing phase but without parallel amygdala disruption. Moreover, the neural correlates of gaze patterns reflected more prefrontal fMRI activity in the free-viewing than the task-related phase. Taken together, spontaneous emotional processing in free viewing might lead to a more pronounced mood-congruency bias in MDD, which indicates that combined fMRI with eye-tracking measurement could be beneficial for our understanding of the underlying psychopathology of MDD in different emotional processing phases.Trial Registration: The BeCOME study is registered on ClinicalTrials (gov: NCT03984084) by the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany."}, {"Title": "Anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients: ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline.", "Abstract": "\u2022 Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in patients with cancer. \u2022 A higher prevalence seen in patients with cancer than the general population is often underrecognised. \u2022 Psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based therapies are effective treatments. \u2022 Psychopharmacological treatments have been shown to be effective treatments of anxiety and depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "A 50-state survey study of thoughts of suicide and social isolation among older adults in the United States.", "Abstract": "We aimed to characterize the prevalence of social disconnection and thoughts of suicide among older adults in the United States, and examine the association between them in a large naturalistic study.\nWe analyzed data from 6 waves of a fifty-state non-probability survey among US adults conducted between February and December 2021.

Working in Walther Spielmeyer's Munich laboratory (1925-1927), Uchimura sought evidence for a vascular theory of Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS). He described an artery supplying the vulnerable sector of the hippocampus, where pathognomonic changes of AHS were noted, and characterized the artery as particularly susceptible to circulatory disturbances. Discovery of this artery led to new concepts and new terminology pertaining to the hippocampus. In addition to having a distinguished career in psychiatry and academia (including a position as University of Tokyo dean), Uchimura was, before attending medical school, one of Japan's best baseball pitchers; he was eventually named Nippon Professional Baseball Organization commissioner and inducted into the Japan Baseball Hall of Fame. Uchimura's description of hippocampal vasculature, which is still subject to debate after nearly a century, brought international attention to AHS and epilepsy and showed the hippocampal vasculature to be variable and vulnerable; important considerations for later neurosurgeons in the development of selective mesial temporal surgery. Prominent figures in neurosurgery have since developed classification systems for the hippocampal vasculature in which the artery of Uchimura remains central.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine system plays a critical role in the body's response and adaptation to stress, and vasopressinergic regulation of the HPA axis is critical to maintaining system responsiveness during chronic stress. However, exposure to repeated or excessive physical or emotional stress or trauma can shift the body's stress response equilibrium to a \"new normal\" underpinned by enduring changes in HPA axis function. Exposure to early life stress due to adverse childhood experiences can also lead to lasting neurobiological changes, including in HPA axis function. HPA axis impairment in patients with depression is considered among the most reliable findings in biological psychiatry, and chronic stress has been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis and onset of depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Modulating HPA axis activity, for example via targeted antagonism of the vasopressin V<sub>1b</sub> receptor, is a promising approach for patients with depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HPA axis impairment. Despite favorable preclinical indications in animal models, demonstration of clinical efficacy for the treatment of depressive disorders by targeting HPA axis dysfunction has been challenging, possibly due to the heterogeneity and syndromal nature of depressive disorders. Measures of HPA axis function, such as elevated cortisol levels, may be useful biomarkers for identifying patients who may benefit from treatments that modulate HPA axis activity. Utilizing clinical biomarkers to identify subsets of patients with impaired HPA axis function who may benefit is a promising next step in fine-tuning HPA axis activity via targeted antagonism of the V<sub>1b</sub> receptor."}, {"Title": "Does method matter?

Accordingly, the four parameters of suicidality examined here are: suicide, suicidal thoughts, suicidal behavior, and suicide attempts. After providing interpretive comments for each, the parameters for all disorders with a suicide subsection were tabulated for ease of reference. Because specific medical disorders are also associated with elevated rates of suicide, these disorders and the supporting research are tabulated and briefly acknowledged.

Principles of architectural design and human-centered co-design have been applied to enhance the patient experience of facility environments; however, little is known about how patients view the impact of physical spaces on their recovery. In this qualitative study, we aimed to understand patient perspectives of how physical environments contribute to mental wellbeing and personal experiences of recovery, in the context of informing future design efforts. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 13 participants receiving outpatient mental health treatment at the Kaiser Permanente San Jose Adult Psychiatry Clinic. Interviews were transcribed and themes were extracted that could inform future design concepts. The sample was comprised of nine female and three male participants, and one unidentified-gender participant, between the ages of 26-64, and across several self-reported racial/ethnic subgroups. We found four dimensions of physical environments that participants reported as impactful: 1) sensory design elements (colors, sounds, and textures), 2) engagement qualities (intensity of distracted activity such as crafting or commuting), 3) social relational aspects (privacy or connection), and 4) affective experiences evoked by being present in the space itself (feeling safe, calm, in control, self-aware, or creative was beneficial). Many of these elements were similarly noted across clinic and non-clinic environments. This study identifies key dimensions of physical environments that can serve as potential metrics of design success in supporting and facilitating mental health recovery. In the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic, where mental health treatment has increasingly shifted outside of traditional clinics, our findings can support patients and clinicians seeking to harness potential in situ therapeutic benefits of physical environments."}, {"Title": "Effects of mindfulness-based interventions on psychological outcomes in college and university students during COVID-19 pandemics: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "We synthesized the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on psychological outcomes in college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTen electronic databases were searched from inception to December 2021.

This article compares care delivery and patient characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in outpatient mental health clinics within an academic health system. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients who received outpatient psychiatric services at two clinics (A and B). The investigators compared care delivery with patients with mental health conditions prepandemic (January 1-December 31, 2019) and midpandemic (January 1-December 31, 2020) periods. Care delivery was defined as the number and type of new and return visits (telehealth and face-to-face visits), patients with recorded measurement-based care (MBC) outcomes, and communication capability between patients and providers. <b>Results:</b> During the prepandemic period, 6,984 patients were seen in Clinics A and B, resulting in 57,629 visits. In the midpandemic period, 7,110 patients were served, resulting in 61,766 total visits. Medication management visits increased from 2019 to 2020; number of visits with documented outcome measures increased by 90% in Clinic A and 15% in Clinic B. The number of MyChart messages per patient increased more than twofold during the midpandemic period. The number of new visits with primary diagnosis of anxiety disorders increased in CY2020 and the number of visits with primary diagnosis of major depressive/mood disorders decreased in CY2020. Payor mix did not vary between the two periods although there was variability between payor mix at the two primary clinic locations. <b>Discussion:</b> The study suggests that there was no detrimental impact on access to care between the prepandemic and midpandemic periods within the health system. Mental health visits while pivoting to telehealth increased during the midpandemic period. Transition to telepsychiatry improved the ability to administer and document MBC."}, {"Title": "Structural Racism in Psychiatric Research Careers: Eradicating Barriers to a More Diverse Workforce.", "Abstract": "Investigators from minoritized backgrounds are underrepresented in psychiatric research. That underrepresentation contributes to disparities in outcomes of access to mental health care. Drawing on lived experience, scholarly qualitative reports, and empirical data, the authors review how the underrepresentation of minoritized researchers arises from interlocking, self-reinforcing effects of structural biases in our research training and funding institutions. Minoritized researchers experience diminished early access to advanced training and opportunities, stereotype threats and microaggressions, isolation due to lack of peers and senior mentors, decreased access to early funding, and unique community and personal financial pressures. These represent structural racism-a system of institutional assumptions and practices that perpetuates race-based disparities, in spite of those institutions' efforts to increase diversity and in contradiction to the values that academic leaders outwardly espouse. The authors further review potential approaches to reversing these structural biases, including undergraduate-focused research experiences, financial support for faculty who lead training/mentoring programs, targeted mentoring through scholarly societies, better use of federal diversity supplement funding, support for scientific reentry, cohort building, diversity efforts targeting senior leadership, and rigorous examination of hiring, compensation, and promotion practices. Several of these approaches have empirically proven best practices and models for dissemination. If implemented alongside outcome measurement, they have the potential to reverse decades of structural bias in psychiatry and psychiatric research."}, {"Title": "Determinants of clinical outcome and length of stay in acute care forensic psychiatry units.", "Abstract": "Criminological and sociodemographic variables, such as previous criminal convictions, increased risk of violence, early onset of mental disorder, antisocial personality, psychosis and low social support, have all been related to longer length of stay (LoS) and poorer outcome in long stay forensic services. The factors impacting on LoS and clinical response in acute care specialized units are poorly documented. To address this issue, we examined the psychiatric records of all cases admitted between January 1st and December 31th 2020 in the sole acute ward for detained persons located in the central prison of the Geneva County, Switzerland. Information on judicial status included pre-trial versus sentence execution, previous incarcerations, and age of the first incarceration. Sociodemographic data included age, gender, marital status, and education attainment. Previous inpatient stays prior to incarceration were recorded. All of the ICD-10 clinical diagnoses were made by two independent, board-certified psychiatrists blind to the scope of the study. The standardized assessment was based on the HoNOS (Health of Nation Outcome Scales) at admission and discharge, HONOS-secure at admission, HCR-20 (Historical Clinical Risk 20) version 2, PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist Revised), and SAPROF (Structured Assessment of Protective Factors). Stepwise forward multiple linear regression models predicting the LoS and delta HONOS respectively were built with the above mentioned parameters. The selected variables were then used in univariate and multivariable regression models. Higher HCR-scores (mainly on clinical items), and longer LoS were related to higher delta HONOS scores. In contrast, cases in pre-trial detention showed a worst clinical outcome. In multivariable models, all three variables remained independent predictors of the clinical outcome and explained 30.7% of its variance. Only education and diagnosis of borderline personality were related to the LoS and explained 12.6% of its variance in multivariable models. Our results suggest that the use of acute wards specialized in forensic psychiatry are mainly useful for patients with prior inpatient care experience, and higher violence risk during sentence execution. In contrast, they seem to be less performant for persons in pre-trial detention that could benefit from less restrictive clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Predicting suicide risk in 137,112 people with severe mental illness in Finland: external validation of the Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS).", "Abstract": "Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS) is a standardised, scalable, and transparent instrument for suicide risk assessment in people with severe mental illness (SMI) based on 17 sociodemographic, criminal history, familial, and clinical risk factors.

We utilised a Finnish population sample of all persons diagnosed by mental health services with SMI (schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders) between 1996 and 2017 (n\u2009=\u2009137,112). To evaluate the performance of OxMIS, we initially calculated the predicted 12-month suicide risk for each individual by weighting risk factors by effect sizes reported in the original OxMIS prediction model and converted to a probability. This probability was then used to assess the discrimination and calibration of the OxMIS model in this external sample. Within a year of assessment, 1.1% of people with SMI (n\u2009=\u20091475) had died by suicide. The overall discrimination of the tool was good, with an area under the curve of 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.71). The model initially overestimated suicide risks in those with elevated predicted risks of >5% over 12 months (Harrell's E<sub>max</sub>\u2009=\u20090.114), which applied to 1.3% (n\u2009=\u20091780) of the cohort.

However, it is unclear if the worsening mental health among physicians is due to specific occupational stressors, reflective of general societal stressors during the pandemic, or a combination. We evaluated the difference in mental health and addictions health service use between physicians and non-physicians, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada between March 11, 2017 and August 11, 2021 using data collected from Ontario's universal health system. Physicians were identified using registrations with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario between 1990 and 2020. Participants included 41,814 physicians and 12,054,070 non-physicians. We compared the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020 to August 11, 2021) to the period before COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2017 to February 11, 2020). The primary outcome was mental health and addiction outpatient visits overall and subdivided into virtual versus in-person, psychiatrists versus family medicine and general practice clinicians. We used generalized estimating equations for the analyses. Pre-pandemic, after adjustment for age and sex, physicians had higher rates of psychiatry visits (aIRR 3.91 95% CI 3.55 to 4.30) and lower rates of family medicine visits (aIRR 0.62 95% CI 0.58 to 0.66) compared to non-physicians. During the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of outpatient mental health and addiction (MHA) visits increased by 23.2% in physicians (888.4 pre versus 1,094.7 during per 1,000 person-years, aIRR 1.39 95% CI 1.28 to 1.51) and 9.8% in non-physicians (615.5 pre versus 675.9 during per 1,000 person-years, aIRR 1.12 95% CI 1.09 to 1.14). Outpatient MHA and virtual care visits increased more among physicians than non-physicians during the first 18 months of the pandemic. Limitations include residual confounding between physician and non-physicians and challenges differentiating whether observed increases in MHA visits during the pandemic are due to stressors or changes in health care access.\nThe first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a larger increase in outpatient MHA visits in physicians than non-physicians. These findings suggest physicians may have had larger negative mental health during COVID-19 than the general population and highlight the need for increased access to mental health services and system level changes to promote physician wellness."}, {"Title": "The Effect of Adding Curcumin to Sertraline in the Treatment of Severe Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized, Double-Blind Clinical Trial.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic and debilitating disease influenced by inflammatory processes in the brain.

However, the anxiety score was lower in the intervention group. Moreover, no severe adverse events were observed in all patients.\nAdding 40 mg/d of SinaCurcumin to sertraline as a routine medical regimen did not improve the depression and anxiety levels in severe MDD patients. However, the anxiety score was lower in the intervention group than in the placebo receiver, which suggests curcumin may have a more effect on anxiety."}, {"Title": "Analysis of Hospital Operating Margins and Provision of Safety Net Services.", "Abstract": "Safety net hospitals (SNH) provide many community services.

Each was categorized as a quintile or binary response. Covariates included hospital ownership, size, teaching status, census region, urbanicity, and wage index.\nOperating margin and its association with each safety net criterion was determined using linear regression adjusting for all safety net criteria and covariates.\nA total of 4219 hospitals were analyzed, of which 3329 hospitals (78.9%) satisfied at least 1 safety net criterion; 23 hospitals (0.5%) met 4 or all 5 criteria. Among safety net criteria, the highest quintile of undercompensated care (-6.2 percentage point difference compared with lowest quintile; 95% CI, -8.2 to -4.2 percentage points), uncompensated care (-3.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.1 to -1.6 percentage points), and neighborhood disadvantage (-3.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -5.7 to -2.1 percentage points) were each associated with a lower operating margin.

Most studies of children and adolescents are done on ADHD and autism spectrum disorders, whereas single reports exist largely on positive effects on cognitive symptoms and quality of life. Initial studies regarding anorexia nervosa point to a potential effect of weight gain and reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms. To date, the effects of prebiotics and probiotics in depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia have been mainly investigated in adults. The best reported evidence exists for depression, whereas the effects on depressive symptomatology are small. Positive effects are seen on gastrointestinal symptoms in these disorders. Given these positive effects, the mixed literature reports may result from very heterogeneous study designs. Nevertheless, the high potential of prebiotics and probiotics may be seen for minors with mental health problems.

We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE.

Age acceleration in different epigenetic clocks can serve as biomarker for such risk and could help to disentangle the interplay of psychiatric comorbidity and early adversity on age-related diseases and mortality. We evaluated five epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge and DunedinPoAm) in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample using epigenome-wide DNA methylation data from peripheral blood of 429 subjects from two studies at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. Burden of psychiatric disease, represented by a weighted score, was significantly associated with biological age acceleration as measured by GrimAge and DunedinPoAm (R2-adj. 0.22 and 0.33 for GrimAge and DunedinPoAm, respectively), but not the other investigated clocks. The relation of burden of psychiatric disease appeared independent of differences in socioeconomic status and medication. Our findings indicate that increased burden of psychiatric disease may associate with accelerated biological aging. This highlights the importance of medical management of patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities and the potential usefulness of specific epigenetic clocks for early detection of risk and targeted intervention to reduce mortality in psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Effect of a long-term art-based group therapy with eating disorders.", "Abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) affect the physical, psychological, emotional and interpersonal areas of the individual and cause serious medical and mental consequences.

In most psychiatric disorders, both diagnosis and monitoring can be challenging, frequently requiring long-term investigation and follow-up. The discovery of better methods to facilitate accurate and fast diagnosis and monitoring of psychiatric disorders is therefore crucial. Circulating nucleic acids (CNAs) are among these new tools. CNAs (DNA or RNA) can be found circulating in body biofluids, and can be isolated from biological samples such as plasma. They can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognoses. They appear to be promising for disorders (such as psychiatric disorders) that involve organs or structures that are difficult to assess. This review presents an accurate assessment of the current literature about the use of plasma and serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as biomarkers for several aspects of psychiatric disorders: diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response, and monitor disease progression. For each psychiatric disorder, we examine the effect sizes to give insights on the efficacy of CNAs as biomarkers. The global effect size for plasma nuclear and mitochondrial cfDNA studies was generally moderate for psychiatric disorders. In addition, we discuss future applications of CNAs and particularly cfDNA as non-invasive biomarkers for these diseases."}, {"Title": "Perceptions of the oral health of their patients reported by Brazilian medical residents in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Persons with severe mental disorders have higher chances of presenting oral health problems than persons in the general population. Mental disorders are considered public-health problems worldwide. Interpreting statements on oral health made by medical students receiving instruction in psychiatry is essential to provide elements for reflection on their difficulties, barriers or limited knowledge in managing their patients' oral health. Based on the presupposition that doctors provide their patients with no instruction or support concerning oral complaints, because these do not symbolize the same challenges as those emerging from severe mental disorders. The aim of this study was to interpret symbolic meanings of statements expressed by medical residents in psychiatry at a specialized university outpatient clinic, about their patients' oral health. Qualitative research using the Qualitative-Clinical method was conducted, adopting the theoretical reference of medical psychology. Data were analyzed by the Clinical-Qualitative Content method and the Seven-Step technique. Based on 06 interviews analyzed, the following categories emerged: \"What do I do? Psychiatrists' dilemmas about not understanding their role in patients' oral health; and \"Dentists do not participate in Balint' so-called \"collusion in anonymity\". It was concluded that among others, the paradigm consisted of a sociological composition, therefore it was stronger than personal decisions that might eventually oppose the barriers to interdisciplinary work posed by the institutional model, which were intertwined with paradigmatic barriers. Thus, specialist training should include a dental perspective, so that oral examinations would always be included in the physical examinations, from an interdisciplinary perspective of the integrity of health-care."}, {"Title": "Temperature and mental health-related emergency department and hospital encounters among children, adolescents and young adults.", "Abstract": "We examine the association between high ambient temperature and acute mental health-related healthcare encounters in New York City for children, adolescents and young adults.\nThis case-crossover study included emergency department (ED) visits and hospital encounters with a primary diagnosis of any mental health disorder during warm-season months (June-August) in New York City from 2005 to 2011 from patients of three age groups (6-11, 12-17 and 18-25\u00a0years). Using a distributed lag non-linear model over 0-5 lag days, by fitting a conditional logistic regression for each age group, we calculated the cumulative odds ratios of mental health encounters associated with an elevated temperature. Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, payment source and mental health categories to elucidate vulnerable subpopulations.\nIn New York City, there were 82,982 mental health-related encounters for young people aged 6 to 25\u00a0years during our study period months. Elevated temperature days were associated with higher risk of mental health-related ED and hospital encounters for the 6- to 11-year-olds (odds ratio [OR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.46), for the 12- to 17-year-olds (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.25) and for the 18- to 25-year-olds (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15).

We randomly selected 110 for chart review. We reviewed the visit when the SSRI was first prescribed (medication visit), immediately previous visit, and immediately subsequent visit. We abstracted rationale for prescribing medication, subspecialist involvement, referral for psychotherapy, and medication monitoring practices.\nAt the medication visit, in 82% (n = 90) of cases, PCPs documented reasons for starting an SSRI, most commonly clinical change (57%, n = 63). Thirty percent (n = 33) of patients had documented involvement of developmental-behavioral pediatrics or psychiatry subspecialists at 1 of the 3 visits reviewed. Thirty-three percent (n = 37) were referred to unspecified psychotherapy; 4% (n = 4) were referred specifically for cognitive behavioral therapy. Of 69 patients with a subsequent visit, 48% (n = 33) had documentation of monitoring for side effects.\nWhen prescribing SSRIs for children with anxiety and/or depression, PCPs in this network documented appropriate indications for starting medication and prescribed without subspecialist involvement.

She examined 977 cousins of 54 DP probands and found a best-estimate risk of 1.4%. She conducted within-study analyses, showing a much higher risk for DP in the siblings than cousins of DP probands. She studied DP-related personalities showing a familial link between these conditions and risk for DP. She demonstrated that the risk for DP in cousins was impacted substantially by the distribution, in ancestors, of psychosis and personality abnormalities. After completing work on this article, Weinberg worked in private practice in Frankfurt, emigrating to the Netherlands in 1934, where she worked at a Jewish psychiatric hospital.

There is currently an adolescent mental health crisis, with a high prevalence of disorders, diagnostic complexity, and many adolescents failing to respond to conventional treatments. While there is strong evidence for the use of ketamine in adults for a variety of treatment-refractory mental illnesses, research in adolescents is in its early stages. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) has been described in adults with promising results and here we present the first published cases of the use of KAP in adolescents. The four cases include adolescents aged 14-19 at the initiation of treatment, each with a variety of comorbid diagnoses including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, panic, and trauma-related symptoms. They each initially received sublingual ketamine, followed by sessions with intramuscular ketamine. Their courses varied, but each had symptomatic and functional improvements, and the treatment was well-tolerated. Subjective patient reports are included. Rapid resolution of symptomatology and suffering often occurs within months as the result of the application of KAP to adolescent psychiatric care but is not inevitable. Family involvement in the treatment process appears to be essential to success.

On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, disoriented, tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypertensive with generalized muscle rigidity. Further investigation revealed that the patient had recently been prescribed ciprofloxacin and restarted on quetiapine. The initial differential diagnosis was acute dystonia, and subsequently, the patient was placed on fluids, lorazepam, diazepam, and later benztropine. The patient's symptoms began to resolve, and psychiatry was consulted. Given the patient's autonomic instability, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and leukocytosis, psychiatric consultation revealed an atypical case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). It was postulated that the patient's NMS was caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between ciprofloxacin, a moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, and quetiapine, which is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. The patient was then taken off quetiapine, admitted overnight, and discharged the next morning with complete resolution of his symptoms along with a prescription for diazepam. This case highlights the variable presentation of NMS and the need for clinicians to consider DDI when managing psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Psychometric Validity of the Anxiety Inventory for Respiratory Disease (AIR) Scale in an Indian Sample of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "Abstract": "Introduction Researchers have found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\u00a0patients suffer from anxiety more than the general population.\u00a0The Anxiety Inventory for Respiratory Disease (AIR) scale has been primarily used to assess non-somatic anxiety in COPD patients. The validity of AIR among COPD patients has not been evaluated in Indian settings. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the validity of AIR in these patients. The study aimed to evaluate concurrent criterion and discriminative validity of the AIR screening scale among patients with COPD using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.2 as the gold standard measure for diagnosing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) anxiety disorders. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Outpatients Department (OPD) of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, from August 2018 to July 2019. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with COPD and aged 30 or above were recruited. All participants were further assessed in person by a psychiatry resident doctor using semi-structured proforma, MINI\u00a07.0.2, and AIR\u00a0Disease (Hindi). Mann-Whitney U and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted. The two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results To assess the concurrent criterion validity of the AIR scale for screening clinical anxiety disorders, the ROC\u00a0curve was constructed using MINI diagnoses of anxiety disorder as the gold standard measure. A cut-off score of 5.5 was found to maximize both the specificity and sensitivity of the AIR scale for screening anxiety disorders among COPD patients with COPD. The AIR scale showed a high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (89%) at this cut-point. Conclusion The findings of this study\u00a0recommend a cut-off score of 5.5 on the AIR scale instead of 8 in previous studies, as maintaining the previously recommended cut-offs in Indian settings may lead to an increase in false negatives. This could have negative consequences for patients seeking treatment.

To this end, a chart review of psychotherapy and psychiatry progress notes from 2019 to 2022 and a patient interview were utilized to assess the impact of COVID-19 and telemedicine on the patient's anxiety symptoms, feelings of isolation, and treatment plan. Feelings of isolation, especially, were exacerbated. Prior to the pandemic, the patient was extremely physically and socially active. The reduced ability to interact with others and maintain her independence was detrimental. As a result, COVID-19 impacted the patient's progress significantly and caused regression of symptoms. However, telemedicine allowed for the continuation of therapy and follow-up to the present time. Though telemedicine allowed the patient to receive regular care for the duration of the lockdown and to regain control of anxiety symptoms, she only recently became comfortable with the technology. Now, the patient prefers the convenience and ease of telemedicine, continues to receive care through this modality, and feels that her current care is equivalent to in-person therapy. This case report should serve as a reminder of the effect that isolation can have on older adults with pre-existing anxiety. Notably, isolation may be related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, such as reduced mobility or limited access to social services. In any case, isolation has a substantial impact on older patients' mental health. And, despite the availability of telemedicine, clinicians should be aware of the technical challenges surrounding emergency implementation. We suggest early exposure to telemedicine for patients, as well as staff training focused on the potential technical limitations of those patients. We also suggest an assessment of technical literacy, conducted early on as part of a patient's initial intake. The main limitation of this report, and the conclusions drawn herein, is the lack of quantitative measures available. Thus, assessment of the patient's condition and symptoms was restricted to clinician assessment and self-reported measures. We feel though\u00a0that this remains a useful example of the long-term benefit of telemedicine for older individuals."}, {"Title": "Assessing attitudes of fourth year medical students towards psychiatry and mental illness.", "Abstract": "Research revealed a high prevalence of negative attitudes towards psychiatry and mental illness among medical students prior to formal psychiatric education.

The occupancy of funded posts decreased (92% in 2008 to 82% in 2018). When considering both funded and unfunded posts, only three more psychiatrists were being trained in 2018. Supernumeraries appointed in unfunded posts can be expected to return to their countries of origin. As such, a decrease in filled funded posts likely reflects a decrease in training psychiatrists destined to work in South Africa. While child and adolescent psychiatry was the only sub-speciality with accredited training posts in 2008, all sub-specialities included on the questionnaire had accredited training posts in 2018, and the number of accredited training posts in child and adolescent psychiatry doubled. That said, many of the posts were unfunded and vacant.\nWhile there was an increase in posts from 2008 to 2018, many posts remained unfilled.

This paper proposes to recognize patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) using their facial images based on deep learning algorithm, and to investigate objective differences in facial expressions between SCZ patients and healthy controls using deep learning algorithm and statistical analyses.\nThe study consists of two parts. The first part recruited 106 SCZ patients and 101 healthy controls, and videotaped their facial expressions through a fixed experimental paradigm. The video data were randomly divided into two sets, one for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the classification of \"healthy control\" or \"SCZ patient\" as output and the other for evaluating the classification result of the trained CNN. In the second part, all facial images of the recruited participants were put into another CNN separately, which was priorly trained with a facial expression database and will output the most likely facial expressions of the recruited participants. Statistical analyses were performed on the obtained facial expressions to find out the objective differences in facial expressions between the two recruited groups.\nThe trained CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 95.18% for classifying \"healthy control\" or \"SCZ patient.\" Statistical results on the obtained facial expressions demonstrated that the objective differences between the two recruited groups were statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nFacial expressions hold great promise as SCZ clues with the help of deep learning algorithm.

Antipsychotics are commonly described as either typical or atypical, but this dichotomous classification does not reflect the diversity of their pharmacological and clinical profiles. There is a need for a data-driven antipsychotic classification scheme suitable for clinicians and researchers that maps onto both pharmacological and clinical effects. Receptor affinity provides one starting point for such a scheme.\nWe analyzed affinities of 27 antipsychotics for 42 receptors from 3325 in\u00a0vitro receptor binding studies. We used a clustering algorithm to group antipsychotics based on receptor affinity. Using a machine learning model, we examined the ability of this grouping to predict antipsychotic-induced clinical effects quantified according to an umbrella review of clinical trial and treatment guideline data.\nClustering resulted in 4 groups of antipsychotics. The predominant receptor affinity and clinical effect \"fingerprints\" of these 4 groups were defined as follows: group 1, muscarinic (M<sub>2</sub>-M<sub>5</sub>) receptor antagonism (cholinergic and metabolic side effects); group 2, dopamine (D<sub>2</sub>) partial agonism and adrenergic antagonism (overall low side-effect burden); group 3, serotonergic and dopaminergic antagonism (overall moderate side-effect burden); and group 4, dopaminergic antagonism (extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia). Groups 1 and 4 were more efficacious than groups 2 and 3. The classification was shown to predict out-of-sample clinical effects of individual drugs.\nA receptor affinity-based grouping not only reflects compound pharmacology but also detects meaningful clinical differences.

This project may inform other Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry teams seeking to promote equity in care.\nWe examined behavioral emergency response team (BERT) management at an urban, tertiary-care medical center in the United States over a 3-year period. BERT data from an existing dataset were combined with demographic information from the hospital's electronic medical record. Race and ethnic identities were categorized as Black, Hispanic, Asian, White, and unknown. BERT events were coded based on the most restrictive intervention utilized per unique patient. Cross-tabulations and adjusted odds ratios from multivariate logistic regression were used to identify quality improvement targets in this exploratory project.\nThe sample included N\u00a0= 902 patients and 1532 BERT events. The most frequent intervention reached was verbal de-escalation (n\u00a0= 419 patients, 46.45%) and the least frequent was 4-point restraints (n\u00a0= 29 patients, 3.2%). Half of BERT activations for Asian and a third for Hispanic patients required interpreter services. Anxiety and cognitive disorders and 2 BERT interventions, verbal de-escalation, and intramuscular/intravenous/ medications, were significantly associated with race/ethnic category. The most restrictive intervention for BERTs involving Black and Asian patients were verbal de-escalation (60.1%) and intramuscular/intravenous(53.7%), respectively. These proportions were higher compared with other race/ethnic groups. There was a greater percentage of patients from the unknown (6.3%) and Black (5.9%) race/ethnic groups placed in 4-point restraints compared with other groups (3.2%) that did not reach statistical significance. A logistic regression model predicting 4-point restraints indicated that younger age, multiple BERTs, and violent behavior as a reason for BERT activation, but not race/ethnic group, resulted in significantly higher odds.\nThis project illustrates that a quality improvement framework utilizing existing clinical data can be used to engage in organizational introspection and identify potential areas of bias in BERT management. Our findings suggest opportunities for further exploration, enhanced education, and programmatic improvements regarding BERT intervention; 4-point restraints; interpreter services; and the influence of race on perception of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant efficacy of cariprazine in bipolar disorder and the role of its pharmacodynamic properties: A hypothesis based on data.", "Abstract": "The treatment of bipolar depression is one of the most challenging needs in contemporary psychiatry. Currently, only quetiapine, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, lurasidone, cariprazine, and recently lumateperone have been FDA-approved to treat this condition. The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain elusive. The current study investigated whether the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine fit into a previously developed model which was the first to be derived based on the strict combination of clinical and preclinical data. The authors performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of cariprazine. The original model suggests that a constellation of effects on different receptors is necessary and that serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to play a significant role in acute bipolar depression. On the contrary, norepinephrine activity seems to be necessary. Probably the early antidepressant effect can be achieved through an agonistic activity at 5HT-1A and antagonism at alpha1 noradrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors, but the presence of a norepinephrine reuptake inhibition appears essential to sustain it. Overall, the properties of cariprazine fit well the proposed model and add to its validity.

Finally, recent cutting-edge cellular studies indicate an underlying vulnerability to the effect of sex hormones at a cellular level. Overall the findings across studies do not yet fit together into a complete description of the underlying biology of PMDD.

However, recurrence and chronicity may heavily influence HPA axis dynamics in MDD along its course and also explain conflicting results in literature. Thus, the mechanistic understanding of HPA axis (re)activity changes over time could be of major importance for unravelling the dynamic pathophysiology of MDD.\nThis study simultaneously assessed several baseline and dynamic HPA-axis-related endocrine biomarkers in both saliva (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA; sulfated DHEA, DHEA-s; cortisol, CORT) and plasma (CORT; adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH; copeptin, CoP) over three consecutive days using overnight HPA axis stimulation (metyrapone) and suppression (dexamethasone) challenges in order to investigate differences between antidepressant-free MDD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a014) with and without history of prior depressive episodes (i.e., first vs. recurrent episode).\nOur results suggest group differences only with respect to saliva DHEA levels, with recurrent-episode MDD patients showing overall lower saliva DHEA levels across the three days, and statistically significant differences mainly at day 1 (baseline) across all three timepoints (awakening, +30\u00a0min, +60\u00a0min), even after adjustment for confounders.\nOur study supports that salivary DHEA levels could represent a significant biomarker of MDD progression and individual stress resilience. DHEA deserves additional attention in the research of pathophysiology, staging and individualized treatment of MDD. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate HPA axis reactivity along MDD course and progression to better understand temporal effects on stress-system-related alterations, related phenotypes and appropriate treatment."}, {"Title": "Knowledge and Attitudes of First- and Final-Year Medical Students about Electroconvulsive Therapy: The Impact of Media.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate medical students' knowledge about and attitudes towards electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and to assess the impact of information sources (including those within and outside the curriculum) on knowledge and attitudes by comparing first- and final-year medical students.\nTwo hundred and ninety-five first-year and one hundred forty-nine final-year medical students of the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium responded to an anonymous self-administered survey which consisted of questions about sociodemographic background, self-perceived knowledge about medicine, psychiatry and ECT, interest in psychiatry, experience with psychiatric disorders, information sources of ECT, and knowledge about and attitudes towards ECT.\nCompared to first-year medical students, final-year students had better knowledge about and more positive attitudes towards ECT, partially explained by differences in information sources. Nevertheless, both student groups showed an average knowledge score below 50%. Whereas freshmen attributed their knowledge to movies or documentaries, senior students gained knowledge mainly at university courses, scientific journals, and attending live ECT sessions. A significant positive correlation was found between knowledge about and positive attitudes towards ECT.\nThe knowledge of first- and final-year medical students remains limited, potentially due to limited instruction about ECT in medical courses. The use of media as an information source predicted negative attitudes towards ECT.

This is particularly concerning, because disrupted sleep is related to worsened clinical, neurocognitive and functional outcomes and leads to increased ADHD symptom impairment. Due to the specific difficulties adolescents with ADHD experience, a tailored sleep treatment is needed. Therefore, our lab developed a cognitive behavioural treatment-Sleep IntervEntion as Sympom Treatment for ADHD (SIESTA)-that integrates sleep training with motivational interviewing, and planning/organisational skills training with the aim of improving sleep problems in adolescents with ADHD.\nA randomised, controlled, investigator-blinded monocentre trial is used to test whether SIESTA in combination with treatment as usual (TAU) for ADHD results in greater improvement in sleep problems than TAU only. Adolescents (aged 13-17 years) with ADHD and sleep problems are included. They complete measurements before treatment (pre-test), approximately 7\u2009weeks after the pre-test (post-test), and approximately 3\u2009months after the post-test (follow-up). The assessment includes questionnaires filled out by adolescents, parents and teachers. Additionally, sleep is assessed by actigraphy and sleep diaries at all time-points. Primary outcomes include objectively and subjectively measured sleep architecture (specified as total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency and number of awakenings), subjectively measured sleep problems and sleep hygiene. Secondary outcomes include ADHD symptoms, comorbidities and functional outcomes.

Given that the delayed diagnosis of such a dysfunction is often associated with excess mortality, it seems essential to devote vastly more attention to this significant clinical characteristic.\nThis cross-sectional study was performed on 309 patients [viz. 259 cases hospitalized in general wards and 50 individuals admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)]. For this purpose, a Demographic-Clinical Information Questionnaire, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and face-to-face interviews were completed by a trained senior psychiatry resident. The data analysis was further done with the SPSS Statistics V22.0 software package.\nOut of 259 patients admitted to the general wards and 50 cases in the ICU due to COVID-19, 41 (15.8%) and 11 (22%) individuals were diagnosed with delirium, respectively.

It is defined by world health organization as \"the degree to which the person's behavior corresponds to the agreed recommendations from a health care provider\". Non-adherence is a multi-factorial phenomenon that can result from five major interacting factors. These are health team and health system-related factors; patient-related factors; therapy-related factors; socio-economic factors; and condition-related factors. The prevalence of non-adherence in mental illness was found to be 40% to 60% world wide. In developing countries, the magnitude of poor adherence is expected to increase. So this study aimed to assess medication adherence status and its associated factors among psychiatric patients in Asella Referral and Teaching Hospital in Oromia, Ethiopia.\nAn institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 18, 2022 to May 25, 2022, with a total sample of 422 patients. Medication adherence was measured by a modified version of the medication adherence rating scale in the psychiatric setting to determine treatment adherence status, and unstructured questionnaires were assessed by interviewing the patient. Additional data concerning the medication-taking behavior of the patient was collected from caregivers. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to see the association between each explanatory variable and the outcome variable. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were used to see the association between treatment adherence and the strength of the link.\nA total of 395 study participants were interviewed, making a response rate of 93.6%.

In this study, factors such as having the slight insight or poor insight about their illness and belief in the medication decreased medication adherence, whereas having an alcohol use history in their lifetime and perceived stigma increased medication adherence. For a better health outcome, awareness creation at an insight level needs to be worked on by psychiatric professionals working on the follow-up psychiatric patients at psychiatry clinic of Assela Referral and Teaching Hospital to enable them to well adhere to their medication."}, {"Title": "Venlafaxine deprescribing and thyroid function.", "Abstract": "This report highlights the effects of discontinuing venlafaxine on thyroid function in an older adult with previously well-managed Hashimoto thyroiditis and sleep apnea.\nConcurrent intervention.\nSetting Community-based psychiatry practice Patient - 66 year old female Intervention Over 8\u2009months, a 66-year-old patient slowly reduced the venlafaxine dose.

However, negotiating treatment in psychiatric contexts can be challenging with patients whose ability to evaluate treatment recommendations rationally may be impaired. This article attempts to examine a conversational practice that psychiatrists use to deal with patients' views and perspectives by formulating what the patients have said related to treatment. Taking the naturally occurring, face-to-face outpatient psychiatric consultations as the data, the present study uses conversation analysis (CA) as a method to demonstrate in a fine-grained detail what functions formulations of patients' perspectives serve in psychiatric contexts. We found that by eliciting patients' views and perspectives toward treatment, this type of formulation is not only used to achieve mutual understanding and establish the grounds for treatment decisions, but may also be used to challenge the legitimacy of patients' position, steering treatment decision to the direction preferred by the psychiatrists. We argue that in the process of treatment decision making, psychiatrists do not simply impose their perspectives upon the patients, instead, they attempt to achieve consensus with patients by balancing their institutional authority and orientation to the patients' perspectives.

Persons who bully and those who are bullied have consistently been found to have higher levels of depression, suicidal ideation, physical injury, distractibility, somatic problems, anxiety, poor self-esteem, and school absenteeism than those not involved with bullying. Objectives To our knowledge, no study has compared physicians' practices of bullying prevention across different hospital settings and the effect of these practices on parents' level of awareness. This article represents a subset (phase I) of the inter-departmental quality improvement study for comparing practices of healthcare professionals regarding bullying prevention between the pediatric outpatient clinic and child & adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic, and parents' awareness about provider's anti-bullying practices. Methods Phase I was conducted as a cross-sectional study with the target population of adolescents (age 12-17 yrs) and corresponding guardians, seeking care from healthcare providers (residents, fellows and attendings) in the child & adolescent outpatient psychiatry clinic and pediatric outpatient clinic. It targeted both patients and providers, with adolescents/guardians completing questionnaire about bullying experiences, physician's anti-bullying practices during past healthcare visits and adolescent Peer Relations Instrument. Providers answered questions about bullying assessing practices, level of self-preparedness and limitations. Results Data were analyzed in SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and Chi-square tests were used for analyses of variables, and cross-comparing results for particular subsets. A total of 150 questionnaires were distributed. Among the provider surveys, self-reported level of preparedness (on a scale of 1-5; 1- least, 5-most) for assessing bullying was more in Psychiatry providers (Median 4, Mean 4.1) as compared to Pediatric providers (Median 3, Mean 2.9). In the first evaluation, very unprepared, unprepared and neutral (1, 2, 3) responses were contrasted with prepared to very prepared responses (4,5).\u00a0The second evaluation excludes the neutral responses (3) and tests responses for the unprepared group (1,2) with the prepared group (4,5).\u00a0The first evaluation resulted in Chi-Squared = 6.810, significant at p = 0.05 and the second evaluation resulted in Chi-squared = 4.774, also significant at p = 0.05.

Drawing on the definition of infodemiology by Eysenbach, this emerging field can be termed \"psychiatric and mental health infodemiology,\" defined as the science of distribution and determinants of information in an electronic medium, including the internet, or in a population to inform mental health services and policies. Since Google Trends is one of its popular tools, this minireview describes its advantages, application, methodological considerations, and limitations in psychiatric and mental health research. The advantage of Google Trends is the nature of its data, which may represent the actual behavior rather than their users' stated preferences in real-time through automatic anonymization. As such, it can provide readily available data about sensitive health topics like mental disorders. Therefore, Google Trends has been used to explore public concerns, interests, and behaviors about psychiatric and mental health phenomena, service providers, and specific disciplines.

Likewise, its limitations should be accounted for in its interpretation, including restricted representation of people who use the Google search engine, limited validity in areas with low internet penetration or freedom of speech, does not provide absolute search volumes, unknown sampled queries, and limited transparency in its algorithm, especially the terms and idioms it subsumes under its \"topic\" keywords."}, {"Title": "Potential Roles of m6A and FTO in Synaptic Connectivity and Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "RNA modifications known as epitranscriptomics have emerged as a novel layer of transcriptomic regulation. Like the well-studied epigenetic modifications characterized in DNA and on histone-tails, they have been shown to regulate activity-dependent gene expression and play a vital role in shaping synaptic connections in response to external stimuli. Among the hundreds of known RNA modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification in eukaryotes. Through recognition of its binding proteins, m6A can regulate various aspects of mRNA metabolism and is essential for maintaining higher brain functions. Indeed, m6A is highly enriched in synapses and is involved in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and adult neurogenesis. m6A can also respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting an important role in linking molecular and behavioral stress. This review summarizes key findings from fields related to major depressive disorder (MDD) including stress and learning and memory, which suggest that activity-dependent m6A changes may, directly and indirectly, contribute to synaptic connectivity changes underlying MDD. Furthermore, we will highlight the roles of m6A and FTO, a m6A eraser, in the context of depressive-like behaviors. Although we have only begun to explore m6A in the context of MDD and psychiatry, elucidating a link between m6A and MDD presents a novel molecular mechanism underlying MDD pathogenesis."}, {"Title": "[What do medical students think about functional neurological disorders?].", "Abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are a frequent reason for visits in neurology.

Fifty-seven students (48.3%) assumed that the diagnosis of FND was mostly a clinical diagnosis of exclusion and 63 (53.4%) indicated that it is managed only by psychiatry. One hundred and one students (85.6%) considered that adequate training on FNDs is an important aspect of their medical training.\nMedical students are aware of the existence of FNDs, but their preferred terminology, as well as the perceived aetiological factors, reflect that the historical view of these disorders is still deeply rooted.

Relevant guidelines recommend that restrictive measures are to be used exclusively if de-escalation and other preventive strategies have failed and there is a risk of harm to patients or staff if no action is taken. However, restrictive measures are untherapeutic and can be harmful. In order to enable staff to intervene before inpatient violence or other serious incidents occur and thus to avoid restrictive measures, mental health staff training programs including de-escalation components are being adopted in general as well as forensic mental health settings. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of mental health staff training in de-escalation techniques in the field of general psychiatry. However, there are no reviews evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing violent incidents in forensic psychiatric settings. Here we present the first literature review on the effectiveness staff training in de-escalation techniques in the field of forensic psychiatry.\nWe searched relevant databases for original research on the effectiveness of reducing violence in forensic psychiatric settings. Studies were included if they investigated staff training programs with de-escalation techniques in forensic mental health settings.\nA total of 5 relevant studies were identified. None of the studies was a randomized controlled trial. Four studies were before and after comparisons without control group. A one group post-test-only design was used in one study. Methodological quality was low. The maximum sample size was 112 participants. Results indicated no relevant impact of mental health staff training in de-escalation techniques on the rate of violent incidents in forensic psychiatric wards. However, staff seemed to feel safer following the training. Results have to be interpreted cautiously due to several methodological and content-related limitations.\nEvidence for the effectiveness of staff training in de-escalation techniques on reducing verbal and physical aggression in forensic settings remains very limited. The existing definitions of terms like de-escalation, de-escalation training and de-escalation techniques in the healthcare context appear rather vague. Although some positive changes are reported across a variety of outcome measures it remains unclear to what extent staff training in de-esclation techniques contributes to a reduction in aggressive incidents and restrictive measures in forensic psychiatry. The clinical implications of this review are therefore limited. Yet, an important implication for future research is that a more comprehensive approach might prove worthwhile. Conducting a further review integrating a wide range of complex interventions aimed at the reduction of inpatient violence rather than focusing on de-escalation only, might be a worthwhile approach."}, {"Title": "With great power comes great vulnerability: an ethical analysis of psychedelics' therapeutic mechanisms proposed by the REBUS hypothesis.", "Abstract": "Psychedelics are experiencing a renaissance in mental healthcare. In recent years, more and more early phase trials on psychedelic-assisted therapy have been conducted, with promising results overall. However, ethical analyses of this rediscovered form of treatment remain rare. The present paper contributes to the ethical inquiry of psychedelic-assisted therapy by analysing the ethical implications of its therapeutic mechanisms proposed by the relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) hypothesis. In short, the REBUS hypothesis states that psychedelics make rigid beliefs revisable by increasing the influence of bottom-up input. Put differently, patients become highly suggestible and sensitive to context during a psychedelic session, amplifying therapeutic influence and effects. Due to that, patients are more vulnerable in psychedelic-assisted therapy than in other therapeutic interventions; they lose control during a psychedelic session and become dependent on the therapeutic setting (including the therapist). This enhanced vulnerability is ethically relevant and has been exploited by some therapists in the past. Therefore, patients in current research settings and starting mainstream medical settings need to be well informed about psychedelics' mechanisms and their implications to give valid informed consent to treatment. Furthermore, other security measures are warranted to protect patients from the vulnerability coming with psychedelic-assisted therapy."}, {"Title": "Cohort profile: SUPER-Finland - the Finnish study for hereditary mechanisms of psychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "SUPER-Finland is a large Finnish collection of psychosis cases.

The common population indirectly governs the use of coercive measures in psychiatry by its stigmatization of people with psychiatric illnesses, and its attitude towards treatment in psychiatry and by local opinion leaders and reactions of social networks.\nThe answers of 1,112 persons from a representative population survey were evaluated. Participants were mailed case vignettes and questionnaires, and asked if they considered involuntary admission, coercive medication, and/or seclusion as acceptable measures in dealing with psychiatric patients.\nWhen symptoms of a psychotic disorder were present, 31.5% approved of at least one coercive measure, with 22% approval in the case of a borderline personality disorder, and 20.7% in the case of alcohol dependency. However, the overall rejection of coercive measures by the general public in Basel was high. The differential approval of the examined coercive measures depending on psychiatric symptoms was in line with professional medical and ethical guidelines.\nPublic attitudes have an indirect influence on the local use of coercive measures and should be included in the specialist psychiatric discourse."}, {"Title": "Investigation of the Relationship Between Psychiatry Visit and Suicide After Deliberate Self-harm: Longitudinal National Cohort Study.", "Abstract": "Deliberate self-harm (DSH) along with old age, physical disability, and low socioeconomic status are well-known contributors to suicide-related deaths. In recent years, South Korea has the highest suicide death rate among all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Owing to the difficulty of accessing data of individuals with DSH behavior who died by suicide, the factors associated with suicide death in these high-risk individuals have not been sufficiently explored. There have been conflicting findings with regard to the relationship between previous psychiatric visits and suicidal death.\nWe aimed to address the following 3 questions: Are there considerable differences in demographics, socioeconomic status, and clinical features in individuals who received psychiatric diagnosis (either before DSH or after DSH event) and those who did not? Does receiving a psychiatric diagnosis from the Department of Psychiatry, as opposed to other departments, affect survival? and Which factors related to DSH contribute to deaths by suicide?\nWe used the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database to design a cohort of 5640 individuals (3067/5640, 54.38% women) who visited the hospital for DSH (International Classification of Diseases codes X60-X84) between 2002 and 2020. We analyzed whether there were significant differences among subgroups of individuals with DSH behavior based on psychiatric diagnosis status (whether they had received a psychiatric diagnosis, either before or after the DSH event) and the department from which they had received the psychiatric diagnosis. Another main outcome of the study was death by suicide. Cox regression models yielded hazard ratios (HRs) for suicide risk. Patterns were plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.\nThere were significant differences in all factors including demographic, health-related, socioeconomic, and survival variables among the groups that were classified according to psychiatric diagnosis status (P<.001). The group that did not receive a psychiatric diagnosis had the lowest survival rate (867/1064, 81.48%). Analysis drawn using different departments from where the individual had received a psychiatric diagnosis showed statistically significant differences in all features of interest (P<.001). The group that had received psychiatric diagnoses from the Department of Psychiatry had the highest survival rate (888/951, 93.4%). These findings were confirmed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves (P<.001). The severity of DSH (HR 4.31, 95% CI 3.55-5.26) was the most significant contributor to suicide death, followed by psychiatric diagnosis status (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.47-2.30).\nReceiving psychiatric assessment from a health care professional, especially a psychiatrist, reduces suicide death in individuals who had deliberately harmed themselves before. The key characteristics of individuals with DSH behavior who die by suicide are male sex, middle age, comorbid physical disabilities, and higher socioeconomic status."}, {"Title": "[Qualit\u00e4tsstandards in der Alterspsychiatrie].", "Abstract": "Quality Standards in Old Age Psychiatry <b>Abstract:</b> Quality standards and regulations are becoming increasingly important and are promoted in the context of the permission to treat, to bill and via financial incentives.

The survey was distributed to 18,147 PAs, of which 10,965 participated (60.4% response rate). In addition to descriptive statistics, chi-square tests were conducted on demographics and specialty to examine if perceptions of value of certification (1 global and 10 items measuring specific domains) were associated with a particular PA profile. A series of fully adjusted multivariate logistic regressions were performed, exploring the relationship between PA characteristics and the value of certification items.\nMost PAs strongly agreed/agreed that certification helps with fulfilling licensure requirements (9,578/10,893; 87.9%), helps with updating medical knowledge (9,372/10,897; 86.0%), and provides objective evidence of continued competence (8,875/10,902; 81.4%). The items receiving the lowest percentage of responses for strongly agreeing/agreeing were for certification providing no value (1,925/10,887; 17.7%), helping with professional liability insurance (5,076/10,889; 46.6%), and competing with other providers for clinical positions (5,661/10,905; 51.9%). Age 55 and older and practicing in dermatology and psychiatry were among the strongest predictors of less favorable views. PAs from underrepresented in medicine (URiM) backgrounds had more positive perceptions.\nOverall, the findings indicate that PAs value certification; however, perceptions varied by demographics and specialties. PAs who were younger, from URiM backgrounds, and practicing in primary care specialties had among the most favorable perspectives.

This terminology is rejected by the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association. ExDS has no demonstrable pathology but has been proposed as predisposing to sudden death, thus exonerating police. Ketamine use during arrests complicates manner of death. ExDS deaths trigger lawsuits claiming police misconduct and excessive force. Defendant officers and municipalities have used ExDS to distance themselves from liability, using expert testimony from nonpsychiatrists. This argument is expressed despite lack of autopsy findings, the false idea that mental illness itself can lead to sudden death, and the absence of consistent diagnostic criteria. This article traces the history of ExDS and reviews the arguments for and against its use in psychiatry and law enforcement. The authors conclude that the label is medically unreliable, has eroded confidence in police-citizen interactions, and obscures dynamics of deaths in custody."}, {"Title": "[Questions and challenges in the diagnostics of gender identity disorder.

Gender identity and gender self-expression of transsexual people do not match their biological sex, and they also feel an intense desire and urge to change their officially registered gender at birth and their physical appearance - even by using hormone therapy or surgery. In their case, the diagnosis of gender identity disorder as a disease category enables the use of medical interventions and health services necessary for transition. At the same time, the diagnosis is complicated by the fact that there is currently no specific psychodiagnostic procedure suitable for the clear identification of gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence can also appear as a symptom of many other mental disorders. Therefore, careful differential diagnosis is essential to establish a well-founded diagnosis, with the help of this literature review that summarizes other mental illnesses with similar symptoms as well as the more common comorbid pathologies."}, {"Title": "Management of medically assisted withdrawal from alcohol in acute adult mental health and specialist addictions in-patient services: UK clinical audit findings.", "Abstract": "Medically assisted alcohol withdrawal (MAAW) is increasingly undertaken on acute adult psychiatric wards.\nComparison of the quality of MAAW between acute adult wards and specialist addictions units in mental health services.\nClinical audit conducted by the Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health (POMH).

Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a clinically complex and serious global health issue and is closely related to suicide attempts. Previous research has found associations between ACE and NSSI and suicide attempts in clinical samples. However, this association has to our knowledge not been studied to this extent in a sample of forensic psychiatric patients. The aim of this study was therefore to describe the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and their associations with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and/or suicide attempts in forensic psychiatric patients.\nThe current study is a cross-sectional study of a consecutive cohort of 98 forensic psychiatric patients (86.7% male) in Sweden. We invited 184 patients with a predicted stay of\u2009>\u20098\u00a0weeks who had been cleared for participation by their treating psychiatrist. Of these, 83 declined and 98 eligible patients\u00a0provided informed consent. Information on ACE, NSSI, and suicide attempts derived from files, self-reports (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form; CTQ-SF), and interviews were compared separately among participants with and without NSSI or suicide attempts using t-tests. The dose-response association between ACE and NSSI/suicide attempts was analysed using binary logistic regression.\nIn file reviews, 57.2% of participants reported physical abuse, 20% sexual abuse, and 43% repeated bullying by peers during childhood. NSSI and suicide attempts were associated significantly with CTQ-SF total scores, with medium effect sizes (d\u2009=\u2009.60 to .63, p\u2009<\u2009.01), and strongly with several CTQ-SF subscales.

When anxiety and depressive disorders were included in the model, ACE remained a significant predictor of NSSI.\nWe report extensive ACE, from both files and self-reports. When comparing groups, correlations were found between ACE and NSSI, and ACE and suicide attempts among forensic psychiatric patients. ACE seem to predict NSSI but not suicide attempts in this group, even when controlling for affective and anxiety disorders.

One novel technology which may have particular application to psychiatry is the metaverse, a three-dimensional digital social platform accessed via augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR/VR/MR). The metaverse allows the interaction of users in a virtual world which can be measured and manipulated, posing at once exciting new possibilities and significant potential challenges and risks. While the final form of the nascent metaverse is not yet clear, the immersive simulation and holographic mixed reality-based worlds made possible by the metaverse have the potential to redefine neuropsychiatric care for both patients and their providers. While a number of applications for this technology can be envisioned, this article will focus on leveraging the metaverse in three specific domains: medical education, brain stimulation, and biofeedback. Within medical education, the metaverse could allow for more precise feedback to students performing patient interviews as well as the ability to more easily disseminate highly specialized technical skills, such as those used in advanced neurostimulation paradigms. Examples of potential applications in brain stimulation and biofeedback range from using AR to improve precision targeting of non-invasive neuromodulation modalities to more innovative practices, such as using physiological and behavioral measures derived from interactions in VR environments to directly inform and personalize treatment parameters for patients. Along with promising future applications, we also discuss ethical implications and data security concerns that arise when considering the introduction of the metaverse and related AR/VR technologies to psychiatric research and care."}, {"Title": "A Case of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Presenting as Anxiety.", "Abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially lethal complication of dopamine antagonist use.

We aimed at defining easily accessible and inexpensive blood-derived clinical diagnostic parameters that might serve as objective markers in the prediction of the effects of pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia patients.\nA total of 40 patients with schizophrenia diagnosis according to ICD 10 during psychotic decompensation were included in the study. Blood-based biochemical parameters, BMI and interview-based medical scales of symptom severity were determined - all at admission and after 12 weeks of standard pharmacological treatment.\nThe drops in scale values were correlated with clinical parameters. All scale changes after treatment were dependent on the value of the given scale at admission, with higher initial values leading to larger drops of the values after treatment. Models based on those correlations were significantly improved when immune and metabolism parameters were included. C4 complement and C-reactive protein (CRP) level at admission were predictive of changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) subscales related to significant disruption of thought processes, reality testing and disorganization. The pharmacological treatment-driven changes in scales representing negative symptoms were correlated with markers of the patients' thyroid status and metabolism.\nWe show that objective markers can be obtained by testing immune and metabolic parameters from the patients' blood and may be added at a low cost to the standard care of schizophrenia patients in order to predict the outcome of pharmacological treatment."}, {"Title": "Determinants of severe QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation in a real-world gerontopsychiatric setting.", "Abstract": "QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation carries the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (Torsades de Pointes) and sudden cardiac death.

Compared to that in 2018 and 2019, the proportion of PED visits in 2020 among patients with anxiety and stress disorders increased significantly. Patients with anxiety-and stress-related disorders during PED visits in 2020 were younger than those in 2018 and 2019 (three-year groups: <i>F</i> =\u20099.124, <i>df</i> =\u20092, <i>p</i> <\u20090.001).\nDespite the epidemic-policy barriers against PED visits, PED care seeking has increased, thereby underscoring the need for crisis prevention services for patients with stress and anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Medical errors room: The effect of simulation training on increasing the awareness of nursing students about the medical errors they may encounter in psychiatry clinics.", "Abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the effect of simulation training on increasing the awareness of nursing students about medical errors they may encounter in psychiatry clinics.\nThis study was quasi-experimental and included pre-test and post-test control groups.

While hospitalization is appropriate for acute stabilization, prolonged stays can contribute to reduced quality of life, increased healthcare expenditures, and trauma exposure with associated trauma-related symptoms. To reduce inpatient psychiatric length of stay and to improve patient outcomes, it is imperative that risk factors for prolonged length of stay are elucidated. The purpose of this retrospective chart review was to examine demographic and clinical characteristics and their association with inpatient psychiatric length of stay in a sample of Veterans. Demographic information collected included age and race. Clinical characteristics collected included primary admitting psychiatric diagnosis, number of psychiatric emergencies during hospitalization, utilization of restraint or seclusion, observation status, 30-day readmission status, adherence to psychiatric follow-up appointments post-discharge, and presence of suicidality. A total of 820 Veterans were included in the analysis. Age, primary psychiatric diagnosis, occurrence of a psychiatric emergency, and observation status were significant predictors of length of stay (F\u00a0=\u00a024.39, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There were significant differences in the average length of stay between Veterans with substance use disorders and those with psychotic disorders (B\u00a0=\u00a00.576, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Likewise, Veterans with neurocognitive disorders also had longer lengths of stay than those without neurocognitive disorders, respectively (B\u00a0=\u00a00.014, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

However, despite evidence for sex differences in functional network connectivity and in the prevalence, presentation, and trajectory of psychiatric illnesses, the extent to which disorder-relevant aspects of network connectivity are shared or unique across the sexes remains to be determined.\nIn this work, we used predictive modeling approaches to evaluate whether shared or unique functional connectivity correlates underlie the expression of psychiatric illness-linked behaviors in males and females in data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (N = 5260; 2571 females).\nWe demonstrate that functional connectivity profiles predict individual differences in externalizing behaviors in males and females but predict internalizing behaviors only in females. Furthermore, models trained to predict externalizing behaviors in males generalize to predict internalizing behaviors in females, and models trained to predict internalizing behaviors in females generalize to predict externalizing behaviors in males. Finally, the neurobiological correlates of many behaviors are largely shared within and across sexes: functional connections within and between heteromodal association networks, including default, limbic, control, and dorsal attention networks, are associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that shared neurobiological patterns may manifest as distinct behaviors across the sexes. Based on these results, we recommend that both clinicians and researchers carefully consider how sex may influence the presentation of psychiatric illnesses, especially those along the internalizing-externalizing spectrum."}, {"Title": "[A guide to psychiatric prescribing in pregnancy, postpartum and breastfeeding].", "Abstract": "Perinatal psychopharmacology is an emerging specialty that is gradually developing alongside perinatal psychiatry. The management of psychiatric disorders during the perinatal period is a challenge for perinatal practitioners due to the multiple changes occurring during this crucial period. This little-known specialty still suffers from inappropriate considerations on the impact of psychotropic treatments on the mother and the infant during pregnancy and postpartum, which can promote a deficiency in perinatal psychic care. However, the risks associated with insufficient management of mental health are major, impacting both the mental and physical health of the mother and the infant.

Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R) was applied to all patients to determine the risk of DSED. In order to detect accompanying psychopathologies, Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Child Anxiety and Depression Scale-Child version (RCADS) and Parenting Style Scale were applied. After completing the scales, semi-structured interviews were conducted with all patients by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\nNinety-two adolescents (45 boys, 47 girls) were included.

The authors then examined the discrimination performance of pairs containing an eye movement and a cognitive function measure to search the pairs that would be effective in practical application for the discrimination according to the diagnostic criterion between the groups.\nMultivariate analyses confirmed that eye movements and cognitive functions were effective modalities for discriminating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The discriminant analyses of the pairs demonstrated that seven eye movement measures and seven scores from cognitive function tests showed high discrimination performance when paired with one measure from the other modality. Moreover, seven pairs of digit-symbol coding or symbol-search and eye movement measures had high and robust discrimination performance.\nSeven pairs of an eye movement and a cognitive function measure were effective, robust, and less time-consuming in assisting with clinical diagnosis by categorizing healthy individuals or patients with schizophrenia.

This study aimed to evaluate training and supervision histories of therapists in outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care settings as an essential first step in improving patient outcomes.\nElectronic surveys were completed by 69 therapists, most of whom had a master's degree, within a psychiatry and behavioral sciences department at an academic institution. Participating therapists were recruited from several outpatient and inpatient mental health settings serving children, adolescents, and adults.\nAlthough most therapists reported completing some form of EST-related coursework, a majority did not receive any supervision related to implementation of ESTs (51% for cognitive-behavioral therapy cases, 76% for dialectical behavior therapy cases, and 52% for other EST cases) during graduate and postgraduate training.\nAlthough research from the past decade has supported the need for improvements in training on ESTs, and especially in supervision, problems related to limited exposure to training and supervision among therapists still exist.

Insights from psychedelic research, however, are not limited to treating mental health, but also have much to offer our current understanding of consciousness. The investigation of psychedelic states has offered new perspectives on how different aspects of conscious experience are mediated by brain activity; as such, much more has been learned about consciousness in terms of its phenomenology and potential mechanisms. One theory that describes how psychedelics influence brain activity is the \"entropic brain theory\" (EBT), which attempts to understand conscious states-normal and psychedelic-in terms of \"brain entropy.\" Given its wide explanatory reach, this theory has several implications for current debates in consciousness research, namely the issue of whether consciousness exists in levels vs. dimensions; whether the psychedelic state is itself a \"higher\" level of consciousness; and if so, whether psychedelics could be used to treat disorders of consciousness. To understand how psychedelics could possibly treat a minimally conscious or vegetative patient, one must first understand EBT and how this theory intersects with these ongoing debates. Thus, this article offers a formal summary of EBT, distilling its core principles and their implications for a theoretical model of consciousness. In response to their proposed use in treating disorders of consciousness, we emphasize the importance of \"set\" and \"setting\" in ascertaining the therapeutic value of psychedelics for vegetative and/or minimally conscious patients."}, {"Title": "Erratum: Detained persons incarcerated for the first time and needing acute psychiatric care: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.", "Abstract": "[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.904735.]."}, {"Title": "Prevalence estimates of major depressive disorder in 27 European countries from the European Health Interview Survey: accounting for imperfect diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-8.", "Abstract": "Cut-offs on self-report depression screening tools are designed to identify many more people than those who meet criteria for major depressive disorder.

Diagnostic and treatment options are limited. Agitated catatonia is a treatable comorbidity in autism, which should be considered in cases of aggression. Preliminary data report high clinical response rates of catatonia in autism when treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with poor response to lorazepam. However, access to ECT is often limited, especially in pediatric populations. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We conducted a retrospective chart review to identify cases of hyperactive catatonia with partial response to lorazepam in profoundly autistic children presenting to the pediatric medical hospital. Five cases were identified, all of whom were followed by the child and adolescent psychiatry consult-liaison service during admission and treated without the use of ECT. Data from the medical record were obtained after institutional review board (IRB) approval including the following: (1) treatment course, (2) Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) scores, and (3) Kanner Catatonia Rating Scale (KCRS) severity scores. The Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale was applied retrospectively to each case. <b><i>Results:</i></b> All five patients demonstrated clinically significant improvements. The average CGI-I score was 1.2. The average percentage reduction in the BFCRS and KCRS severity scores was 63% and 59%, respectively. Two of five patients were first stabilized with infusions midazolam and dexmedetomidine due to the symptom severity and then transitioned to long-acting oral benzodiazepines. Overall, four of five patients were stabilized with oral clonazepam and one of five with oral diazepam. Notably, four of five patients experienced an acute worsening of aggression, self-injury, and other catatonic symptoms with escalating dosages of antipsychotic treatment, which occurred before inpatient admission. All patients experienced resolution of physical aggression toward self and/or others, experienced improvement in their communicative abilities, and were able to return home or enter residential level of care upon discharge. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Given the limited availability of ECT and the unclear utility of lorazepam for hyperactive catatonia in autism, the use of long-acting benzodiazepines and/or midazolam infusion may offer a safe and readily available treatment alternative."}, {"Title": "<b>Ellen R. Grass Lecture:</b> The Future of Neurodiagnostics and Emergence of a New Science.", "Abstract": "Electroencepholography (EEG) is the oldest and original brain measurement technology. Since EEG was first used in clinical settings, the role of neurodiagnostic professionals has focused on two principal tasks that require specialized training. These include collecting the EEG recording, performed primarily by EEG Technologists, and interpreting the recording, generally done by physicians with proper specialization. Emerging technology appears to enable non-specialists to contribute to these tasks. Neurotechnologists may feel vulnerable to being displaced by new technology. A similar shift occurred in the last century when human \"computers,\" employed to perform repetitive calculations needed to solve complex mathematics for the Manhattan and Apollo Projects, were displaced by new electronic computing machines. Many human \"computers\" seized on the opportunity created by the new computing technology to become the first computer programmers and create the new field of computer science. That transition offers insights for the future of neurodiagnostics. From its inception, neurodiagnostics has been an information processing discipline.

Without a coherent framework for the common good, it will be extremely difficult to prevent and manage crises such as pandemics, illness, climate change, poverty, discrimination, injustice, and inequality, all of which affects marginalized populations disproportionally. While frameworks for personal well-being abound in psychology, psychiatry, counseling, and social work, conceptualizations of collective well-being are scarce. Our search for foundations of the common good resulted in the identification of three psychosocial goods: mattering, wellness, and fairness. There are several reasons for choosing them, including the fact that they concurrently advance personal, relational, and collective value. In addition, they represent basic human motivations, have considerable explanatory power, exist at multiple ecological levels, and have significant transformative potential. The complementary nature of the three goods is illustrated in an interactional model. Based on empirical evidence, we suggest that conditions of justice lead to experiences of mattering, which, in turn, enhance wellness. Challenges and opportunities afforded by the model at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, occupational, communal, national, and global levels are presented. The proposed psychosocial goods are used to formulate a culture for the common good in which we balance the right with the responsibility to feel valued and add value, to self and others, in order to promote not just wellness but also fairness.

The purpose of this article is to reflect on the event within the broader context of the international WHPCD theme: \"healing hearts and communities.\" We describe lessons learned in anticipation of the fourth annual conference to be held on 3-4 October 2023.\nDescription of the third annual event, conference planning team reflection, and attendee evaluation responses.\nThe Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care Alliance launched WHPCD in 2005 as an annual unified day of action to celebrate and support hospice and palliative care globally. Since 2020, the conference has attracted an increasing number of attendees from around the world. Two primary aims continue to guide the event: community building and wisdom sharing. Fifty-two interprofessional palliative care experts, advocates, patients, and caregivers provided 13 unique interactive sessions. Four hundred and fifty-eight multidisciplinary registrants from at least 17 countries joined the program. Free registration for colleagues in low- and middle-income countries, students and trainees, and individuals experiencing financial hardship remains a cornerstone of inclusion and equitable access to the event.\nThe US WHPCD celebration provides a virtual platform that offers opportunities for scientific dissemination and collective reflection on hospice and palliative care delivery amid significant local and global changes in clinical practice, research, policy and advocacy, and population health. We remain committed to ensuring an internationally relevant, culturally diverse, and multidisciplinary agenda that will continue to draw increased participation worldwide during future annual events."}, {"Title": "Cardiometabolic Monitoring and Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Youths Prescribed Antipsychotic Medications.", "Abstract": "This study examined time trends and patient characteristics related to guideline-recommended cardiometabolic risk factor monitoring among youths treated with antipsychotic medications.\nThis observational study assessed participant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and year of antipsychotic medication initiation, with receipt of glycemic and lipid testing within 2 years of initiation as the primary outcome. Electronic health records and pharmacy data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California for 4,568 youths (ages 10-21 years) who began antipsychotic medication treatment during 2013-2017 were included.\nMean\u00b1SD age of the sample was 17.0\u00b13.0 years, 52% were male, and 50% were Asian American, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander; Black; Latino; or another or unknown race-ethnicity. Overall, 54% of the sample completed glycemic and lipid monitoring within 2 years of medication initiation (41% within 1 year). With each study year, monitoring rates increased by 5% in this cohort, after the analyses were adjusted for participant factors (p=0.001). In the fully adjusted analysis, youths with a psychotic disorder were 23% more likely to receive cardiometabolic monitoring than those without a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder (p<0.001). Monitoring was also more common among younger versus older adolescents and among those with risperidone (vs. quetiapine) medication, obesity, or more frequent use of outpatient health care. Youths with (vs. without) substance use disorder were 19% less likely to complete monitoring (p<0.001).\nCardiometabolic monitoring increased modestly over time, but close to half of the studied youths did not receive glycemic or lipid testing. Additional clinical strategies may be needed to increase monitoring overall and among harder-to-reach youth subgroups."}, {"Title": "Virtual Acute Psychiatric Ward: Evaluation of Outcomes and Cost Savings.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic motivated rapid expansion of virtual care. In Winnipeg, Canada, the authors launched a virtual psychiatric acute care ward (vWARD) to divert patients from hospitalization through daily remote treatment by a psychiatry team using telephone or videoconferencing. This study examined vWARD patient characteristics, predictors of transfer to a hospital, use of acute care postdischarge, and costs of the vWARD compared with in-person hospitalization.\nData for all vWARD admissions from March 23, 2020, to April 30, 2021, were retrieved from program documents and electronic records. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations in the 6 months before admission and the 30 days after discharge were documented. Logistic regression identified factors associated with transfer to a hospital. Thirty-day acute care use after discharge was modeled with Kaplan-Meier curves. A break-even cost analysis was generated with data for usual hospital-based care.\nThe 132 vWARD admissions represented a diverse demographic and clinical population. Overall, 57% involved suicidal behavior, and 29% involved psychosis or mania. Seventeen admissions (13%) were transferred to a hospital. Only presence of psychosis or mania significantly predicted transfer (OR=34.2, 95% CI=3.3-354.6). Eight individuals were hospitalized in the 30 days postdischarge (cumulative survival=0.93). vWARD costs were lower than usual care across several scenarios.\nA virtual ward is a feasible, effective, and potentially cost-saving intervention to manage acute psychiatric crises in the community and avoid hospitalization. It has benefits for both the health system and the individual who prefers to receive care at home."}, {"Title": "Risk of antidepressant initiation among users of cardiovascular agents and metformin.

This study aimed to examine possible associations between the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), beta-blockers (BB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), diuretics, or metformin and risk of antidepressant initiation. The Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT3), Norway, was linked to the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Participants with no prescriptions of cardiovascular agents, metformin, or antidepressants for at least 6\u2009months before HUNT3 (baseline) were eligible and followed for 10\u2009years. The exposure was the use of cardiovascular agents or metformin, defined as mono- or polytherapy from baseline to end of follow-up. The outcome was the initiation of antidepressant use, indicated by the first drug dispensation during the study period and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Among 20\u2009227 adults aged 40-70\u2009years at baseline, we observed different associations between cardiovascular agents or metformin and the risk of antidepressant initiation. ARBs or CCB monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of initiating antidepressant use (HR 0.70; 95%CI 0.56-0.88 and HR 0.81; 95%CI 0.61-1.06, respectively) compared to no use of any drugs included in the study (reference). Reduced risk of antidepressant initiation was among ASA or statin polytherapy users, whereas there was a small increased risk among participants on ASA monotherapy. In contrast, there was no statistical evidence of associations between ACEI, BB, diuretics, or metformin and increased or decreased risk of antidepressant initiation. Our mixed findings indicate the possibility that some cardiovascular agents may be associated with a reduced risk of initiating antidepressant use while others may not. However, bias due to the limitations of the study design is possible."}, {"Title": "Gut mycobiome dysbiosis and its impact on intestinal permeability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Dysbiosis in the gut microbial community might be involved in the pathophysiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The fungal component of the gut microbiome, namely the mycobiota, is a hyperdiverse group of multicellular eukaryotes that can influence host intestinal permeability. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of fungal mycobiome dysbiosis and intestinal permeability on ADHD.\nFaecal samples were collected from 35 children with ADHD and from 35 healthy controls. Total DNA was extracted from the faecal samples and the internal transcribed spacer regions were sequenced using high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS). The fungal taxonomic classification was analysed using bioinformatics tools and the differentially expressed fungal species between the ADHD and healthy control groups were identified. An in vitro permeability assay (Caco-2 cell layer) was used to evaluate the biological effects of fungal dysbiosis on intestinal epithelial barrier function.\nThe \u03b2-diversity (the species diversity between two communities), but not \u03b1-diversity (the species diversity within a community), reflected the differences in fungal community composition between ADHD and control groups. At the phylum level, the ADHD group displayed a significantly higher abundance of Ascomycota and a significantly lower abundance of Basidiomycota than the healthy control group. At the genus level, the abundance of Candida (especially Candida albicans) was significantly increased in ADHD patients compared to the healthy controls. In addition, the in vitro cell assay revealed that C. albicans secretions significantly enhanced the permeability of Caco-2 cells.\nThe current study is the first to explore altered gut mycobiome dysbiosis using the NGS platform in ADHD. The findings from this study indicated that dysbiosis of the fungal mycobiome and intestinal permeability might be associated with susceptibility to ADHD."}, {"Title": "Health outcomes and service use patterns associated with co-located outpatient mental health care and alcohol and other drug specialist treatment: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Despite long-standing recommendations to integrate mental health care and alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment, no prior study has synthesised evidence on the impact of physically co-locating these specialist services on health outcomes.\nWe searched Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL for studies examining health outcomes associated with co-located outpatient mental health care and AOD specialist treatment for adults with a dual diagnosis of substance use disorder and mental illness. Due to diversity in study designs, patient populations and outcome measures among the included studies, we conducted a narrative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed using the MASTER scale.\nTwenty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. We found provisional evidence that integrated care that includes co-located mental health care and AOD specialist treatment is associated with reductions in substance use and related harms and mental health symptom severity, improved quality of life, decreased emergency department presentations/hospital admissions and reduced health system expenditure. Many studies had a relatively high risk of bias and it was not possible to disaggregate the independent effect of physical co-location from other common aspects of integrated care models such as care coordination and the integration of service processes.\nThere are few high-quality, peer-reviewed studies establishing the impact of co-located mental health care and AOD specialist treatment on health outcomes.

Comparisons between groups were conducted by applying t-tests or analysis of variance. The correlation between volunteer motivation and stress was analysed by Pearson correlation. Influencing factors of volunteer motivation were determined by multivariable linear regression models. A value of p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.\nThe mean score of volunteer motivation of patient volunteers was 73.24 (SD 12.00), while that of stress load was 46.08 (SD 21.28). The mean scores of the personal vulnerability (PV) and event load (EL), two dimensions of stress load, were 26.99 (SD 12.46) and 19.09 (SD 9.63), respectively. The majority of the participants (136, 69.04%) were grouped in the low (PV)-low (EL) stress category. Participants' volunteer motivation was negatively correlated with stress load (r=-0.238, p<0.001), as well as PV (r=-0.188, p<0.01) and EL (r=-0.283, p<0.001). Multivariable linear regression analysis identified that the potential influencing factors of volunteer motivation were occupation (B=1.100, 95%\u2009CI 0.037 to 2.164, p=0.043), health condition (B=-3.302, 95%\u2009CI -5.287 to -1.317, p<0.001) and EL (B=-0.434, 95%\u2009CI -0.756 to -0.111, p=0.009). Participants who worked in the public sector, had better health conditions and had lower EL were more likely to have higher volunteer motivation.\nOur study suggested that reducing stress load might be a possible pathway to encourage and maintain volunteerism in the FSH context.

One implication concerns the central role of concepts in forming the knowledge base of psychiatry. Because of this, it is vital to explore the structures and interrelationships of concepts through their historical constitution. Using this approach to compare concepts of empathy as articulated by R Vischer, T Lipps and E Stein shows that, despite overlap, the concepts vary in structure, in meaning and in the aspect of reality they capture. This suggests that the concept of empathy carries an unstable ontology and epistemology. In turn, this carries implications for the concept itself, for psychiatry and for research approaches in this field."}, {"Title": "Right-side frontal-central cortical hyperactivation before the treatment predicts outcomes of antidepressant and electroconvulsive therapy responsivity in major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder places a great burden on healthcare resources worldwide. Antidepressants are the first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, but if patients don't respond adequately, brain stimulation therapy may be needed as second-line treatment. Digital phenotyping in patients with major depressive disorder will aid in the timely prediction of treatment effectiveness. This study explored electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures that diversify depression treatment responsivity, including antidepressant administration or brain stimulation therapy. Resting-state, pre-treatment EEG sequences from depressive patients who received fluoxetine treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a055; 26 remitters and 29 poor responders) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, n\u00a0=\u00a058; 36 remitters and 22 nonremitters) were recorded on 19 channels. Twenty-nine EEG segments were obtained from each patient per recording electrode. Power spectral analysis was conducted for feature extraction and showed the highest predictive accuracy for fluoxetine or ECT outcomes. Both occurred with beta-band oscillations within right-side frontal-central (F1-score\u00a0=\u00a00.9437) or prefrontal areas of the brain (F1-score\u00a0=\u00a00.9416), respectively. Significantly higher beta-band power was observed among patients who lacked adequate treatment response than the remitters, specifically at 19.2\u00a0Hz or 24.5\u00a0Hz for fluoxetine administration or ECT outcome, respectively. Our findings indicated that pre-treatment, right-side cortical hyperactivation is associated with poor outcomes of antidepressant-based or ECT-based treatment in major depression. Whether depression treatment response rates can be improved by reducing the high-frequency EEG power in corresponding areas of the brain to provide a protective effect against depression recurrence warrants further study."}, {"Title": "Impact Analysis of the Brazilian Suicide Prevention Campaign \"Yellow September\": an Ecological Study.", "Abstract": "Yellow September (YS) is a Brazilian suicide prevention campaign implemented in 2015, however, its effectiveness in reducing mortality is still unknown.\nThis is an ecologically interrupted time series study that analyses the evolution of suicide rates in Brazil between 2011 and 2019 and its association with the implementation of YS at a national level. Data was provided by the Mortality Information System. A segmented interrupted series regression analysis was performed, using a generalized linear Poisson model, with correction for seasonal trends.\nThere was an increase in the annual rates of suicide deaths between 2011 and 2019, with 4.99 and 6.41 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The null hypothesis, that the YS did not change the historical trend of growth in suicides in Brazil after its implementation, was affirmed. However, there was an eventual significant increase of 6.2% in the risk of mortality in 2017 and of 8.6% in 2019.\nThe results are consistent with the literature, which proposes that campaigns focused solely on publications through the media generate unsound findings regarding the effective reduction in the number of deaths by suicide. Conclusions: The lack of initiative in multisectoral actions may explain the failure of YS on changing deaths by suicide, therefore the development of new lines of action focused on training professionals and expanding the care network could make it an effective instrument in reducing mortality from suicide.\nThe lack of initiative in multisectoral actions may explain the failure of YS on changing deaths by suicide, therefore the development of new lines of action focused on training professionals and expanding the care network could make it an effective instrument in reducing mortality from suicide."}, {"Title": "Brain Structure Measurements Predict Individualized Treatment Outcome of 12-Week Antipsychotic Monotherapies in First-episode Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Early prediction of treatment response to antipsychotics in schizophrenia remains a challenge in clinical practice.

Assessments for symptoms and social functioning were conducted by eight \"core symptoms\" selected from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-8) and the Personal and Social performance scale (PSP) multiple times during follow-ups. Treatment outcome was evaluated as subject-specific slope coefficients for PANSS-8 and PSP scores using linear mixed model. LASSO regression model were conducted to examine the performance of baseline gray matter volume and cortical thickness in prediction of individualized treatment outcome.\nThe study showed that individual brain morphometries at baseline, especially the orbitofrontal, temporal and parietal cortex, pallidum and amygdala, significantly predicted 12-week treatment outcome of PANSS-8 (r[predicted vs observed] = 0.49, P = .001) and PSP (r[predicted vs observed] = 0.40, P = .003) in first-episode schizophrenia. Moreover, the gray matter volume performed better than cortical thickness in the prediction the symptom changes (P = .034), while cortical thickness outperformed gray matter volume in the prediction of outcome of social functioning (P = .029).\nThese findings provide initial evidence that brain morphometry have potential to be used as prognostic predictors for antipsychotic response in patients, encouraging the future investigation of the translational value of these measures in precision psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Non-convulsive Status Epilepticus as a Complication of Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a\u00a0highly effective treatment option among the biological treatments introduced in psychiatry.

Not only do they suffer from long-term, serious psychiatric disorders; they often also experience considerable problems in their psychosocial functioning. Research has disclosed that the care needs of this target group are complex, and that the life expectancy of these persons is significantly lower than in the general population. Given (1) the lower life expectancy of persons with SPMI, (2) the higher suicide risk related to mental disorders, and (3) the legalization and practice of medical assistance in dying in an increasing number of countries, it is of utmost importance to map the ethical aspects and challenges of end-of-life care needs in persons with SPMI. Therefore, we charted the way end-of-life care is provided for them by means of a scoping review of the scientific literature, with an emphasis on the ethical aspects surrounding it. We explore existing ethical dilemmas; the underlying ethical values, principles and attitudes; and the locus and stakeholders of ethical dialog regarding end-of-life care in persons with SPMI. The results indicate that the four guiding principles of biomedical ethics can well be identified in the literature, and are each addressed in their own specific way: Autonomy in relation to questions regarding the decision-making capacity of persons with SPMI; Justice in relation to access to quality care and the presence of stigma; and Non-maleficence and Beneficence in relation to the ongoing debate regarding the benefits and obstacles in applying palliative care approaches in the context of psychiatry, and the status of the futility-concept therein. Personal virtues and attitudes in care professionals, like compassion, non-abandonment and upholding dignity are key, as care professionals are the main advocates of persons with SPMI, which often lack an extensive social network. Further, we find that the ethical dialog is mainly focused on care professionals and relatives, rather than the persons with SPMI themselves. This is reflected in the existing research that often had the voices of the latter missing. Future research may benefit from the inclusion of persons with SMPI's first-hand accounts. End-of-life care for persons with SPMI may benefit from identifying and integrating (locally developed) good practices like cross-sectoral education, specific care models, and ethics support."}, {"Title": "Simulating developmental diversity: Impact of neural stochasticity on atypical flexibility and hierarchy.", "Abstract": "Investigating the pathological mechanisms of developmental disorders is a challenge because the symptoms are a result of complex and dynamic factors such as neural networks, cognitive behavior, environment, and developmental learning. Recently, computational methods have started to provide a unified framework for understanding developmental disorders, enabling us to describe the interactions among those multiple factors underlying symptoms. However, this approach is still limited because most studies to date have focused on cross-sectional task performance and lacked the perspectives of developmental learning. Here, we proposed a new research method for understanding the mechanisms of the acquisition and its failures in hierarchical Bayesian representations using a state-of-the-art computational model, referred to as in silico neurodevelopment framework for atypical representation learning.\nSimple simulation experiments were conducted using the proposed framework to examine whether manipulating the neural stochasticity and noise levels in external environments during the learning process can lead to the altered acquisition of hierarchical Bayesian representation and reduced flexibility.\nNetworks with normal neural stochasticity acquired hierarchical representations that reflected the underlying probabilistic structures in the environment, including higher-order representation, and exhibited good behavioral and cognitive flexibility. When the neural stochasticity was high during learning, top-down generation using higher-order representation became atypical, although the flexibility did not differ from that of the normal stochasticity settings. However, when the neural stochasticity was low in the learning process, the networks demonstrated reduced flexibility and altered hierarchical representation. Notably, this altered acquisition of higher-order representation and flexibility was ameliorated by increasing the level of noises in external stimuli.\nThese results demonstrated that the proposed method assists in modeling developmental disorders by bridging between multiple factors, such as the inherent characteristics of neural dynamics, acquisitions of hierarchical representation, flexible behavior, and external environment."}, {"Title": "Duration of forensic psychiatric care and subsequent criminal recidivism in individuals sentenced in Sweden between 2009 and 2019.", "Abstract": "The duration of forensic psychiatric care is in Sweden not determined at the time of sentencing; instead, offenders are regularly evaluated, often with regard to risk of criminal recidivism. The length and justifiability of such a sanction have been greatly debated; however, previous estimates of treatment duration based on datasets delimited to discharged patients-have provided an uncertain groundwork for these deliberations. The aim of this study was to use a more suitable approach to calculate average duration of forensic psychiatric care and to examine the relationship between length of treatment and subsequent recidivism after discharge.\nThis retrospective cohort study focused on offenders sentenced to forensic psychiatric care in Sweden between 2009 and 2019 and registered in the Swedish National Forensic Psychiatric Register (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20092064), with a follow-up period until May 2020.

FNDs, for this purpose, should include only the disorders listed as Conversion from the Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders (SSRD) group. The present review analyzes the rationale of this position and challenges the arguments provided for its support. The review also discusses the systematization of these disorders as provided by public health systems. It outlines risks stemming from economic support and public funding uncertainty, given their negligible epidemiological dimensions resulting from the parcellation of SSRD. The review underlines the unresolved issue of Factitious Disorders, which are in the same SSRD category of the international classification but are, nonetheless, overlooked by the theoretical proponents of the FND entity. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is also analyzed. We propose a model that supports the continuum between different SSRD conditions, including Factitious Disorders. The model is based on the emergence of feigned death reflex and deception from frontal lobe dysfunction. Finally, the paper summarizes the wealth of historical psychiatric and psychodynamic approaches and critical reviews. The study also puts in context the categorization and interpretation efforts provided by the most eminent researchers of the past century."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatric patients' experiences of participating in administrative court proceedings concerning the continuation of forensic psychiatric care.", "Abstract": "Previous studies show that both staff and patients describe patient participation as a challenge in forensic psychiatry. One reason may be that the forensic psychiatric process is difficult to understand and is experienced as being slow and complex. The proceedings in an administrative court are a core element in forensic psychiatric care as it constitutes the legal authority that legitimizes the deprivation of liberty. A better understanding about how patients experience these proceedings can contribute with important knowledge about how forensic psychiatric care can be understood from a patient perspective. The aim of the study was to describe patients' lived experiences of participating in oral hearings in an administrative court concerning the continuation of their forensic psychiatric care.\nThis is a phenomenological study performed in a Swedish context with a total of 20 interviews conducted with a Reflective Lifeworld Research (RLR) approach.\nThe results reveal three themes; A significant, correct but meaningless formality; An imbalance of power within the hearings; and Existential and practical disorientation.\nThe findings show how these court proceedings concerning the continuation of forensic psychiatric care are often experienced as challenging. This is partly due to the care structure in forensic psychiatry and that the purpose of the hearings is difficult to comprehend and is perceived as unjust by patients. Another challenge is of a more existential dimension, where the main character in a hearing is most likely in a situation that would be stressful for anyone. However, the focus on danger can make this experience even more intense. An increased transparency on this legal process along with more discussion and education for both patients and staff is called for based on the results."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of serum interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels in major depressive disorder: A case-control study.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by the occurrence of one or more depressive episodes lasting a minimum of 2 weeks and is marked by a persistently low mood and a lack of enjoyment in daily activities. The diagnosis of MDD is not possible by a well-established laboratory test or biomarker. A wide range of potential biomarkers for depression have been proposed by many studies, but none of them has adequately described the correlation between the biomarkers and depression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) levels as an early depression risk factor.\nThe present case-control study included 88 participants. Among them, 44 MDD patients enrolled from the psychiatry department of a public hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) from various sites in Dhaka city. A qualified psychiatrist evaluated the cases and HCs based on the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5). The Hamilton depression (Ham-D) rating scale was employed to evaluate the intensity of depression. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boster Bio, USA) was used to determine serum IL-1RA concentrations.\nWe observed no marked alteration in the serum concentration of IL-1RA in MDD patients in comparison to HCs (292.81\u2009\u00b1\u200924.81 and 288\u2009\u00b1\u200924.87\u2009pg/mL; <i>p</i>\u2009>\u20090.05). Among MDD patients, we found no noteworthy association between the severity of depression and serum IL-1RA levels.\nThe findings of the present study imply that IL-1RA may not be identified as a promising biomarker for risk assessment of depression.

We hypothesize that this worrisome phenomenon is underestimated, and we will discuss how pre-existent psychopathology might predispose vulnerable people to this situation. We will discuss the negative impact that detention might have on these patients, proposing solutions that might amend this worrisome phenomenon."}, {"Title": "Electrocardiogram abnormalities and associated factors among psychiatric patients attending follow up at Jimma Medical Center Psychiatry Clinic, Jimma, Ethiopia: an institution-based cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric patients have two to three-fold higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as compared to the general population. Despite the high rate of cardiovascular disease, about 80% of patients with psychiatric disorders have fewer opportunities for cardiovascular disease screening. Early detection of subclinical cardiovascular disease using an electrocardiogram can improve the clinical outcomes of these patients. However, in Ethiopia, no previous study had been conducted on electrocardiogram abnormalities and associated factors among psychiatric patients. Hence, this study aimed to assess the electrocardiogram abnormalities and associated factors among psychiatric patients attending follow-up at Jimma Medical Center, Jimma, Ethiopia.\nAn institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among psychiatric patients attending Jimma Medical Center Psychiatry Clinic from October 14 to December 10, 2021. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data, behavioral factors, disease-related and medication-related data. Anthropometry and blood pressure were measured following the standard protocols. A resting 12 lead ECG was recorded according to the standard recording protocol of the Minnesota code. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25. Results of the descriptive analysis were summarized by frequencies, means, and proportions, and presented by using tables and figures. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed. p value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\nA total of 315 psychiatric patients were included in the present study. The mean age (SD) of the respondents was 36.27\u2009\u00b1\u200910.85\u00a0years. ECG abnormalities were identified among 191 (60.6%) respondents.

MUD is characterized by disadvantageous decision-making, and people with MUD perform below controls on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a laboratory test of decision-making under uncertainty. The BART presents a series of choices with progressively higher stakes-greater risk of loss and greater potential monetary reward. This research aimed to clarify whether impaired behavioral updating contributes to maladaptive performance on the BART.\nTwo groups (28 drug-abstinent participants with MUD and 16 healthy control participants) were compared on BART performance. Using a computational model, we deconstructed behavior into risk-taking and behavioral updating. A subset of participants (22 MUD, 15 healthy control) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride positron emission tomography scans to measure dopamine D2-type receptor availability (BPND) in the striatum (caudate and accumbens nuclei and putamen) and the globus pallidus.\nParticipants with MUD exhibited slower behavioral updating than the healthy controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004, d=1.77). BPND in all four bilateral volumes of interest were higher in the healthy control group (ps\u00a0<\u00a00.005, ds\u00a0<\u00a02.16), and updating rate correlated positively with BPND in the caudate nucleus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), putamen (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and globus pallidus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).\nThe findings indicate that behavioral updating contributes to maladaptive decision-making in MUD and suggest that dysregulation of D2-type receptor signaling in the striatum and globus pallidus contributes to this behavioral deficit."}, {"Title": "The use of electroconvulsive therapy for children and adolescents in general hospitals: A 2019 kids' inpatient database analysis.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) devices are classified as class II (moderate risk) for the treatment of depressive disorders and catatonia in patients aged 13 and older, but it is unknown how often the treatment is utilized by child and adolescent patients. The aim of this study was to examine the demographics of child and adolescent hospitalizations involving ECT, the medical and psychiatric comorbidities of these hospitalizations, and the overall number of treatments administered per hospitalization.\nThe 2019 Kids' Inpatient Database, a national sample of pediatric discharges from 3998 acute care hospitals, was analyzed for hospitalizations involving patients aged 19 and younger receiving ECT based on inpatient procedural codes.\n315 (95% confidence interval 275 to 354) discharges among child and adolescent patients, or 0.03% of youth hospitalizations, involved the administration of ECT in the KID in 2019. Hospitalizations in the Northeast, those involving patients residing in ZIP codes in the top income quartile, and those for commercially insured patients had higher odds of ECT administration. Primary discharge diagnoses among ECT recipients were major depressive disorder (143; 46.4%), schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (71; 23.1%) and bipolar disorder (59; 19.2%). In total 153 (48.6%) of ECT recipients had a coded diagnosis of suicidal ideation. Hospitalizations involved a median of 2 (IQR 1 to 5) ECT treatments before discharge.\nECT is rarely utilized in the inpatient treatment of child and adolescent patients, but is most often administered to patients with mood and psychotic disorders.

OCD lifetime prevalence varies between 1% and 3% in the general population and there are no reliable markers that support the diagnosis. In order to fill this gap, Computational Psychiatry employs multiple types of quantitative analyses to improve the understanding, diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of mental illnesses including OCD. One of these computational tools is speech graphs analysis. A graph represents a network of nodes connected by edges: in non-semantic speech graphs, nodes correspond to words and edges correspond to the directed link between consecutive words. Using non-semantic speech graphs, we compared free speech samples from OCD patients and healthy controls (HC), to test whether speech graphs analysis can grasp structural differences in speech between these groups. To this end, 39 OCD patients and 37 HC were interviewed and recorded during six types of speech reports: yesterday, dream, old memory, positive image, negative image and neutral image. Also, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) and the Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) were used to assess symptom severity. The graph-theoretical structural analysis of dream reports showed that OCD patients have significantly smaller lexical diversity, lower speech connectedness and a higher recurrence of words in comparison with HC. The other five report types failed to show differences between the groups, adding to the notion that dream reports are especially informative of speech structure in different psychiatric states. Further investigation is necessary to completely assess the potential of this tool in OCD."}, {"Title": "ACLP Best Practice Guidance: Evaluation and Treatment of Depression in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.", "Abstract": "We present Academy of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry best practice guidance on depression in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, which resulted from the collaboration of Academy of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry's transplant psychiatry special interest group and Guidelines and Evidence-Based Medicine Subcommittee. Depression (which in the transplant setting may designate depressive symptoms or depressive disorders) is a frequent problem among SOT recipients. Following a structured literature review and consensus process, the Academy of Consultation Liaison Psychiatry transplant psychiatry special interest group proposes recommendations for practice: all organ transplant recipients should be screened routinely for depression. When applicable, positive screening should prompt communication with the mental health treating provider or a clinical evaluation. If the evaluation leads to a diagnosis of depressive disorder, treatment should be recommended and offered. The recommendation for psychotherapy should consider the physical and cognitive ability of the patient to maximize benefit. The first-line antidepressants of choice are escitalopram, sertraline, and mirtazapine. Treating depressive disorders prior to transplantation is recommended to prevent posttransplant depression. Future research should address the mechanism by which transplant patients develop depressive disorders, the efficacy and feasibility of treatment interventions (both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic, in person and via telemedicine), and the resources available to transplant patients for mental health care."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Comorbidities and Outcomes in Palliative and End-of-Life Care: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Although psychiatric comorbidities are common among individuals at end of life, their impact on outcomes is poorly understood.\nWe conducted a systematic literature review of six databases following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and aimed at assessing the relationship between psychiatric comorbidities and outcomes in palliative and end-of-life care. Six databases were included in our search. This review is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022335922).\nOur search generated 7472 unique records. Eighty-eight full texts were reviewed for eligibility and 43 studies were included in the review. Clinically, psychiatric comorbidity was associated with poor quality of life, increased physical symptom burden, and low function. The impact of psychiatric comorbidity on health utilization varied, though many studies suggested that psychiatric comorbidity increased utilization of palliative care services. Quality of evidence was limited by lack of consistent approach to confounding variables as well as heterogeneity of the included studies.\nPsychiatric comorbidity is associated with significant differences in care utilization and clinical outcome among patients at end of life. In particular, patients with psychiatric comorbidity and serious illness are at high risk of poor quality of life and high symptom burden. Our finding that psychiatric comorbidity is associated with increased utilization of palliative care likely reflects the complexity and clinical needs of patients with serious illness and mental health needs. These data suggest that greater integration of mental health and palliative care services may enhance quality-of-life among patients at end of life."}, {"Title": "When Adverse Childhood Experiences Present to a Statewide Child Psychiatry Access Program.", "Abstract": "Many children experience adversity, yet few receive needed psychiatric services. Pediatric primary care providers (PCPs) are uniquely positioned to intervene but often lack training and resources to provide patients with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) the psychiatric support they need. The current study examines characteristics of youth with and without ACEs who were the focus of PCP contacts with a statewide child psychiatry access program (CPAP). Compared to those without ACEs, patients with ACEs were more often receiving medication treatment at time of CPAP contact, prescribed two or more psychotropic medications, and diagnosed with two or more mental health disorders. Study findings indicate that patients with ACEs for whom PCPs sought CPAP support were experiencing more clinically severe and complex mental health concerns. These findings underscore the important role of CPAPs in supporting PCPs with pediatric patients who have ACEs and will inform training provided by CPAPs to PCPs."}, {"Title": "Suicide by Cop and Civil Liability for Police.", "Abstract": "Suicide by cop (SbC) is a variant of victim-precipitated homicide. In SbC, a citizen intent on dying provokes police, often with credible threats of violence. A fatality results in ambiguity about manner of death (homicide versus suicide). Decedents' families may raise claims of civil-rights violations, asserting insufficient restraint by officers. Police officers, when questioned, may justify their actions as reasonable and necessary force. Defendant officers and municipalities are concerned about police safety and adverse economic and public-perception consequences of litigation. This article explores the history and evolution of the SbC phenomenon, examines related civil case law, and reviews the contours of police-citizen interactions in SbC cases. There is potential liability for officers whose actions must be objectively reasonable to prevail in court. Since SbC can be admitted as evidence, there may be an expanded role for forensic psychiatry in distinguishing manner of death. Expert testimony can also aid fact finders in appreciating the decisions of officers faced with ambiguous and threatening situations. The author recommends collaboration between law enforcement and mental health professionals to improve recognition and handling of difficult situations involving persons with mental illness."}, {"Title": "A Longitudinal Investigation of Blood Neurofilament Light Chain Levels in Chronic Cocaine Users.", "Abstract": "The identification of a blood marker of brain pathology that is sensitive to substance-induced neurotoxicity and dynamically responds to longitudinal changes in substance intake would substantially improve clinical monitoring in the field of substance use and addiction. Here, we explored the hypothesis that plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a promising marker of neuroaxonal pathology, are elevated in chronic cocaine users and longitudinally associated with changes in cocaine use. Plasma NfL levels were determined using single molecule array (SIMOA) technology at baseline and at a 4-month follow-up. Substance use was subjectively assessed with an extensive interview and objectively measured via toxicological analysis of urine and 4-month hair samples. In a generalized linear model corrected for sex, age, and body mass index, NfL plasma levels were elevated in cocaine users (n=35) compared to stimulant-na\u00efve healthy controls (n=35). A positive correlation between cocaine hair concentration and NfL levels was also found. Changes in cocaine hair concentration (group analysis of increasers vs. decreasers) over the 4-month interval predicted NfL levels at follow-up, indicating a rise in NfL with increased cocaine use and a reduction with decreased use. No associations between use or change of use of other substances (including the neurotoxic cocaine adulterant levamisole) and NfL levels were found. Our findings demonstrate that NfL is a sensitive marker for assessing cocaine-related neuroaxonal pathology, supporting the utility of blood NfL analysis in addiction research but also suggesting the detailed assessment of substance use in neurological studies and diagnostics."}, {"Title": "Cannabis Use and Symptomatic Relapse in First Episode Schizophrenia: Trigger or Consequence?

The accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques is a hallmark of AD. However, smaller, soluble aggregates of A\u03b2 - including A\u03b2 protofibrils - also play a role in the disease. Because A\u03b2-related disease mechanisms are complex, the diagnosis, treatment and management of AD should be reflective of and guided by up-to-date scientific knowledge and research findings in this area. This article describes the A\u03b2 protein and its role in AD, summarizing the evidence showing that altered A\u03b2 clearance from the brain may lead to the imbalance, toxic buildup and misfolding of the protein - triggering a cascade of cellular, molecular and systematic events that ultimately lead to AD.\nThe physiological balance of brain A\u03b2 levels in the context of AD is complex.

Switzerland, however, still has a high number of inpatient psychiatric hospital beds and a comparatively high length of stay. The existence of differing remuneration systems between inpatient and outpatient settings creates a distortion of incentives regarding the choice of treatment setting and an inefficient allocation of resources. To address this issue, a new tariff structure for day care treatment is suggested, based on the development and evaluation of the DRG-based inpatient remuneration system tariff psychiatry (TARPSY), using inpatient data from 2018, 2019, and 2021. The method involves three steps: estimating the day care treatment setting potential by delimiting cases from the inpatient patient data, adjusting the costs of this subset to approximate a day care treatment setting, and calculating daily cost weights based on the existing cost weights. The resulting reimbursements are about half of the inpatient reimbursements. To implement the tariff structure, this paper suggests that a number of framework conditions and regulations must be defined or modified. Additionally, subsequent cost data surveys from the day care setting can be incorporated into the calculation as part of a learning system.

Another aim was to map previous criminality, types of index crime, and whether there were any changes within this decade.\nCrime-, clinical, and treatment-related variables were collected from the Swedish National Forensic Psychiatric Register for all unique inpatients registered from January 1-December 31 in 2010 (N\u00a0=\u00a0717) and 2018 (N\u00a0=\u00a0757). The mean, frequency, percentage, and standard deviation were calculated per variable and stratified by study year and gender. Between-group comparisons were made using t-tests and Chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine whether variables expected to be associated with recidivism showed any relation to criminal recidivism for each study cohort.\nMost patients were male and approximately one-quarter and one-half of the men, respectively, had a previous sentence for non-violent and violent crimes. The 2018 cohort showed significantly lower rates of sentences to forensic psychiatry with special court supervision although the numbers were low in both cohorts and for both men and women. Previous violent conviction was associated with criminal recidivism during treatment in 2010, while this was joined by index crime under the influence of alcohol/illicit drugs for the 2018 cohort.\nOverall, these results showed more similarities between the 2010 and 2018 cohorts then dissimilarities, while on the other hand some quite substantial differences were described between males versus females. The results of this study indicate that it may be possible to tailor forensic psychiatric treatment to gender as a proxy for other variables related to increased criminal recidivism in offenders sentenced to forensic psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Association between ultra-processed foods and recurrence of depressive symptoms: the Whitehall II cohort study.", "Abstract": "To examine the association between high intakes of ultra-processed foods (UPF) and recurrence of depressive symptoms (DepS) in a Western non-Mediterranean country and its contribution to the overall diet-depression relationship.\nAnalyses were carried out on British participants from the Whitehall II cohort.

Additional analyses showed that associations between adherence to several diet quality measures and recurrent DepS were partially attenuated (17-27%) by UPF intakes.\nIn this British population, high intakes of ultra-processed foods were associated with increased odds of recurrent depressive symptoms and contributed to the overall diet quality-depressive symptoms association."}, {"Title": "Is Another kind of Biologization Possible? On Biology and the psy Sciences.", "Abstract": "The relationship between biology and the psy disciplines (psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy) is a complex one. Many scholars have criticized how these disciplines have been biologized in the 20th century, especially since the emergence of psychopharmacology, neuroscience, and genetic research. However, biology is not just a laboratory-based science of chemical compounds, scanners, and DNA sequencing, but also a field science based on observations of organisms in their milieus. In this paper, we draw a contrast between laboratory-based biology with a focus on brains and genes, and an ecology-based biology with a focus on lives and niches. Our argument is philosophical in nature - building partly on Wittgenstein as a \"philosopher of life\" - to the effect that the psy sciences need not just less biologization of the former kind, but also more biologization of the latter kind to avoid a prevalent mentalism. Not least when it comes to an understanding of psychological distress, which can favorably be viewed situationally and coupled to human lives in ecological niches."}, {"Title": "Prescribing and deprescribing trends in schizophrenia: An overview of inpatients in Belgium and in the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec.", "Abstract": "Although switching to antipsychotic monotherapy improves patient outcomes in schizophrenia, antipsychotic deprescribing is rarely performed, and its use varies between countries, as do psychotropic prescribing patterns.

In the current review, we outline risk factors for depressive symptoms among pregnant adolescents and provide guidance on best practices in assessment and treatment of depressive symptoms in this pediatric sub-population.\nDepressive symptoms are persistent across pregnancy. In adolescents, they are linked to greater risk of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and nonsuicidal self-injury. Risk factors for prenatal depressive symptoms among adolescents include lower levels of income, history of depression, exposure to childhood maltreatment and/or recent abuse, and/or lifetime exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination. These risk factors likely interact with each other.\nClinicians should assess carefully for depressive symptoms in all pregnant adolescents using a standardized, validated measure supplemented by thoughtful clinical interviewing. Clinicians can educate adolescents on the distinction between symptoms of pregnancy versus symptoms of depression. We encourage clinicians to increase their comfort in providing psychopharmacological treatment, consulting with colleagues in psychiatry, and referring adolescents for psychopharmacological treatment and therapy as needed."}, {"Title": "A feasibility study of the transdiagnostic self-injury interview.", "Abstract": "The Transdiagnostic Self-injury Interview (TSI) is a new measure that assesses the onset, frequency, methods, and severity of non-suicidal self-injury.

The aim of this study is to shed light on the extent and time of involuntary medication in Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland, when it is most often used and whether there is a difference between patients who receive involuntary medication and those who do not receive such treatment.\nThis study is a quantitative descriptive retrospective study using data obtained from medical records. The sample consisted of all patients admitted to the psychiatric inpatient wards at Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland in the years 2014-2018 (N=4053). The sample was divided into two groups, group 1 with patients who received involuntary medication n=400 (9.9%) and group 2 with patients who did not receive such treatment n=3653 (90.1%).\nThe total number of involuntary medications was 2438 and about 1% of the total sample received about half of all involuntary medication. Involuntary medications were most frequent during the daytime during weekdays and late at night, but no notable difference was seen between months of the year. When comparing the groups, it appears that proportionally more men and patients with foreign citizenship are in group 1 than in group 2, but no notable difference is seen in age between groups. Patients in group 1 had more visits to the emergency services at Landspitali, more admissions, and patient days per patient at psychiatric wards in Landspitali than those in group 2. The most common medical diagnosis in group 1 were within the schizophrenia spectrum (F20-F29) and mood disorders (F30-39) but in group 2 the most common medical diagnosis were mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use (F10-19) and mood disorders (F30-F39).\nFindings indicate certain risk factors for involuntary medication regarding demographic, medical diagnosis, use of services as well as external factors such as timing of involuntary medication.

Headlines on major media platforms frequently tout the psychedelic future of psychiatry, and patients increasingly ask about the prospect of using psychedelics during their sessions. Despite this enthusiasm, psychedelics remain in an investigational stage, and more research and regulatory work are required before psychedelics can be deemed appropriate for general clinical use. In this climate, psychiatrists are increasingly curious about the prospects of psychedelic treatments. This review's goal was to help psychiatrists better understand the complexities of the burgeoning field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The discussion encompasses issues surrounding psychedelics in their current investigational stage and issues for psychiatrists to consider should psychedelics become available for broad clinical use. This review discusses research equipoise in the context of the current enthusiasm for psychedelics, informed consent, patient vulnerability, equity and access, differences between clinical and nonclinical psychedelic uses, and psychedelic self-enhancement. As psychedelics move closer toward regulatory approval beyond research settings, it is vital that these promising treatments be used ethically. The unique features of psychedelic therapies, including the altered states of consciousness they produce and the vulnerability that such states entail for patients, require careful consideration to minimize potential ethical pitfalls. This review seeks to ensure that psychiatrists are equipped to use psychedelic psychotherapy both ethically and effectively."}, {"Title": "Cross-cultural, transnational or interdisciplinary?

Functional connectomes derived from three guided imagery conditions of personalized appetitive, stress, and neutral-relaxing experiences were used to predict craving rated before and after each imagery condition. The generalizability of the \"craving network\" was tested in an independent sample using functional connectomes derived from a cue-induced craving task collected before and after fasting to predict craving rated during fasting.\nCPM successfully predicted craving, thereby identifying a transdiagnostic \"craving network.\" Anatomical localization of model contribution suggested that the strongest predictors of craving were regions of the salience, subcortical, and default mode networks. As external validation, in an independent sample, the \"craving network\" predicted food craving during fasting using data from a cue-induced craving task.\nThese data provide a transdiagnostic perspective to a key phenomenological feature of addictive disorders-craving-and identify a common \"craving network\" across individuals with and without substance use-related disorders, thereby suggesting a neural signature for craving or urge for motivated behaviors."}, {"Title": "Dietary Fats and Cognitive Status in Italian Middle-Old Adults.", "Abstract": "The increase in life expectancy led to a significant rise in the prevalence of age-related neurological diseases, such as cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical depression is a common, potentially debilitating condition that may be amenable to a precision psychiatry-based approach utilizing probiotics. Although our understanding has not yet reached a sufficient level, this could be a therapeutic approach that can be tailored for specific individuals with their own unique set of characteristics and health issues. Scientifically, the use of probiotics as a treatment for depression has a valid basis rooted in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) mechanisms, which play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. In theory, probiotics appear to be ideal as adjunct therapeutics for major depressive disorder (MDD) and as stand-alone therapeutics for mild MDD and may potentially revolutionize the treatment of depressive disorders.

We included only studies describing recruitment strategies for pediatric clinical trials in mental health settings and extracted data on recruitment and completion rates. <b>Results</b>: The search yielded 13 studies that enrolled a total of 14,452 participants. Overall, studies mainly used social networks or clinical settings to recruit participants. Half of the studies used only one recruitment method. Using multiple recruitment methods (56.6%, 95%CI: 24.5-86.0) resulted in higher recruitment. The use of monetary incentives (47.0%, 95%CI: 24.6-70.0) enhanced the recruitment rate but not significantly (32.6%, 95%CI: 15.7-52.1).

The aim of the DeprAir study is to verify the hypothesis that air pollution exposure may exacerbate neuroinflammation with consequent alterations in DNA methylation of genes involved in circadian rhythms and hormonal dysregulation, resulting in the worsening of depressive symptoms. The study population consists of 420 depressed patients accessing the psychiatry unit of the Policlinico Hospital (Milan, Italy), from September 2020 to December 2022. Data collection is still ongoing for about 100 subjects. For each participant demographic and lifestyle information, depression history and characteristics, as well as blood samples, were collected. MDD severity was assessed through five rating scales commonly used in clinical practice to assess the severity of affective symptoms. Exposure to particulate and gaseous air pollutants is assigned to each subject using both air pollution monitoring station measurements and estimates derived from a chemical transport model. DeprAir is the first study investigating in a comprehensive picture whether air pollution exposure could be an important modifiable environmental factor associated with MDD severity and which biological mechanisms mediate the negative effect of air pollution on mental health.

Clozapine is the gold standard for the treatment of TRS, although it is also known to cause significant side effects in some patients. In view of the burgeoning interest in the role of genetic factors in precision psychiatry, we conducted a scoping review to narratively summarize the current genetic factors associated with TRS, clozapine resistance and side effects to clozapine treatment. We searched PubMed from inception to December 2022 and included 104 relevant studies in this review. Extant evidence comprised associations between TRS and clozapine resistance with genetic factors related to mainly dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems, specifically, TRS and rs4680, rs4818 within COMT, and rs1799978 within DRD2; clozapine resistance and DRD3 polymorphisms, CYP1A2 polymorphisms; weight gain with LEP and SNAP-25 genes; and agranulocytosis risk with HLA-related polymorphisms. Future studies, including replication in larger multi-site samples, are still needed to elucidate putative risk genes and the interactions between different genes and their correlations with relevant clinical factors such as psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, cognition and progressive changes with treatment over time in TRS and clozapine resistance."}, {"Title": "The Autism Spectrum: Behavioral, Psychiatric and Genetic Associations.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consists of a group of heterogeneous genetic neurobehavioral disorders associated with developmental impairments in social communication skills and stereotypic, rigid or repetitive behaviors. We review common behavioral, psychiatric and genetic associations related to ASD. Autism affects about 2% of children with 4:1 male-to-female ratio and a heritability estimate between 70 and 90%. The etiology of ASD involves a complex interplay between inheritance and environmental factors influenced by epigenetics. Over 800 genes and dozens of genetic syndromes are associated with ASD. Novel gene-protein interactions with pathway and molecular function analyses have identified at least three functional pathways including chromatin modeling, Wnt, Notch and other signaling pathways and metabolic disturbances involving neuronal growth and dendritic spine profiles. An estimated 50% of individuals with ASD are diagnosed with chromosome deletions or duplications (e.g., 15q11.2, BP1-BP2, 16p11.2 and 15q13.3), identified syndromes (e.g., Williams, Phelan-McDermid and Shprintzen velocardiofacial) or single gene disorders. Behavioral and psychiatric conditions in autism impacted by genetics influence clinical evaluations, counseling, diagnoses, therapeutic interventions and treatment approaches. Pharmacogenetics testing is now possible to help guide the selection of psychotropic medications to treat challenging behaviors or co-occurring psychiatric conditions commonly seen in ASD. In this review of the autism spectrum disorder, behavioral, psychiatric and genetic observations and associations relevant to the evaluation and treatment of individuals with ASD are discussed."}, {"Title": "Elucidation of the Landscape of Alternatively Spliced Genes and Features in the Dorsal Striatum of Aggressive/Aggression-Deprived Mice in the Model of Chronic Social Conflicts.", "Abstract": "Both aggressive and aggression-deprived (AD) individuals represent pathological cases extensively studied in psychiatry and substance abuse disciplines. We employed the animal model of chronic social conflicts curated in our laboratory for over 30 years. In the study, we pursued the task of evaluation of the key events in the dorsal striatum transcriptomes of aggression-experienced mice and AD species, as compared with the controls, using RNA-seq profiling. We evaluated the alternative splicing-mediated transcriptome dynamics based on the RNA-seq data. We confined our attention to the exon skipping (ES) events as the major AS type for animals. We report the concurrent posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulation of the ES events observed in the phosphorylation cycles (in phosphoproteins and their targets) in the neuron-specific genes of the striatum. Strikingly, we found that major neurospecific splicing factors (<i>Nova1</i>, <i>Ptbp1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>Mbnl1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>Sam68</i>) related to the alternative splicing regulation of cAMP genes (<i>Darpp-32</i>, <i>Grin1</i>, <i>Ptpn5</i>, <i>Ppp3ca</i>, <i>Pde10a</i>, <i>Prkaca</i>, <i>Psd95</i>, and <i>Adora1</i>) are upregulated specifically in aggressive individuals as compared with the controls and specifically AD animals, assuming intense switching between isoforms in the cAMP-mediated (de)phosphorylation signaling cascade. We found that the coding alternative splicing events were mostly attributed to synaptic plasticity and neural development-related proteins, while the nonsense-mediated decay-associated splicing events are mostly attributed to the mRNA processing of genes, including the spliceosome and splicing factors. In addition, considering the gene families, the transporter (Slc) gene family manifested most of the ES events. We found out that the major molecular systems employing AS for their plasticity are the 'spliceosome', 'chromatin rearrangement complex', 'synapse', and 'neural development/axonogenesis' GO categories. Finally, we state that approximately 35% of the exon skipping variants in gene coding regions manifest the noncoding variants subject to nonsense-mediated decay, employed as a homeostasis-mediated expression regulation layer and often associated with the corresponding gene expression alteration."}, {"Title": "Clinical Relevance of Gut Microbiota Alterations under the Influence of Selected Drugs-Updated Review.", "Abstract": "As pharmacology and science progress, we discover new generations of medicines. This relationship is a response to the increasing demand for medicaments and is powered by progress in medicine and research about the respective entities. However, we have questions about the efficiency of pharmacotherapy in individual groups of patients. The effectiveness of therapy is controlled by many variables, such as genetic predisposition, age, sex and diet. Therefore, we must also pay attention to the microbiota, which fulfill a lot of functions in the human body. Drugs used in psychiatry, gastroenterology, diabetology and other fields of medicine have been demonstrated to possess much potential to change the composition and probably the function of the intestinal microbiota, which consequently creates long-term risks of developing chronic diseases.

However, recordings performed outside laboratory settings are required to test the ecological validity of these findings. Wearable devices, such as sensor-imbedded garments, biopatches, and smartwatches, are promising tools for this purpose. We systematically reviewed the evidence for wearables-based cardiorespiratory assessments in PD by searching for publications on the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases, from inception to 30 July 2022. After the screening of two-hundred and twenty records, eight studies were included. The limited number of available studies and critical aspects related to the uncertain reliability of wearables-based assessments, especially concerning respiration, prevented us from drawing conclusions about the cardiorespiratory function of patients with PD in daily life. We also present preliminary data on a pilot study conducted on volunteers at the Villa San Benedetto Menni Hospital for evaluating the accuracy of heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) measurements by the wearable Zephyr BioPatch compared with the Quark-b2 stationary testing system. Our exploratory results suggested possible BR and HR misestimation by the wearable Zephyr BioPatch compared with the Quark-b2 system.

Despite this, it is limited in its potential for repeated administration, its sensitivity and its demands on professionals and their clients. We evaluated a digital Stroop deployed using a smart device. Spoken responses were timed using automated speech recognition. Participants included adult nonpatients (N = 113; k = 5 sessions over 5 days) and patients with psychiatric diagnoses (N = 85; k = 3-4 sessions per week over 4 weeks). Traditional interference (difference in response time between color incongruent words vs. color neutral words; M = 0.121 s) and facilitation (neutral vs. color congruent words; M = 0.085 s) effects were robust and temporally stable over testing sessions (ICCs 0.50-0.86). The performance showed little relation to clinical symptoms for a two-week window for either nonpatients or patients but was related to self-reported concentration at the time of testing for both groups. Performance was also related to treatment outcomes in patients. The duration of response word utterances was longer in patients than in nonpatients. Measures of intra-individual variability showed promise for understanding clinical state and treatment outcome but were less temporally stable than measures based solely on average response time latency. This framework of remote assessment using speech processing technology enables the fine-grained longitudinal charting of cognition and verbal behavior. However, at present, there is a problematic lower limit to the absolute size of the effects that can be examined when using voice in such a brief 'out-of-the-laboratory condition' given the temporal resolution of the speech-to-text detection system (in this case, 10 ms). This resolution will limit the parsing of meaningful effect sizes."}, {"Title": "Application of Antipsychotic Drugs in Mood Disorders.", "Abstract": "Since their first application in psychiatry seventy years ago, antipsychotic drugs, besides schizophrenia, have been widely used in the treatment of mood disorders. Such an application of antipsychotics is the subject of this narrative review. Antipsychotic drugs can be arbitrarily classified into three generations. First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), such as phenothiazines and haloperidol, were mainly applied for the treatment of acute mania, as well as psychotic depression when combined with antidepressants. The second-generation, so-called atypical antipsychotics (SGAs), such as clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, have antimanic activity and are also effective for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Additionally, quetiapine exerts therapeutic action in bipolar depression. Third-generation antipsychotics (TGAs) started with aripiprazole, a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist, followed by brexpiprazole, lurasidone, cariprazine, and lumateperone. Out of these drugs, aripiprazole and cariprazine have antimanic activity, lurasidone, cariprazine, and lumateperone exert a significant antidepressant effect on bipolar depression, while there is evidence for the efficacy of aripiprazole and lurasidone in the prevention of recurrence in bipolar disorder. Therefore, successive generations of antipsychotic drugs present a diverse spectrum for application in mood disorders. Such a pharmacological overlap in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar illness stands in contrast to the dichotomous Kraepelinian division of schizophrenia and mood disorders."}, {"Title": "Mental Health Disorders in Ultra Endurance Athletes per ICD-11 Classifications: A Review of an Overlooked Community in Sports Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Although research suggests that exercise benefits mental health, psychiatric disorders have been acknowledged in the ultra-endurance-athlete population.

We contend that ultra-endurance athletes may represent a different, though similar, demographic than elite and/or professional athletes, as they often engage in high-volume training with similarly high motivation. This can have regulatory implications, which we also highlight.\nMental illness in ultra-endurance athletes is an underrepresented topic in sports medicine, though psychiatric disorders may be especially prevalent in this population.

The KWG's brain science institutes, along with their intramural psychiatry and neurology research programs, were of considerable interest to the Western Allies and former administrators of the German science and education systems in their plans to rebuild the extra-university research society-first in the British Occupation Zone and later in the American and French Occupation Zones. This formation process occurred under the physicist Max Planck (1858-1947) as acting president, and the MPG was named in his honor when it was formally established in 1948. In comparison to other international developments in the brain sciences, it was neuropathology as well as neurohistology that initially dominated postwar brain research activities in West Germany. In regard to its KWG past, at least four historical factors can be identified that explain the dislocated structural and social features of the MPG during the postwar period: first, the disruption of previously existing interactions between German brain scientists and international colleagues; second, the German educational structures that countered interdisciplinary developments through their structural focus on medical research disciplines during the postwar period; third, the moral misconduct of earlier KWG scientists and scholars during the National Socialism period; and, fourth, the deep rupture that appeared through the forced migration of many Jewish and oppositional neuroscientists who sought to find exile after 1933 in countries where they had already held active collaborations since the 1910s and 1920s. This article examines several trends in the MPG's disrupted relational processes as it sought to grapple with its broken past, beginning with the period of reinauguration of relevant Max Planck Institutes in brain science and culminating with the establishment of the Presidential Research Program on the History of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society in National Socialism in 1997."}, {"Title": "Preventive and Therapeutic Mental Health Care after the Earthquake- Expert Opinion from the Psychiatric Association of Turkey.", "Abstract": "Two major earthquakes hit Turkey at the Kahramanmara\u015f region on February 6th 2023.

However, to facilitate practical implementation of rights, it is often necessary to decide which of these rights should be given priority, especially when they conflict with each other.\nThe aim of the Priorities of Human Rights and Mental Health (PHRAME) project is to develop a replicable approach to establish a proposed set of high-priority human rights of people with mental health conditions, to facilitate practical decision-making and implementation of such rights.\nA two-stage Delphi-style study with stakeholders was conducted to generate a list of key rights of people with mental health conditions, and rank priorities among these rights in terms of feasibility, urgency and overall importance.\nThe stakeholders in this study consistently ranked three rights as top priorities: (a) the right to freedom from torture, cruel inhuman treatment and punishment; (b) the right to health and access to services/treatment; and (c) the right to protection and safety in emergency situations.\nInsights from PHRAME can support decision-making about the priority to be given to human rights, to guide practical action. This approach can also be used to assess how human rights are prioritised in different settings and by different stakeholders. This study identifies the clear need for a central voice for people with lived experience in research and implementation of decisions about the priority of human rights, ensuring that action respects the opinion of people whose rights are directly affected."}, {"Title": "Implementation of a peer support worker in a forensic psychiatric hospital in Germany-Views of patients.", "Abstract": "Peer Support has become common in psychiatric practice in the past decade.

Data collection was conducted in two different points in time, three months and twelve months after the introduction of the of some peer support intervention. In the first time point two focus groups involving 10 patients and three semi-structured individual interviews were conducted. The second time point included one focus group with five patients and five semi-structured individual interviews.

In general, patients agreed on the high value of peer support work.\nFindings revealed a broad acceptance of the peer support intervention by most patients, but also some reservations. They saw the peer support worker as someone who is part of the professional team, and has a unique knowledge coming from personal experience. This knowledge often facilitated conversations about several topics related to patients experiences with substance use and their recovery journey."}, {"Title": "Predicting benzodiazepine prescriptions: A proof-of-concept machine learning approach.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications, but they may place users at risk of serious adverse effects. Developing a method to predict benzodiazepine prescriptions could assist in prevention efforts.\nThe present study applies machine learning methods to de-identified electronic health record data, in order to develop algorithms for predicting benzodiazepine prescription receipt (yes/no) and number of benzodiazepine prescriptions (0, 1, 2+) at a given encounter. Support-vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) approaches were applied to outpatient psychiatry, family medicine, and geriatric medicine data from a large academic medical center. The training sample comprised encounters taking place between January 2020 and December 2021 (<i>N</i> = 204,723 encounters); the testing sample comprised data from encounters taking place between January and March 2022 (<i>N</i> = 28,631 encounters). The following empirically-supported features were evaluated: anxiety and sleep disorders (primary anxiety diagnosis, any anxiety diagnosis, primary sleep diagnosis, any sleep diagnosis), demographic characteristics (age, gender, race), medications (opioid prescription, number of opioid prescriptions, antidepressant prescription, antipsychotic prescription), other clinical variables (mood disorder, psychotic disorder, neurocognitive disorder, prescriber specialty), and insurance status (any insurance, type of insurance). We took a step-wise approach to developing a prediction model, wherein Model 1 included only anxiety and sleep diagnoses, and each subsequent model included an additional group of features.\nFor predicting benzodiazepine prescription receipt (yes/no), all models showed good to excellent overall accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for both SVM (Accuracy = 0.868-0.883; AUC = 0.864-0.924) and RF (Accuracy = 0.860-0.887; AUC = 0.877-0.953). Overall accuracy was also high for predicting number of benzodiazepine prescriptions (0, 1, 2+) for both SVM (Accuracy = 0.861-0.877) and RF (Accuracy = 0.846-0.878).\nResults suggest SVM and RF algorithms can accurately classify individuals who receive a benzodiazepine prescription and can separate patients by the number of benzodiazepine prescriptions received at a given encounter.

However, the overall efficacy of current treatment interventions aimed at reducing aggressive behavior is limited. New technological-based interventions may enhance treatment outcomes, for instance by facilitating out-of-session practice and providing just-in-time support. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of the Sense-IT biocueing app as an addition to aggression regulation therapy (ART) on interoceptive awareness, emotion regulation, and aggressive behavior among forensic outpatients.\nA combination of methods was used. Quantitatively, a pretest-posttest design was applied to explore group changes in aggression, emotion regulation, and anger bodily sensations associated with the combination of biocueing intervention and ART. Measures were assessed at pretest, after 4 weeks posttest, and after one-month follow-up. During the 4 weeks, a single-case experimental ABA design was applied for each participant. Biocueing was added in the intervention phase. During all phases anger, aggressive thoughts, aggressive behavior, behavioral control, and physical tension were assessed twice a day, and heart rate was measured continuously. Qualitative information regarding interoceptive awareness, coping, and aggression was collected at posttest. 25 forensic outpatients participated.\nA significant decrease in self-reported aggression was found between pre- and posttest. Furthermore, three-quarters of participants reported increased interoceptive awareness associated with the biocueing intervention. However, the repeated ambulatory measurements of the single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) did not indicate a clear effect favoring the addition of biocueing. On group level, no significant effects were found. On the individual level, effects favoring the intervention were only found for two participants. Overall, effect sizes were small.\nBiocueing seems a helpful addition to increase interoceptive awareness among forensic outpatients. However, not all patients benefit from the current intervention and, more specifically, from its behavioral support component aimed at enhancing emotion regulation. Future studies should therefore focus on increasing usability, tailoring the intervention to individual needs, and on integration into therapy. Individual characteristics associated with effective support by a biocueing intervention should be further investigated, as the use of personalized and technological-based treatment interventions is expected to increase in the coming years."}, {"Title": "Olfactory neuronal cells as a promising tool to realize the \"druggable genome\" approach for drug discovery in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "\"Druggable genome\" is a novel concept that emphasizes the importance of using the information of genome-wide genetic studies for drug discovery and development. Successful precedents of \"druggable genome\" have recently emerged for some disorders by combining genomic and gene expression profiles with medical and pharmacological knowledge. One of the key premises for the success is the good access to disease-relevant tissues from \"living\" patients in which we may observe molecular expression changes in association with symptomatic alteration. Thus, given brain biopsies are ethically and practically difficult, the application of the \"druggable genome\" approach is challenging for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, to fill this gap, we propose the use of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs) biopsied and established via nasal biopsy from living subjects. By using candidate genes that were proposed in a study in which genetic information, postmortem brain expression profiles, and pharmacological knowledge were considered for cognition in the general population, we addressed the utility of ONCs in the \"druggable genome\" approach by using the clinical and cell resources of an established psychosis cohort in our group. Through this pilot effort, we underscored the <i>chloride voltage-gated channel 2 (CLCN2)</i> gene as a possible druggable candidate for early-stage psychosis. The <i>CLCN2</i> gene expression was associated with verbal memory, but not with other dimensions in cognition, nor psychiatric manifestations (positive and negative symptoms). The association between this candidate molecule and verbal memory was also confirmed at the protein level. By using ONCs from living subjects, we now provide more specific information regarding molecular expression and clinical phenotypes. The use of ONCs also provides the opportunity of validating the relationship not only at the RNA level but also protein level, leading to the potential of functional assays in the future. Taken together, we now provide evidence that supports the utility of ONCs as a tool for the \"druggable genome\" approach in translational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Association of ethnic concordance between patients and psychiatrists with the management of suicide attempts in the emergency department.", "Abstract": "Suicide attempt is a psychiatric emergency that can be treated with different approaches.

Two logistic regression models were built to examine whether patient and psychiatrist's demographic variables can predict 1) the clinical decision to provide a continued psychiatric intervention and 2) the setting for the psychiatric intervention (inpatient or outpatient).\nIn total, 1,325 ED visits were evaluated, corresponding to 1,227 unique patients (mean age; 40.47\u00b118.14 years, 550 men [41.51%]; 997 Jewish [75.25%] and 328 Arabs [24.75%]]), and 30 psychiatrists (9 men [30%]; 21 Jewish [70%] and 9 Arabs [30%]). Demographic variables had a limited predictive power for the decision to intervene (R\u00b2=0.0245). Yet, a significant effect of age was observed as intervention rates increased with age. In contrast, the type of intervention was strongly associated with demography (R\u00b2=0.289), with a significant interaction between patient and psychiatrist's ethnic identities. Further analysis revealed that Arab psychiatrists preferentially referred Arab patients to outpatient over inpatient treatment.\nThe results indicate that while demographic variables, and specifically patient and psychiatrist's ethnicity, do not affect clinical judgement for psychiatric intervention following a suicide attempt, they do play a major role in selecting treatment setting. Further studies are required to better understand the causes underlying this observation and its association with long-term outcomes.

Thus, the current randomised pilot trial evaluates the feasibility of CE<sub>EV</sub> for adolescents and its efficacy in reducing eating in the absence of hunger (EAH) of binge food items.\nThe trial will include <i>N</i>=76 female adolescents aged between 13 and 20 years with a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder (BED) or their subthreshold forms based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Participants will be randomly assigned to two sessions of CE<sub>EV</sub> or behavioural analysis (BA), a classical cognitive-behavioural therapy-based intervention. The primary endpoint is the change in EAH measured according to ad libitum consumption of personally preferred binge food in a bogus taste test at post-test based on the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary endpoints are changes in EAH of standardised binge food at post-test, in EAH at 3-month follow-up (FU) and in food craving after induction of food cue reactivity at post-test and FU. To identify further valid outcome parameters, we will assess effects of CE<sub>EV</sub> compared with BA on global ED psychopathology, BE frequency within the last 28 days, body weight, response inhibition and emotion regulation abilities. Treatment groups will be compared using analysis of covariance with intervention as fixed factor and body mass index at baseline as covariate.\nThis clinical trial has been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Medical Association of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Medical Faculty of the Ruhr-University Bochum. The collected data will be disseminated locally and internationally through publications in relevant peer-reviewed journals and will be presented at scientific and clinical conferences. Participants data will only be published in an anonymised form.\nDRKS00024009."}, {"Title": "Acute Psychosis: Differential Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Management.", "Abstract": "The Psychiatric Consultation Service at Massachusetts General Hospital sees medical and surgical inpatients with comorbid psychiatric symptoms and conditions.

This collaboration has produced the DSM-IV Outline for Cultural Formulation (OCF) and the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI). Nonetheless, some anthropologists have critiqued the concept of culture in DSM-5 as too focused on patient meanings and not on clinician practices. This article traces the evolution of the culture concept from DSM-IV through DSM-5-TR by analyzing publications from the American Psychiatric Association on the OCF and CFI alongside scholarship in psychiatry and anthropology. DSM-IV relied on a culture concept of coherent ethnic communities sharing coherent cultures, primarily for minoritized ethnoracial individuals in the United States. Changing demographics and newer immigration patterns around the world deminoritized the culture concept for DSM-5. After George Floyd's death and demands for social justice, the culture concept in DSM-5-TR emphasized social structures. The article proposes an intersubjective model of culture through which patients and clinicians work through similarities and differences. It recommends a revised formulation that attends to clinician practices such as communicating, diagnosing, recommending treatments, and documenting, beyond collecting patient meanings. It also raises the question of whether an intersubjective model of culture prompts reconsiderations of culture-related text in other sections of the DSM. The social sciences can redirect attention to the clinician's culture of biomedicine to close patient health disparities."}, {"Title": "Effect of a single dose of intravenous ketamine on the wish to hasten death in palliative care: A case report in advanced cancer.", "Abstract": "The suffering experienced by some patients at the end of their lives can lead to a wish to hasten death (WTHD). It is sometimes an existential suffering, refractory to palliative care even if well conducted, which leads to this desire. Since several years, in psychiatry, the rapid anti-suicidal effects of a single injection of ketamine have been proven. WTHD and suicidal ideation have similarities. The injection of a single dose of ketamine could have an efficiency on the desire to hasten death.\nWe report the case of a woman with advanced breast cancer expressing a WTHD, treated by ketamine.\nA 78-year-old woman expressed a WTHD (request for euthanasia) because of existential suffering following a loss of autonomy related to cancer. The suicide item was 4 on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). She had no associated pain or depression. A single dose of intravenous ketamine 1\u00a0mg/kg over 40\u00a0min\u00a0plus\u00a01\u00a0mg of midazolam was injected. She had no adverse effects. From D1 post-injection to D3, the WTHD disappeared completely with a MADRS suicide item at 0. At D5, the WTHD started to reappear, and at D6, the previous speech was completely back.\nThese results suggest an effect of ketamine on WTHD. This opens up the possibility of treating existential suffering at the end of life. The optimal dosage of this treatment would have to be determined as well as a maintenance of efficacy scheme."}, {"Title": "Working in corona-designated departments in a fortified underground hospital: Concerns about corona and predictors of job burnout.", "Abstract": "In August 2020 during Israel's second COVID-19 wave Rambam Medical Center opened the Sammy Ofer Fortified Underground Emergency Hospital. This was declared a regional Corona center in the north of Israel, receiving the most severe Corona patients from the region. Alongside the advanced inpatient capacity and technology within the underground facility, there was a severe shortage of trained medical and paramedical staff, as well as harsh working conditions. The current study examined the implications and effects of working in an underground facility on healthcare workers, focusing on emotion regulation tendencies and profession as predictors of job burnout.\nSeventy-six healthcare workers, who had worked in the underground hospital for a minimum continuous period of 2\u2009weeks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a control group of 40 healthcare workers from northern Israel were asked to fill out an online survey administered <i>via</i> Qualtrics (total sample 116). The survey comprised six questionnaires: a demographic survey questionnaire; a COVID-19 concerns questionnaire; a psychological distress questionnaire (DASS, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale); trait worry (PSWQ; Penn State Worry Questionnaire); emotion regulation (ERQ, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), and burnout (SMBM, Shirom - Melamed Burnout Measure).\nIndependent-samples <i>t</i>-tests revealed no significant differences in psychological distress or burnout between Rambam Underground hospital workers and the control group. Conversely, COVID-19 concern scores were significantly different in the two groups, the Rambam hospital workers showing less concern (<i>M</i> = 2.9, <i>SD</i> =\u20090.73) than the control group (<i>M</i> = 3.47, <i>SD</i> =\u20090.76) [<i>t</i> <sub>(114)</sub> =\u2009-3.974, <i>p</i> <\u20090.001]. Hierarchical linear regression analysis identified the significant predictors of burnout among healthcare workers. Participants' profession (physician), psychological distress (total DASS score), and a personality trait of worry were statistically significant predictors for job burnout (<i>p</i> =\u20090.028, <i>p</i> <\u20090.001, <i>p</i> =\u20090.023, respectively). Concerns about COVID-19 marginally predicted job burnout (<i>p</i> =\u20090.09). Group (underground vs. control) and emotion regulation tendencies did not predict burnout.\nThe two groups showed no significant differences in psychological distress nor in burnout. Being a physician, having an intrinsic trait of being overly worried and experiencing psychological distress were significant predictors for job burnout among healthcare workers, regardless of work environment (underground vs. control)."}, {"Title": "Synthetic cannabinoids awareness among patients with opioid use disorder in Serbia - A survey based cross-sectional pilot study.", "Abstract": "There is limited data on the awareness and use of synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) in high-risk population in Serbia, despite SCs becoming more and more common at illicit drug market.\nThis pilot study aimed to examine the awareness and prevalence of use of SCs in patients with an opioid-use disorder and to identify patient characteristics and other factors associated with SCs use.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted at the Clinic for Psychiatry, Clinical Center Vojvodina, Serbia, the largest tertiary health care institution in this region of the country. All patients hospitalized due to the treatment of opioid dependence during November and December 2017 were included (response rate 100%), and filled-out an anonymous questionnaire specifically developed for the purpose of this study. Differences between patients reporting SCs use and those who did not were compared using chi-square test with values of <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered significant.\nOut of 64 patients (median age 36.37\u2009years), one third (32.81%) reported using SCs.

The most commonly reported adverse effect of SCs among users included dry mouth (81.0%), trouble thinking clearly (52.4%) and panic attacks (52.4%).\nUnderstanding the awareness and use of SCs among high-risk drug users, as well as associated factors can help improve substance-use disorder treatment in our setting. Educational activities targeting public are urgently needed to raise awareness on SCs, considering that social contacts are the main sources of information on SC for this vulnerable population.

Previous international studies reported that patients experienced high levels of coercion, threats and a range of negative emotions. Little is known about the patients' experience in South Africa. The aim of this study was to describe the patient's experiences of involuntary admission at two psychiatric hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal.\nA cross-sectional descriptive quantitative study of patients admitted involuntarily was conducted. Demographic information was extracted from clinical records and interviews were conducted with consenting participants at discharge. The MacArthur Perceived Coercion Scale, the MacArthur Negative Pressures Scale, and the MacArthur Procedural Justice Scale, of the MacArthur Admission Experience Survey (short form) were utilized to describe participants' experiences.\nThis study comprised 131 participants.

We thus evaluated whether sleep quality and depression mediated the relationship between physical exercise and cognitive impairment in older adults with T2DM by focusing on the exercise-physiology-psychology and psychiatry connection.\nSelf-reported data were collected from 2646 older adults with T2DM in Weifang, Shandong, China. Regression and bootstrap analyses were conducted to explore the chain mediator model including physical exercise, cognitive impairment, sleep quality, and depression.\nEngaging in physical exercise (coefficient = -0.6858, <i>p</i> < 0.001), high levels of sleep quality (coefficient = -0.3397, <i>p</i> = 0.015), and low levels of depression (coefficient = 0.3866, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were significantly associated with a low level of cognitive impairment. Sleep quality and depression mediated the chain effect between physical exercise and cognitive impairment (total effect = -1.0732, 95% CI [-1.3652, -0.7862]; direct effect = -0.6858, 95% CI [-0.9702, -0.3974]; indirect effect = -0.3875, 95% CI [-0.5369, -0.2521]).\nPhysical exercise may improve sleep quality in older adults with T2DM, alleviating depression and delaying the development of cognitive impairment. Physical exercise can enhance patients' ability to resist depression and cognitive impairment, and creating comfortable sleep environments can also reinforce the effects of this process. These findings have important implications for promoting healthy aging in older adults with T2DM."}, {"Title": "Competencies for Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Postgraduate Medical Education: Expert Consensus Using a Modified Delphi Process.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is recommended in Canadian guidelines as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder. With the shift towards competency-based medical education, it remains unclear how to determine when a resident is considered competent in applying knowledge of rTMS to patient care. Given inconsistencies between postgraduate training programmes with regards to training requirements, defining competencies will improve the standard of care in rTMS delivery.\nThe goal of this study was to develop competencies for rTMS that can be implemented into a competency-based training curriculum in postgraduate training programmes.\nA working group drafted competencies for postgraduate psychiatry trainees. Fourteen rTMS experts from across Canada were invited to participate in the modified Delphi process.\nTen experts participated in all three rounds of the modified Delphi process. A total of 20 items reached a consensus. There was improvement in the Cronbach's alpha over the rounds of modified Delphi process (Cronbach's alpha increased from 0.554 to 0.824) suggesting improvement in internal consistency. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) increased from 0.543 to 0.805 suggesting improved interrater agreement.\nThis modified Delphi process resulted in expert consensus on competencies to be acquired during postgraduate medical education programmes where a learner is training to become competent as a consultant and/or practitioner in rTMS treatment. This is a field that still requires development, and it is expected that as more evidence emerges the competencies will be further refined.

However, not much is known about which of these ICTs are implemented in clinical settings and their implementation characteristics. In response, this scoping review aimed to systematically explore the breadth of evidence on ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings and then to identify and characterize implementation barriers and facilitators, as well as evaluation outcomes, and measures.\nWe conducted this review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. A search strategy was applied to the following six databases between August 17-20, 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts. We also supplemented our search with Google searches and hand-searching reference lists of relevant reviews. To be included in this review, studies must include ICT-based interventions for any spectrum of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours including non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, these ICTs must be implemented in clinical settings, such as emergency department and in-patient units. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to prepare this full report.\nThis review included a total of 75 citations, describing 70 studies and 66 ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings. The majority of ICTs were computerized interventions and/or applications (n\u2009=\u200955). These ICTs were commonly used as indicated strategies (n\u2009=\u200949) targeting patients who were actively presenting with suicide risk. The three most common suicide prevention intervention categories identified were post-discharge follow-up (n\u2009=\u200927), screening and/or assessment (n\u2009=\u200922), and safety planning (n\u2009=\u200920). A paucity of reported information was identified related to implementation strategies, barriers and facilitators. The most reported implementation strategies included training, education, and collaborative initiatives. Barriers and facilitators of implementation included the need for resource supports, knowledge, skills, motivation as well as engagement with clinicians with research teams. Studies included outcomes at patient, clinician, and health system levels, and implementation outcomes included acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, and penetration.\nThis review presents several trends of the ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings and identifies a need for future research to strengthen the evidence base for improving implementation. More effort is required to better understand and support the implementation and sustainability of ICTs in clinical settings. The findings can also serve as a future resource for researchers seeking to evaluate the impact and implementation of ICTs."}, {"Title": "Predicting future depressive episodes from resting-state fMRI with generative embedding.", "Abstract": "After a first episode of major depressive disorder (MDD), there is substantial risk for a long-term remitting-relapsing course. Prevention and early interventions are thus critically important. Various studies have examined the feasibility of detecting at-risk individuals based on out-of-sample predictions about the future occurrence of depression. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has received very little attention for this purpose so far. Here, we explored the utility of generative models (i.e. different dynamic causal models, DCMs) as well as functional connectivity (FC) for predicting future episodes of depression in never-depressed adults, using a large dataset (N = 906) of task-free (\"resting state\") fMRI data from the UK Biobank (UKB). Connectivity analyses were conducted using timeseries from pre-computed spatially independent components of different dimensionalities. Over a three-year period, 50% of selected participants showed indications of at least one depressive episode, while the other 50% did not. Using nested cross-validation for training and a held-out test set (80/20 split), we systematically examined the combination of 8 connectivity feature sets and 17 classifiers. We found that a generative embedding procedure based on combining regression DCM (rDCM) with a support vector machine (SVM) enabled the best predictions, both on the training set (0.63 accuracy, 0.66 area under the curve, AUC) and the test set (0.62 accuracy, 0.64 AUC; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, on the test set, rDCM was only slightly superior to predictions based on FC (0.59 accuracy, 0.61 AUC). Interpreting model predictions based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values suggested that the most predictive connections were widely distributed and not confined to specific networks. Overall, our analyses suggest (i) ways of improving future fMRI-based generative embedding approaches for the early detection of individuals at-risk for depression and that (ii) achieving accuracies of clinical utility may require combination of fMRI with other data modalities."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal invariance of psychotic experiences in children and adolescents: What do the data tell us?", "Abstract": "Psychotic experiences are common in adults, adolescents, and children.

This step is required to conduct reliable comparisons in longitudinal studies with different age groups.\nWe used data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort, which enrolled 2511 individuals aged 6-12\u00a0years from public schools for the baseline evaluation. A 3-year follow-up assessment evaluated 1880 participants.

Visits consisted of an evidence-guided discussion about general wellbeing, relationships, family life, coping strategies, and referrals. Archived, confidential WCP session notes between July 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 were reviewed and a simple tally system was used to record coping strategies, concerns, and referrals made.\nPartner and family issues were the most prevalent concern, followed by mental health issues, and relationships with colleagues, faculty, or staff. Most residents described several coping strategies: 66.36% listed two to three, and 26.36% listed four or more. Referrals were offered to community or employee assistance program therapists, follow-up with the OPV, psychiatry, couple counseling, given Web based psychoeducational links, or referred to their program director. Nine other residencies requested the WCP providing anecdotal evidence of its feasibility and usefulness.\nAs the pandemic surged, these visits normalized reflections about wellbeing, intentional coping strategies, and resilience practices.

The present retrospective observational study reviews the incidents of seclusion, restraint, and violence in a forensic psychiatric hospital one year before and one year after the introduction of a policy which ended night-confinement and allowed patients to exit their rooms overnight. The results show that there were fewer episodes of seclusion and fewer hours spent in seclusion post policy change, however this difference was not significant. There was no statistically significant difference in incidents of violence or in the use of physical restraint. While the research is of a small scale, it does suggest that policies ending night-confinement do not lead to increased seclusion episodes and encourages future research in this area."}, {"Title": "The Glutamatergic System in Treatment-Resistant Depression and Comparative Effectiveness of Ketamine and Esketamine: Role of Inflammation?", "Abstract": "The glutamatergic system is the primary excitatory pathway within the CNS and is responsible for cognition, memory, learning, emotion, and mood. Because of its significant importance in widespread nervous system function, it is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms, such as glutamate recycling, microglial interactions, and inflammatory pathways. Imbalance within the glutamatergic system has been implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions including neurodegenerative conditions, neuromuscular conditions, and mood disorders including depression. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder worldwide, has a high prevalence rate, and afflicts approximately 280 million people. While there are numerous treatments for the disease, 30-40% of patients are unresponsive to treatment and deemed treatment resistant; approximately another third experience only partial improvement (World Health Organization, Depression fact sheet [Internet], 2020). Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in 2019 and has offered new hope to patients. It is the first treatment targeting the glutamatergic system through a complex mechanism. Numerous studies have implicated imbalance in the glutamatergic system in depression and treatment resistance. Esketamine and ketamine principally work through inhibition of the NMDA receptor, though more recent studies have implicated numerous other mechanisms mediating the antidepressant efficacy of these agents. These mechanisms include increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), activation of mammalian target of the rapamycin complex (mTORC), and reduction in inflammation. Esketamine and ketamine have been shown to decrease inflammation in numerous ways principally through reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) (Loix et al., Acta Anaesthesiol Belg 62(1):47-58, 2011; Chen et al., Psychiatry Res 269:207-11, 2018; Kopra et al., J Psychopharmacol 35(8):934-45, 2021). This anti-inflammatory effect has also been shown to be involved in the antidepressive properties of both ketamine and esketamine (Chen et al., Psychiatry Res 269:207-11, 2018; Kopra et al., J Psychopharmacol 35(8):934-45, 2021)."}, {"Title": "Anti-Inflammatory Therapy as a Promising Target in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "This chapter analyzes the therapeutic potential of current anti-inflammatory drugs in treating psychiatric diseases from a neuro-immunological perspective. Based on the bidirectional brain-immune system relationship, the rationale is that a dysregulated inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of psychiatric and neurological disorders, while the immunology function is associated with psychological variables like stress, affective disorders, and psychosis. Under certain social, psychological, and environmental conditions and biological factors, a healthy inflammatory response and the associated \"sickness behavior,\" which are aimed to resolve a physical injury and microbial threat, become harmful to the central nervous system. The features and mechanisms of the inflammatory response are described across the main mental illnesses with a special emphasis on the profile of cytokines and the function of the HPA axis. Next, it is reviewed the potential clinical utility of immunotherapy (cytokine agonists and antagonists), glucocorticoids, unconventional anti-inflammatory agents (statins, minocycline, statins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and particularly celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) inhibitor, as adjuvants of conventional psychiatric medications. The implementation of anti-inflammatory therapies holds great promise in psychiatry. Because the inflammatory background may account for the etiology and/or progression of psychiatric disorders only in a subset of patients, there is a need to elucidate the immune underpinnings of the mental illness progression, relapse, and remission. The identification of immune-related bio-signatures will ideally assist in the stratification of the psychiatric patient to predict the risk of mental disease, the prognosis, and the response to anti-inflammatory therapy."}, {"Title": "C-Reactive Protein (CRP): A Potent Inflammation Biomarker in Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "An increasing number of studies have investigated the role of inflammation in psychiatric disorders, by demonstrating how an altered/dysfunctional immunological and inflammatory system may underpin a psychiatric condition. Particularly, several studies specifically investigated the role of a neuroinflammatory biomarker, named C-reactive protein (CRP), in psychiatric disorders. Overall, even though scientific literature so far published still does not appear definitive, CRP is more likely reported to be elevated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, a low-grade inflammation (CRP >3\u00a0mg/L) has been more likely observed in a subgroup of patients affected with a more severe psychopathological symptomatology, more treatment resistance and worst clinical mental illness course, strengthening the hypothesis of the need for a different clinical and prognostic characterization based on this concomitant neuroinflammatory predisposition. However, even though further research studies are needed to confirm this preliminary evidence, CRP may represent a potential clinical routine biomarker which could be integrated in the clinical routine practice to better characterize clinical picture and course as well as address clinicians towards a personalized treatment."}, {"Title": "Untreated major depression in healthcare workers: Results from the nationwide AMADEUS survey.", "Abstract": "Recent studies have suggested increased rates of depression in healthcare workers (HCWs), with direct impact on care quality and productivity. The objective was to determine the proportion of HCWs adequately treated for their major depression in a nationwide survey, the proportion of lifestyle risk factors for depression, and to determine if working in psychiatry department or professional status may modulate these outcomes.\nThe method followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement guidelines. A survey comprising the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale was sent to public and private national healthcare facilities.\nOverall, 10,325 participants were recruited; 3438 (33.3%) [95% confidence interval 32.4-34.2] met likely diagnostic criteria for clinical depression. Almost 80% of them declared that they had a history of major depressive episode. However, only approximately 23% of them were treated with antidepressants and approximately 13% had a psychiatric follow-up. Depressed HCWs working in psychiatry departments received slightly better care for their depression, but they also consumed more anxiolytics and hypnotics and had more risk factors for depression (including smoking and hazardous drinking). We found specificities according to professions, physicians reported higher rates of hazardous drinking while nurses, nurse assistants, and health executives had higher rates of smoking and twice as much obesity as physicians.\nDisseminating tools to detect major depression, programs destigmatizing depression and antidepressants, promoting physical activity, weight loss, tobacco cessation and reduced alcohol consumption are promising strategies to improve the care of major depression in HCWs.\nReducing depression in healthcare workers is necessary to improve the quality of care, to limit burnout, medical errors, absenteeism and turn-over and globally to improve the wellbeing at work."}, {"Title": "Linguistic profile automated characterisation in pluripotential clinical high-risk mental state (CHARMS) conditions: methodology of a multicentre observational study.", "Abstract": "Language is usually considered the social vehicle of thought in intersubjective communications.

In recent years, clinical high at-risk mental state (CHARMS) criteria (evolved from the Ultra-High-Risk paradigm) and the introduction of the Clinical Staging system have been proposed to address the dynamicity of early psychopathology. At the same time, natural language processing (NLP) techniques have greatly evolved and have been successfully applied to investigate different neuropsychiatric conditions. The combination of at-risk mental state paradigm, clinical staging system and automated NLP methods, the latter applied on spoken language transcripts, could represent a useful and convenient approach to the problem of early psychopathological distress within a transdiagnostic risk paradigm.\nHelp-seeking young people presenting psychological distress (CHARMS+/- and Clinical Stage 1a or 1b; target sample size for both groups n=90) will be assessed through several psychometric tools and multiple speech analyses during an observational period of 1-year, in the context of an Italian multicentric study.

In that context, the dose-response relationship should receive more attention. Increasing the frequency from one to two sessions per week seems to be a promising start. Moreover, the concept of expectations and its influence in depression can be another auspicious approach. Dysfunctional expectations and the lack of their modification are central in symptom maintenance.

To better comprehend a global history of science, it is also crucial to include Germany's most prominent research organization: The Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science (MPG). Despite the existence of numerous institute chronicles and selected anniversary editions, the overall development of the MPG-historically situated in more than 80 institutes with more than 250 research service departments (of which approximately 50 have reached into the wider field of neuroscience, behavioral science, and cognitive science)-it remains largely <i>terra incognita</i> from a scholarly perspective. From June 2014 to December 2022, the Research Program on the History of the Max Planck Society (GMPG) opened previously neglected vistas on contemporary history, academic politics, and economic developments of the Federal Republic of Germany and its international relations by raising questions such as these: Who were the key scientific actors? In what networks did they work? In what fields had the MPG paved the way for cutting-edge innovations? What were its successes and where did it fail? In what ways were its institutional structures connected to its scientific achievements and its historical legacies? What is specific about the MPG in comparison to other national institutions in and outside of Germany? These questions relate to the emerging interdisciplinary field of the neurosciences. They refer in part to the MPG's founding years-from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s-which faced significant challenges for a \"normalization process\" in biomedical research and the burgeoning field of neuroscience. This special issue of the <i>Journal of the History of the Neurosciences</i> is composed of an introduction, five articles, and two neuroscience history interviews. It reflects on the multifold dimensions of behavioral psychology, brain research, and cognitive science developments at the MPG since its beginning through the reopening of several former Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes. After World War II, the extra-university research society-named in honor of physicist Max Planck (1858-1947)-was eventually established in the British Occupation Zone in 1946, in the American Zone in 1948, and in 1949 in the French Zone, unifying the MPG as the successor umbrella organization of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes (KWIs), now transformed into Max Planck Institutes.

This question has received a lot of attention within present-day philosophy of psychiatry, where many authors debate the ontology and nature of mental disorders. Similarly, historians of psychiatry, dating back to Foucault, have debated whether psychiatric researchers conceived of mental disorders as natural kinds or not. However, historians of psychiatry have paid little to no attention to the influence of (a) theories within logic, and (b) theories within metaphysics on psychiatric accounts of proper method, and on accounts of the nature and classification of mental disorders. Historically, however, logic and metaphysics have extensively shaped methods and interpretations of classifications in the natural sciences. This paper corrects this lacuna in the history of psychiatry, and demonstrates that theories within logic and metaphysics, articulated by Christian Wolff (1679-1754), have significantly shaped the conception of medical method and (psychiatric) nosology of the influential nosologist Boissier De Sauvages (1706-1767). After treating Sauvages, I discuss the method of the influential nosologist William Cullen (1710-1790), and demonstrate the continuity between the classificatory methods of Sauvages and Cullen. I show that both Sauvages and Cullen were essentialists concerning medical diseases in general and psychiatric disorders in particular, contributing to the history of conceptions of the ontology and nature of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "[Experiences of dangerous situations in psychiatry and psychotherapy involving patients with extremist attitudes].", "Abstract": "Dangerous situations in connection with the treatment of persons with suspected extremist attitudes have become increasingly relevant.

From this perspective, the discourse of trauma gained relevance and events of devastating magnitude began to receive neurobehavioral interpretations until finally being recognized less for their cultural and subjective effects than for the physiological changes they cause. By a narrative review, this study aims to analyze the transition of traumatic rationality from the 19th century, when trauma was associated with the cognitive concept of memory, to the 20th century, when this phenomenon was finally attached to neuroscientific research on stress. The plurality of conceptual models and deterministic paradigms can contribute to the fact that trauma research produces multifactorial coping protocols more appropriate to the human experience of post-traumatic suffering."}, {"Title": "Natural Language Processing Markers for Psychosis and Other Psychiatric Disorders: Emerging Themes and Research Agenda From a Cross-Linguistic Workshop.", "Abstract": "This workshop summary on natural language processing (NLP) markers for psychosis and other psychiatric disorders presents some of the clinical and research issues that NLP markers might address and some of the activities needed to move in that direction. We propose that the optimal development of NLP markers would occur in the context of research efforts to map out the underlying mechanisms of psychosis and other disorders. In this workshop, we identified some of the challenges to be addressed in developing and implementing NLP markers-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) in psychiatric practice, especially with respect to psychosis. Of note, a CDSS is meant to enhance decision-making by clinicians by providing additional relevant information primarily through software (although CDSSs are not without risks). In psychiatry, a field that relies on subjective clinical ratings that condense rich temporal behavioral information, the inclusion of computational quantitative NLP markers can plausibly lead to operationalized decision models in place of idiosyncratic ones, although ethical issues must always be paramount."}, {"Title": "Language and Psychosis: Tightening the Association.", "Abstract": "This special issue of DISCOURSE in Psychosis focuses on the role of language in psychosis, including the relationships between formal thought disorder and conceptual disorganization, with speech and language markers and the neural mechanisms underlying these features in psychosis.

Much of the research in this field has investigated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and immuno-inflammatory processes among individuals with established psychotic disorders. However, as such studies are limited in their ability to provide knowledge that can be used to develop preventative interventions, it is important to shift the focus to individuals with increased vulnerability for psychosis (i.e., high-risk groups). In the present article, we provide an overview of the current methods for identifying individuals at high-risk for psychosis and review the psychosocial stressors that have been most consistently associated with psychosis risk. We then describe a network of interacting physiological systems that are hypothesised to mediate the relationship between psychosocial stress and the manifestation of psychotic illness and critically review evidence that abnormalities within these systems characterise high risk populations. We found that studies of high-risk groups have yielded highly variable findings, likely due to (i) the heterogeneity both within and across high-risk samples, (ii) the diversity of psychosocial stressors implicated in psychosis, and (iii) that most studies examine single markers of isolated neurobiological systems. We propose that to move the field forward, we require well-designed, large- scale translational studies that integrate multi-domain, putative stress-related biomarkers to determine their prognostic value in high-risk samples. We advocate that such investigations are highly warranted, given that psychosocial stress is undoubtedly a relevant risk factor for psychotic disorders."}, {"Title": "Cognitive outcomes of transcranial magnetic stimulation in treatment-resistant depression: a randomized controlled study.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant cause of workforce loss, and is associated with cognitive impairments which can continue even after the elimination of mood and behavioural symptoms.

Poor adherence is common and related relapse can impair outcomes. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) may promote treatment adherence and decrease the likelihood of relapse and rehospitalization. Using LAIs in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and early-phase (EP) schizophrenia patients could benefit them, yet LAIs have traditionally been reserved for chronic patients. Methods A three-step modified Delphi panel process was used to obtain expert consensus on using LAIs with FEP and EP schizophrenia patients. A literature review and input from a steering committee of five experts in psychiatry were used to develop statements about patient population, adverse event management, and functional recovery. Recruited Delphi process psychiatrists rated the extent of their agreement with the statements over three rounds (Round 1: paper survey, 1:1 interview; Rounds 2-3: email survey). Analysis rules determined whether a statement progressed to the next round and the level of agreement deemed consensus. Measures of central tendency (mode, mean) and variability (interquartile range) were reported back to help panelists assess their previous responses in the context of those of the overall group. Results The Delphi panelists were 17 psychiatrists experienced in treating schizophrenia with LAIs, practicing in seven countries (France, Italy, US, Germany, Spain, Denmark, UK). Panelists were presented with 73 statements spanning three categories: patient population; medication dosage, management, and adverse events; and functional recovery domains and assessment. Fifty-five statements achieved\u2009\u2265\u200980% agreement (considered consensus). Statements with low agreement (40%-79%) or very low agreement (<\u200939%) concerned initiating dosage in FEP and EP patients, and managing loss of efficacy and breakthrough episodes, reflecting current evidence gaps. The panel emphasized benefits of LAIs in FEP and EP patients, with consensus that LAIs can decrease the risk of relapse, rehospitalization, and functional dysfunction. The panel supported links between these benefits and multidimensional longer-term functional recovery beyond symptomatic remission. Conclusions Findings from this Delphi panel support the use of LAIs in FEP and EP schizophrenia patients regardless of disease severity, number of relapses, or social support status. Gaps in clinician knowledge make generating evidence on using LAIs in FEP and EP patients critical."}, {"Title": "Digitally Diagnosing Multiple Developmental Delays using Crowdsourcing fused with Machine Learning: A Research Protocol.", "Abstract": "Roughly 17% percent of minors in the United States aged 3 through 17 years have a diagnosis of one or more developmental or psychiatric conditions, with the true prevalence likely being higher due to underdiagnosis in rural areas and for minority populations.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective options for pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder (MDD), yet remission rates were reported to be below 50%.\nSince epigenetics of the stress response system seem to play a role in MDD, we analyzed the DNA methylation (DNAm) of genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (<i>NR3C1</i>) and proopiomelanocortin (<i>POMC</i>) through Sanger Sequencing. For analysis, blood was taken before and after the first and last ECT from MDD patients (n=31), unmedicated depressed controls (UDC; n=19, baseline), and healthy controls (HC; n=20, baseline).\nBaseline DNAm in <i>NR3C1</i> was significantly lower in UDCs compared to both other groups (UDC: 0.014(\u00b10.002), ECT: 0.031(\u00b10.001), HC: 0.024(\u00b10.002); p<0.001), whereas regarding <i>POMC</i>, ECT patients had the highest DNAm levels (ECT: 0.252(\u00b10.013), UDC: 0.156(\u00b10.015), HC: 0.162(\u00b10.014); p<0.001). <i>NR3C1</i>m and <i>POMC</i>m decreased after the first ECT (<i>NR3C1</i>: p<0.001; <i>POMC</i>: p=0.001), and responders were less methylated compared to non-responders in <i>NR3C1</i>(p<0.001).\nOur findings indicate that both genes might play a role in the chronification of depression and <i>NR3C1</i> may be relevant for ECT response prediction."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and Factors Affecting the Use of Antipsychotics and Antipsychotic Polypharmacy in a Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Inpatient Service.", "Abstract": "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> We aimed to examine the antipsychotics used by patients hospitalized in the child and youth inpatient service providing tertiary care to investigate whether there is a difference between admission and discharge, polypharmacy, which antipsychotics are used, and which psychotropics are used concomitant with antipsychotics. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Research data were collected retrospectively from all children and adolescents hospitalized in a child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient service in a university hospital in a 4-year period (2015-2019).

Kennedy. Participants included child psychiatrists, educators, psychologists, social workers, philanthropists and other laypeople and professionals interested in the plight of children. While the original inspiration for the JCMHC was to address the potential for violence from disturbed children and adolescents, its findings and recommendations were an indictment of American society itself in which poor children went hungry, minority children were oppressed and there were not sufficient resources dedicated to the mental health of the nation's population of young people. The task forces and committees of the JCMHC spent significantly more time addressing prevention and mental health rather than mental illness. Two years into the work of the JCMHC, the leadership formed a committee to specifically examine issues related to race. The final report, published in popular book form as Crisis in Child Mental Health, arrived after the unraveling of the liberal consensus that had fueled President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs. Most of the proposed solutions for government intervention were ignored by the Nixon administration. The focus on mental health and the willingness to take a critical look at the detrimental effects of racism had represented child psychiatry at that time. In the decades that followed, however, child psychiatrists turned away from issues about prevention, race and environment and instead focused on the problems of mental illness in individual children."}, {"Title": "A Direct Observation Form for Evaluation of the Psychiatric Interview: Pilot Testing During the Psychiatry Clerkship.", "Abstract": "The authors evaluated the validity of a structured direct observation form (DOF) to assess medical student performance on psychiatric interviews for use in the psychiatry clerkship.\nOne hundred and forty-eight third-year medical students were evaluated by two DOFs completed by a supervising resident, fellow, attending, or another team member.

Therefore, various alternative therapeutic approaches including diets are, therefore, under investigation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is effective for treatment-resistant epilepsy and metabolic diseases, however, only a few clinical studies suggest its beneficial effect also for mental disorders. Animal models are a useful tool to uncover the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects. Women have a twice-higher prevalence of mood disorders but very little is known about sex differences in nutritional psychiatry. In this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge of the sex-specific effects of KD in mood disorders. Ketone bodies improve mitochondrial functions and suppress oxidative stress, inducing neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects which are both beneficial for mental health. Limited data also suggest KD-induced improvement of monoaminergic circuits and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis-the key pathophysiological pathways of mood disorders. Gut microbiome is an important mediator of the beneficial and detrimental effects of diet on brain functioning and mental health. Gut microbiota composition is affected in mood disorders but its role in the therapeutic effects of different diets, including KD, remains poorly understood. Still little is known about sex differences in the effects of KD on mental health as well as on metabolism and body weight. Some animal studies used both sexes but did not find differences in behavior, body weight loss or gut microbiota composition. More studies, both on a preclinical and clinical level, are needed to better understand sex-specific effects of KD on mental health."}, {"Title": "Changing prescribing practice for rapid tranquillization-a quality improvement project based on the Plan-Do-Study-Act method.", "Abstract": "It is unclear how the evidence from clinical trials best translates into complex clinical settings.

This highly emotional scenario forced students out of their comfort zone, to the intersection of their roles as private person and professional. The SP perceived the collaborative creation of the scenario as significant learning. The teacher took a professional position and perceived the learning in the perspective of a future colleague.\nThe mutually created emotionally loaded scenario was found to be important from all three perspectives, forcing the students to identify unexpected ways of communicating.

Traditionally, controllability is operationalized in sensorimotor terms as one's ability to exercise their actions to achieve an intended outcome (also termed \"agency\"). However, recent social neuroscience research suggests that humans also assess if and how they can exert influence over other people (i.e., their actions, outcomes, beliefs) to achieve desired outcomes (\"social controllability\"). In this review, we will synthesize empirical findings and neurocomputational frameworks related to social controllability. We first introduce the concepts of contextual and perceived controllability and their respective relevance for decision-making. Then, we outline neurocomputational frameworks that can be used to model social controllability, with a focus on behavioral economic paradigms and reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, we discuss the implications of social controllability for computational psychiatry research, using delusion and obsession-compulsion as examples.

One promising approach is the development of computational assays: integrating computational models with cognitive tasks to infer latent patient-specific disease processes in brain computations. While recent years have seen many methodological advancements in computational modelling and many cross-sectional patient studies, much less attention has been paid to basic psychometric properties (reliability and construct validity) of the computational measures provided by the assays. In this review, we assess the extent of this issue by examining emerging empirical evidence. We find that many computational measures suffer from poor psychometric properties, which poses a risk of invalidating previous findings and undermining ongoing research efforts using computational assays to study individual (and even group) differences.

Secondarily, we explored which physiological data were related to prior predictions, generalization across patients, and associations between affective symptoms and physiological data.\nWe conducted a prospective exploratory observational study including patients with BD and MDD on acute affective episodes (manic, depressed, and mixed) whose physiological data were recorded using a research-grade wearable (Empatica E4) across 3 consecutive time points (acute, response, and remission of episode). Euthymic patients and healthy controls were recorded during a single session (approximately 48 h). Manic and depressive symptoms were assessed using standardized psychometric scales. Physiological wearable data included the following channels: acceleration (ACC), skin temperature, blood volume pulse, heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Invalid physiological data were removed using a rule-based filter, and channels were time aligned at 1-second time units and segmented at window lengths of 32 seconds, as best-performing parameters. We developed deep learning predictive models, assessed the channels' individual contribution using permutation feature importance analysis, and computed physiological data to psychometric scales' items normalized mutual information (NMI). We present a novel, fully automated method for the preprocessing and analysis of physiological data from a research-grade wearable device, including a viable supervised learning pipeline for time-series analyses.\nOverall, 35 sessions (1512 hours) from 12 patients (manic, depressed, mixed, and euthymic) and 7 healthy controls (mean age 39.7, SD 12.6 years; 6/19, 32% female) were analyzed. The severity of mood episodes was predicted with moderate (62%-85%) accuracies (aim 1), and their polarity with moderate (70%) accuracy (aim 2). The most relevant features for the former tasks were ACC, EDA, and HR. There was a fair agreement in feature importance across classification tasks (Kendall W=0.383). Generalization of the former models on unseen patients was of overall low accuracy, except for the intra-individual models. ACC was associated with \"increased motor activity\" (NMI>0.55), \"insomnia\" (NMI=0.6), and \"motor inhibition\" (NMI=0.75).

Support that emphasizes engagement in satisfying and valued everyday activities and boosts self-esteem would be a potential way to help people with mental health issues develop work readiness in terms of the worker role and satisfaction with work participation."}, {"Title": "Compulsory admission: are there differences between migrants and natives? Data from a psychiatric emergency service of an Italian metropolitan area.", "Abstract": "As compared to natives, higher rates of involuntary admission were found among migrants in most European countries. A possible strategy to reduce this phenomenon is to develop preventive strategies targeting risk and protective factors of compulsory admission specific to the migrant population.\nThe first aim of the present study was to evaluate compulsory admission rates in the migrant population as compared to natives admitted for an acute mental disorder. The second aim was investigate whether sociodemographic, clinical, and care-related variables associated with compulsory admission differed between migrants and natives. Moreover, in the whole sample we assessed whether migrant status affected the risk of compulsory admission.\nRetrospective single-center study on patients hospitalized in the period between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020 in a large metropolitan academic hospital. We compared sociodemographic, clinical, and care-related variables between migrants and natives, voluntary or compulsory admitted. We investigated the association between compulsory admission and the variables collected in the whole sample and in the migrants' and natives' groups with a correlation analysis followed by hierarchical logistic regression models.\nThe sample included 185 migrant patients and 933 native patients. The prevalence of compulsory admission was significantly higher in the migrants' group. Male gender, lower education, non-comprehension of the local language, a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, and aggressive behavior were associated with compulsory admission in the migrants' sample, partially differing from the natives.\nOur study highlighted how migrant status is associated with a higher risk for compulsory admission. Inclusion policies or the presence of cultural mediators in emergency settings might be preventive strategies in this context."}, {"Title": "How social media expression can reveal personality.", "Abstract": "Personality psychology studies personality and its variation among individuals and is an essential branch of psychology. In recent years, machine learning research related to personality assessment has started to focus on the online environment and showed outstanding performance in personality assessment. However, the aspects of the personality of these prediction models measure remain unclear because few studies focus on the interpretability of personality prediction models. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning model with domain knowledge introduced to enhance accuracy and improve interpretability.\nStudy participants were recruited <i>via</i> an online experiment platform. After excluding unqualified participants and downloading the Weibo posts of eligible participants, we used six psycholinguistic and mental health-related lexicons to extract textual features. Then the predictive personality model was developed using the multi-objective extra trees method based on 3,411 pairs of social media expression and personality trait scores. Subsequently, the prediction model's validity and reliability were evaluated, and each lexicon's feature importance was calculated. Finally, the interpretability of the machine learning model was discussed.\nThe features from Culture Value Dictionary were found to be the most important predictors. The fivefold cross-validation results regarding the prediction model for personality traits ranged between 0.44 and 0.48 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The correlation coefficients of five personality traits between the two \"split-half\" datasets data ranged from 0.84 to 0.88 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Moreover, the model performed well in terms of contractual validity.\nBy introducing domain knowledge to the development of a machine learning model, this study not only ensures the reliability and validity of the prediction model but also improves the interpretability of the machine learning method. The study helps explain aspects of personality measured by such prediction models and finds a link between personality and mental health. Our research also has positive implications regarding the combination of machine learning approaches and domain knowledge in the field of psychiatry and its applications to mental health."}, {"Title": "Clinical significance of microbiota changes under the influence of psychotropic drugs. An updated narrative review.", "Abstract": "Relationship between drugs and microbiota is bilateral. Proper composition thus function of microbiota is a key to some medications used in modern medicine. However, there is also the other side of the coin. Pharmacotherapeutic agents can modify the microbiota significantly, which consequently affects its function. A recently published study showed that nearly 25% of drugs administered to humans have antimicrobial effects. Multiple antidepressants are antimicrobials,. and antibiotics with proven antidepressant effects do exist. On the other hand, antibiotics (e.g., isoniaside, minocycline) confer mental phenotype changes, and adverse effects caused by some antibiotics include neurological and psychological symptoms which further supports the hypothesis that intestinal microbiota may affect the function of the central nervous system. Here we gathered comprehensively data on drugs used in psychiatry regarding their antimicrobial properties. We believe our data has strong implications for the treatment of psychiatric entities. Nevertheless the study of ours highlights the need for more well-designed trials aimed at analysis of gut microbiota function."}, {"Title": "English Language Medical Schools in China: An Analysis of International Medical Graduates Practicing in the UK.", "Abstract": "From 2006, the Ministry of Education in China has approved universities to provide undergraduate medical training in English, targeting fee-paying international students. Students on these courses can face challenges in their clinical training, particularly in the domains of communication and professionalism. This study examines the proportion of doctors qualified from such medical schools who are currently listed on the UK medical register.\nThe UK General Medical Council register of medical practitioners was searched to identify doctors qualified from 33 Chinese medical schools who provide education in the English language.\nAs of February 2022, 502 doctors whose primary medical qualification is from a university offering English language education in China were registered on the UK medical register. Four hundred twenty-five (84.7%) of these doctors were aged 39 and under, approximately double the proportion of doctors in this age bracket overall. Three hundred forty nine (69.5%) were staff grade and associate specialist doctors, 109 (21.7%) were doctors in training, 36 (7.2%) were on the General Practitioner (GP) register, and 20 (4.0%) were on the specialist register. Among doctors in training, the most common specialty areas were in general practice and psychiatry that are both facing recruitment shortages in the UK at present.\nA small but significant number of graduates whose medical training was in the English language in China are practicing medicine in the UK. These doctors are in younger age groups than the overall medical workforce, and are less likely to be in training, and specialist or GP posts. Among those in training, a high proportion are in GP and psychiatry training and could contribute to alleviating UK medical workforce shortages.

In order to compensate, the Australian Government introduced new Medicare-subsidized telephone and video-linked consultations. This study investigates how these developments affected the pre-existing inequity of psychiatry service delivery in Australia.\nThe study analyses five and a half years of national Medicare data listing all subsidized psychiatry consultation consumption aggregated to areas defined as Statistical Area level 3 (SA3s; which have population sizes of 30 k-300 k). Face-to-face, video-linked and telephone consultations are considered separately. The analysis consists of presenting rates of consumption, concentration graphs, and concentration indices to quantify inequity, using Socio Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) scores to rank the SA3 areas according to socio-economic disadvantage.\nThere is a 22% drop in the rate of face-to-face psychiatry consultation consumption across Australia in the final study period compared with the last study period predating the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the loss is made up by the introduction of the new subsidized telephone and video-linked consultations. Referring to the same time periods, there is a reduction in the inequity of the distribution of face-to-face consultations, where the concentration index reduces from 0.166 to 0.129. The new subsidized video-linked consultations are distributed with severe inequity in the great majority of subpopulations studied. Australia-wide, video-linked consultations are also distributed with gross inequity, with a concentration index of 0.356 in the final study period. The effect of this upon overall inequity was to cancel out the reduction of inequity resulting from the reduction of face-to face appointments.\nAustralian subsidized video-linked psychiatry consultations have been distributed with gross inequity and have been a significant exacerbator of the overall inequity of psychiatric service provision. Future policy decisions wishing to reduce this inequity should take care to reduce the risk posed by expanding telepsychiatry."}, {"Title": "Baby Brains at Work: How Task-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Can Illuminate the\u00a0Early Emergence of Psychiatric Risk.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are complex, often emerging from multiple atypical processes within specified domains over the course of development. Characterizing the development of the neural circuits supporting these domains may help break down the components of complex disorders and reveal variations in functioning associated with psychiatric risk. This review highlights the current and potential role of infant task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in elucidating the developmental neurobiology of psychiatric disorders. Task-fMRI measures evoked brain activity in response to specific stimuli through changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. First, we review extant studies using task fMRI from birth through the first few years of life and synthesize current evidence for when, where, and how different neural computations are performed across the infant brain. Neural circuits for sensory perception, the perception of abstract categories, and the detection of statistical regularities have been characterized with task fMRI in infants, providing developmental context for identifying and interpreting variation in the functioning of neural circuits related to psychiatric risk. Next, we discuss studies that specifically examine variation in the functioning of these neural circuits during infancy in relation to risk for psychiatric disorders. These studies reveal when maturation of specific neural circuits diverges, the influence of environmental risk factors, and the potential utility for task fMRI to facilitate early treatment or prevention of later psychiatric problems. Finally, we provide considerations for future infant task-fMRI studies with the potential to advance understanding of both functioning of neural circuits during infancy and subsequent risk for psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Is visual metacognition associated with autistic traits?

Several recent studies investigated the relationship between metacognition and autism. However, the evidence is still inconsistent. While some studies reported autistic people having lower levels of metacognitive sensitivity, others did not. Leveraging the fact that autistic traits are present in the general population, our study investigated the relationship between visual metacognition and autistic traits in a sample of 360 neurotypical participants. We measured metacognition as the correspondence between confidence and accuracy in a visual two alternative forced choice task. Autistic-traits were assessed through the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) score. A regression analysis revealed no statistically significant association between autistic traits and metacognition or confidence. Furthermore, we found no link between AQ sub-scales and metacognition.

The single frontline service approach is time-intensive and risks a coercive pathway to care. The emergency department is the default location for transfers by police or ambulance involving a person involved in a mental health crisis, despite being viewed as suboptimal.\nPolice and ambulance staff struggled keeping up with the mental health demand, reporting inadequate mental health training, little enjoyment and negative experiences when trying to access help from other services. Most mental health staff had adequate mental health training and enjoyed their work, but many experienced difficulties getting help from other services. Police and ambulance staff found it hard to work with mental health services.\nThe combination of limited training, poor interagency referral processes, and difficulties accessing support from mental health services means that when police and ambulance services attend mental health crises alone, distress may be heightened and prolonged. Enhanced mental health training for first responders and more streamlined referral processes may improve process and outcomes. Mental health nurses have key skills that could be utilized in assisting police and ambulance staff who attend 911 emergency mental health calls. New models such as co-response teams, whereby police, mental health clinicians and ambulance staff respond conjointly should be trialled and evaluated.\nINTRODUCTION: First responders are increasingly called to assist people experiencing mental health crises but little research exists canvassing multi-agency perspectives of such work.\nTo understand the views of police officers, ambulance and mental health staff attending mental health or suicide-related crises in Aotearoa New Zealand and to discover how they experience current models of cross-agency collaboration.\nA descriptive cross-sectional survey involving mixed methods.

We also evaluated the psychotic motivation accompanying the homicide. Forty-four (93.6%) of the homicides were psychotically motivated. The victim was a stranger in only 8.5 percent of the homicides. Use of firearms as a killing method was significantly higher in predominantly proactive homicides (30%) compared with impulsive homicides (3.7%). Infidelity delusions were more frequent in proactive homicides than in impulsive homicides. According to regression models, a predominantly proactive homicide was significantly associated with being married, older age at illness onset, killing with firearms, infidelity delusions and a high PCL-R affective facet score in univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses showed a significant association with infidelity delusions and a high PCL-R affective facet score.

Yet, with decades of multiple NCE failures in Phase II and III efficacy trials for different psychiatric disorders, the utility and value of animal models in the drug discovery process have come under intense scrutiny along with the widespread withdrawal of the pharmaceutical industry from psychiatric drug discovery. More recently, the development and utilization of animal models for the discovery of psychiatric NCEs has undergone a dynamic evolution with the application of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework for better design of preclinical to clinical translational studies combined with innovative genetic, neural circuitry-based, and automated testing technologies. In this chapter, the authors will discuss this evolving role of animal models for improving the different stages of the discovery and development in the identification of next generation treatments for psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "The History of Drug Development in Psychiatry: A Lesson in Serendipity.", "Abstract": "The goal of this book is to provide a guide on modern day drug development in psychiatry. However, in order to understand current practices in drug development, it is important to first understand the history of psychiatry including early attempts at drug discovery and develoment. The early history of psychiatry is mired with the use of inhumane experimental treatments and the institutionalization of patients in asylums. Some of the earliest drugs used in these asylums were meant to sedate patients rather than treat underlying mental disorders. The earliest identified drugs treating mental disorders were born out of serendipitous discoveries which later led to their clinical effects being demonstrated through clinical trials and case studies. This is evident from the history of chlorpromazine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and others. We discuss in detail about each of these psychotropic drugs, the events leading up to their discovery, and their role in formulating the biological basis of mental disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. Psychiatry, it seems has worked its way backwards from first identifying treatments before understanding the biological basis of mental disorders, in a sharp contrast to the other fields of medicine. With our growing understanding of the etiopathogenesis of mental disorders, drug development in psychiatry is evolving to develop treatments that target the underlying physiology of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Drug Development in Psychiatry: The Long and Winding Road from Chance Discovery to Rational Development.", "Abstract": "Based extensively on tables and figures, this chapter reviews drug development in psychiatry with an emphasis on antidepressants from the 1950s to the present and then looks forward to the future. It begins with the chance discovery drugs and then moves to through their rational refinement using structure activity relationships to narrow the pharmacological actions of the drugs to those mediating their antidepressant effects and eliminating the effects on targets that mediate adverse effects. This approach yielded newer antidepressants which compared to older antidepressants are safer and better tolerated but nevertheless do still not treat the approximately 40% of patients with major depression (MD) which is unresponsive to biogenic amine mechanisms of action. This form of MD is commonly referred to as treatment resistant depression. Esketamine is an antidepressant which has a novel mechanism of action: blockade of the glutamate NMDA receptor. These studies coupled with earlier studies with other NMDA drugs suggest approximately 60% of patient with TRD are rapidly and robustly responsive to this mechanism of action. Thus, there appears to be three forms of MD based on pharmacological responsiveness: (a) 60% responsive to biogenic amine mechanisms of action, (b) 24% (i.e., 40\u00a0\u00d7\u00a060%) responsive to NMDA but not to biogenic amine mechanisms of action, and (c) 16% (i.e., 40-24%) not responsive to either of these mechanisms of action. Scientific investigation of these three groups may yield important information about the pathophysiology and/or pathoetiology of these different forms of MD. This information coupled with studies into the neurobiology (e.g., imaging studies, connectomes to name a few approaches being used) and genetics of MD should provide the fundamental knowledge which will permit a rational search for and discovery of newer antidepressant drugs and other somatic and psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of patients with different forms of MD based on pathophysiology and pathoetiology. Examples are given of how such discovery and development have occurred in other areas of medicine and even in central nervous system (CNS) space including six novel mechanisms of action CNS drugs which have been successfully developed and marketed over the last 25\u00a0years."}, {"Title": "Management Challenges of Recurrent Foreign Body Ingestions in a Psychiatric Patient: A Case Report.", "Abstract": "Intentional foreign body ingestions (FBIs) are commonly seen in adult patients with intellectual disabilities, substance use, severe psychiatric conditions, or external motivations, but these cases are rarely reported in the psychiatric literature. We present the case of a patient with an extensive history of FBIs and suicide attempts and a multitude of psychiatric diagnoses including borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder from significant abuse in foster care, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and pica. During the single hospitalization described in this report, she had multiple incidents of self-harm, aggression, and 9 FBIs. A multidisciplinary team involving psychiatry, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, surgery, internal medicine, nursing, social work, behavioral health technicians, case management, chaplain, the legal department, police officers, and hospital maintenance was necessary for care coordination. Interventions included 8 endoscopies and an abdominal surgery to retrieve swallowed foreign bodies, pain management, psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for agitation, and environmental precautions to minimize the risk of ingestion. Ultimately, to prevent further trauma and limit additional opportunities for FBI, a collaborative decision was made with the patient to discharge her to her home with outpatient psychologist and psychiatrist support. This case describes the complexities of hospital management of a patient with intentional recurrent FBI, highlighting the importance of a critical assessment of risk versus benefit for prolonging hospitalization. Development of practical management protocols and risk assessments for continued hospitalization is necessary for patients with recurrent intentional FBIs."}, {"Title": "\"Fighting for the Last Gasp\"-Severe Borderline Personality Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Chronic Deliberate Ingestion of Foreign Bodies, and Palliative Struggles in Intensive Care.", "Abstract": "Repeated deliberate ingestion of foreign bodies can have tragic long-term consequences. We report the case of a young woman with borderline personality disorder and chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, whose chronic repeated ingestion of razor blades and batteries eventually resulted in severe medical complications. We focus on the involvement of the consultation-liaison psychiatry team as part of her multidisciplinary care, predominantly in the intensive care environment. Her care posed extensive challenges due to the retraumatizing effects of the intensive care environment and the measures required to provide life-sustaining care when the young woman was emotionally dysregulated. Strategies used to address team dynamics and \"compassion fatigue\" are discussed, including some pertinent relevant literature that was used as educational material for staff to develop a better understanding of the confronting and apparently self-defeating antitherapeutic behavior she frequently displayed. The consultation-liaison psychiatry team has a significant role to play in such situations, carefully balancing patient advocacy roles while simultaneously supporting staff who may be vicariously traumatized by the substantial emotional challenges of providing care in these circumstances."}, {"Title": "Risk of suicide in children and adolescents in the emergency department-is universal screening the answer?", "Abstract": "Suicide is a leading cause of death among children and adolescents. Suicide risk screening tools can detect the risk of suicide among patients presenting to healthcare settings. The aim of this review was to describe the effectiveness of universal suicide risk screening (all patients) compared with selective screening (behavioural health patients only) in children and adolescents in emergency departments (EDs).\nA literature search was conducted on PubMed for articles related to suicide risk screening in paediatric EDs between January 2016 and February 2022.\n8 studies met the selection criteria. The review showed that 46%-93% of patients that screened positive for suicide risk had presented with a medical concern. These patients would have been missed without universal suicide risk screening. In both selective and universal screening scenarios, use of a suicide risk screening tool was better at detecting suicide risk compared with use of presenting problem alone. Suicide risk screening was found to be acceptable without increasing length of stay in the ED.\nBased on this review, using a suicide screening tool can help detect patients at risk who would otherwise have been missed."}, {"Title": "Lifelong mental health service use among 15-22 years old offenders: a document-based, mixed-methods descriptive study.", "Abstract": "Among young offenders, psychiatric morbidity and comorbidity are common, but our knowledge about their use of mental health services during childhood and adolescence is scarce. We aimed to describe the lifelong use of mental health services of young offenders who have committed serious crimes.\nUsing data on forensic psychiatric examinations of 42 Finnish offenders aged 15-22 years, we analysed the timing and typical patterns of their prior mental health service use with qualitative and quantitative content analysis and typification.\nYoung offenders appeared in this study as children with plenty of perinatal and developmental risks, and risks related to their family situation and peer relations. Most subjects were described as having had emotional or behavioural symptoms, or both, since childhood. Involvement in mental health services was rare before the age of 7 years but increased markedly after that, staying on the same level during adolescence. Five categories of mental health service users were identified: (1) continuing service use around a decade (14.3%), (2) one brief fixed treatment (11.9%), (3) involuntary use of services (31.0%), (4) evasive use of services (21.4%) and (5) no mental health service use (21.4%).\nYoung offenders had symptoms from early ages, but during childhood and adolescence, involvement in mental health services appeared for most as relatively short, repetitive or lacking. To help children at risk of criminal development, a multiprofessional approach, an early evidence-based intervention for behavioural symptoms and screening for learning problems, traumatic experiences and substance use are necessary.

We aimed to characterize the clinical use and diagnostic consequences of EEG in a general psychiatric setting to evaluate and optimize its use.\nWe performed a quality development project at the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. We identified patients referred for EEG examination from psychiatric services between 1 September 2017 and 1 September 2022. We extracted data from electronic health records on patient characteristics, indications, EEG results, and treatment consequences and analyzed risk factors for abnormal EEGs.\nAmong 57,031 persons seen in the psychiatric services in the study period, 219 (0.4%) were referred for EEG examination. Psychosis (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200970, 32%) was the most common symptom and suspicion of epilepsy (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009129, 59%) was the most common clinical suspicion leading to referral. Of the 219 patients, 53 (24%) had an abnormal EEG result including 17 (7.8%) with epileptiform changes. Abnormal EEGs led to treatment alterations in six patients (3%). Age, prior epilepsy, use of antiseizure medication, use of clozapine, and convulsions were associated with epileptiform changes in the EEG.\nEEG is rarely used in psychiatric settings and seldom has treatment consequences. However, in specific clinical settings, the EEG result leads to an alteration of clinical management and the findings, therefore, call for refinement of clinical guidelines to optimize the use of EEG."}, {"Title": "Stimulating human prefrontal cortex increases reward learning.", "Abstract": "Work in computational psychiatry suggests that mood disorders may stem from aberrant reinforcement learning processes. Specifically, it has been proposed that depressed individuals believe that negative events are more informative than positive events, resulting in higher learning rates from negative outcomes (Pulcu and Browning, 2019). In this proof-of-concept study, we investigated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as commonly used in depression treatment trials, might change learning rates for affective outcomes. Healthy adults completed an established reinforcement learning task (Pulcu and Browning, 2017) in which the information content of reward and loss outcomes was manipulated by varying the volatility of stimulus-outcome associations. Learning rates on the tasks were quantified using computational models. Stimulation over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) but not motor cortex (M1) increased learning rates specifically for reward outcomes. The effects of prefrontal tDCS were cognitive state-dependent: tDCS applied during task performance increased learning rates for wins; tDCS applied before task performance decreased both win and loss learning rates. A replication study confirmed the key finding that tDCS to DLPFC during task performance increased learning rates specifically for rewards. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of tDCS for modulating computational parameters of reinforcement learning that are relevant to mood disorders."}, {"Title": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 and recurrent depression.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 (APS-2) features autoimmune Addison's disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus. Addison's disease is occasionally associated with depressive symptoms, therefore patients with APS-2 might present primarily in a psychiatric clinic. Such atypical primary presentation can possibly lead to delayed and/or inadequate diagnosis and management.\nA 57-year-old female patient was referred to our psychiatric clinic from an internal medicine hospital presenting severe depressive symptoms. Upon admission, she complained of sadness, loss of interest (anhedonia) and drive, nausea, and loss of appetite. Physical examination revealed generalized hyperpigmentation. Laboratory investigations revealed hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, macrocytic anemia along with treated hypothyroidism, and partially treated adrenal insufficiency.\nA diagnosis of the APS-2 was made. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was mandatory and a complete regression of the affective symptoms was achieved.\nOrganic workout in psychiatry is essential to detect diseases symptomatically or semiologically related to depression. In our case, hyperpigmentation, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency linked to depressive symptoms led to APS-2 diagnosis. ECT was challenging due to the avoidance of etomidate by the anesthesiologists, due to adrenal insufficiency. The adjustment of ECTs' energy dosage (to avoid too short and ineffective seizures) and optimization of adrenal and thyroid function was essential to reverse the severe depressive syndrome."}, {"Title": "Psychometric Features of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Among Malaysian Women: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "Abstract": "Background The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item questionnaire developed to identify women at risk for postpartum depression (PD). EPDS symptom patterns appear to vary by nation.\u00a0The EPDS items and their correlation with affirmative EPDS screens have thus far been minimally studied among Malaysians.\u00a0Using positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), this study aims to evaluate the EPDS-based psychometric features of individual answer items. Methodology A cross-section of postpartum women receiving care at two tertiary care facilities in Malaysia underwent screening assessments in the course of receiving treatment.\u00a0EPDS was employed with an aggregate cutoff score (\u226512). EPDS items were assessed as predictors of abnormal EPDS screens. Results A total of\u00a0219\u00a0participants were screened, among which 66\u00a0were positive on the EPDS. EPDS item responses were collected (item responses 0-3: PPV = 0.07-0.78 and NPV = 0.93-0.22). A negative response to any item strongly predicted a negative EPDS screen (item entry = 0 and NPV = 0.93).\u00a0Affirmative responses on items 8, 9, and 10 were particularly strong predictors of abnormal EPDS scores, while negative responses to items 3, 5, and 7 were strong predictors of negative EPDS scores. A substantial NPV for any item (response\u00a00 and NPV items 1-10 = 0.93) and a moderate PPV for any affirmative response (responses 1-3, PPV items 1-10\u00a0= 0.60) were observed. Conclusions This is one of the few studies to examine the EPDS item responses among Malaysian women. The results suggest that depression remains prevalent in this postpartum population. Our findings reveal a robust NPV for any negative response to the individual items of the scale, a moderate PPV for any affirmative response, and a particularly robust validity for specific EPDS items. Physical complaints, rather than feelings of sadness, figure prominently in this population, suggesting a tendency among Malaysian women toward\u00a0somatization."}, {"Title": "Using standardized patients for undergraduate clinical skills training in an introductory course to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to assess the value and acceptance of Standardized or Simulated Patients (SPs) for training clinically inexperienced undergraduate medical students in psychiatric history taking, psychopathological assessment, and communication with psychiatric patients.\nAs part of a newly developed introductory course to psychiatry, pairs of 3rd year medical students conducted psychiatric assessments of SPs, including history and psychopathological state, under the supervision of a clinical lecturer. Prior to the assessment, students attended introductory lectures to communication in psychiatry and psychopathology but were clinically inexperienced. After the interview, the students' summary of their findings was discussed with other students and the lecturer. Students, lecturers, and actors were invited to a survey after the course. Questions for the students included self-reports about perceived learning success and authenticity of the interviews.\n41 students, 6 actors and 8 lecturers completed the survey (response rates of 48%, 50%, and 100%, respectively). The survey results indicated that, despite their lack of clinical experience, students learned how to conduct a psychiatric interview, communicate in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, take a psychiatric history and perform a psychopathological examination. SPs were perceived as authentic. The survey results suggested that this setting allowed for an enjoyable, non-distressful and motivating learning experience within a restricted time frame of just two afternoons.\nThe results indicated that the SP approach presented is useful for teaching clinical skills in psychiatry to students with limited previous clinical experience and knowledge of psychiatry. We argue that SPs can be used to teach practical psychiatric skills already during an early phase of the curriculum. Limitations of our study include a limited sample size, a temporal gap between the course and the survey, reliance on self-reports, and lack of comparison to alternative interventions."}, {"Title": "Psychological distress and caregiving experience during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic among parents of an offspring with anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "To compare different aspects of caregiving distress and experience in parents of patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThree cohorts of parents of AN patients (cohort 1-pre-pandemic: N\u00a0=\u00a078, cohort 2-first pandemic year: N\u00a0=\u00a051, cohort 3-second pandemic year: N\u00a0=\u00a0119) were recruited from child and adolescent psychiatry wards and cross-sectionally assessed as part of the clinical routine.

Furthermore, increased causal connections from LIN to multiple networks, aberrant self-inhibitory connections of DAN and SMN, and increased self-inhibitory connection of SAN were disorder-specific patterns for SCZ, MDD, and BD, respectively.\nDCM revealed that LIN was the core abnormal network common to psychiatric disorders.

While risk assessment methods are well rooted in forensic psychiatry, there are no available tools to predict longitudinal physical aggression in patients with schizophrenia within forensic settings at an individual level. In the present study, we used evidence-based risk and protective factors, as well as variables related to course of treatment assessed at baseline, to predict prospective incidents of physical aggression (4-month, 12-month, and 18-month follow-up) among 151 patients with schizophrenia within the forensic mental healthcare system. Across our HARM models, the balanced accuracy (sensitivity\u00a0+\u00a0specificity/2) of predicting physical aggressive incidents in patients with schizophrenia ranged from 59.73 to 87.33% at 4-month follow-up, 68.31-80.10% at 12-month follow-up, and 46.22-81.63% at 18-month follow-up, respectively. Additionally, we developed separate models, using clinician rated clinical judgement of short term and immediate violent risk, as a measure of comparison. Several modifiable evidence-based predictors of prospective physical aggression in schizophrenia were identified, including impulse control, substance abuse, impulsivity, treatment non-adherence, mood and psychotic symptoms, substance abuse, and poor family support. To the best of our knowledge, our HARM models are the first to predict longitudinal physical aggression at an individual level in patients with schizophrenia in forensic settings. However, it is important to caution that since these machine learning models were developed in the context of forensic settings, they may not be generalisable to individuals with schizophrenia more broadly. Moreover, a low base rate of physical aggression was observed in the testing set (6.0-11.6% across timepoints). As such, larger cohorts will be required to determine the replicability of these findings."}, {"Title": "Insult to Injury?

Consequently, opportunities to identify and prevent health events before they occur are missed. New health technologies are addressing these critical issues by enabling the continual monitoring of health-related processes using speech. These technologies are a great match for the healthcare environment because they make high-frequency assessments non-invasive and highly scalable. Indeed, existing tools can now extract a wide variety of health-relevant biosignals from smartphones by analyzing a person's voice and speech. These biosignals are linked to health-relevant biological pathways and have shown promise in detecting several disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. However, more research is needed to identify the speech signals that matter most, validate these signals against ground-truth outcomes, and translate these data into biomarkers and just-in-time adaptive interventions. We discuss these issues herein by describing how assessing everyday psychological stress through speech can help both researchers and health care providers monitor the impact that stress has on a wide variety of mental and physical health outcomes, such as self-harm, suicide, substance abuse, depression, and disease recurrence. If done appropriately and securely, speech is a novel digital biosignal that could play a key role in predicting high-priority clinical outcomes and delivering tailored interventions that help people when they need it most."}, {"Title": "Transdiagnostic computations of uncertainty: towards a new lens on intolerance of uncertainty.", "Abstract": "People radically differ in how they cope with uncertainty. Clinical researchers describe a dispositional characteristic known as \"intolerance of uncertainty\", a tendency to find uncertainty aversive, reported to be elevated across psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Concurrently, recent research in computational psychiatry has leveraged theoretical work to characterise individual differences in uncertainty processing. Under this framework, differences in how people estimate different forms of uncertainty can contribute to mental health difficulties. In this review, we briefly outline the concept of intolerance of uncertainty within its clinical context, and we argue that the mechanisms underlying this construct may be further elucidated through modelling how individuals make inferences about uncertainty. We will review the evidence linking psychopathology to different computationally specified forms of uncertainty and consider how these findings might suggest distinct mechanistic routes towards intolerance of uncertainty. We also discuss the implications of this computational approach for behavioural and pharmacological interventions, as well as the importance of different cognitive domains and subjective experiences in studying uncertainty processing."}, {"Title": "Patient and Clinician Satisfaction with the Early Implementation of Telemental Health Services in an Urban Behavioral Health Clinic During the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "Abstract": "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> <i>The COVID-19 pandemic served as an impetus for the rapid expansion of telehealth.

However, research in this area is both sparse and conflicted, especially regarding potentially asymmetric development of learning for different motives (obtain wins vs avoid losses) and learning from valenced feedback (positive vs negative). In the current study, we investigated the development of RL from adolescence to adulthood, using a probabilistic reversal learning task modified to experimentally separate motivational context and feedback valence, in a sample of 95 healthy participants between 12 and 45. We show that adolescence is characterized by enhanced novelty seeking and response shifting especially after negative feedback, which leads to poorer returns when reward contingencies are stable. Computationally, this is accounted for by reduced impact of positive feedback on behavior.

Further, we examined group differences in the frequency of ED in accepted vs. rejected referrals, as well as group differences in types of ED in age and sex distributions, and diagnoses occurring with specific types of ED.\nED was present in 62.3 % of the 999 referrals and was assessed as the primary issue in twice as many rejected referrals (11.4 %) compared to accepted referrals (5.7 %). Boys were significantly more often described with externalizing and internalizing behavior (55.5 % vs. 31.6 %; 35.1 % vs. 26.5 %) as well as incongruent affect (10.0 % vs. 4.7 %), whereas girls were more often described with depressed mood (47.5 % vs. 38.0 %) and self-harm (23.8 % vs. 9.4 %). The frequency of different types of ED varied with age.\nThe present study is the first to evaluate the frequency of ED in children and adolescents referred to mental health services. The study offers insights into the high frequency of ED and the associations between ED and subsequent diagnoses, which may prove to be a method of early identification of risk of psychopathology. Our findings suggest that ED may rightly be considered a transdiagnostic factor, independent of specific psychiatric disorders, and that an ED-centered as opposed to diagnosis-specific approach to assessment, prevention, and treatment could target transversal symptoms of psychopathology in a more holistic manner.

A Pilot Study on the Effect of a Newly Developed Ostracism Task for Adolescents.", "Abstract": "(1) Background: Many studies have used a well-known social exclusion task, namely Cyberball, to assess the psychophysiological reactions to ostracism in laboratory settings. However, this task has been recently criticized for its lack of realism. Instant messaging communication platforms are currently central communication channels where adolescents conduct their social life. These should be considered when recreating the emotional experiences that fuel the development of negative emotions. To overcome this limitation, a new ostracism task, namely SOLO (Simulated On-Line Ostracism), recreating hostile interactions (i.e., exclusion and rejection) over WhatsApp was developed. The aim of this manuscript is to compare adolescents' self-reported negative and positive affect, as well as physiological reactivity (i.e., heat rate, HR; heart rate variability, HRV) exhibited during SOLO to Cyberball. (2) Method: A total of 35 participants (Mage = 15.16; SD = 1.48; 24 females) took part in the study. The first group (<i>n</i> = 23; transdiagnostic group), recruited at an inpatient and outpatient unit of a clinic for children and adolescent psychiatry, psychotherapy, and psychosomatic therapy in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Germany), reported clinical diagnoses linked with emotional dysregulation (e.g., self-injury and depression). The second group (n = 12; control group), recruited in the district of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, had no pre-existing clinical diagnoses. (3) Results: The transdiagnostic group showed higher HR (b = 4.62, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and lower HRV (b = 10.20, <i>p</i> < 0.01) in SOLO than in Cyberball. They also reported increased negative affect (interaction b = -0.5, <i>p</i> < 0.01) after SOLO but not after Cyberball. In the control group, no differences in either HR (<i>p</i> = 0.34) or HRV (<i>p</i> = 0.08) between tasks were found. In addition, no difference in negative affect after either task (<i>p</i> = 0.83) was found. (4) Conclusion: SOLO could be an ecologically valid alternative to Cyberball when assessing reactions to ostracism in adolescents with emotional dysregulation."}, {"Title": "Contribution of Risk and Resilience Factors to Suicidality among Mental Health-Help-Seeking Adolescent Outpatients: A Cross-Sectional Study.", "Abstract": "Peer victimization is an established risk factor for youth suicidal thoughts and behavior (suicidality), yet most peer-victimized youth are not suicidal. More data are needed pertaining to factors that confer resilience to youth suicidality.\nTo identify resilience factors for youth suicidality in a sample of N = 104 (Mean age 13.5 years, 56% female) outpatient mental health help-seeking adolescents.\nParticipants completed self-report questionnaires on their first outpatient visit, including the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions, a battery of risk (peer victimization and negative life events) and resilience (self-reliance, emotion regulation, close relationships and neighborhood) measures.\n36.5% of participants screened positive for suicidality. Peer victimization was positively associated with suicidality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.84, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.95-8.62, <i>p</i> < 0.001), while an overall multi-dimensional measure of resilience factors was inversely associated with suicidality (OR, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.11-0.59, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Nevertheless, high peer victimization was found to be associated with a greater chance of suicidality across all levels of resilience (marked by non-significant peer victimization by resilience interaction, <i>p</i> = 0.112).\nThis study provides evidence for the protective association of resilience factors and suicidality in a psychiatric outpatient population.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the potential usefulness of NSFT in mental disorder diagnostics along with the determination of factors that may affect its results. The authors reviewed articles from 1977 onwards, focusing on the history, variety of methodologies, influencing factors, and proposed mechanisms underlying its performance. Research indicated that NSFT could be applicable in early intervention, staging in psychiatry, and the search for new therapeutic methods and drugs based on the mechanisms of NSFT action. The NSFT can contribute to defining an individualized diet for patients and prevent the development of damaging disease effects at an early stage. There is promising evidence for supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have a beneficial influence on the metabolic profile and are effective even in the subclinical phase of the disease. NSFT can contribute to the new classification of diseases and a better understanding of certain mental disorders' pathophysiology.

TD is a group of involuntary, irregular hyperkinetic movements, mainly in the muscles of the face, eyelid, lips, tongue, and cheeks, and less frequently in the limbs, neck, pelvis, and trunk. In some patients, TD takes on an extremely severe form, massively disrupting functioning and, moreover, causing stigmatization and suffering. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a method used, among others, in Parkinson's disease, is also an effective treatment for TD and often becomes a method of last resort, especially in severe, drug-resistant forms. The group of TD patients who have undergone DBS is still very limited. The procedure is relatively new in TD, so the available reliable clinical studies are few and consist mainly of case reports. Unilateral and bilateral stimulation of two sites has proven efficacy in TD treatment. Most authors describe stimulation of the globus pallidus internus (GPi); less frequent descriptions involve the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In the present paper, we provide up-to-date information on the stimulation of both mentioned brain areas. We also compare the efficacy of the two methods by comparing the two available studies that included the largest groups of patients. Although GPi stimulation is more frequently described in literature, our analysis indicates comparable results (reduction of involuntary movements) with STN DBS."}, {"Title": "Pharmacokinetic Markers of Clinical Outcomes in Severe Mental Illness: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "The term severe mental illness (SMI) encompasses those psychiatric disorders exerting the highest clinical burden and socio-economic impact on the affected individuals and their communities. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) approaches hold great promise in personalizing treatment selection and clinical outcomes, possibly reducing the burden of SMI. Here, we sought to review the literature in the field, focusing on PGx testing and particularly on pharmacokinetic markers. We performed a systematic review on PUBMED/Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus. The last search was performed on the 17 September 2022, and further augmented with a comprehensive pearl-growing strategy. In total, 1979 records were screened, and after duplicate removal, 587 unique records were screened by at least 2 independent reviewers. Ultimately, forty-two articles were included in the qualitative analysis, eleven randomized controlled trials and thirty-one nonrandomized studies. The observed lack of standardization in PGx tests, population selection, and tested outcomes limit the overall interpretation of the available evidence. A growing body of evidence suggests that PGx testing might be cost-effective in specific settings and may modestly improve clinical outcomes. More efforts need to be directed toward improving PGx standardization, knowledge for all stakeholders, and clinical practice guidelines for screening recommendations."}, {"Title": "The Impact of Health Education on the Quality of Life of Patients Hospitalized in Forensic Psychiatry Wards.", "Abstract": "An original health education program, developed for a group of patients of forensic psychiatry wards, was the basis for conducting a study on the impact of educational influences on the quality of life of patients long-term isolated from their natural environment. The main aim of the study was to answer the question: Does health education affect the quality of life of patients in forensic psychiatry wards and is educational activity effective?\nThe study was conducted at the State Hospital for Mental and Nervous Diseases in Rybnik, Poland, in the forensic psychiatry wards, and lasted from December 2019 to May 2020. During the study, patients gained knowledge in the field of broadly understood health education. The study group consisted of 67 men, aged 22-73, diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of double measurements (before and after the health education cycle) was applied, using the WHOQOL-BREF scale of quality of life and the first author's questionnaire of patients' knowledge, from the educational program used.\nHealth education does not significantly affect the overall quality of life of patients staying in forensic psychiatry wards, but it does affect their somatic condition. The proprietary health education program is effective because the patients' knowledge has significantly improved.\nThe quality of life of interned patients with schizophrenia is not significantly related to educational activities, however, psychiatric rehabilitation through educational activities effectively increases the level of patients' knowledge."}, {"Title": "Relationship of Psychological Flexibility and Mindfulness to Caregiver Burden, and Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms in Caregivers of People with Dementia.", "Abstract": "Caregivers of People with dementia (PwD) commonly experience burdens and other mental health issues, e.g., depression and anxiety.

Recent observational studies highlighted their potential detrimental effects on patients' mental health, but this topic remains understudied. This study investigated the effect of a common coercive practice, seclusion (i.e., being locked in a closed room), on mental health using a trial emulation of observational data to allow causal inference. We used data from 1200 psychiatric inpatients, classified as being either secluded or non-secluded during their hospital stay. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to emulate the random assignment to the intervention. The primary outcome was the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS). The secondary outcome was the first item of the HoNOS, which focuses on overactive, aggressive, disruptive, or agitated behavior. Both outcomes were assessed at hospital discharge. There was a significant effect of seclusion with increases in both total HoNOS score (<i>p</i> = .002) and item 1 of the HoNOS (<i>p</i> = .01).

Biomarkers are valuable because they can reveal the underlying mechanisms of symptoms and monitor treatment progress and may predict future risk of developing schizophrenia. Despite the existence of various promising biomarkers that relate to symptoms across the schizophrenia spectrum, and despite published recommendations encouraging multivariate metrics, they are rarely investigated simultaneously within the same individuals. In those with schizophrenia, the magnitude of purported biomarkers is complicated by comorbid diagnoses, medications and other treatments. Here, we argue three points. First, we reiterate the importance of assessing multiple biomarkers simultaneously. Second, we argue that investigating biomarkers in those with schizophrenia-related traits (schizotypy) in the general population can accelerate progress in understanding the mechanisms of schizophrenia. We focus on biomarkers of sensory and working memory in schizophrenia and their smaller effects in individuals with nonclinical schizotypy. Third, we note irregularities across research domains leading to the current situation in which there is a preponderance of data on auditory sensory memory and visual working memory, but markedly less in visual (iconic) memory and auditory working memory, particularly when focusing on schizotypy where data are either scarce or inconsistent. Together, this review highlights opportunities for researchers without access to clinical populations to address gaps in knowledge. We conclude by highlighting the theory that early sensory memory deficits contribute negatively to working memory and vice versa.

Investigating the underlying neurobiological effects of GCs may help to better understand the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders. GCs impact a plethora of neuronal processes at the genetic, epigenetic, cellular, and molecular levels. Given the scarcity and difficulty in accessing human brain samples, 2D and 3D <i>in vitro</i> neuronal cultures are becoming increasingly useful in studying GC effects. In this review, we provide an overview of <i>in vitro</i> studies investigating the effects of GCs on key neuronal processes such as proliferation and survival of progenitor cells, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, neuronal activity, inflammation, genetic vulnerability, and epigenetic alterations. Finally, we discuss the challenges in the field and offer suggestions for improving the use of <i>in vitro</i> models to investigate GC effects."}, {"Title": "Best practices for documentation of psychotropic drug-drug interactions in an adult psychiatric clinic.", "Abstract": "Psychotropic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) contribute to adverse drug events, but many go undetected or unmanaged.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the quality of and factors associated with documentation of DDIs in an adult psychiatric clinic run by postgraduate year 3 psychiatry residents (PGY3s).\nA list of high-alert psychotropic medications was identified by consulting primary literature on DDIs and clinic records. Charts of patients prescribed these medications by PGY3 residents from July 2021 to March 2022 were reviewed to detect potential DDIs and assess documentation. Chart documentation of DDIs was noted as none, partial, or complete.\nChart review identified 146 DDIs among 129 patients. Among the 146 DDIs, 65% were not documented, 24% were partially documented, and 11% had complete documentation. The percentage of pharmacodynamic interactions documented was 68.6% with 35.3% of pharmacokinetic interactions documented. Factors associated with partial or complete documentation included diagnosis of psychotic disorder (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.003), treatment with clozapine (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.02), treatment with benzodiazepine-receptor agonist (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.01), and assumption of care during July (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.04).

Emerging evidence confirms co-occurrence of mental health problems in this population is common, and mental health is often overlooked during rehabilitation for chronic physical conditions. For example, symptoms of depression and anxiety are frequently present in adolescents with physical disability such as spina bifida or Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and access to mental health services is often limited. Addressing mental health concerns for this age group is particularly critical as it encompasses a challenging transition to adulthood.\nBuilding upon findings from a recent scoping review on the co-occurrence of physical disabilities and mental health problems, this paper synthesizes scientific literature related to the organization and delivery of services for youth with co-occurring childhood-onset physical disabilities (e.g., cerebral palsy, spina bifida) and mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety).\nA scoping review protocol stemming from Arksey & O'Malley's framework and updated guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute was developed.

Two workstreams will run concurrently: (1) a realist synthesis of literature on living libraries, combined with stakeholder interviews, will produce several programme theories; theories will be developed collaboratively with an expert advisory group of stakeholders who have hosted or taken part in a living library and will form our initial analysis framework; a systematic search will identify literature about living libraries; data will be coded into our analysis framework, and we will use retroductive reasoning to explain living libraries' impacts across multiple contexts. Individual stakeholder interviews will help refine and test theories; (2) data from workstream 1 will inform 10 EBCD workshops with people with experience of managing mental health difficulties and health professionals to produce a LoLEM implementation guide; data from this process will also inform the theory in workstream 1.\nEthical approval was granted by Coventry and Warwick National Health Service Research Ethics Committee on 29 December 2021 (reference number 305975).

Despite its presence across a range of psychiatric disorders, the cognitive processes that give rise to anhedonia remain unclear.\nHere we examine whether anhedonia is associated with learning from positive and negative outcomes in patients diagnosed with major depression, schizophrenia and opiate use disorder alongside a healthy control group. Responses in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - a task associated with healthy prefrontal cortex function - were fitted to the Attentional Learning Model (ALM) which separates learning from positive and negative feedback.\nLearning from punishment, but not from reward, was negatively associated with anhedonia beyond other socio-demographic, cognitive and clinical variables. This impairment in punishment sensitivity was also associated with faster responses following negative feedback, independently of the degree of surprise.\nFuture studies should test the longitudinal association between punishment sensitivity and anhedonia also in other clinical populations controlling for the effect of specific medications.\nTogether the results reveal that anhedonic subjects, because of their negative expectations, are less sensitive to negative feedbacks; this might lead them to persist in actions leading to negative outcomes."}, {"Title": "[Reflexive groups with medical students from the mental health league as a strategy for change].", "Abstract": "This paper set out to present the outcomes of qualitative research conducted with medical students of a Mental Health and Psychiatry League (LASMP).

There was no significant correlation between NGAL and TNF-\u03b1 levels among schizophrenia and the control group.\nIn psychiatric diseases, especially schizophrenia, there may be differences in immune and inflammatory markers compared to the healthy population. After treatment, the NGAL levels of the patients at follow-up were reduced compared to the levels at admission. It can be thought that NGAL may be related to psychopathology in schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatment. This is the first follow-up study for NGAL levels in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Emergency care considerations for transgender and gender diverse youth: a review to improve health trajectories.", "Abstract": "Transgender and Gender Diverse (TGD) youth represent a growing subset of pediatric patients who are at increased risk for harmful health outcomes. Consideration of these risks during emergency encounters may decrease these undesired, sometimes fatal, adverse events.\nGender affirmative care of TGD youth is considered a basic healthcare right as noted by several academic societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the American Psychological Association [1-3] ( Table 1 ). Withholding gender affirmative care can lead to undesired health outcomes including but not limited to an increased incidence of mood disorders, self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, sexually transmitted diseases, and delayed presentations of treatable illness. TGD youth often access acute care settings, yet many feel apprehensive due to prior negative experiences or fear of discrimination. Practitioners are also often unaware as to how to effectively provide this type of healthcare.\nAcute care settings provide a unique and impactful environment to provide evidence-based, gender-affirming care that can make patients feel validated, mitigate future care avoidance, and minimize negative downstream health effects. In this review, we have consolidated high yield health considerations regarding TGD youth for acute care and emergency providers to deliver optimal care for this population."}, {"Title": "Work-related experiences of consultant psychiatrists during the COVID-19 response: qualitative analysis.", "Abstract": "Research has begun to draw attention to the challenges mental health professionals faced in delivering services during the COVID-19 pandemic response. However, few studies have examined the specific experiences of consultant psychiatrists.\nTo examine the work-related experiences and psychosocial needs of consultant psychiatrists situated in the Republic of Ireland arising from the COVID-19 response.\nWe interviewed 18 consultant psychiatrists and analysed data using inductive thematic analysis.\nWork-related experience of participants was characterised by increased workload associated with assumption of guardianship of physical and mental health of vulnerable patients. Unintended consequences of public health restrictions increased case complexity, limited availability of alternative supports and hindered the practice of psychiatry, including inhibiting peer support systems for psychiatrists. Participants perceived available psychological supports as generally unsuitable for their needs given their specialty. Long-standing under-resourcing, mistrust in management and high levels of burnout exacerbated the psychological burden of the COVID-19 response.\nThe challenges of leading mental health services were evident in the increased complexity involved in caring for vulnerable patients during the pandemic, contributing to uncertainty, loss of control and moral distress among participants. These dynamics worked synergistically with pre-existing system-level failures, eroding capacity to mount an effective response. The longer-term psychological well-being of consultant psychiatrists - as well as the pandemic preparedness of healthcare systems - is contingent on implementation of policies addressing long-standing under-investment in the services vulnerable populations rely on, not least community mental health services."}, {"Title": "A retrospective data analysis of psychiatric cases in Hargeisa, Somaliland between 2019 and 2020.", "Abstract": "In Somaliland, an estimated one person in every two households suffers from psychiatric disorders.

The homeless population has a higher burden of disease that includes psychiatric disorders. In addition, they have a lower use of ambulatory health services and a higher use of acute care. Few investigations analyze the use of services of this population group in the long term. We analyzed the risk of psychiatric readmission of homeless individuals through survival analysis. All admissions to a mental health hospitalization unit in the city of Malaga, Spain, from 1999 to 2005, have been analyzed. Three analyses were carried out: two intermediate analyses at 30 days and 1 year after starting follow-up; and one final analysis at 10 years. In all cases, the event was readmission to the hospitalization unit. The adjusted Hazard Ratio at 30 days, 1-year, and 10-year follow-ups were 1.387 (<i>p</i> = 0.027), 1.015 (<i>p</i> = 0.890), and 0.826 (<i>p</i> = 0.043), respectively. We have found an increased risk of readmission for the homeless population at 30 days and a decreased risk of readmission at 10 years. We hypothesize that this lower risk of long-term readmission may be due to the high mobility of the homeless population, its low degree of adherence to long-term mental health services, and its high mortality rate. We suggest that time-critical intervention programs in the short term could decrease the high rate of early readmission of the homeless population, and long-term interventions could link them with services and avoid its dispersion and abandonment."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based integration of yoga in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "Yoga has been put to test in clinical medicine to build evidence.

Among eight mGlu subtypes (mGlu1-8), mGlu8 has drawn increasing attention. This subtype is localized to the presynaptic active zone of neurotransmitter release and is among the mGlu subtypes with high affinity for glutamate. As a G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled autoreceptor, mGlu8 inhibits glutamate release to maintain homeostasis of glutamatergic transmission. mGlu8 receptors are expressed in limbic brain regions and play a pivotal role in modulating motivation, emotion, cognition, and motor functions. Emerging evidence emphasizes the increasing clinical relevance of abnormal mGlu8 activity. Studies using mGlu8 selective agents and knockout mice have revealed the linkage of mGlu8 receptors to multiple neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including anxiety, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and chronic pain. Expression and function of mGlu8 receptors in some limbic structures undergo long-lasting adaptive changes in animal models of these disorders, which may contribute to the remodeling of glutamatergic transmission critical for the pathogenesis and symptomatology of brain illnesses.

By any measure, it is among the most severe mental health problems occurring in young people, uniquely predicting debilitating current problems and acting as a 'gateway' to diverse and serious future problems. Yet, PD still struggles for legitimacy and parity of access to services, including early intervention.\nAddressing PD is fundamental to youth mental health, and early intervention for PD has reached 'proof of concept'. Yet, reform is hindered by bigotry and sectarianism. Successful early intervention calls for a shift in the culture of services, countering damaging myths, addressing bigotry, and fostering hope. Such reforms are well within the reach of youth mental health."}, {"Title": "Merging cultures and disciplines to create a drug discovery ecosystem at Virginia commonwealth university: Medicinal chemistry, structural biology, molecular and behavioral pharmacology and computational chemistry.", "Abstract": "The Department of Medicinal Chemistry, together with the Institute for Structural Biology, Drug Discovery and Development, at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) has evolved, organically with quite a bit of bootstrapping, into a unique drug discovery ecosystem in response to the environment and culture of the university and the wider research enterprise. Each faculty member that joined the department and/or institute added a layer of expertise, technology and most importantly, innovation, that fertilized numerous collaborations within the University and with outside partners. Despite moderate institutional support with respect to a typical drug discovery enterprise, the VCU drug discovery ecosystem has built and maintained an impressive array of facilities and instrumentation for drug synthesis, drug characterization, biomolecular structural analysis and biophysical analysis, and pharmacological studies. Altogether, this ecosystem has had major impacts on numerous therapeutic areas, such as neurology, psychiatry, drugs of abuse, cancer, sickle cell disease, coagulopathy, inflammation, aging disorders and others. Novel tools and strategies for drug discovery, design and development have been developed at VCU in the last five decades; e.g., fundamental rational structure-activity relationship (SAR)-based drug design, structure-based drug design, orthosteric and allosteric drug design, design of multi-functional agents towards polypharmacy outcomes, principles on designing glycosaminoglycans as drugs, and computational tools and algorithms for quantitative SAR (QSAR) and understanding the roles of water and the hydrophobic effect."}, {"Title": "Crime hierarchy, victimization and coping results of a qualitative study on the older incarcerated Person's mental health in Switzerland.", "Abstract": "Incarcerated persons rank themselves according to the crime they have committed. Due to which, those lower in this hierarchy (e.g., paedophiles) are bullied. The goal of this paper was to better knowledge on older incarcerated adults' experiences of crime and social hierarchy in prisons.\nOur results comprise data from 50 semi-structured interviews with older incarcerated persons. Data was assessed following thematic analysis.\nOur research showed that crime hierarchy occurs in prison and is recognized by older incarcerated individuals. Also, a social hierarchy based on various characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, education, language, mental health) is established within detention centres. This hierarchy is put forth by all persons deprived of liberty, but mostly by the ones at the bottom of the crime hierarchy, thus using it to portray themselves as better human beings than other incarcerated adults. They use the social hierarchy to cope with bullying whilst exhibiting coping mechanisms, such as the narcissistic facade. A concept we put forth as a novel idea.\nOur results show that crime hierarchy prevails in prison. Also, we explain the social hierarchy based on ethnicity, education, and other characteristics. Hence, being a victim of bullies, make lower-ranked (on the crime hierarchy) persons resort to social hierarchy to portray themselves as better individuals. This should not be considered as a personality disorder, but rather a narcissistic facade."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial Factors Associated with Substance Use among Secondary School Students in Ilorin, Nigeria.", "Abstract": "Adolescent substance use is a global concern. Identifying factors associated with it can help in preparing prevention programmes.\nThe objectives were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with substance use and the prevalence of associated psychiatric morbidity among secondary school students in Ilorin.\nInstruments used were a sociodemographic questionnaire, a modified WHO Students' Drug Use Survey Questionnaire, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) which was used to determine psychiatric morbidity, using a cut-off score of 3.\nSubstance use was associated with older age groups, male gender, parental substance use and poor relationship with parents, and urban location of school. Reported religiosity did not confer protection against substance use. The overall prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 22.1% (n= 442). Psychiatric morbidity was more common among users of opioids, organic solvents, cocaine and hallucinogens, with current opioid users having ten times the odds of psychiatric morbidity.\nFactors influencing adolescent substance use serve as a substrate for interventions. A good relationship with parents and teachers are protective factors, while parental substance use calls for holistic psychosocial support. The association of substance use with psychiatric morbidity highlights the need to incorporate behavioural treatment in substance use interventions."}, {"Title": "Treatment with Soteria-elements in acute psychiatry-Effectiveness for acutely ill and voluntarily treated patients.", "Abstract": "This article aims at evaluating the treatment outcomes of acute psychiatric patients before and after the implementation of Soteria-elements in an acute psychiatric ward.

This approach enabled the comparison of structural and conceptual reconstruction regarding treatment outcomes of all voluntarily treated acutely ill patients before (2016) and after (2019). A subgroup analysis focused on patients suffering from schizophrenia.\nUsing a pre-post design, the following parameters were examined: total treatment time, time in locked ward, time in open ward, antipsychotic discharge medication, re-admissions, discharge circumstances, and treatment continuation in day care clinic.\nCompared to 2016, there was no significant difference in the total time of stay in the hospital. However, data show a significant decrease of days spent in locked ward, a significant increase of days in open ward, a significant increase of treatment discontinuation but without an increase of re-admissions, and a significant interaction of diagnosis and year regarding the medication dosage, resulting altogether in a reduction of antipsychotic medication for patients suffering from schizophrenia spectrum disorder.\nThe implementation of Soteria-elements in an acute ward facilitates less potentially harmful treatments of psychotic patients, likewise enabling lower dosages of medication."}, {"Title": "The network approach: A path to decolonize mental health care.", "Abstract": "The violent colonial history of psychiatry in Africa prevents individuals from help-seeking. Because of this history, mental health care is now stigmatized, and clinical research, practice, and policy fail to capture the salient features of distress across African communities. If we are to transform mental health care for all, we must adopt decolonizing frameworks to ensure mental health research, practice, and policy are enacted in a manner that is ethical, democratic, critical, and serves the needs of local communities. Here, we present that the network approach to psychopathology as an invaluable tool in achieving this purpose. The network approach recognizes mental health disorders not as discrete entities, but rather as dynamic networks that are made of psychiatric symptoms (called <i>nodes</i>) and the relationships between these symptoms (called <i>edges</i>). This approach can pave a path to decolonizing mental health care by alleviating stigma, allowing context-based understanding of mental health and mental health problems, opening new avenues for (low-cost) mental health care and empowering local researchers to pioneer context-based knowledge production and treatment."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of undergraduate and second speciality mental health programmes in Peru: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "This study aims to describe the training offered and the availability of professionals required by the Ministry of Health for mental health problems management in the community.\nA cross-sectional study was carried out on the training offered in mental health in Peruvian universities.

SCD often accompanies with megaloblastic anemia. Psychiatric symptoms could be the initial manifestations of SCD by lack of Vitamin B12, but are rarely considered secondary to physical discomfort and psychological factors in SCD. Additionally, treatment experience for psychiatric symptoms in SCD remains little reported.\nWe presented a case of a 37-year-old female who complained of being persecuted and controlled for one week and thus was admitted to the psychiatry department. Before that, she had went through persistent paresthesia and numbness of her lower extremities for two-month. Low Vitamin B12 level and hemoglobin concentration, neurologic symptoms and bone marrow smear results supported the clinical diagnosis of SCD and megaloblastic anemia. With supplementation of Vitamin B12 and blood transfusion and short-term prescription of antipsychotics and antidepressants, physical symptoms were improved and psychological symptoms disappeared within 2\u00a0weeks.\nPsychiatric symptoms of SCD could be generated from lack of Vitamin B12, anemia and neurologic symptoms, where short-term use of antipsychotics and antidepressants may be effective."}, {"Title": "Examining the acceptability of actigraphic devices in children using qualitative and quantitative approaches: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Actigraphy is commonly used to record free living physical activity in both typically and atypically developing children.

As telemedicine becomes routine, understanding how specialty and diagnosis combine with demographics to impact telemedicine use will aid in addressing its current limitations.\nTo analyze the relationship between medical specialty, diagnosis, and telemedicine use, and their interplay with patient demographics in determining telemedicine usage patterns.\nWe extracted encounter and patient data of all adults who scheduled outpatient visits from June 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 from the electronic health record of an integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties. Extracted variables included medical specialty, primary visit diagnosis, visit modality (video, audio, or in-person), and patient age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity and 2013 rural-urban continuum code. Six specialties (General Surgery, Family Medicine, Gastroenterology, Oncology, General Internal Medicine, and Psychiatry) ranging from the lowest to the highest quartile of telemedicine use (video and audio) were chosen for analysis. Relative proportions of video, audio, and in-person modalities were compared. We examined diagnoses associated with the most and least frequent telemedicine use within each specialty. Finally, we analyzed associations between patient characteristics and telemedicine modality (video vs. audio/in-person, and video/audio vs. in-person) using a mixed-effects logistic regression model.\nA total of 2,494,296 encounters occurred during the study period, representing 420,876 unique patients (mean age: 44 years, standard deviation: 24 years, 54% female). Medical diagnoses requiring physical examination or minor procedures were more likely to be conducted in-person. Rural patients were more likely than urban patients to use video telemedicine in General Surgery and Gastroenterology and less likely to use video for all other specialties. Within most specialties, male patients and patients of nonwhite race were overall less likely to use video modality and video/audio telemedicine. In Psychiatry, members of several demographic groups used video telemedicine more commonly than expected, while in other specialties, members of these groups tended to use less telemedicine overall.\nMedical diagnoses requiring physical examination or minor procedures are more likely to be conducted in-person. Patient characteristics (age, sex, rural vs. urban, race/ethnicity) affect video and video/audio telemedicine use differently depending on medical specialty. These factors contribute to a unique clinical scenario which impacts perceived usefulness and accessibility of telemedicine to providers and patients, and are likely to impact rates of telemedicine adoption."}, {"Title": "Epigenetic changes in the CYP2D6 gene are related to severity of suicide attempt: A cross-sectional study of suicide attempters.", "Abstract": "The ability to accurately estimate risk of suicide deaths on an individual level remains elusive.\nThis study reports on a case-control study set-up from a well-characterized cohort of 88 predominantly female suicide attempters (SA), stratified into low- (n\u00a0=\u00a057) and high-risk groups (n\u00a0=\u00a031) based on reports of later death by suicide, as well as degree of intent-to-die and lethality of SA method.

Medical hypotheses from 1882 to 2016.", "Abstract": "Between 1882 and 2016, the medical literature offered a variety of etiologic hypotheses to explain Joan of Arc's voices, visions, and unwavering belief that she was the instrument of God. Although Joan lived from 1412 to 1431, there is extensive primary documentation of her life, including transcripts of her testimony during the Trial of Condemnation. Once this source material was compiled and made available, physician-authors began to theorize about Joan's neuropsychiatric symptoms in the context of her remarkable achievements. This article summarizes all papers written by physician-authors about Joan of Arc. The historical flow of diagnostic speculation in the medical literature reflects the cultural context in which it was produced as well as the emergence of novel ideas and new technologies in psychiatry, neurology, and neuropsychiatry. The early literature offered psychological theories and addressed the question of whether Joan was sane. The later literature focused on the possibility that Joan might have had epilepsy, with discussions of seizure etiology and possible cerebral focus, and also reflections on the purview of science as well as spirituality and the brain. This article offers the first comprehensive review of the medical literature about Joan of Arc, making this scholarship more accessible."}, {"Title": "The impact of receiving polygenic risk scores for alcohol use disorder on psychological distress, risk perception, and intentions to reduce drinking.", "Abstract": "For the return of polygenic risk scores to become an acceptable clinical practice in psychiatry, receipt of polygenic risk scores must be associated with minimal harm and changes in behavior that decrease one's risk for developing a psychiatric outcome. Data from a randomized controlled trial was used to assess the impact of different levels of hypothetical polygenic risk scores for alcohol use disorder on psychological distress, risk perception, and intentions to change drinking behaviors. The analytic sample consisted of 325 participants recruited from an urban, public university. Results demonstrated that there were significant increases in psychological distress as the level of genetic risk for alcohol use disorder increased. In addition, the perceived chance of developing alcohol use disorder significantly increased as the level of genetic risk increased. Promisingly, a greater proportion of participants indicated that they would intend to engage in follow-up behaviors, such as seeking additional information, talking to a healthcare provider about risk, and reducing drinking behaviors, as the level of genetic risk increased. Returning polygenic risk scores for alcohol use disorder in a clinical setting has the potential to promote risk-reducing behavior change, especially with increasing levels of genetic risk.

Substance use, even critical in scale, is perceived as masculine, just like hard (over-)work, while not seeking help. With the ongoing separation between gender and sex, masculine norms become more relevant also to females' mental health. The male depression concept highlights the role of male symptoms in affective disorders. However, the empirical evidence is still limited. Here, we use the denomination 'masculine depression' to open the category for female patients and tested substance use patterns, health services' utilization, and working hours as predictors in a case-control study of 163 depressed in-patients (44% women; masculine vs. non-masculine depression according to a median split of the Male Depression Rating Scale-22) and 176 controls (51% women). We assessed higher depression severity in patients with masculine (vs. non-masculine) depression. Masculine depression (vs. non-masculine depression and vs. no depression) was predicted by more frequent and critical use of alcohol (including binge drinking), tobacco, and illicit drugs, and by longer working times. Moreover, fewer health services contacts due to mental complaints during the previous year were associated with masculine (vs. non-masculine) depression. Alarmingly, even critical substance misuse was not significantly associated with more frequent health services contacts; however, the higher the depression severity, the more contacts the patients reported. Here, we provide evidence that patients with masculine depression are highly burdened and undertreated, which applies equally to female and male patients.

The participants were randomly assigned to read either a male or female case vignette. The vignettes were identical, except for the gender of the patient in the case. The primary and secondary outcomes were the respondents' opinions on the seriousness of the case and the degree to which the case's wish should be maintained, using sliding scales of 0-100. Results We included 560 laypersons and 585 psychiatrists. Neither cohort differed in most outcomes between the groups assigned to the male and female case vignettes. Among laypersons, the average score of seriousness was 58.8 in the female-vignette group and 58.6 in the male-vignette group (mean difference, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, -4.9 to 5.2). Among psychiatrists, the average score of seriousness was 53.9 in the female-vignette group and 53.7 in the male-vignette group (mean difference, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, -3.1 to 3.4).

The role of the peer supporter in these interventions, known as experts-by-experience (EbE), is situated between mutual peer support and semi-professional service delivery, and they face the challenge of balancing an asymmetric, professional relationship with a reciprocal, mutuality-based, equal relationship. This article investigates how EbEs tackle this challenge when responding to clients' stories about their personal, distressing experiences in peer-based groups in psychiatric services. The results show how the EbEs responded to their clients' experience-sharing with two types of turns of talk. In the first response type, the EbEs highlighted reciprocal experience-sharing, nudging the clients toward accepting their illness. This invoked mutual affiliation and more problem-talk from the clients. In the second response type, the EbEs compromised reciprocal experience-sharing and advised clients on how to accept their illness in their everyday lives. This was considered less affiliative in relation to the client's problem description, and the sequence was brought to a close. Both response types involved epistemic asymmetries that needed to be managed in the interaction. Based on our analysis, semi-professional, experience-based expertise involves constant epistemic tensions, as the participants struggle to retain the mutual orientation toward peer-based experience-sharing and affiliation."}, {"Title": "Systematic Review of Gender-Specific Child and Adolescent Mental Health Care.", "Abstract": "Gender differences in mental health emerge as early as in childhood and adolescence, highlighting the potential need for gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care. However, it is unclear how gender-specific child and adolescent mental health care is implemented and whether its' approaches are useful. Therefore, this study reviews gender-specific interventions and their effectiveness for child and adolescent mental health. Five databases were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2021. In total, 43 studies were included. Most interventions were conducted in school (n\u2009=\u200915) or community settings (n\u2009=\u20098). Substance-related disorders (n\u2009=\u200913) and eating disorders (n\u2009=\u200912) were addressed most frequently. Most interventions targeted girls (n\u2009=\u200931). Various gender-specific aspects were considered, including gender-specific risk and protective factors (n\u2009=\u200935) and needs (n\u2009=\u200935). Although most interventions yielded significant improvements in mental health outcomes (n\u2009=\u200932), only few studies reported medium or large effect sizes (n\u2009=\u200913). Additionally, there was a lack of strong causal evidence derived from randomized controlled trials, calling for more rigorous trials in the research field.

Therefore, policy and decision makers and mental health service planners can play an important role in suicide prevention. Although a number of suicide risk predictive tools have been developed, these tools were designed to be used by clinicians for assessing individual risk of suicide. There have been no risk predictive models to be used by policy and decision makers for predicting population risk of suicide at the national, provincial and regional levels. This paper aimed to describe the rationale and methodology for developing risk predictive models for population risk of suicide.\nA case-control study design will be used to develop sex-specific risk predictive models for population risk of suicide, using statistical regression and machine learning techniques. Routinely collected health administrative data in Quebec, Canada, and community-level social deprivation and marginalisation data will be used. The developed models will be transformed into the models that can be readily used by policy and decision makers. Two rounds of qualitative interviews with end-users and other stakeholders were proposed to understand their views about the developed models and potential systematic, social and ethical issues for implementation; the first round of qualitative interviews has been completed. We included 9440 suicide cases (7234 males and 2206 females) and 661\u2009780 controls for model development.

This has led to research to determine if exercise can serve as a potential therapeutic modality for major depressive disorder (MDD), which is a leading cause of mental-health impairment and overall disability worldwide. The strongest evidence to support this use comes from an increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have compared exercise to usual care, placebo controls, or established therapies in healthy adults and in various clinical populations. The relatively large number of RCTs has led to numerous reviews and meta-analyses, which generally have been concordant in indicating that exercise ameliorates depressive symptoms, improves self-esteem, and enhances various aspects of quality of life. Together, these data indicate that exercise should be considered as a therapeutic modality for improving CV health and psychological well-being. The emerging evidence also has led to a new proposed subspecialty of \"lifestyle psychiatry\", which promotes the use of exercise as an adjunctive treatment for patients with MDD. Indeed, some medical organizations have now endorsed lifestyle-based approaches as foundational aspects of depression management, with adoption of exercise as a treatment option for MDD. This review summarizes research in the area and provides practical suggestions for the use of exercise in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "The era of the Dawn of Mendelian research in the field of psychiatry: R\u00fcdin's 1922 review paper \"regarding the heredity of mental disturbances\".", "Abstract": "On September 27, 1922, Ernst R\u00fcdin gave an address to the Annual Conference of the German Society of Genetics entitled \"Regarding the Heredity of Mental Disturbances.\" Published in a 37-page article, R\u00fcdin reviewed the progress in the field of Mendelian psychiatric genetics, then hardly more than a decade old.

The shift is prompted by the realization that a one-size-fits all approach is inadequate to guide clinical care because people differ in ways that are not captured by broad diagnostic categories. One of the first steps in developing this personalized approach to treatment was the use of genetic markers to guide pharmacotherapeutics based on predictions of pharmacological response or non-response, and the potential risk of adverse drug reactions. Advances in technology have made a greater degree of specificity or precision potentially more attainable. To date, however, the search for precision has largely focused on biological parameters. Psychiatric disorders involve multi-level dynamics that require measures of phenomenological, psychological, behavioral, social structural, and cultural dimensions. This points to the need to develop more fine-grained analyses of experience, self-construal, illness narratives, interpersonal interactional dynamics, and social contexts and determinants of health. In this paper, we review the limitations of precision psychiatry arguing that it cannot reach its goal if it does not include core elements of the processes that give rise to psychopathological states, which include the agency and experience of the person. Drawing from contemporary systems biology, social epidemiology, developmental psychology, and cognitive science, we propose a cultural-ecosocial approach to integrating precision psychiatry with person-centered care."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrization, assertions of epistemic justice, and the question of agency.", "Abstract": "Thus far, the concept of epistemic injustice in the context of psychiatry has been discussed more widely by clinical academics than by authors with personal experience of psychiatrization. It is from the latter perspective that I critique the practice of attributing testimonial injustice solely to the \"stigma against mental illness\", and point to psychiatric diagnosing itself as a principal enabler and re-producer of this form of injustice. In relation to hermeneutical justice, I take a closer look at initiatives seeking to incorporate (collective) first-person knowledge into the epistemic systems that currently dominate mental-health service provision and research. Highlighting the incompatibility of psychiatric knowledge claims with first-person ways of knowing, I discuss some of the issues and challenges involved in achieving epistemic justice for psychiatrized people and advancing our collective knowledge base. Finally, I turn to the questions of identity and agency in these processes."}, {"Title": "Dynamical systems in computational psychiatry: A toy-model to apprehend the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms.", "Abstract": "These last years, scientific research focuses on the dynamical aspects of psychiatric disorders and their clinical significance. In this article, we proposed a theoretical framework formalized as a generic mathematical model capturing the heterogeneous individual evolutions of psychiatric symptoms. The first goal of this computational model based on differential equations is to illustrate the nonlinear dynamics of psychiatric symptoms. It offers an original approach to nonlinear dynamics to clinical psychiatrists.\nIn this study, we propose a 3+1 dimensions model (<i>x, y, z</i> + <i>f</i>) reproducing the clinical observations encountered in clinical psychiatry with: a variable modeling environmental noise (<i>z</i>) on the patient's internal factors (<i>y</i>) with its temporal specificities (<i>f</i>) and symptomatology (<i>x</i>). This toy-model is able to integrate empirical or simulated data from the influence of perceived environmental over time, their potential importance on the internal and subjective patient-specific elements, and their interaction with the apparent intensity of symptoms.\nConstrained by clinical observation of case formulations, the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms is studied through four main psychiatric conditions were modeled: i) a healthy situation, ii) a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving following an outbreak (i.e., schizophrenia spectrum), iii) a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving by kindling and bursts (e.g., bipolar and related disorders); iv) and a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving due to its high susceptibility to the environment (e.g., spersistent complex bereavement disorder). Moreover, we simulate the action of treatments on different psychiatric conditions.\nWe show that the challenges of dynamical systems allow to understand the interactions of psychiatric symptoms with environmental, descriptive, subjective or biological variables. Although this non-linear dynamical model has limitations (e.g., explanatory scope or discriminant validity), simulations provide at least five main interests for clinical psychiatry, such as a visualization of the potential different evolution of psychiatric disorders, formulation of clinical cases, information about attracting states and bifurcations, or the possibility of a nosological refinement of psychiatric models (e.g., staging and symptom network models)."}, {"Title": "[Features of the reward-based decision-making in patients with alcohol use disorders].", "Abstract": "Foreign studies increasingly emphasize the role of reward-based cognitive decision-making and its contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Unfortunately, such studies are extremely few in Russia. Given the importance of the insufficiency of cognitive functions, primarily the decision-making process based on reward, among the risk factors of addictive pathology, increasing the severity of alcoholism, reducing the effectiveness of its therapy and rehabilitation, research in this direction is extremely relevant. This review summarizes and systematizes current data on the features of the cognitive decision-making process based on reward in patients with alcohol dependence. An analysis of the literature has shown that reward-based decision making is an important component of addictive behavior. Patients with alcohol dependence, as well as people, who abuse alcohol, demonstrate clear impairment of this cognitive function. Thus, the relative value of diagnosing disorders in decision-making in modern psychiatry is beyond doubt. It is recommended to include the above tests in the diagnostic complex of a psychiatrist, along with standard psychometric tools."}, {"Title": "[Borderline regions between neurology and psychiatry, focusing particularly on the functional neurological disorders].", "Abstract": "Neurology in Japan did not develop from the separation of neuropsychiatry into neurology and psychiatry, which casts a shadow on the present situation of Japanese neurology.

Here, we use examples from psychiatric epidemiological studies conducted during the COVID-19 era to reflect on errors driven by overlooking specific major methodological advances of modern epidemiology. We focus on (i) use of non-representative sampling in online surveys, which limit the potential knowledge to be gained from descriptive studies and amplify collider stratification bias in causal studies; and (ii) failure to acknowledge multiple versions of exposures (e.g., lockdown, school closure) and differences in prevalence of effect measure modifiers across contexts, which cause violations of the consistency assumption and lack of effect transportability. We finish by highlighting (i) the heterogeneity of psychiatric epidemiological results during the pandemic across place and sociodemographic groups and over time; (ii) the importance of following the foundational advancements of modern epidemiology even in emergency settings; and (iii) the need to limit the role of political agendas in cherry-picking and reporting epidemiological evidence."}, {"Title": "Self-injury and suicidal behavior in children and youth population: Learning from the pandemic.", "Abstract": "Suicidal behaviour and self-harm are increasing in children and adolescents.

This study has revealed the severe and adverse impact of mental health problems across all of the four domains of reproductive health and family planning, which the questions specifically targeted. Based on these results, we recommend discussing family planning with all patients experiencing or at risk for mental health problems and their partners. These discussions should address a desire to have children, (involuntary) childlessness, uncertainties about parenting and sexuality, while remaining considerate of experienced taboos."}, {"Title": "The Influence of Insecure Attachment to Parents on Adolescents' Suicidality.", "Abstract": "Insecure attachment has been identified as a risk factor for adolescent psychopathology and, consequently, for suicidal behavior. We aimed to highlight the relationship between the attachment styles of adolescents and their suicidal behavior and to investigate the role of each parent in the suicidality pathway of adolescents. The sample consisted of 217 adolescent inpatients who were at the highest risk for suicidal behavior and who were hospitalized in the Unit for Intensive Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Self-report questionnaires assessing their attachment to their parents, their acquired capability for attempting suicide, their suicidality, and a number of traumatic life events were administered. The results showed a higher level of attachment avoidance rather than attachment anxiety among the most at-risk adolescents. An acquired capability for suicide (ACS) mediated the positive correlation between adolescents' attachment avoidance in relation to the mother or father and their suicidality. The suppressive mediating effect of an ACS on the association between attachment anxiety in relation to the father and suicidality was detected. The odds ratio for attempted suicide was more than two times higher for adolescents who were insecurely attached to their father compared to adolescents who were insecurely attached to their mother. Our results confirmed the importance of attachment, especially paternal attachment, in developing suicidality during adolescence. Preventive and clinical interventions should target these important domains with the aim of decreasing suicidality among adolescents."}, {"Title": "Traumatic Childbirth Experience and Childbirth-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Contemporary Overview.", "Abstract": "With this manuscript we provide an overview of the prevalence, symptoms, risk factors, screening, support, and treatment for women with a traumatic childbirth experience or childbirth-related PTSD.

In addition, it evaluates the experiences of the students using this model in clinical practice.\nIn this interventional study, 19 students were taught critical thinking skills using the OPT clinical reasoning model during a psychiatry clinical practice. Work-learning forms were used in daily 1 h individual and group discussions with students. The critical thinking disposition scale was completed by every student before and after the intervention. Moreover, the students were asked to the complete reflection experience forms.\nThe average critical thinking disposition pre-intervention score was 95.21, whereas the average post-intervention score was 97.05, indicating an increase of 1.84. There was a significant increase in the fourth dimension of open-mindedness (z = -2.80, <i>p</i> < 0.01). The learning experience has been likened to a process of clearing the fog, and it involves the use of limited known conditions, thinking outside the box, and adaptation to complex care issues.\nUsing the OPT clinical reasoning model as a teaching strategy during a psychiatric nursing internship significantly improved the open-mindedness dimension among the students.

An estimated 44% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not respond to two consecutive antidepressant therapies, and 33% do not respond to up to four antidepressants. Over 15% of all patients with MDD remain refractory to any treatment intervention. rTMS is considered a treatment option for patients with TRD. Likewise, iCBT is evidence-based, symptom-focused psychotherapy recommended for the treatment of TRD. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to evaluate the initial comparative clinical effectiveness of rTMS treatment with and without iCBT as an innovative intervention for the treatment of participants diagnosed with TRD. <b>Methods:</b> This study is a prospective two-arm randomized controlled trial. Overall, 78 participants diagnosed with TRD were randomized to one of two treatment interventions: rTMS sessions alone and rTMS sessions plus iCBT. Participants in each group were made to complete evaluation measures at baseline, and 6 weeks (discharge) from treatment. The primary outcome measure was baseline to six weeks change in mean score for the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD-17). Secondary outcomes included mean baseline to six-week changes in the Columbia suicide severity rating scale (CSSRS) for the rate of suicidal ideations, the QIDS-SR16 for subjective depression, and the EQ-5D-5L to assess the quality of health in participants. <b>Results:</b> A majority of the participants were females 50 (64.1%), aged \u2265 40 39 (50.0%), and had college/university education 54 (73.0%).

However, the change of serum BDNF during pharmacotherapy remains obscure in MDD. In particular, the changes in serum BDNF associated with pharmacotherapy have not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to compare the changes in serum BDNF concentrations in first-episode, drug-naive patients with MD treated with antidepressants between treatment-response and treatment-nonresponse groups. The study included 35 inpatients and outpatients composed of 15 males and 20 females aged 36.7 \u00b1 6.8 years at the Department of Psychiatry of our University Hospital. All patients met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for MD. The antidepressants administered included paroxetine, duloxetine, and escitalopram.

Responders were defined as those whose total HAMD scores at 8 weeks had decreased by 50% or more compared to those before drug administration, while non-responders were those whose total HAMD scores had decreased by less than 50%. Here we showed that serum BDNF levels were not significantly different at any point between the two groups. The responder group, but not the non-responder group, showed statistically significant changes in serum BDNF 0 and serum BDNF 8.

Cognitive deficits have been closely linked to alterations in early auditory processes (EAP) that occur in auditory cortical areas. Preliminary evidence indicates that cognitive deficits in schizophrenia can be improved with a reliable and safe non-invasive brain stimulation technique called tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). However, a significant proportion of patients derive no cognitive benefits after tDCS treatment. Furthermore, the neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive changes after tDCS have been poorly explored in trials and are thus still unclear.\nThe study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm parallel-group, sham-controlled, multicenter trial. Sixty participants with recent-onset schizophrenia and cognitive impairment will be randomly allocated to receive either active (n=30) or sham (n=30) tDCS (20-min, 2-mA, 10 sessions during 5 consecutive weekdays). The anode will be placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the left auditory cortex. Cognition, tolerance, symptoms, general outcome and EAP (measured with EEG and multimodal MRI) will be assessed prior to tDCS (baseline), after the 10 sessions, and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the number of responders, defined as participants demonstrating a cognitive improvement \u2265Z=0.5 from baseline on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery total score at 1-month follow-up. Additionally, we will measure how differences in EAP modulate individual cognitive benefits from active tDCS and whether there are changes in EAP measures in responders after active tDCS.\nBesides proposing a new fronto-temporal tDCS protocol by targeting the auditory cortical areas, we aim to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with follow-up assessments up to 3 months. In addition, this study will allow identifying and assessing the value of a wide range of neurobiological EAP measures for predicting and explaining cognitive deficit improvement after tDCS. The results of this trial will constitute a step toward the use of tDCS as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of cognitive impairment in recent-onset schizophrenia.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05440955.

Unfortunately, they are difficult to detect, particularly the challenging neurotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN). The aim of this study was twofold: First, to develop a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method (LC-MS) for simultaneous targeted quantification of key kynurenine metabolites together with untargeted metabolomics, and second, to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by exploring serum/plasma and gender differences in 120 healthy young adults between 18 and 30 years of age. A range of analytical columns (C18 and biphenyl columns) and mobile phases (acidic and alkaline) were systematically evaluated. The optimized LC-MS method was based on a biphenyl column, a water-methanol gradient with 0.2% formic acid, and authentic isotope-labeled standards for each kynurenine metabolite. Precision and accuracy of targeted quantification of the key kynurenine metabolites tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and QUIN were excellent, far exceeding the acceptance criteria specified by international guidelines. Median inter- and intra-day precision were <\u00a06% in serum and plasma; the median accuracy was 2.4% in serum and 8% in plasma. Serum concentrations were \u2264\u00a010% different from the corresponding concentrations in plasma for all kynurenine metabolites in healthy young adults. Men had higher levels (8-18%) of TRP, KYN, and KYNA than women (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.009), while no differences were observed for 3-HK and QUIN (p\u00a0>\u00a00.70). Incurred sample reanalysis of 10% of the samples yielded a median difference <\u00a05% from the initial measurement, demonstrating the robustness of the method. Besides the targeted quantification of key kynurenine metabolites, our method was found to be suitable for simultaneous untargeted metabolomics analyses of hundreds of metabolites. A range of compound classes could be detected including amino acids, nucleic acids, dipeptides, antioxidants, and acylcarnitines, making explorative studies highly feasible. For example, we identified an additional kynurenine metabolite, 2-Quinolinecarboxylic acid, which was 47% higher in males than females (adjusted p-value = 0.001). In conclusion, in this study, we present a reliable and robust LC-MS method for simultaneous targeted and untargeted metabolomics ready for both research and clinical use. We show that both serum and plasma can be used for kynurenine studies, and the reported gender differences are in accordance with the literature.

Strategies to create a less restrictive environment within psychiatric facilities are therefore eagerly sought. Peer support workers (PSWs) are increasingly employed in mental health settings. The prevailing theory is that PSWs have the potential to contribute to conflict and restraint prevention efforts in acute psychiatric wards. However, to date, research in support of this claim remains limited.\nThe present study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of employing peer support workers with regard to reducing the use of restraint.\nThis prospective controlled pre-post study sought to evaluate the implementation of peer support in one locked ward compared to treatment as usual (TAU) with no implementation of peer support in a second locked ward of a psychiatry department in Berlin, Germany. The pre-post comparison was planned to consist of two assessment periods of 3\u2009months each, taking place directly before and after peer support implementation or TAU. Both assessments were extended to a period of 6\u2009months, before and after the initially planned 12-month implementation process, in order to balance the effects of disruptions and of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using routine data, the proportion, frequency, and duration of mechanical restraint, forced medication as well as mechanical restraint in combination with forced medication, were evaluated.\nIn the control group, an increase in the proportion of patients subjected to measures of restraint was found between pre- and post-assessment, which was accompanied by a further increase in the mean number of events of restraint per patient within this group. In the intervention group, no significant change in the application of restraint was observed during the study period.\nThere is some indication that peer support may be protective with regard to restraint in acute wards. However, our study faced major challenges during the implementation process and the post-assessment period, such as COVID-19 and staff reorganization. This may have led to peer support not reaching its full potential. The relationship between the implementation of peer support and the use of restraint therefore merits further investigation."}, {"Title": "Health Anxiety by Proxy Disorder: A Case Report.", "Abstract": "Health anxiety by proxy (HAP) is a newly introduced term in psychiatry to describe the anxious feelings or fear of having or acquiring a serious illness. It is often accompanied by maladaptive illness behavior in the absence of true somatic symptoms. This, in turn, entails seeking medical advice and therefore doing many unnecessary investigations in an attempt to justify these symptoms. Functional impairment may appear in HAP patients, and this indicates a pathological point.\u00a0To some extent, it can be said that HAP is similar to health anxiety disorder in terms of symptomatology and items. However, it is imposed on another (usually the patients' children) instead of the patient himself. Many biopsychosocial factors are suggested to play a role in the psychopathology of HAP. Until now, there are no well-established criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) or\u00a0International Classification of Diseases 11<sup>th</sup>\u00a0Revision (ICD-11) to make the diagnosis of health anxiety by proxy. Although treatment protocols are missing, it appears that patients are not responding to treatment protocols for illness anxiety disorder. This requires focusing attention on conducting studies on those patients to develop clear treatment plans to help patients. In this report, we present a 28-year-old female with constant worries about her child's health, which subsequently resulted in seeking medical advice at multiple clinics with different medical specialties. Many factors were thought to be implicated in triggering her current condition. The anxious feelings reflected negatively on the patient's life, resulting in a poor functioning status. A treatment plan was initiated with a dismal response and fluctuating course.\u00a0Additionally, we discussed the initial definition and the bases that could be used to facilitate the diagnosis and management of HAP disorder."}, {"Title": "Machine learning prediction will be part of future treatment of depression.", "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is changing the way that medicine is practiced. While already clinically utilised in diagnostic radiology and outcome prediction in intensive care unit, ML approaches in psychiatry remain nascent. Implementing ML algorithms in psychiatry, particularly in the treatment of depression, is significantly more challenging than other areas of medicine in part because of the less demarcated disease nosology and greater variability in practice. Given the current exiguous capacity of clinicians to predict patient and treatment outcomes in depression, there is a significantly greater need for better predictive capability. Early studies have shown promising results. ML predictions were significantly better than chance within the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) trial (accuracy 64.6%, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) and combining medications to enhance depression outcomes (COMED) randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) (accuracy 59.6%, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.043), with similar results found in larger scale, retrospective studies. The greater flexibility and dimensionality of ML approaches has been demonstrated in studies incorporating diverse input variables including electroencephalography scans, achieving 88% accuracy for treatment response, and cognitive test scores, achieving up to 72% accuracy for treatment response. The predicting response to depression treatment (PReDicT) trial tested ML informed prescribing of antidepressants against standard therapy and found there was both better outcomes for anxiety and functional endpoints despite the algorithm only having a balanced accuracy of 57.5%. Impeding the progress of ML algorithms in psychiatry are pragmatic hurdles, including accuracy, expense, acceptability and comprehensibility, and ethical hurdles, including medicolegal liability, clinical autonomy and data privacy. Notwithstanding impediments, it is clear that ML prediction algorithms will be part of depression treatment in the future and clinicians should be prepared for their arrival."}, {"Title": "Use of mental health services in the aftermath of COVID-19 waves: a retrospective study conducted in a French Psychiatric and Neurosciences University Hospital.", "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictive measures taken to prevent its propagation had profound effects on mental health and well-being, especially in children and young adults (<25 years old).

Natural disasters are particularly associated with an increase in the prevalence of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. Indirect consequences of climate change, such as food shortages, economic crises, violent conflicts and forced migration, additionally represent severe psychological risk and stress factors. Climate anxiety and solastalgia, the distress induced by environmental change, are new psychological syndromes in the face of the existential threat posed by the climate crisis. Accordingly, a\u00a0sustainable psychiatry must prepare for increasing and changing demands. The principles of psychiatric treatment need to focus more on prevention to reduce the overall burden on the healthcare system. Waste of resources and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in psychiatric treatment processes as well as infrastructure must be perceived and prevented. Psychiatric education, training and continuing education concepts should be expanded to include the topic of climate change in order to comprehensively inform and sensitize professionals, those affected and the public and to encourage climate-friendly and health-promoting behavior.

Among the minority groups that may be vulnerable to experiencing greater risks for their physical and mental health and full development is the migrant population. The mobile population's migration experience, from their place of origin to destination translates into psychosocial problems and clearly stressful conditions which could be resolved using certain coping strategies. Accordingly, numerous epidemiological studies have found differences in the prevalence of mental health problems between migrants and native-born residents of destination countries, as well as between migrants and their non-migrant co-nationals.\nTo describe sociodemographic characteristics of the Latino migrant population in the United States who visited the Health Windows (HW) and Mobile Health Units (MHU) in 2021, who may have been at risk for mental, neurological or substance use disorders and agreed to a screening for signs and symptoms of mental health conditions.\nUsers of the HW and MHU were offered preventive health services and completed a mental health screening. These variables were registered in SICRESAL. If their results showed signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, they were screened by credentialed professionals from the Psychology Faculty of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Screened individuals received a diagnosis and specialized care remotely and/or online with the MHU and HW network partners.

Further, 59% were women with an average age of 43, ranging from 7 to 86 years of age. Twenty percent 20% of the population who voluntarily agreed to screening yielded a positive result for some type of mental health symptom or problem. This percentage (37%) was greater among those who consulted MHU. With respect to age, results showed that youth were at greatest risk for mental health problems.

Thus, these symptoms relate to being a female aged between 18 and 38 and originating from Mexico. Finally, the possibility of screening the migrant population for signs and symptoms of mental health conditions that attended the Health Windows or Mobile Health Units during 2021, made it possible to refer them to psychology or psychiatry services and improve the quality of life of those who accessed the services and, consequently, that of their families and communities.\nThe main limitation is associated with the information source since we worked with secondary data and relied on the information provided by those who attended both the HW and the MHU."}, {"Title": "Contribution of parental health to the subsequent social assistance entry of the family with children: a nationwide register-linked birth cohort study in Finland.", "Abstract": "AimOur aim in this paper was to estimate the contribution of different parental specialised health care diagnoses to the subsequent risk of entry into the social assistance system for families with children in the period 1998-2013.\nWe used longitudinal population-level register data consisting of all children born in 1997 in Finland and their registered parents (54 960 one and two-parent families with 801 336 observations in the period 1998-2013).

Parent psychiatric diagnoses were linked to a higher, 3.01-fold risk of social assistance entry. Covariate adjustment reduced these risk ratios to 1.2 and 2.1, respectively. Some 2.9% of all social assistance entries may be attributed to parental psychiatric diagnoses while somatic health records account for another 7.2%, making their total contribution over 1/10th of all cases.\nParental specialised healthcare records were associated with a higher risk of social assistance need.

This could motivate a critical public to demand improved treatment facilities for persons with mental illness. Instead, the media and a critical public tend to repeat a traditional critique of psychiatry, which was articulated before psychiatry reform in the 1970s and which tends to romanticize or neglect mental illness. The replication of this traditional critique of psychiatry today has an ideological function: it reassures a neoliberal public that it is emancipated from traditional authoritarian patterns of dominance, rejects demands for increased funding of mental health treatment facilities, and emphasizes individual autonomy at the price of blaming the victims for homelessness and social impoverishment."}, {"Title": "[On the way to democracy-The transformation process 1990/1991 and the role of the Association for Psychiatry and Neurology in the GDR].", "Abstract": "The transition from socialist dictatorship to liberal democracy in the GDR was associated with political and social upheaval.

Clinicians are familiar with its effects: mute patients can speak again, akinetic patients can move again and patients with negativism can eat and drink again within usually a short duration of about 10\u00a0min to 1-2\u00a0h. Fear is often gone after lorazepam administration. While not always effective, the introduction of lorazepam into clinical practice represented a breakthrough and was often life-saving for many patients suffering from catatonia. It is rare to observe such rapid therapeutic effects in other domains of psychiatry. In this narrative review we will briefly look at the past, present and future of lorazepam in the treatment of catatonia. It is gratifying to reflect on the fact that clinicians using the age-old medical practice of observation and empirical treatment succeeded in advancing the management of catatonia 40\u00a0years ago. The present evidence shows that the clinical effect of lorazepam in catatonia treatment is excellent and more or less immediate although it remains to be explicitly tested against other substances such as diazepam, zolpidem, clozapine, quetiapine, amantadine, memantine, valproate and dantrolene in randomized clinical trials. In addition, future studies need to answer the question how long lorazepam should be given to patients with catatonia, months or even years?

Among these, the TaqIA polymorphism is one of the most commonly studied in psychiatry. TaqIA is located in the gene that codes for the ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 kinase (Ankk1) near the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor (D2R) gene. Homozygous expression of the A1 allele correlates with a 30% to 40% reduction of striatal D2R, a typical feature of addiction, overeating, and other psychiatric pathologies. The mechanisms by which the variant influences dopamine signaling and behavior are unknown.\nHere, we used transgenic and viral-mediated strategies to reveal the role of Ankk1 in the regulation of activity and functions of the striatum.\nWe found that Ankk1 is preferentially enriched in striatal D2R-expressing neurons and that Ankk1 loss of function in the dorsal and ventral striatum leads to alteration in learning, impulsivity, and flexibility resembling endophenotypes described in A1 carriers. We also observed an unsuspected role of Ankk1 in striatal D2R-expressing neurons of the ventral striatum in the regulation of energy homeostasis and documented differential nutrient partitioning in humans with or without the A1 allele.\nOverall, our data demonstrate that the Ankk1 gene is necessary for the integrity of striatal functions and reveal a new role for Ankk1 in the regulation of body metabolism."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry practitioners' views on accessing aftercare and psychological therapies for patients who present to hospital following self-harm: multi-site interview study.", "Abstract": "Timely provision of aftercare following self-harm may reduce risks of repetition and premature death, but existing services are frequently reported as being inadequate.\nTo explore barriers and facilitators to accessing aftercare and psychological therapies for patients presenting to hospital following self-harm, from the perspective of liaison psychiatry practitioners.\nBetween March 2019 and December 2020, we interviewed 51 staff members across 32 liaison psychiatry services in England.

Clinical severity stage of CMC joint arthritis has not been correlated with the pain level of the patient. Recently, the association of joint pain with patient psychological factor, such as depression or case-specific personality, has been investigated. This study was designed to determine the impact of psychological factors to residual pain after treatment of CMC joint arthritis, using pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) and the Yatabe-Guilford (YG) personality test. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-six patients (7 males and 19 females) with 26 hands were included. Thirteen patients classified as Eaton stage 3 underwent suspension arthroplasty and 13 patients as Eaton stage 2 underwent conservative treatment using a custom fitted orthosis. Clinical evaluation was assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire Score (QuickDASH) at initial evaluation, at 1 month and at 3 months after treatment. We compared both groups using the PCS and YG test. <b>Results:</b> The PCS showed significant difference in the VAS scores only at initial evaluation in both surgical and conservative treatment. There was a significant difference in VAS at 3 months between the two groups in both surgical and conservative treatment and in QuickDASH at 3 months in conservative treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> The YG test has been used mainly in psychiatry. Although this test has not yet been used worldwide, its usefulness has been recognised and applied clinically, especially in Asia. Patient characteristics are strongly associated with residual pain of the CMC joint arthritis of the thumb.

Much of the debate, however, may be based on a misconception of what financial incentives are and what their purpose is. Financial incentives are not meant to influence informed consent about treatment decisions, but to bridge the gap between intentions and behaviour and help patients achieve adherence to a treatment that they have agreed to. In this context, patients' positive views may reflect that the use of financial incentives can support a good therapeutic relationship rather than undermine it."}, {"Title": "Perspectives on reasons for suicidal behaviour and recommendations for suicide prevention in Kenya: qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the reasons for suicidal behaviour in Africa, and communities' perception of suicide prevention. A contextualised understanding of these reasons is important in guiding the implementation of potential suicide prevention interventions in specific settings.\nTo understand ideas, experiences and opinions on reasons contributing to suicidal behaviour in the Coast region of Kenya, and provide recommendations for suicide prevention.\nWe conducted a qualitative study with various groups of key informants residing in the Coast region of Kenya, using in-depth interviews. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and translated from the local language before thematic inductive content analysis.\nFrom the 25 in-depth interviews, we identified four key themes as reasons given for suicidal behaviour: interpersonal and relationship problems, financial and economic difficulties, mental health conditions and religious and cultural influences. These reasons were observed to be interrelated with each other and well-aligned to the suggested recommendations for suicide prevention. We found six key recommendations from our thematic content analysis: (a) increasing access to counselling and social support, (b) improving mental health awareness and skills training, (c) restriction of suicide means, (d) decriminalisation of suicide, (e) economic and education empowerment and (f) encouraging religion and spirituality.\nThe reasons for suicidal behaviour are comparable with high-income countries, but suggested prevention strategies are more contextualised to our setting. A multifaceted approach in preventing suicide in (coastal) Kenya is warranted based on the varied reasons suggested.

The identification of shared fMRI brain signatures of genetically and pharmacologically induced NMDAR dysfunction may help to define biomarkers for patient stratification. NMDAR-related genetic and pharmacological effects on functional connectivity were investigated by integrating three different datasets: (A) resting state fMRI data from 146 patients with schizophrenia genotyped for the disease-associated genetic variant rs7191183 of GRIN2A (encoding the NMDAR 2\u2009A subunit) as well as 142 healthy controls. (B) Pharmacological effects of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine and the GABA-A receptor agonist midazolam were obtained from a double-blind, crossover pharmaco-fMRI study in 28 healthy participants. (C) Regional gene expression profiles were estimated using a postmortem whole-brain microarray dataset from six healthy donors. A strong resemblance was observed between the effect of the genetic variant in schizophrenia and the ketamine versus midazolam contrast of connectivity suggestive for an associated E/I-imbalance. This similarity became more pronounced for regions with high density of NMDARs, glutamatergic neurons, and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. From a functional perspective, increased connectivity emerged between striato-pallido-thalamic regions and cortical regions of the auditory-sensory-motor network, while decreased connectivity was observed between auditory (superior temporal gyrus) and visual processing regions (lateral occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, cuneus). Importantly, these imaging phenotypes were associated with the genetic variant, the differential effect of ketamine versus midazolam and schizophrenia (as compared to healthy controls). Moreover, the genetic variant was associated with language-related negative symptomatology which correlated with disturbed connectivity between the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and the superior lateral occipital cortex. Shared genetic and pharmacological functional connectivity profiles were suggestive of E/I-imbalance and associated with schizophrenia. The identified brain signatures may help to stratify patients with a common molecular disease pathway providing a basis for personalized psychiatry."}, {"Title": "How subjective well-being, patient-reported clinical improvement (PROMs) and experience of care (PREMs) relate in an acute psychiatric care setting?", "Abstract": "Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) are increasingly acknowledged as critical tools for enhancing patient-centred, value-based care.

Subjective well-being was assessed using standardized generic PROMs on well-being, symptom improvement was assessed using standardized disease-specific PROMs, and experience of care using PREMs. PROMs were completed at admission and discharge, PREMs were completed at discharge.

Recent meta-analyses with 50,000-70000 participants noted the increase in anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness in the general population.1 Patients with pre-existing mental disorders were a vulnerable group at high risk of deterioration.1,2 As part of the measures to combat the pandemic, the operation of mental health services was reduced, the access to them became more difficult and the provision of supportive and psychotherapeutic interventions continued through telepsychiatry.2 Of particular interest is the study of the impact of the pandemic on patients with personality disorders (PD).3 These patients experience severe difficulties related to interpersonal relationships and identity, which lie at the basis of intense affective and behavioral manifestations.4,5 Most studies on the impact of the pandemic on patients with personality pathology have focused on borderline personality disorder (BPD).6 Social distancing measures during the pandemic and increased sense of loneliness are serious aggravating factors for patients with BPD and may cause anxieties of abandonment and rejection, social withdrawal, and feelings of emptiness. Consequently, the patients' susceptibility to risky behaviors and substance use increases.3,7 The anxieties caused by the condition, as well as the feeling of not being in control of the situation by the subject, may mobilize paranoid ideation in patients with BPD, which further exacerbates the difficulties in their interpersonal relationships.7 In a Nordic multicenter study of 1120 outpatients with PD during the first wave of the pandemic, results showed an increase in anxiety, depression, aggression, substance use, social isolation and a decrease in work activity, while the rates of suicidal behaviors remained the same.8 On the other hand, for some patients the restricted exposure to interpersonal triggers could lead to amelioration of symptoms.7 Several papers have studied the number of visits of patients with PD or patients with self-harm to hospital emergency departments during the pandemic.6,9 In the studies that examined self-injury, the psychiatric diagnosis was not recorded, but they are mentioned here because the presence of self-harm is closely associated with PD.10 The number of emergency department visits of patients with PD or self-harm was found to be increased in some papers, decreased in others, and stable in others, compared to the previous year.6,9 During the same period, however, both the distress of patients with PD and rates of self-harm thoughts in the general population increased.3,6-8 The decreased number of emergency department visits could be the result of reduced access to services or amelioration of symptomatology due to decreased social contact or sufficient remote therapy through telepsychiatry. A critical issue that mental health services providing therapy to patients with PD had to encounter was the need to discontinue in person psychotherapy and continue by telephone or online. Patients with PD are particularly sensitive to therapeutic setting modifications and this was an aggravating factor.7 In several studies, discontinuation of in person psychotherapy for BPD patients was accompanied by worsening symptomatology, feelings of anxiety, sadness, and feelings of helplessness.6,11 When it was not possible to continue sessions by telephone or online, there was an increase in the number of emergency department visits.6,11 In contrast, continuation of sessions via tele-psychiatry was considered satisfactory by patients and in some cases their clinical picture, after the initial nuance, returned and maintained at previous level.6,11 In the above studies, the discontinuation of sessions involved a period of 2-3 months. In a study conducted at the PD services of the First Psychiatric Department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, at Eginition Hospital, at the start of the restriction measures, 51 BPD patients were attending group psychoanalytic psychotherapy sessions. The face-to-face sessions were discontinued and continued online for 4 months. During this time, no self-harm incidents, suicide attempts or hospitalizations occurred; 2 patients discontinued treatment. In crises, patients used telephone communication with therapists and no emergency department visits were recorded.12 In conclusion, the pandemic had a significant psychological impact on patients with PD. However, it should be emphasized that in cases where the therapeutic setting remained alive and the continuity of therapeutic collaboration was maintained, patients with PD, despite the severity of their pathology, showed good adaptation and were able to withstand the tensions caused by the pandemic."}, {"Title": "[The effects of carotid revascularization on mood symptoms and quality of life in patients with high - grade carotid stenosis].", "Abstract": "Carotid occlusive disease has been related to ischaemic strokes and cerebral hypoperfusion, thus affecting patients' quality of life, mainly because of cognitive decline and depressive symptoms. Carotid revascularization techniques [carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS)] may, postoperatively, have a positive impact on patients' quality of life and mental condition, though there have been also presented elusive findings and controversial results. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of carotid revascularization (CEA, CAS) on patients' psychological condition and quality of life through a baseline and follow-up examination. We present data of a group of 35 patients (age range:60-80 years, \u039cA=70,26-SD=9,05) with severe, left or right, carotid artery stenosis (>75%), presented with or without symptoms, who underwent surgical treatment with CEA or CAS. Baseline and follow-up (6 months post-surgery) evaluation was conducted in order to assess patients' depressive symptoms and quality of life, through completion of the Beck Depression Inventory and WHOQOL-BREF Inventory, respectively. No statistically significant (p < 0,05) effect of the revascularization process on mood or quality of life assessment could be documented for our patients, regardless of the applied technique (CAS or CEA). Our study supports existing evidence that all of the traditional vascular risk factors represent active participants in the inflammatory process, which has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression as well as in pathogenesis of atherosclerotic processes. Thus we have to illuminate new links between the two nosological entities, in the crossroads of psychiatry, neurology and angiology, through the pathways of inflammatory reactions and endothelium dysfunctions. Even though the effects of carotid revascularization on patient's mood and quality of life, are often characterized by opposing results, pathophysiological processes of \"vascular depression\" and \"post stroke depression\" remain a promising interdisciplinary medical domain, sharing both scientific and clinical interests between the fields of neurosciences and vascular medicine. Our results, regarding the bilateral connection of depression and carotid artery disease, advocate a most probable causality link between atherosclerotic process and depressive symptoms, rather than justifying a direct association between depressive disorders and carotid stenosis and inferred cerebral blood flow reduction per se."}, {"Title": "Primary hypothyroidism presenting as neuropsychiatric symptoms and pituitary enlargement in a young woman: illustrative case.", "Abstract": "Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary enlargement and can potentially warrant surgical intervention.

However, personality differences are older than humanity and are ubiquitous in nature, from insects to higher primates. This suggests that a number of evolutionary mechanisms-other than dysfunctions-may be able to maintain stable behavioral variation in the gene pool. First of all, apparently maladaptive traits may actually improve fitness by enabling better survival or successful mating or reproduction, as exemplified by neuroticism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Furthermore, some PDs may harm important biological goals while facilitating others, or may be globally beneficial or detrimental depending on environmental circumstances or body condition. Alternatively, certain traits may form part of life history strategies: Coordinated suites of morphological, physiological and behavioral characters that optimize fitness through alternative routes and respond to selection as a whole. Still others may be vestigial adaptations that are no longer beneficial in present times. Finally, variation may be adaptative in and by itself, as it reduces competition for finite resources. These and other evolutionary mechanisms are reviewed and illustrated through human and non-human examples. Evolutionary theory is the best-substantiated explanatory framework across the life sciences, and may shed light on the question of why harmful personalities exist at all."}, {"Title": "Does the Hikikomori Syndrome of Social Withdrawal Exist in Denmark?

Initial studies showed high accuracy for the identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) with resting-state connectivity, but progress has been hampered by the absence of large datasets. Here we used regular machine learning and advanced deep learning algorithms to differentiate patients with MDD from healthy controls and identify neurophysiological signatures of depression in two of the largest resting-state datasets for MDD. We obtained resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the REST-meta-MDD (N\u2009=\u20092338) and PsyMRI (N\u2009=\u20091039) consortia. Classification of functional connectivity matrices was done using support vector machines (SVM) and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN), and performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Features were visualized using GCN-Explainer, an ablation study and univariate t-testing. The results showed a mean classification accuracy of 61% for MDD versus controls. Mean accuracy for classifying (non-)medicated subgroups was 62%. Sex classification accuracy was substantially better across datasets (73-81%). Visualization of the results showed that classifications were driven by stronger thalamic connections in both datasets, while nearly all other connections were weaker with small univariate effect sizes. These results suggest that whole brain resting-state connectivity is a reliable though poor biomarker for MDD, presumably due to disease heterogeneity as further supported by the higher accuracy for sex classification using the same methods. Deep learning revealed thalamic hyperconnectivity as a prominent neurophysiological signature of depression in both multicenter studies, which may guide the development of biomarkers in future studies."}, {"Title": "Personalized Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Depression.", "Abstract": "Personalized treatments are gaining momentum across all fields of medicine.

This scoping review aims to map the available literature on intensive community and home treatments for EDs, focusing on their conceptualisation, implementation and clinical outcomes.\nThis proposed scoping review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual. This review will include any peer-reviewed study concerning intensive community and home-based treatments for any EDs, with no restrictions on geographical context or study design. Grey literature will also be considered. The literature search will be conducted in four databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, MEDLINE and Web of Science. Two researchers will independently screen the titles, abstracts and text of the returned articles for eligibility. Data charting and analysis will consist of a narrative description of the included studies, quantitative and qualitative findings relative to the aims of this scoping review. Gaps in the literature will be highlighted to inform future research, clinical practice, and policy.\nEthical approval is not required as all data are available from public sources. The results of this scoping review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation, and social media."}, {"Title": "Symptom-specific effects of counselling for depression compared to cognitive-behavioural therapy.", "Abstract": "Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling for depression (CfD) are recommended first-line treatments for depression. While they approach change differently, there is little understanding of the impact those approaches have on change during treatment.\nThis study aimed to identify whether CBT and CfD target different symptoms and explore the implications of modelling choices when quantifying change during treatment.\nSymptom-specific effects of treatment were identified using moderated network modelling. This was a retrospective cohort study of 12 756 individuals who received CBT or CfD for depression in primary/community care psychological therapy services in England. Change was modelled several ways within the whole sample and a propensity score matched sample (n=3446).\nCBT for depression directly affected excessive worry, trouble relaxing and apprehensive expectation and had a stronger influence on changes between suicidal ideation and concentration. CfD had a stronger direct influence on thoughts of being a failure and on the associated change between being an easily annoyed and apprehensive of expectation. There were inconsistencies when modelling change using the first and second appointments as the baseline. Residual score models produced more conservative findings than models using difference scores.\nCfD and CBT for depression have differential effects on symptoms demonstrating specific mechanisms of change.\nCBT was uniquely associated with changes in symptoms associated with anxiety and may be better suited to those with anxiety symptoms comorbid to their depression. When assessing change, the baseline should be the first therapy session, not the pretreatment assessment. Residual change scores should be preferred over difference score methods."}, {"Title": "metaumbrella: the first comprehensive suite to perform data analysis in umbrella reviews with stratification of the evidence.", "Abstract": "Umbrella reviews are a new form of literature review that summarises the strength and/or quality of the evidence from all systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted on a broad topic. This type of review thus provides an exhaustive examination of a vast body of information, providing the highest synthesis of knowledge. A critical strength of umbrella reviews is recalculating the meta-analytic estimates within a uniform framework to allow a consistent evidence stratification. To our best knowledge, there is no comprehensive package or software to conduct umbrella reviews.\nThe R package metaumbrella accomplishes this aim by building on three core functions that (1) automatically perform all required calculations in an umbrella review (including but not limited to pairwise meta-analyses), (2) stratify evidence according to various classification criteria and (3) generate a visual representation of the results. In addition, this package allows flexible inputs for each review or meta-analysis analysed (eg, means plus SD, or effect size estimate and CI) and customisation (eg, stratification criteria following Ioannidis, algorithmic GRADE or personalised classification).\nThe R package metaumbrella thus provides the first comprehensive range of facilities to perform umbrella reviews with stratification of the evidence.\nTo facilitate the use of this package, even for researchers unfamiliar with R, we also provide a JAMOVI module and an open-access, browser-based graphical interface that allow use of the core functions of the package with a few mouse clicks."}, {"Title": "Mental health problems of black and white children in a nationally representative epidemiologic survey.", "Abstract": "Black children face more numerous socio-economic disadvantages than White children, but whether they have more adverse mental health problems remains understudied. Using nationally-representative data from the 2018-2019 National Survey of Children's Health, we examined differences in mental health problems between non-Hispanic Black (n\u00a0=\u00a02,890) and White (n\u00a0=\u00a030,015) children aged 6-17. Multivariate analyses were used to determine whether differences in mental health conditions could be accounted for by other factors. We found Black children were significantly less likely than White children to have clinically-identified internalizing conditions (especially anxiety) and more likely to be identified with conduct problems. Black children were also substantially more likely to have greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), to be uninsured, experience poverty, and less likely to receive needed mental health services. After adjusting for these potential confounders, Black children remained half as likely to have clinically-recognized internalizing conditions, but were no longer more likely to have clinically-identified conduct problems. Differences in ACEs alone fully accounted for the racial difference in conduct problems. These results point to the potential impact of assessment bias by clinicians and underscore the potential benefit of routine screening for depression/anxiety in racial/ethnic minority children, especially in light of rising suicide rates among Black youth."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric liaison: From yesterday to tomorrow].", "Abstract": "This article reviews the genesis and development of liaison psychiatry, whose mission is (i) taking care for patients with psychiatric comorbidities (psychiatric consultation) and (ii) transferring knowledge and skills to somatic medicine and supporting clinicians in their practice (psychiatric liaison).

Post hoc analyses indicated these associations had pleiotropic effects with the risk of coronary artery disease. Genetic proxied risk of educational attainment was found to be inconsistently associated with the risk of AD.\nPost hoc analysis indicated that the apparent protective effects of smoking, obesity and blood pressure were a result of survivor bias. The findings from this study did not support those presented by the Lancet Commission.

The mean and SD of the effective dose and the pre-post changes in manic symptoms were extracted. A network meta-analysis (NMA) under a frequentist framework was performed to examine the comparative efficacy between the antipsychotics. A classic mean dose method (sample size weighted) was used to calculate each antipsychotic dose equivalent to 1\u2009mg/day olanzapine for acute mania.

These children are at risk of negative health, social and educational outcomes and often experience severe difficulties at school, so effective psychosocial interventions are needed. There is mixed evidence for existing school-based interventions for ADHD, which are complex and resource-intensive, contradicting teachers' preferences for short, flexible strategies that suit a range of ADHD-related classroom-based problems. They are also poorly evaluated. In this study, a prototype intervention comprising a digital 'toolkit' of behavioural strategies will be tested and refined. We aim to refine the prototype so that its use is feasible and acceptable within school settings, and to establish whether a future definitive, appropriately powered, trial of effectiveness is feasible. This novel iterative study aims to pre-emptively address implementation and evaluation challenges that have hampered previous randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions.\nA randomised iterative mixed-methods case-series design will be used. Schools will be randomised to the time (school term) they implement the toolkit. Eight primary schools and 16-32 children with impairing traits of ADHD will participate, along with school staff and parents. The toolkit will be refined after each term, or more frequently if needed. Small, theory-based and data driven changes hypothesised as relevant across school contexts will be made, as well as reactive changes addressing implementation barriers. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses in relation to study continuation criteria, and ADHD symptoms and classroom functioning will be tracked and visually evaluated to assess whether there are early indications of toolkit utility.\nEthical approval has been obtained.

The patient also had self-inflicted superficial lacerations of the forearm. Due to concern over suspected compartment syndrome in the forearm, 25 mg of protamine was administered. Approximately 11 hours after reported enoxaparin self-injection, the patient's activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 206 seconds, prompting administration of an additional 50 mg of protamine. Three hours later, the aPTT had decreased to 79 seconds, then rose over several hours to 127 seconds before gradually declining to normal values. Protamine administration had no appreciable impact on anti-factor Xa activity. The patient did not require any blood products during the hospital admission. There were no further complications, and the patient was discharged to the inpatient psychiatry service on hospital day 8.\nThe case highlights the role of protamine as a reversal agent in the management of low-molecular-weight heparin overdoses.

The potential impact of unblinding chimes with a general concern for psychological research: so-called demand characteristics can undermine confidence in findings from experimental and clinical studies. Scepticism can result in nihilism. The reliance on subjective report of symptoms in clinical trials of drug efficacy in depression provides an important example. It is regularly implied that if subjective effects, including specific adverse reactions, unblind participants to an active treatment then evidence for its efficacy is suspect. In fact, the strong association between dose and subjective effects does not translate into a strong relationship with efficacy in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of conventional antidepressant drugs; this observation falsifies the proposition that unblinding is the principal mechanism driving RCT outcomes in studies of depression. Instead, changes in brain function, that occur soon after treatment starts, do predict treatment outcomes and align with our understanding of neurotransmitter effects from neuroscience. Psychedelic experience for the treatment of depression must be unblinding, but the effect results directly from serotonergic receptor activation and changes in brain connectivity. Where such effects are part of a novel mechanism of action, a strong dose response relationship would be expected, irrespective of unblinding. We highlight the importance of exploring blinding as a mechanism, confirming dose-related outcomes, and dissociating unblinding effects from efficacy. Unblinding does not necessarily invalidate the subjective experience of sustained recovery from depression."}, {"Title": "Pre- and post-task resting-state differs in clinical populations.", "Abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity has generated great hopes as a potential brain biomarker for improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in psychiatry. This neuroimaging protocol can routinely be performed by patients and does not depend on the specificities of a task. Thus, it seems ideal for big data approaches that require aggregating data across multiple studies and sites. However, technical variability, diverging data analysis approaches, and differences in data acquisition protocols introduce heterogeneity to the aggregated data. Besides these technical aspects, a prior task that changes the psychological state of participants might also contribute to heterogeneity. In healthy participants, studies have shown that behavioral tasks can influence resting-state measures, but such effects have not yet been reported in clinical populations. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by comparing resting-state functional connectivity before and after clinically relevant tasks in two clinical conditions, namely substance use disorders and phobias. The tasks consisted of viewing craving-inducing and spider anxiety provoking pictures that are frequently used in cue-reactivity studies and exposure therapy. We found distinct pre- vs post-task resting-state connectivity differences in each group, as well as decreased thalamo-cortical and increased intra-thalamic connectivity which might be associated with decreased vigilance in both groups. Our results confirm that resting-state measures can be strongly influenced by prior emotion-inducing tasks that need to be taken into account when pooling resting-state scans for clinical biomarker detection. This demands that resting-state datasets should include a complete description of the experimental design, especially when a task preceded data collection."}, {"Title": "Preliminary evidence that fatigue contributes to anhedonia in stable individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Anhedonia and fatigue are trans-diagnostic symptoms commonly observed in schizophrenia. Anhedonia is a core negative symptom with a strong relationship with depression and is associated with diminished global functioning. Similarly, fatigue is also associated to depression and research across psychiatric illnesses indicate that fatigue may persist even when primary symptoms are treated. Although fatigue is common in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, it is under studied within this population. The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the association of fatigue and anhedonia by controlling for depression in a sample of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nFifty-one stable individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia from the University Department of Adult Psychiatry in Montpellier took part in this study. Participants completed questionnaires on fatigue impact and depression, and were assessed for symptom severity. Following data collection, statistical analyses were conducted in order to explore associations between clinical variables and fatigue impact. Based on the results obtained, a hierarchical linear regression was conducted in order to investigate whether fatigue impact contributed to the variance of negative symptoms.\nThe hierarchical linear regression indicated that when controlling for depression, fatigue impact contributes to ~20% of the variance of anhedonia. Together the social impact of fatigue and depression contribute to 24% of the variation of anhedonia.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this exploratory study is the first to investigate and show that fatigue impact may contribute to anhedonia.

Each expert completed a detailed questionnaire for their respective country using the best available data.\nFinally, 22 EU Member States and Switzerland participated in the survey. Due to the frequent lack of a clear definition of what represented a forensic psychiatric bed, exact numbers on bed availability across specialized forensic hospitals or wards, general psychiatric hospitals or prison medical wards were often unknown or could only be estimated in a number of countries. Population-based rates calculated from the survey data suggested a highly variable pattern of forensic psychiatric provision across Europe, ranging from 0.9 forensic psychiatric beds per 100,000 population in Italy to 23.3 in Belgium.

This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted as a subset of a quality improvement project at the hospital to investigate the characteristics of the emergent nature of consults, types, and the specialty from which the referral was placed to the CL services. This study aims to improve the efficacy of our consult process by improving the appropriateness and precision of consult requests. Methodology This cross-sectional, observational study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board under a quality improvement exemption. The study investigated the EPIC electronic medical record data for characteristics of consult referrals in the third quarter of 2019 from July 1, 2019, to September 30, 2019. A total of 629 consults were recorded during this period. We excluded follow-up calls, duplicate data rows, and patients with missing data points; the final consults were 421. Patients who required more than one new consult (follow-up excluded) within 90 days were considered; thus, the total number of patients who were included in the study was 327. Results Of the 421 consults identified in the dataset for review, only 45.8% were valid consults, 32.8% were not valid, and 21.4% were uncertain. Further, the most common department from which consults were placed was Medicine (73.2%), followed by Surgery (12.8%), Obstetrics/Gynecology (9%), Critical Care (3.6%), and, finally, Pediatrics (1.4%). Conclusions The study overviews the quality of general consults for the CL psychiatry service and how the CL staff manages it.

This relationship might be due to adaptations that continue to exist after treatment is stopped, such as dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Therefore, more progressive weaning off antipsychotic medication may help reduce the likelihood of relapse when the medication is stopped. As there is a need to gradually reduce or stop using antipsychotic medication, our team tried to conduct a more in-depth search to give further answers to the suggested recommendations. Around 192 articles were gathered for our research, but we could only narrow our search to 36, which were further filtered, and eight were used.\u00a0We went through all of the pertinent information available until May 2022 and reviewed it to determine the risks associated with prolonged antipsychotic usage and abrupt cessation in the psychotic spectrum of diseases. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Psychiatry Online were the databases used, and the keywords that were looked for and utilized were antipsychotics, tapering, relapse, maintenance dosage, schizophrenia, and psychosis. The recurrence incidence was high in patients in whom antipsychotics were stopped and in whom the dosage was quickly lowered.\u00a0Patients who were gradually weaned off their antipsychotic medication and kept on the lowest effective dose had a much lower risk of experiencing a relapse.

We then discuss some of the open challenges and share our perspectives on the future of fNIRS in psychiatric research and clinical practice. We conclude that fNIRS holds promise for becoming a useful tool in clinical psychiatric settings with respect to developing closed-loop systems and improving individualized treatments and diagnostics."}, {"Title": "Survey results on training in developmental disabilities in Canadian psychiatry residency programs.", "Abstract": "Mental health problems in children, adolescents, and adults with developmental disabilities (DD) are an underserviced clinical area. Although the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada requires that experiences with patients with DD must be included during psychiatry residency training, the type and extent of this experience is not specified. The purpose of this study was to examine the current educational opportunities regarding DD in Canadian psychiatry residency programs.\nA survey asking about training in DD was sent to psychiatry residency directors at all 17 medical schools in Canada. The survey consisted of three sections focused on didactic teaching and clinical rotations (required and elective) in DD for residents.\nProgram directors of all psychiatry residency programs noted that their program included didactic teaching specific to DD, although the time dedicated to this differed greatly, ranging from 2 to 20 hours. Although 13 programs offered electives in DD, only five programs required residents to complete a clinical rotation specific to DD. Two programs did not have required or elective rotations in DD.\nThese results suggest that training specific to DD is probably inadequate for most residents. This is likely to result in limitations in knowledge and skills required to assess and treat people with DD, decreased comfort working with them, and ultimately reduced quality and availability of psychiatric care for this underserved population. More specific and comprehensive training requirements and opportunities are needed to ensure that residents receive appropriate training in this area."}, {"Title": "Focusing the APA Ethics Code to Include Development: Applications to Abuse.", "Abstract": "Extant ethics codes in psychological work generally are not sufficiently developmentally oriented. Here, we examine the American Psychological Association ethics code for its developmental sensitivity, find it lacking in this regard, and make recommendations. Our approach was to place children and youth at the forefront in forming developmentally-targeted principles, meta-principles, values, and rights. To further this aim, we consulted the one ethics code in the field that is developmentally-attuned, the ethics code of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. We used a revised set of ethical principles for psychological work and developed a set of meta-principles. The five APA ethics code principles are: (a) beneficence and nonmaleficence; (b) fidelity and responsibility; (c) integrity; (d) justice; and (e) respect for people's rights and dignity. The set of ethical principles taken from Young (<i>Revising the American Psychological Association ethics code</i>, Springer International Publishing,\u00a02017) includes: (a) life preservation, (b) caring beneficence/nonmaleficence, (c) relational integrity, (d) respect for the dignity and rights of persons and peoples, and (e) promoting and acting from justice in society. The major meta-principles proposed here include: (a) functioning from responsibility, (b) promoting personhood, and (c) promoting participation. In addition, we added meta-principles for working from appropriate (d) theory and (e) meta-theory (Neo-Maslovian and a combined relationism-empiricism, respectively). Secondary meta-principles in the text refer to (a) systems, (b) the person as unique, (c) the vulnerabilities of people, (d) autonomy, and (e) morality."}, {"Title": "Elements of Control Differentiate Associations Between Childhood Emotional Abuse and Anxiety Symptoms.", "Abstract": "Among adolescents experiencing childhood maltreatment, there exists wide variability regarding the development and maintenance of anxious symptoms. Existing research has identified the protective role of effortful control against childhood anxiety (Raines et al. in\u00a0<i>Child Psychiatry and Human Development</i>,\u00a02021). The current study aimed to uncover how distinct elements of effortful control differentially diminish or intensify anxiety symptoms arising from a perceived lack of control following childhood emotional abuse (CEA). 467 college student participants provided reports of their experience with childhood emotional abuse, locus of control, anxiety symptoms, and effortful control via in-person surveys. We explored three categories of effortful control: inhibitory control (the capacity to suppress inappropriate behavior), attentional control (the capacity to focus or shift attention), and activational control (the capacity to perform an action despite a strong tendency to avoid). Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed that CEA predicted increased anxiety symptoms. External LOC significantly mediated the relationship between CEA and anxiety. When effortful control was broken down into its component elements, higher inhibitory control acted as a protective factor for locus of control driven anxiety, whereas higher levels of activational control acted as a risk factor. Attentional control was not a significant moderator. These findings stress the importance of identifying risk and protective factors that contribute to resilience, and may aid in the development of interventions targeted to specific aspects of effortful control."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of medical students toward psychiatry in Eastern Mediterranean Region: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is facing one of the highest levels of shortages among medical specialties. Stigma toward psychiatry plays an influential role in medical students' decision to choose psychiatry as a career and has been reported to be prevalent in different parts of the world, particularly in low/middle-income countries.\nTo systematically review the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry, to assess whether their attitudes are stigmatized or not, and the factors affecting their attitudes.\nPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo (PsycARTICLES) were searched using a combination of main terms \"stigma,\" \"psychiatry,\" \"medical students,\" and the name of Eastern Mediterranean countries. Cross-sectional studies assessing the attitudes of EMR medical students toward psychiatry were included in this review.\nTen studies were eligible to be included in the result synthesis. These were from Pakistan (<i>n</i> = 3), Iran (<i>n</i> = 2), Saudi Arabia (<i>n</i> = 1), Lebanon (<i>n</i> = 1), Egypt (<i>n</i> = 1), Bahrain (<i>n</i> = 1), and Oman (<i>n</i> = 1). Most studies reported a combination of both positive and negative attitudes among medical students; however, the overall attitude was positive. Factors affecting medical students' attitude toward psychiatry included poor psychological well-being, having a friend with a psychiatric illness, involving in a romantic relationship with someone suffering from mental illness, young age, frequency of exposure to psychiatry clerkship/teaching, and quality of psychiatry clerkship. Nevertheless, the final positive or negative outcome of these factors on students' attitudes remained controversial.\nConsidering the lack of sufficient data from most EMR countries, we need to exercise caution in interpreting the results of this review. Nevertheless, our review indicates that psychiatry is not stigmatized among EMR medical students, and they have generally positive attitudes toward it. The findings of studies evaluating influencing factors are contradictory and demand further exploration."}, {"Title": "The new Code of Ethics of the World Psychiatric Association: A fresh look at the ethical issues of the psychiatric profession.", "Abstract": "This article develops the WPA's new Code of Ethics that was developed in 2020.

Most psychiatric disorders emerge prior to adulthood, yet little work has extended these computational approaches to study the development of psychopathology. Here, we lay out a roadmap for future studies implementing this approach by developing empirically and theoretically informed hypotheses about how developmental changes in model-based control of action and Pavlovian learning processes may modulate vulnerability to anxiety and addiction. We highlight how insights from studies leveraging computational approaches to characterize the normative developmental trajectories of clinically relevant learning and decision-making processes may suggest promising avenues for future developmental computational psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "The impact of rounds with a psychiatry team in the intensive care unit: A prospective observational pilot study evaluating the effects on delirium incidence and outcomes.", "Abstract": "Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common but serious condition that has been associated with in-hospital mortality and post-discharge psychological dysfunction. The aim of this before and after study is to determine the effect of a multidisciplinary care model entailing daily ICU rounds with a psychiatrist on the incidence of delirium and clinical outcomes.\nTo assess the impact of a proactive psychiatry consultation model in the surgical ICU on the incidence and duration of delirium.\nThis was a prospective, single institution, observational controlled cohort pilot study of adult patients admitted to a surgical ICU. A control group that received standard of care (SOC) with daily delirium prevention care bundles in the pre-intervention period was compared to an intervention group, which had a psychiatrist participate in daily ICU rounds (post-intervention period). The primary outcome was delirium incidence. The secondary outcomes were: delirium duration, ventilator days, hospital and ICU length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.\nA total of 104 patients were enrolled and equally split between SOC and intervention groups; 95 contributed to analysis. The overall incidence of ICU delirium was 19%. SOC and intervention groups had similar rates of delirium (21% vs 18%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.72). None of the secondary outcomes statistically significantly differed between the two groups.\nDelirium in ICU patients is a potentially preventable condition with serious sequelae.

This study aimed to characterise the physical activity levels of inpatients in a general psychiatric clinic and to determine the feasibility of using a simple tool in everyday practice to assess physical activity levels in standard patient documentation. We assessed the level of physical activity undertaken by patients treated on an inpatient basis in a psychiatric hospital over 20\u00a0months. A total of 328 patients were included in the analysis. Physical activity was measured using a slightly altered version of the Exercise as a vital sign (EVS) questionnaire. All information was extracted from letters of discharge. During inpatient treatment, moderate to vigorous activity levels increased, and more patients engaged in physical activity. Patients with mood or anxiety disorders displayed the most considerable increase in physical activity. Patients with other diagnoses, such as schizophrenia, benefitted less or not at all. Factors associated with physical activity included-among others-history of substance use, education and month of admission. Investigating the feasibility of standardised documentation of physical activity showed fluctuation in documentation rates throughout the study. The level of physical activity performed by psychiatric patients can be increased during inpatient treatment. Implementing physical activity level as part of standard patient documentation is a first step in gathering data to assess the need for interventions to achieve an optimal physical activity in psychiatric patients throughout inpatient treatment."}, {"Title": "Using social network analysis approach in developing rural psychiatrist workforce.", "Abstract": "This study examines how rural and remote junior doctors career decisions are influenced by highly connected principles within a discipline.\nSocial network analysis was completed with data collected, by structured interview, with five psychiatry trainees and three early career psychiatrists in a rural location rated MM3 using the Modified Monash Model.

It is one of the causes of extensive disability, and f not properly treated, it can lead to severe emotional, behavioral, and physical health problems. In most mental health research studies, the focus is on treatment, but fewer resources are focused on technical solutions to mental health issues. The present paper carried out a systematic review of available literature using PRISMA guidelines to address various monitoring solutions in mental health through the use of wearable sensors. Wearable sensors can offer several advantages over traditional methods of mental health assessment, including convenience, cost-effectiveness, and the ability to capture data in real-world settings. Their ability to collect data related to anxiety and stress levels, as well as panic attacks, is discussed. The available sensors on the market are described, as well as their success in providing data that can be correlated with the aforementioned health issues. The current wearable landscape is quite dynamic, and the current offerings have enough quality to deliver meaningful data targeted for machine learning algorithms. The results indicate that mental health monitoring is feasible."}, {"Title": "Ultra-Processed Food Consumption and Depressive Symptoms in a Mediterranean Cohort.", "Abstract": "Excess consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is currently under investigation for its potentially detrimental impact on human health. Current evidence demonstrates a substantial association with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, but data on mental health outcomes are just emerging. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the consumption of UPFs and depressive symptoms in a sample of younger Italian adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 596 individuals (age 18-35 y) recruited in southern Italy. Food frequency questionnaires and the NOVA classification were used to assess dietary factors; the Center for the Epidemiological Studies of Depression Short Form (CES-D-10) was used to assess presence of depressive symptoms. Individuals in the highest quartile of UPF consumption had higher odds of having depressive symptoms in the energy-adjusted model (odds ratio (OR) = 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 3.28); the association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.01) and became even stronger after further adjustment for adherence to the Mediterranean diet as a proxy of diet quality (OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.51). In conclusion, a positive association between UPF consumption and likelihood of having depressive symptoms was found in younger Italian individuals.

This stigmatization might influence the approval of coercive measures in psychiatry by the public and healthcare professionals and might have an influence on the clinical practice of coercive measures. We examined whether the general approval of coercive measures for psychiatric patients with dangerous behaviors differs from case-specific approval.\nWe conducted a representative survey of the general population (<i>n</i> = 2207) in the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. In total, 1107 participants assessed a case vignette depicting a fictitious character with a mental illness and indicated whether they would accept coercive measures (involuntary hospitalization, involuntary medication, and seclusion) for the person in the vignette. It was explicitly stated that within the last month, the fictitious character displayed no dangerous behavior (Vignette ND) or dangerous behavior (Vignette D). Another 1100 participants were asked whether they would approve coercive measures (involuntary hospitalization, involuntary medication, and seclusion) for psychiatric patients with dangerous behavior in general (General D), i.e., without having received or referring to a specific case vignette.\nThe logistic regression model containing all variables explained 45% of the variance in approval of any type of coercive measures. Assessment of case vignettes without dangerous behavior (Vignette ND) was associated with significantly reduced approval of coercive measures compared to assessment of a case vignette with dangerousness (Vignette D), while approval for coercive measures in a person with mental health disorder with dangerous behavior in general (General D) was significantly higher than for the case vignette with dangerousness.\nThe general approval of coercive measures for people with mental disorders seems to differ depending on if the respondents are asked to give a general assessment or to examine a specific and detailed clinical case vignette, indicating an increased role of stigmatization when asking about generalized assessments. This may contribute to diverging findings on the acceptance of coercive measures in the literature and should be considered when designing future studies."}, {"Title": "\"Maybe it's Not Just the Food?\" A Food and Mood Focus Group Study.", "Abstract": "Epidemiological and intervention studies in nutritional psychiatry suggest that the risk of mood disorders is associated with what we eat. However, few studies use a person-centred approach to explore the food and mood relationship. In this qualitative study of 50 Australian participants, we explored individuals' experiences with food and mood as revealed during focus group discussions. Using a thematic template analysis, we identified three themes in the food and mood relationship: (i) <i>social context: familial and cultural influences of food and mood</i>, (ii) <i>social economics: time, finance, and food security</i>, and (iii) <i>food nostalgia: unlocking memories that impact mood</i>. Participants suggested that nutrients, food components or food patterns may not be the only way that food impacts mood. Rather, they described the social context of who, with, and where food is eaten, and that time, finances, and access to healthy fresh foods and bittersweet memories of foods shared with loved ones all impacted their mood. Findings suggest that quantitative studies examining the links between diet and mood should look beyond nutritional factors and give increased attention to the cultural, social, economic, and identity aspects of diet."}, {"Title": "Foreign Nationality, Family Psychiatry History and Pregestational Neoplastic Disease as Predictors of Perinatal Depression in a Cohort of Healthy Pregnant and Puerperal Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Perinatal depression (PND) represents one of the most common mental disorders in the pregnancy and/or postpartum period, with a 5-25% prevalence rate.

Emerging perspectives from social science and psychiatry outline a comprehensive, multidimensional view of despair, inclusive of individuals' cognitive, emotional, biological and somatic, and behavioral circumstances. The current study assesses the structure and plausibility of this framework based on longitudinal data spanning early to middle adulthood. We identified 40 measures of different dimensions of despair in Wave IV (2008-2009) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adult to Adolescent Health (n\u00a0=\u00a09149). We used structural equation modeling to evaluate hypothesized relationships among observed and latent variables; we then regressed Wave V (2016-2018) suicidality, heavy drinking, marijuana use, prescription drug misuse, and illicit drug use on latent despair. Our analyses find that models for separate dimensions of despair and overall despair demonstrated excellent fit. Overall despair was a significant predictor of Wave V outcomes, especially suicidality, accounting for 20% of its variation, as compared to 1%-7% of the variation in substance use. Suicidality was consistently associated with all domains of despair; behavioral despair explained the most variation in substance use. Given these results we contend that, lacking direct measures, latent despair can be modeled using available survey items; however, some items are likely better indicators of latent dimensions of despair than others. Moreover, the association between despair and key health behaviors varies considerably, challenging its status as a mechanism simultaneously underlying increased substance use and suicide mortality in the United States. Critically, further validation of measures in other surveys can improve the operationalization of despair and its associated conceptual and theoretical frameworks, thus advancing our understanding of this concept."}, {"Title": "A genome-wide association study of a rage-related misophonia symptom and the genetic link with audiological traits, psychiatric disorders, and personality.", "Abstract": "People with misophonia experience strong negative emotional responses to sounds and associated stimuli-mostly human produced-to an extent that it may cause impairment in social functioning.

Stronger genetic correlations (0.21 < <i>r</i> <sub>G</sub> < 0.42) were observed for two clusters of personality traits: a guilt/neuroticism and an irritability/sensitivity cluster. Our results showed no genetic correlation with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and psychotic disorders. A negative correlation with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was found, which may be surprising given the previously reported comorbidities and the sensory sensitivity reported in ASD. Clustering algorithms showed that rage-related misophonia consistently clustered with MDD, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and related personality traits.\nWe conclude that-based on the genetics of a common misophonia symptom-misophonia most strongly clusters with psychiatric disorders and a personality profile consistent with anxiety and PTSD."}, {"Title": "Implementation of the AAMC's Holistic Review Model for Psychiatry Resident Recruitment.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, several converging factors are impacting the recruitment of residents: the increased competitiveness of the specialty, the national trend to take active steps to improve diversity and inclusion, and the decision from USMLE to change Step 1 to a pass/fail result.\nWe developed a workshop for psychiatry residency program directors to meet these challenges and transition into using a holistic review model during recruitment. The workshop included (1) a didactic session providing background on the AAMC holistic review model; (2) a small-group exercise to determine and prioritize experiences, attributes, competencies, and metrics (EACMs) aligned with the program's mission and aims; (3) a review of the rankings from the previous exercise, selection of two \"very important\" criteria for each of the four domains of the EACM model, and operationalization of these criteria based on the recruitment process; and (4) a discussion focused on application of program criteria with example applicants.\nThe holistic review workshop was conducted at the American Association of Psychiatry Residency Directors conference in 2021 with 48 self-selected attendees. Following the workshop, 74% of attendees reported a likelihood of implementing holistic applications during their next application cycle, 78% were able to leave with at least one actionable item, 100% thought that the session was interactive, and 78% felt that the session met their expectations.\nImplementing a holistic review for psychiatry residency recruitment can assist programs in responding to the rapidly changing landscape and achieve aims for improving diversity and inclusion."}, {"Title": "Machine Learning and Prediction in Fetal, Infant, and Toddler Neuroimaging: A Review and Primer.", "Abstract": "Predictive models in neuroimaging are increasingly designed with the intent to improve risk stratification and support interventional efforts in psychiatry. Many of these models have been developed in samples of children school-aged or older. Nevertheless, despite growing evidence that altered brain maturation during the fetal, infant, and toddler (FIT) period modulates risk for poor mental health outcomes in childhood, these models are rarely implemented in FIT samples. Applications of predictive modeling in children of these ages provide an opportunity to develop powerful tools for improved characterization of the neural mechanisms underlying development. To facilitate the broader use of predictive models in FIT neuroimaging, we present a brief primer and systematic review on the methods used in current predictive modeling FIT studies. Reflecting on current practices in more than 100 studies conducted over the past decade, we provide an overview of topics, modalities, and methods commonly used in the field and under-researched areas. We then outline ethical and future considerations for neuroimaging researchers interested in predicting health outcomes in early life, including researchers who may be relatively new to either advanced machine learning methods or using FIT data.

There are two modeling frameworks, reinforcement learning (RL) and drift diffusion modeling (DDM), that are well-developed in cognitive science, and have begun to be applied to Gambling Disorder. RL models focus on explaining how an agent uses reward to learn about the environment and make decisions based on outcomes. The DDM is a binary choice framework that breaks down decision making into psychologically meaningful components based on choice reaction time analyses. Both approaches have begun to yield insight into aspects of cognition that are important for, but not unique to, gambling, and thus relevant to the development of Gambling Disorder. However, these approaches also oversimplify or neglect various aspects of decision making seen in real-world gambling behavior. Gambling Disorder presents an opportunity for 'bespoke' modeling approaches to consider these neglected components. In this review, we discuss studies that have used RL and DDM frameworks to investigate some of the key cognitive components in gambling and Gambling Disorder. We also include an overview of Bayesian models, a methodology that could be useful for more tailored modeling approaches. We highlight areas in which computational modeling could enable progression in the investigation of the cognitive mechanisms relevant to gambling."}, {"Title": "[Treatment Outcome of Migrants and Non-Migrants in Forensic Psychiatry.

This study drew on the ICD diagnostic records of 2,634 individuals with PDs who were admitted to a specialized inpatient psychiatric crisis unit over a 6-year period. Multiple logistic regressions and survival regressions were performed to examine whether PD categories, gender, and other individual, interpersonal, and precipitating factors were associated with readmission and time-to-readmission. The results showed a 16.1% readmission rate. Of these, 99.5% of readmissions occurred within 4 years following the first admission. Gender was the main factor associated with both readmission and time-to-readmission: while men were readmitted faster, more women in total were readmitted for a second psychiatric emergency hospitalization. Findings also indicated that readmission rate and time-to-readmission differed following the category of PD: readmission rate in a ratio of 1-2 (from 8% to 10% for dissocial and paranoid PD up to 19%-21% for impulsive and borderline PD), and time-to-readmission in a ratio of 1-5 (from 1 month for anankastic and dependent, to 5 months for impulsive, histrionic and anxious-avoidant PD). Limitations of this naturalistic study include a lack of self-reported measures and generalizability to less specialized emergency settings. Future research should include a prospective longitudinal design using standardized scalable measurement tools to improve the completeness and accuracy of the data concerning the psychological processes involved in risk and time-to-readmission after brief hospitalizations in emergency psychiatry.

This has brought to focus the important roles that sports psychiatrists and other allied health professionals play in professional sports. It has also exposed the limitations of sports psychiatry, especially the shortage of sports psychiatrists. Professional athletes are subjected to multiple stressors during their careers, resulting in significant mental health outcomes.\u00a0If not adequately addressed, stress can cause performance slumps and poorer outcomes, which in turn exacerbates stress in a vicious cycle. We present the case of a former male athlete with multiple physical, somatic, and psychosocial stressors that predisposed him to develop\u00a0mental illness. This case highlights the potential consequences of a lack of early recognition and management of physical and psychosocial stressors in athletes, which can contribute to psychological illness and potentially lead to adverse medical outcomes such as repeat hospitalization and homelessness."}, {"Title": "Older adults sex offender: Five case series in a Brazilian population.", "Abstract": "Sexual assault perpetrated by older adults is still an underreported crime and is not fully understood. To describe a series of cases of sexual assault by Brazilian older adults and discuss the associated factors based on the literature. This is a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of five cases of older adults accused of sexual assault in the Forensic Psychiatry sector of the Medical Legal Institute (Coroner's Office) in the City of Belo Horizonte'. This review focuses on five cases involving male defendants with a mean age of 59.75\u2009years; two with previous psychiatric treatment, and one with a previous criminal record. Their victims were prepubescent children, four of them female. Psychiatric conditions related to forensic diagnosis included dementia, schizophrenia, alcohol-related substance use disorder, paraphilia, and one without a psychiatric diagnosis. The final forensic report on all five cases found that two of the older adults diagnosed with a mental disorder in two were considered to have a mental illness that completely impaired the cognitive and volitional domains; two other adults were diagnosed with mental health disturbance that partially impaired these domains; and the last adult was diagnosed and found without mental health impairment. While the incidence of sexual crimes committed by older adults is low, the absolute number of cases has expected to rise due to population aging. Assessing the factors related to this type of crime is therefore an initial step to understanding and formulating preventive strategies."}, {"Title": "Stronger coupling of emotional instability with reward processing in borderline personality disorder is predicted by schema modes.", "Abstract": "Mood instability and risk-taking are hallmarks of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Schema modes are combinations of self-reflective evaluations, negative emotional states, and destructive coping strategies common in BPD. When activated, they can push patients with BPD into emotional turmoil and a dissociative state of mind. Our knowledge of the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms driving these changes is incomplete. We hypothesized that in patients with BPD, affective instability is more influenced by reward expectation, outcomes, and reward prediction errors (RPEs) during risky decision-making than in healthy controls. Additionally, we expected that these alterations would be related to schema modes.\nThirty-two patients with BPD and thirty-one healthy controls were recruited. We used an established behavioral paradigm to measure mood fluctuations during risky decision-making. The impact of expectations and RPEs on momentary mood was quantified by a computational model, and its parameters were estimated with hierarchical Bayesian analysis. Model parameters were compared using High-Density Intervals.\nWe found that model parameters capturing the influence of RPE and Certain Rewards on mood were significantly higher in patients with BPD than in controls. These model parameters correlated significantly with schema modes, but not with depression severity.\nBPD is coupled with altered associations between mood fluctuation and reward processing under uncertainty. Our findings seem to be BPD-specific, as they stand in contrast with the correlates of depressive symptoms. Future studies should establish the clinical utility of these alterations, such as predicting or assessing therapeutic response in BPD."}, {"Title": "Supporting Veterans, Caregivers, and Providers in Rural Regions With Tele-Geriatric Psychiatry Consultation: A Mixed Methods Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "Cross-facility tele-geriatric psychiatry consultation is a promising model for providing specialty services to regions lacking sufficient geriatric psychiatry expertise.

Victoria, Australia, implemented legislation permitting Voluntary Assisted Dying for terminally ill adult patients with a life expectancy less than 6\u2009months. Ethical dilemmas arise when terminally ill patients with a comorbid mental illness attempt to access Voluntary Assisted Dying because of the complex relationship between psychiatric conditions and suicidal ideation. This paper seeks to investigate the most ethical approach for doctors to respond to such a request by discussing objections raised in other literature to patients with a comorbid psychiatric illness aiming to access Voluntary Assisted Dying in Victoria. To answer this question, objections to terminally ill patients with a comorbid psychiatric illness accessing Voluntary Assisted Dying were found through review of literature. Discussion of these objections centred around unpacking the two historical ethical justifications for Voluntary Assisted Dying: respect for autonomy and relief of suffering. Regarding autonomy, contention focused on competency to make autonomous decisions. Not all psychiatric patients lack competency to decide about Voluntary Assisted Dying, and there are comparable competency assessments used in psychiatry today. Considering suffering, objections related to the authenticity of the intolerable nature of a patient's suffering out of concerns that it has been influenced by their condition, and that the psychiatric illness may still be treatable. However, given suffering is subjective, its perception is not lessened if the source is psychological in nature. Furthermore, it is challenging to justify a position where a patient is forced to spend the last months of their life enduring suffering that has been historically refractory to multiple, genuine treatment efforts. Not all terminally ill patients with a comorbid psychiatric disorder will lack competency to choose Voluntary Assisted Dying, and many will have genuine suffering for which they are requesting Voluntary Assisted Dying. Multidisciplinary, holistic assessments for these patients are not mandated, but would be useful to address the issues, overcome barriers to access and determine that applicants are making an authentic request."}, {"Title": "Geographic Trends in Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Dispensing Before and After the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic.", "Abstract": "This study examined trends and geographic variability in dispensing of prescription psychotropic medications to U.S. youths before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUsing national data on prescription medication dispensing, the authors performed a cross-sectional study examining the monthly percent change in psychotropic medications dispensed (total N=95,639,975) to youths (ages 5-18 years) in 2020 versus 2019, across medication classes and geographic regions.\nFor many medications, more were dispensed in March 2020 than in March 2019 and fewer in April-May 2020 versus April-May 2019.

It has been suggested this may explain individual differences in other aspects of cognition; in particular that greater effort sensitivity may underlie some of the symptoms of conditions such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we highlight a major problem with existing measures of cognitive effort that hampers this line of research, specifically the confounding of effort and difficulty. This means that behaviour thought to reveal effort costs could equally be explained by cognitive capacity, which influences the frequency of success and thereby the chance of obtaining reward. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a new test, the Number Switching Task (NST), specially designed such that difficulty will be unaffected by the effort manipulation and can easily be standardised across participants. In a large, online sample, we show that these criteria are met successfully and reproduce classic effort discounting results with the NST. We also demonstrate the use of Bayesian modelling with this task, producing behavioural parameters which can be associated with other measures, and report a preliminary association with the Need for Cognition scale."}, {"Title": "Using statistical techniques to understand the unique needs of military personnel experiencing mental health difficulties: moving away from assuming patient homogeneity to understanding heterogeneity.", "Abstract": "Gold standard treatments for military personnel seeking support for mental health difficulties are often standardised and manualised to ensure high levels of treatment fidelity.

This 'change' in the use of the above-mentioned consultation service could be understood as a 'natural' consequence of the family life cycle of forced migrants who some years ago came to Germany as adolescents or young adults and started here a family. The treatment of 'preschoolers with a refugee background', as we may call this group of patients, confronts mental health practitioners with particular challenges. In this contribution, we specify some of these challenges and argue that, due to the deep intertwinement of different aspects of these patients' condition, a 'situated approach' is required when treating this population.When planning therapeutic interventions for preschoolers with refugee background, their families should be conceived as unified systems which in their social and transcultural embeddedness exhibit trans-individual vulnerabilities and resources. By discussing a case study, we illustrate how an extremely challenging child psychiatric treatment could succeed only on the condition that we focused on the interconnectedness of various factors determining not merely the patient's symptomatic behavior but, furthermore, the behavior of the family, i. e., on the condition of focusing on the situated nature of the problematic."}, {"Title": "[Refugee Minors from Ukraine and their Families - First Experiences from an Intercultural Practice for Child and Adolescents Psychiatry and an Outpatient Clinic for Refugees/Hamburg].", "Abstract": "Due to the Russian invasion in Ukraine, many families were forced to flee to Germany, often having to leave relatives behind.The outpatient clinic for refugees at Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Eppendorf coordinates the psychosocial and psychotherapeutic care for refugee minors from Ukraine in Hamburg.

Diagnostic and therapeutic experiences to this point indicate the contribution of multifactorial stress to the development of symptoms in Ukrainian minors.The threat of war and displacement seems to be only one of many factors. Although there are some remarkable resilience factors for Ukrainian refugee children and adolescents in comparison to refugees from other countries of origin, the forced adaptation to living and studying conditions in Hamburg bears challenges for many. Additionally due to war experiences psychotherapeutic and psychiatric care is frequently needed. On Germany's side, there is a need for action to ameliorate the accessibility to the health care system for refugees and migrants.

Studies reported significant improvement in outcomes pertinent to behavioural problems, coping mechanisms and general well-being but not to caregiver support or psychiatric symptoms. In meta-analysis, resilience was improved (g<sub>av</sub>=0.194, 95%\u2009CI 0.018 to 0.369), but anxiety symptoms and quality of life were not (g<sub>av</sub>=-0.326, 95%\u2009CI -0.782 to 0.131 and g<sub>av</sub>=0.325, 95%\u2009CI -0.027 to 0.678, respectively). Risk of bias varied. Quality of evidence for most graded outcomes was very low.\nThe multiplicity of study designs, intervention types, outcomes and measures incumbered quantifying intervention effectiveness.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on this process when inpatient psychiatric units were unable to provide care for patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection because of infection control concerns in units unable to accommodate isolation precautions. Similar to other disrupted hospital workflows, these clinical handoffs became more complicated by requiring COVID exposed or COVID+ patients in the midst of behavioral health crisis to quarantine or isolate on general hospital units if not otherwise stable for discharge to the community. To better respond to the growing number of patients isolating in the general hospital during the 2022 Omicron surge, we used quality improvement (QI) methodology to illustrate the need to create a COVID+ unit in the inpatient psychiatric hospital to care for the growing cohort of COVID+ patients in psychiatric crisis who were otherwise unable to access traditional psychiatric hospital care because of their isolation status."}, {"Title": "Does use of primary care-based behavioral health programs differ by race and ethnicity?

FKBP5 is a gene with decades of evidence suggesting its pathogenic role in a subset of psychiatric patients, with potential to be leveraged as a therapeutic target for these individuals. While it is widely reported that FKBP5/FKBP51 mRNA/protein (FKBP5/1) expression is impacted by psychiatric disease state, risk genotype and age, it is not known in which cell types and sub-anatomical areas of the human brain this occurs. This knowledge is critical to propel FKBP5/1-targeted treatment development. Here, we performed an extensive, large-scale postmortem study (n\u2009=\u20091024) of FKBP5/1, examining neocortical areas (BA9, BA11 and ventral BA24/BA24a) derived from subjects that lived with schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder. With an extensive battery of RNA (bulk RNA sequencing, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, microarray, qPCR, RNAscope) and protein (immunoblot, immunohistochemistry) analysis approaches, we thoroughly investigated the effects of disease state, ageing and genotype on cortical FKBP5/1 expression including in a cell type-specific manner. We identified consistently heightened FKBP5/1 levels in psychopathology and with age, but not genotype, with these effects strongest in schizophrenia. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq; BA9 and BA11) and targeted histology (BA9, BA24a), we established that these disease and ageing effects on FKBP5/1 expression were most pronounced in excitatory superficial layer neurons of the neocortex, and this effect appeared to be consistent in both the granular and agranular areas examined. We then found that this increase in FKBP5 levels may impact on synaptic plasticity, as FKBP5 gex levels strongly and inversely correlated with dendritic mushroom spine density and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in superficial layer neurons in BA11. These findings pinpoint a novel cellular and molecular mechanism that has potential to open a new avenue of FKBP51 drug development to treat cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Lived experience of psychosis: challenges and perspectives for research and care.", "Abstract": "There is currently a recognition of the first-personal knowledge of people with lived experience of schizophrenia as an epistemic privilege that can influence and improve the quality of research and care.

Due to diagnosed treatment resistance additional therapeutic approaches were introduced sequentially: Electroconvulsive therapy (efficient only 4 months) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation, iTBS improved just insomnia). Finally the patient was enrolled to the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) study with the medial forebrain bundle target. After 20 months of active DBS a reduction of over 80% of depressive symptom severity was observed (Montgomery-Asberg and Hamilton Depression Rating Scales), together with an 87% reduction of anxiety symptoms intensity (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and a 90% increase in social and occupational functioning. Subjective assessment of the patient performed with questionnaires and visual analog scales showed less pronounced improvement in terms of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and high reduction of anhedonia. Some mild, transient side effects of neurostimulation were eliminated with an adjustment in stimulation parameters.\nThe presented clinical case confirms the possibility of achieving remission after the use of MFB DBS in treatment-resistant depression, but postponed for many months.

In our study, we explore the impact on this population and identify risk and resilience factors by looking both at those children who were impacted negatively as well as those who were impacted positively by this period. Questionnaires were administered by child and adolescent psychiatrists to 101 parents of child and adolescent outpatients in a mental health clinic as well as 75 of the adolescents, themselves, during the initial stay-at-home orders in Israel. Parents and their children were asked how the situation changed the symptoms for which the children are being treated at our clinic. Information regarding demographic, family, and individual factors was also gathered. The largest group of parents (44%) reported improvement in their child's symptoms during this period, whereas 33% reported no change and 25% reported worsening. Risk factors included parental stress and level of child preoccupation with Covid-19. The major protective factor was parental presence. Although home confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic can lead to worsening mental health status among children, it can also provide an opportunity for those with previous mental health conditions to improve and strive. For these children to improve during such a period, decreased social and academic demands and increased parental presence seem to be key factors. For those who deteriorate, identifying and targeting parental stress can be as important as targeting the child's stress during such times."}, {"Title": "Improving the Rates of Objective Monitoring of Patients with Depression with the PHQ-9 in an Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic: A Quality Improvement Initiative.", "Abstract": "Despite evidence that measurement-based care (MBC) can help identify nonresponse and residual depressive symptoms and could improve treatment, it is underused.

Researchers used the Model for Improvement (MFI) methodology framework to design the project. The interventions included two education sessions for physicians and the flagging of charts of patients with depression as a visual reminder. Data on the rate of monitoring were collected prospectively each month and extracted after reviewing the paper charts (to determine whether the PHQ-9 was completed by the physician and part of the chart or the PHQ-9 score was documented in the physicians' follow-up note).\nPrior to the start of the quality improvement initiative the rate of objective monitoring using a rating scale in the clinic was 5.1%.

There is need for patient-centric methods for lithium monitoring and the use of dried blood spots has recently been proposed for determination of lithium concentration. The purpose of the current study was to assess feasibility of this method by introducing a volumetric technique developed for home-sampling.\nLaboratory: Capillary blood was sampled by finger-prick using a volumetric device that collects 10\u00a0\u00b5L volumes as a dried blood spot. Lithium was measured in the dried blood spots using a validated atomic absorption spectroscopy method.\nThirty-nine lithium-treated patients were recruited, and dried blood spots and venous blood samples were collected. Routine serum analysis was performed for comparison.\nThe range of serum lithium concentrations was 0.41-1.22\u00a0mmol/L, and the dried blood spot/serum ratio was 0.78. A strong linear correlation between the two specimens was shown with Pearson's R =\u00a00.95 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.90). Adding hematocrit as a variable only minimally improved prediction.\nVolumetric dried blood spots is a promising technique for measurement of lithium concentrations. This will enable home-sampling and could potentially save resources, improve compliance, and make treatment safer. This may facilitate the use of lithium treatment in regions where monitoring via venous blood sampling remains difficult.

Outcomes evaluated included satisfaction, knowledge, attitudes and confidence, and clinical skill in delivering SBIRT to a standardized patient (rated by the actor, as well as an expert).\nResults indicated acceptable satisfaction at post-curriculum and significant improvements in attitudes and knowledge from pre- to post-curriculum. On the clinical skills exam, all students were rated as having mastered at least 80% of SBIRT elements by standardized patients and 91.8% were rated at this level by a faculty expert. Student attitudes and knowledge were unrelated to expert ratings, and standardized patient ratings had limited associations with expert ratings.\nThese results suggest curriculum objectives were achieved and provide unique contributions to the SBIRT curricular outcome research for healthcare trainees. Other findings included that trainee knowledge and confidence may not relate to skill, and standardized patient feedback provides different information on SBIRT and MI skill than expert ratings."}, {"Title": "Alternative hypotheses regarding the association between early engagement in gambling and gambling-like activities and later problem gambling - a commentary on Richard and King (2023).", "Abstract": "This issue of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry includes a systematic review on the emergence of problem gambling from childhood to emerging adulthood (Richard & King,\u00a02023).

The aim of this webinar is to address NDD in a dimensional rather than in a categorical approach. Several speakers were invited to present their researches on the subject. Classifications in NDD were discussed: irritability in NDD, involvement of the immune system in neurodevelopment, nutrition and gut microbiota modulate brain inflammation and neurodevelopment, co-occurring conditions in autistic adolescents and adults without intellectual disability. Classifications in psychiatric disorders were asked: mapping the effect of genes on cognition and autism risk, epigenetics and symptomatic trajectory in neurodevelopmental disorders, the autism-schizophrenia continuum in two examples: minor neurological signs and EEG microstates, the cerebellum in schizophrenia and autism: from imaging to intervention perspectives. Both genetic and environmental factors, along with clinical and imaging features, argue toward a continnum between NDD but also with adult psychiatric presentations. This new paradigm could modify the therapeutic strategy, with the development of large-spectrum treatments or new psychotherapies addressing co-occuring symptoms.

The CAB was recruited in partnership with the Muslim Community Association (MCA), one of the largest Islamic centres in the San Franscisco Bay Area. In addition to describing the development of the CAB, the authors present the findings of the evaluation and synthesis of best processes based on CAB members' feedback.\nTo evaluate the perceived community advisory board members' perceptions of their roles and elicit feedback on how to enhance the relationship between the university team and the CAB, an evaluation was conducted by an independent team who was not part of the research process. Data was collected using anonymous individual surveys and small group open discussions that were conducted over three evaluation meetings. The evaluation utilised mixed method data collection strategies using questions from Schulz <i>et al.</i> (, Evaluation and Program Planning 26, 249-262), an instrument for evaluating dimensions of group dynamics within CBPR partnerships.\nResults of the evaluation within the sphere of CAB operation indicated that CAB members found the greatest satisfaction from their contributions through direct participation in the research activities that were conducted by the university-CAB team. The collective responses indicated that most CAB members were satisfied with trust built between the university-CAB team and the diversity represented in the members of the board. However, given that the Bay Area is home to a very diverse Muslim community, challenges in recruiting representatives that account for all possible self-identifying groups was reported by the CAB with recommendations to recruit religious leaders. Recommendations also included eliciting funds for potential financial compensation for CAB members.\nThe Stanford-San Francisco Bay Area CAB demonstrated that empowering community members through direct participation, creating channels and safe spaces for feedback help create community rooted research that carry the true voices of marginalised communities and reflects their evolving needs."}, {"Title": "Fulfilling the Goals of 988 Through Crisis Stabilization Care.", "Abstract": "Recent implementation of the nationwide 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has expanded telephone-based mental health crisis services and created a unified framework for crisis care in the United States.

He established care with psychiatry 5 months ago after his school referred him to a hospital-school-community telepartnership bridge program following statements of self-harm and numerous concerns with his behavior, including elopement.Sam currently receives special education support under the classifications of \"Emotional Disturbance\" and \"Speech Impairment.\" His parents report significant challenges with having his medical diagnosis of autism recognized by the school, which has impeded him receiving educational support as a student with autism. This has resulted in Sam being penalized for challenging behaviors related to his neurodevelopmental disorder. He is not currently making meaningful progress in the school setting. Sam currently demonstrates avoidance, physical and verbal aggression, and difficulty adapting to change across settings. In addition to difficulties advocating for more individualized support at school, Sam has never received applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy because of challenges obtaining insurance approval. There are no additional barriers to accessing care, such as language, geographic, or socioeconomic factors.Sam's visit to reestablish care with DB pediatrics consisted of an individual clinician evaluation model. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition, (CARS-2) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3), were administered, and Sam continued to meet DSM-5 criteria for ASD following re-evaluation. A new referral for ABA therapy was submitted. Shortly afterward, his family received an insurance denial letter specifying that additional developmental testing was needed before ABA therapy would be approved. His clinician called the insurance company to appeal this decision but was unsuccessful. Sam was then seen by the DB pediatrics embedded psychologist, who completed additional testing, including assessment of cognitive functioning, administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), and autism-specific rating scales.

By adopting a reverse translation of validated circuitry relevant human endpoints, her research brought new insights in mechanism-based biomarker guided treatment of patients in early stages of psychosis. She showed that oxidative stress/redox dysregulation, in reciprocal interaction with dopamine imbalance, NMDAR hypofunction, neuroinflammation and mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction, may represent a \"hub\" on which both genetic and environmental risk factors converge during neurodevelopment. This leads to impairments of structural and functional connectivity in microcircuits, involving impaired parvalbumin fast-spiking GABA neurons, and macrocircuits, impacting myelination of fiber tracts, at the basis of neural synchronization abnormalities, as well as sensory and cognitive deficits.

Here, we argue that the direct effects of tES are not so mysterious: Extensive data from a wide range of model systems shows it has appreciable effects on the activity of individual neurons. Instead, the real mysteries are how tES interacts with the brain's own activity and how these dynamics can be controlled to produce desirable therapeutic effects.

However, bridging the gap between molecular-level manipulations and neural systems-level functional alterations remains an unsolved problem in psychiatry. After decades of low success rates in pharmaceutical research and development for psychiatric drugs, multiple studies now point to the potential of psychedelics as a promising, fast-acting, and long-lasting treatment for some psychiatric symptoms. Yet, given the highly psychoactive nature of these substances, a precision medicine approach is essential to map the neural signals related to clinical efficacy to identify patients who can maximally benefit from this treatment. Recent studies have shown that bridging the gap between pharmacology, systems-level neural response in humans, and individual experience is possible for psychedelic substances, therefore paving the way for a precision neuropsychiatric therapeutic development. Specifically, it has been shown that the integration of brain-wide positron emission tomography or transcriptomic data, i.e., receptor distribution for the serotonin 2A receptor, with computational neuroimaging methods can simulate the effect of psychedelics on the human brain. These novel computational psychiatry approaches allow for modeling interindividual differences in neural as well as subjective effects of psychedelic substances. Collectively, this review provides a deep dive into psychedelic pharmaconeuroimaging studies with a core focus on how recent computational psychiatry advances in biophysically based circuit modeling can be leveraged to predict individual responses.

With regard to distinguishing between ADHD-I and ADHD-C, a combination of demographic information, SNAP-IV scale results, and CPT-2 results yielded overall accuracies of 88.75 and 85.56% in the training and testing sets, respectively. The replacement of CPT-2 with CPT-3 results in this model yielded an overall accuracy of 90.46% in the training set and 89.44% in the testing set. With regard to distinguishing between ADHD-I, ADHD-C, and the absence of ADHD, a combination of demographic information, SNAP-IV scale results, and CPT-2 results yielded overall accuracies of 86.74 and 77.43% in the training and testing sets, respectively.\nThis proposed model distinguished between the ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups with 85-90% accuracy, and it distinguished between the ADHD-I, ADHD-C, and control groups with 77-86% accuracy. The machine learning model helps clinicians identify patients with ADHD in a timely manner."}, {"Title": "An auditory processing advantage enables communication in less complex social settings: Signs of an extreme female brain in children and adolescents being assessed for Autism Spectrum Disorders.", "Abstract": "The underlying factors of the male predominance in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are largely unknown, although a female advantage in social communication has been pointed out as a potential factor. Recently, attention has been given to ASD as a sensory processing disorder, focusing on the audio-visual temporal processing paramount for the development of communication. In ASD, a deviant audio-visual processing has been noted, resulting in difficulties interpreting multisensory information. Typically Developed (TD) females have shown an enhanced language processing in unisensory situations compared to multisensory situations. We aim to find out whether such an advantage also can be seen in girls within the ASD population, and if so, is it related to social communication skills?\nForty children (IQ\u2009>\u200985), 20 females (mean age\u2009=\u200913.90\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20092.34) and 20 males (mean age\u2009=\u200912.15\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u20092.83) triaged for an ASD assessment were recruited from a child and youth psychiatric clinic in Sweden. Using The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) we looked at associations with child performance on the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test (IVA-2).\nAn auditory advantage in the female group was associated with less rated problems in social communications in unisensory processing whereas in multisensory processing an auditory dominance was associated with more rated problems in Social Awareness. In the male group, a visual dominance was associated with more rated problems in Social Rigidity.\nA female unisensory processing advantage in ASD could very well be explaining the male domination in ASD. However, the social difficulties related to multisensory processing indicate that ASD females might be struggling as hard as males in more complex settings. Implications on the assessment procedure are discussed."}, {"Title": "Commentary on alignment of medical student assessment and vocational training in psychiatry and addiction medicine.", "Abstract": "To comment upon the potential for alignment of medical student assessment and vocational specialist training through the RANZCP-CanMEDS model of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) and Workplace-Based Assessments (WBAs).

Sigmund Freud's description of the id, ego, and super ego reflects the various identities that lie within each of us. Carl Jung introduced the development of our identity through the stages of life. We have identity disorders in the DSM. In psychiatry, we diagnose patients, and that diagnosis can meaningfully impact identity formation. It plays a part in the way persons views themselves while also influencing how they are perceived by others. The discussion of identity development through our experiences and how we view our current identity plays an integral role in therapy. This month's Book Forum focuses on 3 books that look at identity through various lenses of experience, diagnosis, and treatment.

Technological advancements and decreasing costs of high throughput sequencing has led to an unprecedented increase in data generation. Furthermore, over the years it has become increasingly clear that these subsystems do not act in isolation but instead interact with each other to drive mental illness and health. Consequently, individual subsystems are now analysed jointly to promote a holistic understanding of the underlying biological complexity of health and disease. Complementing the increasing data availability, current research is geared towards developing novel methods that can efficiently combine the information rich multi-omics data to discover biologically meaningful biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. However, clinical translation of the research is still challenging. In this review, we summarise conventional and state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches for discovery of biomarker, diagnosis, as well as outcome and treatment response prediction through integrating multi-omics and clinical data. In addition, we describe the role of biological model systems and in silico multi-omics model designs in clinical translation of psychiatric research from bench to bedside. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and explore the application of multi-omics integration in future psychiatric research.

A patient with insomnia was also included. <b><i>Consensus Process:</i></b> The Insomnia Working Group met in March 2022 to review data on available therapies (including medications approved since publication of current guidelines) and share current best practices for evidence-based multimodal treatment of insomnia disorder. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Insomnia is highly prevalent but underdiagnosed and undertreated. It is increasingly recognized as a distinct disorder, not merely a symptom arising secondary to another medical or psychiatric illness. The subtypes of sleep disturbance-reports of difficulty falling or staying asleep, insufficient sleep duration, early waking-and the presence of next-day impairment and common comorbid conditions require a targeted, individualized approach to therapy. Challenges exist in treating insomnia with commonly used on- and off-label drugs, including low-dose antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and benzodiazepine receptor agonists because of the risk of adverse effects, including impaired next-day functioning. The dual orexin receptor antagonists have a novel mechanistic target and offer an alternative pharmacologic choice.

Multiple causes can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. Humans subjected to violence, participants in hostilities, victims of terrorist attacks, physical or psychological persecution, witnessing scenes of cruelty, survival of natural disasters, and more, can strongly affect both children and adults. Pathological features of post-traumatic stress disorder that are manifested at molecular, cellular and whole-organism levels must be clearly understood for successful diagnosis, management, and minimizing of long-term outcomes associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. This article summarizes existing data on different post-traumatic stress disorder causes and symptoms, as well as effects on homeostasis, genetic instability, behavior, neurohumoral balance, and personal psychic stability. In particular, we highlight a key role of mitochondria and oxidative stress development in the severity and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Excessive or prolonged exposure to traumatic factors can cause irreversible mitochondrial damage, leading to cell death. This review underlines the exceptional importance of data integration about the mechanisms and functions of the mitochondrial stress response to develop a three-dimensional picture of post-traumatic stress disorder pathophysiology and develop a comprehensive, universal, multifaceted, and effective strategy of managing or treatment post-traumatic stress disorder."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of psychometric properties of the Persian version of the predicaments questionnaire, exploring social attitudes to suicide.", "Abstract": "Due to the growing prevalence of suicide, assessing people's attitudes toward suicide is necessary. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Predicaments Questionnaire (PQ), measuring social attitudes toward suicide.\nThis psychometrics study evaluated face validity, content validity, temporal stability, internal consistency, and construct validity. First, the questionnaire was translated into Persian by the translate-back-translate method. The Persian version was provided to 10 experts in psychiatry for further revision. Two indicators, CVR and CVI, were calculated to evaluate the content validity. To check the face validity, we prepared a form and gave it to 10 people outside the campus to submit their opinions. Temporal stability was investigated by the test-retest method, reporting Intraclass correlation (ICC). Internal consistency was assessed by reporting Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's Omega coefficients. Construct validity was assessed using the confirmatory factor analysis to determine the number of dimensions of the questionnaire.\nA total of 151 students were enrolled with a mean age of 25 (SD = 0.32). The Persian PQ was valid in terms of content validity and face validity. Furthermore, it was reliable as Cronbach's alpha, McDonald's Omega, and the ICC were 0.94, 0.943, and 0.998, respectively. In addition, the confirmatory factor analysis yielded one dimension.

We randomly assigned subjects to one of eight conditions in our full factorial design: four neuromodulation interventions [electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, or adaptive brain implants] by two depression severity levels [moderate or severe]. In this paper we present results from ANOVA and linear regression models explaining how views about these four neuromodulation interventions-as measured in five attitudinal scales (general affect, perceived influence on self, perceived benefit, perceived risk, and perceived invasiveness)-vary by (1) intervention, (2) depression severity, and/or (3) stakeholder group.\nOur results provide evidence that psychiatrists views differ significantly in important ways from other stakeholder groups.

Fortunately, at the same time, mental health stigma is showing signs of lessening. To further decrease stigma and enhance help-seeking, all stakeholders should appreciate mental health as inseparable from other aspects of physical health in athletes.

Different interventions were already developed to reduce coercion, but for their effective application, it is crucial to know the risk factors of individuals and clinical situations that might be associated with coercion. Since the results of previous studies differ considerably the current study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the course of the exertion of coercion in detail.\nIn this study, we analyzed clinical, procedural, and sociodemographic data from patients (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a016,607 cases) who were treated as inpatients in Switzerland's largest psychiatric institution with 320 beds during the years 2017 to 2020. We used regression models to identify predictors for the exertion of coercion, the number of coercive measures during a treatment episode and time until exertion of the first and last coercive measure.\nCoercive measures are mostly used during the first days of treatment. We identified clinical parameters such as manic or psychotic episodes to be the most relevant predictors for the exertion of coercion. Cases with those disorders also received coercion more often and earlier in their treatment course than other diagnostic groups. Other promoting factors for frequency and early application of coercion were involuntary admission and factors of chronicity and clinical severity.\nKnowing the risk factors may help to target preventive strategies for those at highest risk.

We aimed to summarize the available evidence from the literature also considering what we have learned from our daily clinical practice. As hospital care was restricted by COVID-19, although reducing their opening hours and activities, Community Mental Health Centers promoted continuity of care for at-risk populations, supporting them to cope with loneliness and hopelessness during quarantine and self-isolation. Ensuring continuity of care also remotely, via teleconsultation, lowered the risk of psychopathological decompensation and consequent need of hospitalization for mental health patients, with satisfaction expressed both by patients and mental health workers. Considering what we have learned from the pandemic, the organization and the activity of the Italian community-based system of mental health care would need to be implemented through 1) the promotion of a \"territorial epidemiology\" that makes mental health needs visible in terms of health care workers involved, 2) the increase of mental health resources in line with the other European high-income countries, 3) the formalization of structured initiatives of primary care and mental health cooperation, 4) the creation of youth mental health services following a multidimensional and multidisciplinary approach and encouraging family participation, 5) the promotion of day centers, to build competence and self-identity within a more participatory life, and programs geared to employment as valid models of recovery-oriented rehabilitation."}, {"Title": "Model-based experimental manipulation of probabilistic behavior in interpretable behavioral latent variable models.", "Abstract": "Interpretable latent variable models that probabilistically link behavioral observations to an underlying latent process have increasingly been used to draw inferences on cognition from observed behavior. The latent process usually connects experimental variables to cognitive computation. While such models provide important insights into the latent processes generating behavior, one important aspect has often been overlooked. They may also be used to generate precise and falsifiable behavioral predictions as a function of the modeled experimental variables. In doing so, they pinpoint how experimental conditions must be designed to elicit desired behavior and generate adaptive experiments.\nThese ideas are exemplified on the process of delay discounting (DD). After inferring DD models from behavior on a typical DD task, the models are leveraged to generate a second adaptive DD task. Experimental trials in this task are designed to elicit 9 graded behavioral discounting probabilities across participants. Models are then validated and contrasted to competing models in the field by assessing the ouf-of-sample prediction error.\nThe proposed framework induces discounting probabilities on nine levels. In contrast to several alternative models, the applied model exhibits high validity as indicated by a comparably low prediction error. We also report evidence for inter-individual differences with respect to the most suitable models underlying behavior. Finally, we outline how to adapt the proposed method to the investigation of other cognitive processes including reinforcement learning.\nInducing graded behavioral frequencies with the proposed framework may help to highly resolve the underlying cognitive construct and associated neuronal substrates."}, {"Title": "The perspective of staff members of two forensic psychiatric clinics in German-speaking Switzerland on the introduction of recovery orientation: An explorative study.", "Abstract": "Recovery orientation (RO) is directed at living a worthwhile life despite being impaired by the constraints of mental illness.

This explorative study qualitatively investigates baseline expectations and professional perspectives of forensic staff members concerning the idea of establishing RO in Swiss forensic psychiatric wards. Thereby, three central themes were worked out, namely \"challenges associated with recovery,\" \"expected barriers,\" and \"possible recovery-oriented interventions.\" From a general point of view, the staff members were uncertain whether RO interventions could be introduced at all, and if so, to what extent. This, on the one hand, had to do with structural obstacles such as security requirements; however, personal obstacles in the form of different, sometimes contradictory attitudesand ideals and fearful anticipations-such as the loss of authority and power-also played a central role.

Their distinction from organic tics is challenging because they both phenomenologically present common features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in functional tic-like behaviours in vulnerable children and adolescents after social media exposure. This study explores the phenomenology and course of a cohort of newly diagnosed functional tic-like behaviors.\nWe analysed clinical data of 243 patients affected by tic disorders collected at outpatient Tourette Clinic, Child and Adolescent Neurology and Psychiatry Unit, Catania University. Among the clinical cohort with functional tic-like behaviors, we evaluated the clinical course of symptoms at follow-up visits after 6 and 12 months.\nAmong the cohort of 243 patients referred for evaluation at our centre, 11 were diagnosed with functional tic-like behaviours. The majority of participants with functional tic-like behaviours were female with a mean age of 15 years old and presented an explosive symptom's onset. At follow-up visit after 12 months, patients with functional tic-like behaviors showed a significant variation in the severity of tics and anxiety symptoms. Conversely, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms did not significantly differ during the follow-up.\nOur data suggest that several characteristics in clinical course and their phenomenology can help clinicians to distinguish functional tic-like behaviours from organic tics. Our results also suggest a better outcome for tics and anxiety symptoms respect on other comorbidities.

Epistemic issues in mental health have received some attention, however, less attention has been paid to the possible epistemic problems of mental health legislation existing. In this manuscript, we examine the epistemic problems that arise from the presence of such legislation, both for patients without a prior experience of being detained under such legislation and for those with this experience. We also examine how the doctor is legally obligated to compound the epistemic problems by the knowledge they prioritise and the failure to generate new knowledge. Specifically, we describe the problems of testimonial epistemic injustice, epistemic silencing, and epistemic smothering, and address the possible justification provided by epistemic paternalism. We suggest that there is no reasonable epistemic justification for mental health legislation that creates an environment that fundamentally unbalances the doctor-patient relationship.

The purpose of the current study was to determine if spectral clustering applied to previously acquired KOR images (with [11C]LY2795050 PET) could identify meaningful groupings of different responses to naltrexone and to assess the robustness of the finding. Spectral clustering was applied to 6 features (regional volume of distribution values, V<sub>T</sub>) per AUD subject to produce 3 classes of subjects with different mean responses to naltrexone. Response to naltrexone was quantified as the difference in drinks consumed in an established lab-based alcohol drinking paradigm (Krishnan-Sarin et al. Biological Psychiatry, 62(6), 694-697, 2007) prior to, and after a week of naltrexone treatment. Clustering was applied exclusively to features of the image data with no a priori knowledge of the subjects' responses. Separation of classes was tested using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with drink reduction as the outcome of interest. To assess robustness of the result, the size of the training set was varied by using successively reduced subsets of the data. Clustering resulted in significantly different groupings of drink reduction. The finding was robust to initialization of the spectral clustering procedure and was replicable for different random subsets of training subjects.

Kernberg and his contribution to the theoretical understanding of personality pathology in adolescence. In his object relations theory of the structure of personality, an integrated identity is considered central to healthy personality functioning and is contrasted with identity diffusion, which is posited to underlie the maladaptive interpersonal functioning of patients with severe personality disorders. His work provided an early theoretical foundation for the understanding and treatment of personality disorders in adults, but a need remained for a deeper understanding of the development and treatment of personality disorders during adolescence. During the past 10 years, Kernberg has led a group of clinicians and developmental researchers focusing on childhood and adolescence to elaborate an understanding of the development, assessment, and treatment of personality disorders among adolescents. He proposed that in the context of typical development, adolescence is important to the expansion of identity, because it represents the period when sexual and aggressive impulses are integrated and earlier representations of the self and others are revised and become more realistic and nuanced. Furthermore, adolescence entails a reorganization of the moral system and enrichment of the ego ideal. This article presents two methods for assessing personality disorders in adolescence that are based on Kernberg's theory and demonstrates the use of transference-focused psychotherapy for adolescents with personality disorders."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (Pre XDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among extra pulmonary (EP) multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at a tertiary care center in Mumbai in pre Bedaquiline (BDQ) era.", "Abstract": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is the most exigent and calamitous challenge encountered in treatment of TB.

Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was the most common comorbidity seen in 26 (40.6%) patients, followed by anemia in 5 (7.8%), psychiatry problems 5 (7.8%), hypertension in 3 (4.6%), renal disorders in 2 (3.1%) while thyroid disorder, HIV and thalassemia in 1 each (1.5%).\nEPDR-TB forms a small but significant proportion of total DR-TB. Lymph node DR-TB is its most common subclass. Our study emphasises the momentousness and essentiality of baseline DST to FQ and SLI in patients of DR-TB. This enables an appropriate modification of therapy at baseline itself to better the treatment outcomes. We observed a strikingly high proportion of preXDR-TB (FQ) in our study group."}, {"Title": "A Survey of Behavioral Health Care Providers on Use and Barriers to Use of Measurement-Based Care.", "Abstract": "Despite robust evidence for efficacy of measurement-based care (MBC) in behavioral health care, studies suggest that adoption of MBC is limited in practice. A survey from Blue Cross-Blue Shield of North Carolina was sent to behavioral health care providers (BHCPs) about their use of MBC, beliefs about MBC, and perceived barriers to its adoption.\nThe authors distributed the survey by using professional networks and snowball sampling. Provider and clinical practice characteristics were collected. Numerical indices of barriers to MBC use were created. Ordered logistic regression models were used to identify associations among practice and provider characteristics, barriers to MBC use, and level of MBC use.\nOf the 922 eligible BHCPs who completed the survey, 426 (46%) reported using MBC with at least half of their patients. Providers were more likely to report MBC use if they were part of a large group practice, had MBC training, had more weekly care hours, or practiced in nonmetropolitan settings. Physicians, self-reported generalists, more experienced providers, and those who did not accept insurance were less likely to report MBC use. Low perceived clinical utility was the barrier most strongly associated with less frequent use of MBC.\nAlthough evidence exists for efficacy of MBC in behavioral health care, less than half of BHCPs reported using MBC with at least half of their patients, and low perceived clinical utility of MBC was strongly associated with lower MBC use. Implementation strategies that attempt to change negative attitudes toward MBC may effectively target this barrier to use."}, {"Title": "Youth Mental Health Screening and Linkage to Care.", "Abstract": "One Mind, in partnership with Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, convened several virtual meetings of mental health researchers, clinicians, and other stakeholders in 2020 to identify first steps toward creating an initiative for early screening and linkage to care for youths (individuals in early adolescence through early adulthood, ages 10-24 years) with mental health difficulties, including serious mental illness, in the United States. This article synthesizes and builds on discussions from those meetings by outlining and recommending potential steps and considerations for the development and integration of a novel measurement-based screening process in youth-facing school and medical settings to increase early identification of mental health needs and linkage to evidence-based care. Meeting attendees agreed on an initiative incorporating a staged assessment process that includes a first-stage brief screener for several domains of psychopathology. Individuals who meet threshold criteria on the first-stage screener would then complete an interview, a second-stage in-depth screening, or both. Screening must be followed by recommendations and linkage to an appropriate level of evidence-based care based on acuity of symptoms endorsed during the staged assessment. Meeting attendees proposed steps and discussed additional considerations for creating the first nationwide initiative for screening and linkage to care, an initiative that could transform access of youths to mental health screening and care."}, {"Title": "Interpersonal violence and recurrent headache among adolescents with a history of psychiatric problems.", "Abstract": "Interpersonal violence (IPV) is found to be associated with mental health problems and pain disorders such as headache among children and adolescents. It is well-known that adolescents in need of mental health services have experienced IPV more often than adolescents in the general population. However, there has not been much focus on pain conditions in child and adolescent psychiatric populations.\nData from the current study are based on a 3-year follow-up of the CAP-survey, which is a study of adolescents in the child and adolescent psychiatric unit population of St. Olavs Hospital (Trondheim University Hospital). The baseline study was conducted between 2009 and 2011, with 717 participants between 13 and 18\u00a0years. All participants were enrolled, or newly referred to the child and adolescent psychiatric clinic. At follow-up, 570 participants completed questionnaire, and 550 completed a diagnostic interview. The participants were aged 16-21\u00a0years (mean age 18.6\u00a0years).\nA third of the adolescents reported frequent headaches (weekly or daily). Adolescents with more severe mental problems were more likely to experience frequent headaches. Adolescents exposed to unpleasant sexual acts or bullying, reported more frequent headaches than non-exposed participants. Participants exposed to three or more types of IPV seemed to be at particularly high risk of experiencing frequent headache.\nBoth experiences of interpersonal violence and headache are common in this clinical psychiatric population. Clinicians should assess for headache disorders in addition to psychiatric and trauma assessment and provide need-based treatment to enhance chance of recovery among adolescents in mental health services."}, {"Title": "Digital self-report instruments for repeated measurement of mental health in the general adult population: a protocol for a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Digital technologies present tremendous opportunities for enabling long-term measurement of mental health in the general population. Emerging studies have established preliminary efficacy of collecting self-report data digitally. However, a key challenge when developing a new self-report instrument is navigating the abundance of existing instruments to select relevant constructs for measurements. This review is a precursor to developing a novel future integrated digital instrument for repeated measurements. We interrogate the literature as the first step towards optimal measurement of the multifaceted mental health concept, in the context of digital repeated measurement. This review aims to identify (1) digital self-report instruments administered repeatedly to measure the mental health of the general adult population; (2) their structure and format; (3) their psychometric properties; (4) their usage in empirical studies; and (5) the constructs these instruments were designed to measure (as characterised in the original publication), and the constructs the instruments have been used to measure in the identified empirical studies.\nFive major electronic databases will be searched. Studies administering mental health instruments (in English) repeatedly to community dwellers in the general adult population are eligible. A reviewer will preliminarily screen for eligible studies. Then, two reviewers will independently screen the full text of the eligible articles and extract data. Both reviewers will resolve any disagreement through discussion or with a third reviewer. After the data extraction, a reviewer will manually search for the structure, format, psychometric properties and the original constructs these instruments were developed to measure. This review will synthesise the results in a narrative approach. The reporting in this review will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist.\nEthical approval is not required as no data will be collected.

One example of these attempts is the CHAM system developed by the Dutch psychiatrist R.M. Silbermann (1932-1976). This system is intended as a simple classification with 20 \"psychiatric states,\" which are classified based on the presence of one of 12 hierarchically arranged core symptoms or key characteristics, while all \"hierarchically higher\" symptoms are excluded without inference about the \"hierarchically lower\" symptoms. Its scientific evidence is, as yet, insufficiently substantiated. However, disqualifying the CHAM system as an outdated Dutch folklore is like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The CHAM system emerges as clinically straightforward, didactically fruitful, and consistent with more modern initiatives in descriptive psychopathology. Studying pre-DSM attempts such as Silbermann's CHAM system can stimulate psychopathological thinking and serve as a source of inspiration for future phenomenological research in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Analyzing User-Generated Web-Based Posts of Adolescents' Emotional, Behavioral, and Symptom Responses to Beliefs About Depression: Qualitative Thematic Analysis.", "Abstract": "Depression is common during adolescence. Early intervention can prevent it from developing into more progressive mental disorders. Combining information technology and clinical psychoeducation is a promising way to intervene at an earlier stage. However, data-driven research on the cognitive response to health information targeting adolescents with symptoms of depression is lacking.\nThis study aimed to fill this knowledge gap through a new understanding of adolescents' cognitive response to health information about depression. This knowledge can help to develop population-specific information technology, such as chatbots, in addition to clinical therapeutic tools for use in general practice.\nThe data set consists of 1870 depression-related questions posted by adolescents on a public web-based information service. Most of the posts contain descriptions of events that lead to depression. On a sample of 100 posts, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis based on cognitive behavioral theory investigating behavioral, emotional, and symptom responses to beliefs associated with depression.\nResults were organized into four themes. (1) Hopelessness, appearing as a set of negative beliefs about the future, possibly results from erroneous beliefs about the causal link between risk factors and the course of depression. We found beliefs about establishing a sturdy therapy alliance as a responsibility resting on the patient. (2) Therapy hesitancy seemed to be associated with negative beliefs about therapy prognosis and doubts about confidentiality. (3) Social shame appeared as a consequence of impaired daily function when the cause is not acknowledged. (4) Failing to attain social interaction appeared to be associated with a negative symptom response. In contrast, actively obtaining social support reduces symptoms and suicidal thoughts.\nThese results could be used to meet the clinical aims stated by earlier psychoeducation development, such as instilling hope through direct reattribution of beliefs about the future; challenging causal attributions, thereby lowering therapy hesitancy; reducing shame through the mechanisms of externalization by providing a tentative diagnosis despite the risk of stigmatizing; and providing initial symptom relief by giving advice on how to open up and reveal themselves to friends and family and balance the message of self-management to fit coping capabilities. An active counseling style advises the patient to approach the social environment, demonstrating an attitude toward self-action."}, {"Title": "The Barriers and Facilitators to Decentralised Nurse-Led Mental Health Service Delivery in Sierra Leone.", "Abstract": "In 2009, 98.0% of people with mental illness in Sierra Leone were not receiving treatment, partly due to the absence of public psychiatric facilities outside the capital. In response to this situation, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation rolled out nurse-led mental health units (MHUs) to every district. This study evaluates the barriers and facilitators to mental health service delivery in decentralised MHUs in Sierra Leone using key informant interviews and focus group discussions with 13 purposefully sampled clinical staff and senior management personnel. The interviews were audio-recorded, translated from Krio if necessary, transcribed, and analysed using manifest content analysis. The findings suggest that factors affecting nurse-led mental health service delivery include small workforce and high workload, culture and beliefs, risks, lack of safety measures and required resources, outdated policies, poor salaries, lack of funds for medication, distance, power, influence, and stigma. Factors that could facilitate nurse-led mental health services include: increasing motivation, increasing the workforce, knowledge sharing, mentorship, availability of medication, passion and modern psychiatry. The findings contribute towards understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by the recently established nurse-led decentralised mental health services across Sierra Leone, in order to address the large mental health treatment gap. We hope the findings will inform further policy and planning to improve the quality of decentralised mental healthcare."}, {"Title": "Incidence of mental disorders in the general population aged 1-30\u00a0years disaggregated by gender and socioeconomic status.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence and age of onset of mental disorders diagnosed by gender and socioeconomic status (SES) in children, adolescents, and young adults up to 30\u00a0years of age in the whole population of the Basque Country (Spain).\nAll mental health diagnoses documented in Basque Health Service records from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2018, were classified into eight clusters: anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorders, depression, psychosis/personality disorders, substance use, eating disorders, and self-harm. We calculated incidence and cumulative incidence for each cluster, disaggregated by gender, and socioeconomic status (SES). Poisson regression analyses were performed.\nOverall, 9,486,853 person-years of observation were available for the 609,281 individuals included. ADHD and conduct disorders were diagnosed in the first decade, anxiety and depression disorders in the second and third decades, and psychosis/personality and substance use in the third. The cumulative incidence at 18\u00a0years of age for any type of disorder was 15.5%. The group with low SES had a statistically significantly higher incidence of all eight clusters. The incidence of ADHD, conduct disorders, depression, psychosis/personality disorders, and substance use was higher in males and that of anxiety, eating disorders and self-harm was higher in females.\nThe incidence of mental disorders is high among children, adolescents, and young adults in the Basque Country underlining the need for preventive interventions.

This survey was piloted, revised and then distributed to all the Division Chiefs at our institution. The results of each question were collated, and simple descriptive statistics were calculated.\nThe survey was completed by 22 of 31 Division Chiefs. The majority of respondents were from the Department of Pediatrics (63.6%), followed by Surgery (20%), Psychiatry (3.3%) and Laboratory Medicine (3.3%). Their mean length of time as Division Chief was 5.5 years. Seventy-seven percent had concurrent leadership roles in addition to the role of Division Chief. None felt they were very well prepared for the role, five felt they were somewhat well prepared, nine were neutral, five were somewhat unprepared and three were very unprepared for the role. Half of the respondents received mentoring, either formal or informal, for their role and all but one felt that formal mentoring would have been useful. In terms of desired training, the Division Chiefs felt they had the most knowledge and skills in patient safety. All wanted training in developing divisional budgets, and many desired training in supporting the academic mission of the Division.\nOverall, this needs assessment identified an unmet need for leadership training and development among Division Chiefs. The findings are being used to optimize onboarding of Division Chiefs and an ongoing leadership development program targeted at this group."}, {"Title": "The influence of a Learning to Forgive Program on institutional offending and recidivism among offenders with mental disorder.", "Abstract": "Previous researchers have demonstrated that learning to forgive may reduce the likelihood of offending/reoffending.

The current study is a follow up to a previous study that examined the effects of a 6-week forgiveness psychoeducational intervention for offenders with mental disorders. The aim of the current study was to determine any differences for participants who received a forgiveness intervention versus a control group for rates of recidivism (likelihood of reoffending and length of time to reoffend) and type of institutional offense. Recidivism data was collected through the Canadian Police Information Center. Both the control and treatment group in this study were selected from offenders with mental disorder at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, a multilevel forensic psychiatry hospital in Saskatoon, Canada. Results indicated that participants who received the forgiveness intervention took significantly longer than the control group to both commit non-violent offenses, and to be convicted of any offense.

We did a grounded theory study of enablers and barriers to community response to ongoing violence, sampling from programme areas of a non-governmental organisation (NGO)-led community mobilisation intervention in informal settlements in Mumbai, India. We held 27 focus group discussions and 31 semistructured interviews with 113 community members and 9 NGO staff, along with over 170 hours of field observation. We found that residents responded to violence in diverse ways, ranging from suicide prevention to couple mediation to police and NGO referral. Enabling and constraining factors fit into a social ecological model containing intrapersonal, immediate social network, and wider societal levels. We identified four themes interlinking factors: legitimacy of action, collective power, protection against risk and informal leadership. Legitimacy of action was negotiated in the context of individual disputes, making community members question not only whether VAW was 'wrong', but <i>who</i> was 'wrong' in specific disputes. Collective power through neighbourhood solidarity was key to action but could be curtailed by violent gang crime. Interveners in incidents of VAW turned out to need significant physical, social and legal protection against reprisal. However, repeat interveners could become informal leaders wielding influential prosocial reputations that incentivised and facilitated action. Our model integrates multiple perspectives on community action into one analytical framework, which can be used by implementers to ensure that community members receive encouragement, support and protection to act."}, {"Title": "CBT-informed psychological interventions for adult patients with anxiety and depression symptoms: A narrative review of digital treatment options.", "Abstract": "Across a range of age, educational and clinical characteristics, adults experiencing depression and anxiety already use digital technology to manage their symptoms.

This review illustrates potentials and limitations of interventions that specifically leveraged unique features of digital technology and were grounded in the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\nThis systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic database search was conducted in October 2021. Peer-reviewed, English-language studies were included if i) they reported data from RCTs for adults aged 18+ who engaged with CBT-informed digital interventions targeting primarily depression and anxiety; ii) they used at least PHQ-9 or GAD-7 as standardized and validated assessment self-report measures for depression and anxiety.\nFindings from 35 RCTs examining 33 interventions (25 internet-based, 6 mobile-based, a2 mobile/web) are discussed. The quality of the evidence differed widely as many small-scale RCTs reported only short-term feasibility and preliminary efficacy.

To provide a deeper understanding of workplace learning, this study explores the structure and dynamics of advice-seeking networks in two residency programs. <b><i>Approach</i>:</b> We conducted a survey-based social network study. To develop the survey, we conducted focus group discussions and identified three main categories of advice: factual knowledge, clinical reasoning, and procedural skills. We invited a total of 49 emergency medicine and psychiatry residents who had completed at least six months of their training, to nominate their supervisors and peer residents, as their sources of advice, from a roster. Participants identified the number of occasions during the previous month that they turned to each person to seek advice regarding the three broad categories. We calculated the density, centrality, and reciprocity measures for each advice category at each department. <b><i>Findings</i>:</b> The response rates were 100% (n\u2009=\u200921) and 85.7% (n\u2009=\u200924) in the emergency medicine and psychiatry departments, respectively. The advice network of emergency medicine residents was denser, less hierarchical, and less reciprocated compared to the psychiatry residents' network. In both departments, PGY-1s were the top advice-seekers, who turned to PGY-2s, PGY-3s, and supervisors for advice. The \"procedural skills\" network had the lowest density in both departments. There was less overlap in the sources of advice for different advice types in the psychiatry department, implying more selectivity of sources. <b><i>Insights</i>:</b> Complex social structures and dynamics among residents vary by discipline and level of seniority. Program directors can develop tailored educational interventions informed by their departments' specific network patterns to promote a timely and effective advice-seeking culture which in turn, could lead to optimally informed patient care."}, {"Title": "Use of metaphors when treating unexplained medical symptoms.", "Abstract": "The words one chooses to describe personal pain mirror current usage, but may also hold echoes of an individual's lived experience. They may provide clues to the origin of physical symptoms that are medically hard to explain. The aim of this commentary is to propose, on the basis of the available literature, that verbal metaphors can prove effective in the psychotherapy of such conditions. I provide a case history of a 45 year old woman referred to psychiatry because of extreme 'burning' pain in her mouth and tongue. She had been to numerous doctors, had undergone a variety of tests, had tried many medical treatments, and had been prescribed a number of different pharmaceutical agents. She had changed her diet, done her daily dental mouth exercises, drunk a lot of water, but the burning continued and interfered, with her job (she was a teacher), her friendships, and her everyday life. This made her angry and recalcitrant to therapy, but the metaphor 'burning with rage,' as applicable to her pain, worked to establish a good alliance that led to a decrease of symptoms. Burning Mouth Syndrome is a medically unexplained condition of complex etiology that psychotherapy alone cannot reverse. The literature bears out, however, that the use of metaphors can help to open avenues of psychological exploration that accelerate adaptation to pain and improve quality life."}, {"Title": "Childhood adversity, allostatic load, and adult mental health: Study protocol using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort.", "Abstract": "The cumulative burden of chronic stress and life events has been termed allostatic load.

We aimed to empirically validate Leonhard's four classes of psychoses: systematic schizophrenia (SSch), unsystematic (USch), cycloid psychosis (Cyclo), and manic-depressive illness (MDI) using a comprehensive set of explanatory validators. 243 patients with first-episode psychosis were followed between 10 and 31\u00a0years. A wide-ranging assessment was carried out by collecting data on antecedent, illness-related, concurrent, response to treatment, neuromotor abnormalities, and cognitive impairment variables. Compared with USch, Cyclo, and MDI, SSch displayed a pattern of impairments significantly larger across the seven blocks of explanatory variables. There were no significant differences between Cyclo and MDI in explanatory variables. Except for the majority of illness-onset features, USch displayed more substantial abnormalities in the explanatory variables than Cyclo and MDI. SSch and MDI showed higher percentages of correctly classified patients than USch and Cyclo in linear discriminant analyses. Partial validation of Leonhard's classification was found. SSch showed differences in explanatory variables with respect to Cyclo and MDI. USch showed also significant differences in explanatory variables regarding Cyclo and MDI, although with a lower strength than SSch. There was strong empirical evidence of the separation between both Leonhard's schizophrenia subtypes; however, the distinction between the Cyclo and MDI groups was not empirically supported.

Using a drift diffusion model, increased frontal midline theta power during high-conflict, relative to low-conflict, trials predicted a more conservative style of responding through the starting point (bias). During both high- and low-conflict trials, increases in frontal midline theta also predicted improvements in response efficiency (drift rate). Regression analyses provided support for the importance of the starting point bias, which was associated with frontal midline theta over the course of the task above-and-beyond both drift rate and mean reaction time.

Pubertal maturation might also trigger underlying (genetic or other) vulnerabilities in at-risk individuals, influencing brain development trajectories that contribute to the emergence of SZ. This review is the first to integrate links between pubertal development and neural development with cognitive neuroscience research in SZ to form and evaluate these hypotheses, with a focus on the frontal-striatal and frontal-limbic networks and their hypothesized contribution to negative and mood symptoms respectively. To test these hypotheses, longitudinal research with human adolescents is needed that examines the role of sex and pubertal development using large cohorts or high risk samples.

However, despite the benefits, there is a lack of evidence regarding its practice in developing countries such as Southeast Asian Countries. The optimal treatment for PWS has not yet been identified, since most mental health care is provided in hospital-based settings in Southeast Asia. Mental health treatment in Southeast Asia is highly influenced by cultural norms, values, and practices. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: The findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural aspects into the treatment of people with schizophrenia. The sample of unique elements in Southeast Asian mental health recovery include using a close neighbour/cadre as social support and using religious activity to increase hope. Lack of government support, high level of employment, and stigma are the biggest barriers in the PWS recovery process. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE?: There is a research gap regarding the awareness and implementation of mental health recovery in psychiatric programs across the Southeast Asian region which likely impacts the effectiveness of the treatment. The review shows that little research has explored the concept of personal recovery in Southeast Asian Countries.\nINTRODUCTION: Recovery has become an important approach used by mental health services around the world. Many mental health systems have taken steps to move towards more recovery-oriented practices and service delivery.

Connection includes peer support and support groups, relationship status, and limited opportunities to become involved in the community. Hope is found in cultural concepts of hope, stimulating recovery through mental health programs, whilst lack of knowledge and education are the main barriers. Ethnicity is linked to a high level of stigma, but ethnicity also builds identity. Meaning and spirituality manifest in religious activities as the catalyst for recovery. Finally, the opposite of Empowerment is seen in the tendency of people with schizophrenia to remain in a passive position. Further barriers to empowerment are unemployment and a lack of social support.\nIn Southeast Asia, the elements of culture, religiosity, and communality are essential to mental health recovery. The obstacles to recovery are relate to human rights, social support, family involvement, and continuity of care.\nThis review explores the concept of mental health recovery for people who are experiencing psychosis and living in Southeast Asian countries.

Inconsistent definitions, models, measurement tools, and lack of sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of SDM interventions are potential contributors to the limited use of SDM in mental health.\n(1) Provide the first systematic analysis of global development trends and challenges of SDM research; (2) clarify the meaning, role, and measurement of SDM in mental health; (3) create a theoretical framework for key effective SDM components to guide future development and implementation of SDM interventions.\nA comprehensive search strategy was conducted in CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Included reviews focused on SDM interventions for prevention and/or treatment of mental illness in adults. A narrative synthesis was performed to capture the range of interventions, populations, measurement tools, comparisons, and outcomes.\n10 systematic reviews of SDM in mental health were included with 100 nested studies spanning from 2006 to 2020. All reviews focused on dyadic and psychopharmacological decision-making. Primary outcomes of SDM in mental health interventions include treatment satisfaction, medication adherence, symptom severity, quality of life, and hospital readmissions. Participant-related factors unique to SDM in mental health, such as stigma and mental capacity, were not reported.\nThe current landscape of SDM in mental health is overwhelmingly disconnected from the needs and experiences of potential end-users; clients, clinicians, and family members. Most SDM interventions and tools were adapted from physical health and are mainly geared to psychopharmacological decision-making. The SDM in Mental Health Framework (SDM-MH), developed here, expands the scope of decisions to non-psychopharmacological discussions, diversifies the pool of SDM participants and settings, and offers potential primary target outcomes of SDM in mental health to reduce heterogeneity across studies."}, {"Title": "Long-Term Lithium Therapy: Side Effects and Interactions.", "Abstract": "Lithium remains the drug of first choice for prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder, preventing the recurrences of manic and depressive episodes. The longitudinal experiences with lithium administration greatly exceed those with other mood stabilizers. Among the adverse side effects of lithium, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, thyroid, metabolic, cognitive, dermatological, cardiologic, and sexual are listed. Probably, the most important negative effect of lithium, occurring mostly after 10-20 years of its administration, is interstitial nephropathy. Beneficial side-effects of long-term lithium therapy also occur such as anti-suicidal, antiviral, and anti-dementia ones. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of lithium, mostly those with other drugs, may have an impact on the success of long-term lithium treatment. This paper makes the narrative updated review of lithium-induced side-effects and interactions that may influence its prophylactic effect in bipolar disorder. Their description, mechanisms, and management strategies are provided. The papers appearing in recent years focused mainly on the long-term lithium treatment are reviewed in detail, including recent research performed at Department of Psychiatry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland. Their own observations on ultra-long lithium treatment of patients with bipolar disorder are also presented.

This study aims to reveal the relationship and illustrate potential mechanism by exploring the alteration of cerebellar functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia patients with comorbidity metabolic syndrome. Thirty-six schizophrenia patients with comorbidity of metabolic syndrome (SCZ-MetS), 45 schizophrenia patients without metabolic syndrome (SCZ-nMetS) and 39 healthy controls (HC) were recruited in this study. We constructed FC map of cerebello-cortical circuit and used moderation effect analysis to reveal complicated relationship among FC, psychiatric symptom and metabolic disturbance. Components of metabolic syndrome were significantly correlated with positive symptom score and negative symptom score. Importantly, the dysconnectivity between cognitive module of cerebellum and left middle frontal gyrus in SCZ-nMetS was recuperative increased in SCZ-MetS, and was significantly correlated with general symptom score. Finally, we observed significant moderation effect of body mass index on this correlation. The present findings further supported the potential relationship between emergence of metabolic syndrome and weaker psychiatric symptom, and provided neuroimaging evidence. The mechanism of intrinsic therapeutic link involved functional change of cerebello-cortical circuit."}, {"Title": "\"It's about What You've Assigned to the Salad\": Focus Group Discussions on the Relationship between Food and Mood.", "Abstract": "Current observational and interventional studies in nutritional psychiatry suggest that healthy dietary patterns rich in fresh whole foods could protect against depressive symptoms, and that unhealthy dietary patterns high in ultra-processed and refined foods could contribute to depressive symptoms. However, no studies have explored detailed subjective accounts behind the food and mood relationship. This study aimed to uncover unknown factors in the human experience with food and mood. Using a phenomenological framework, this focus group study applied thematic template analysis to accounts of over 50 Australians aged between 18 and 72. Three themes were identified from the transcript of the focus groups: (i) reactive and proactive relationships with food, (ii) acknowledgement of individual diversity relating to eating and mental health, and (iii) improving mood by removing food restriction and eating intuitively. The data highlights the complexity of the relationship between food and mood that extends beyond biological mechanisms which could be used to extend current epidemiological and intervention studies in the field of dietary patterns and depression."}, {"Title": "Impaired Non-Selective Response Inhibition in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Two prominent features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are the inability to inhibit intrusive thoughts and behaviors and pathological doubt or intolerance of uncertainty. Previous study showed that uncertain context modeled by equiprobable presentation of excitatory (Go) and inhibitory (NoGo) stimuli requires non-selective response inhibition in healthy subjects. In other words, it requires transient global inhibition triggered not only by excitatory stimuli but also by inhibitory stimuli. Meanwhile, it is unknown whether OCD patients show abnormal brain activity of the non-selective response inhibition system. In order to test this assumption, we performed an fMRI study with an equiprobable Go/NoGo task involving fourteen patients with OCD and compared them with 34 healthy controls. Patients with OCD showed pathological slowness in the Go/NoGo task. The non-selective response inhibition system in OCD included all brain areas seen in healthy controls and, in addition, involved the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the anterior insula/frontal operculum (AIFO). Moreover, a between-group comparison revealed hypoactivation of brain regions within cingulo-opercular and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits in OCD. Among hypoactivated areas, the right ACC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were associated with non-selective inhibition. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that OCD slowness was associated with decreased activation in cingulate regions and two brain areas related to non-selective inhibition: the right DLPFC and the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These results suggest that non-selective response inhibition is impaired in OCD, which could be a potential explanation for a relationship between inhibitory deficits and the other remarkable characteristic of OCD known as intolerance of uncertainty."}, {"Title": "The Global Pandemic as a Life-Changer?

The survey aimed to determine how the public in different social groups and age categories assessed the impact of the pandemic on their personal and professional lives, and where and to what extent respondents sought psychological and medical help to cope with the effects caused by the pandemic. The survey was conducted using the CAWI technique based on a questionnaire designed by an interdisciplinary team of experts. The study indicated that 61.9% of respondents declared that the COVID-19 pandemic did not bring any good, and had rather adverse effects on their lives, and 57.7% of respondents declared that the pandemic had not affected their professional lives. Nearly half of the respondents (45.0%) declared that although the pandemic forced them to change their personal lives, it did not work out for them. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, every eighth respondent (12.3%) contacted a mental health specialist-a psychologist, or psychiatrist.

The characteristics of sexual abuse were correlated with the medical severity of the patients, as well as the number, the duration of their hospitalization(s), and the time until disclosure.\nThe results show the central place of SA in adolescent psychiatry, with a prevalence of 28.5% and a cumulative hospital stay which is five times longer than average. Correlations have been observed between the number of suicide attempts and the number of abuses reported. The medical severity of patients is significantly increased when the named aggressor is an adult. The number of hospitalizations is positively correlated with the number of reported abuses, as well as with the intrafamilial and adult status of the perpetrator. Finally, an early age of onset, repeated abuse, and the intrafamilial nature of the abuse are associated with a longer time to disclosure.\nThe severity of adolescent psychiatric situation is statistically in favor of a history of SA, which should therefore be actively explored during care."}, {"Title": "Suicidal Offenders and Non-Offenders with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: A Retrospective Evaluation of Distinguishing Factors Using Machine Learning.", "Abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) have an elevated risk of suicidality. The same has been found for people within the penitentiary system, suggesting a cumulative effect for offender patients suffering from SSD. While there appear to be overlapping characteristics, there is little research on factors distinguishing between offenders and non-offenders with SSD regarding suicidality. Our study therefore aimed at evaluating distinguishing such factors through the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms on a dataset of 232 offenders and 167 non-offender patients with SSD and history of suicidality. With an AUC of 0.81, Na\u00efve Bayes outperformed all other ML algorithms. The following factors emerged as most powerful in their interplay in distinguishing between offender and non-offender patients with a history of suicidality: Prior outpatient psychiatric treatment, regular intake of antipsychotic medication, global cognitive deficit, a prescription of antidepressants during the referenced hospitalisation and higher levels of anxiety and a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation measured by an adapted positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). Interestingly, neither aggression nor overall psychopathology emerged as distinguishers between the two groups. The present findings contribute to a better understanding of suicidality in offender and non-offender patients with SSD and their differing characteristics."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the implementation and impact of a new model of care for integrating children and young people's acute mental healthcare in a paediatric setting: a protocol for a realist, mixed-methods approach.", "Abstract": "The mental health of children and young people in the UK has been declining and has continued to worsen throughout the pandemic, leading to an increase in mental health-related emergencies.

In particular, stress at school and in relation to learning is a major problem in this age group. Studies in Germany have indicated that the pandemic has led to a reduced quality of life (QoL) and an increased risk for psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Schools are an ideal setting for interventions against stress, which is one of the strongest predictors for the development of psychosocial problems. The present study seeks to address stress by means of a short prevention training programme in schools, including emotion regulation, mindfulness, and self-compassion. In addition to information material for self-study, students should have the opportunity to actively deal with the topic of stress and develop coping strategies within a short space of time. In contrast to very long stress reduction programmes that often last several weeks, the programme is delivered in just 90 min.\nThe effectiveness of the short and economical prevention programme LessStress will be examined in a cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) encompassing 1894 students. At several measurement time points, students from two groups (intervention and control) will be asked about their subjectively perceived stress levels, among other aspects. Due to the clustered nature of the data, mainly multilevel analyses will be performed.\nIn Germany, there are no nationwide universal prevention programmes for students against stress in schools, and this gap has become more evident since the outbreak of the pandemic. Universal stress prevention in schools may be a starting point to promote resilience. By dealing with stress in a healthy way, mental health can be strengthened and maintained.

Across medical specialties we compared which of the CanMEDS competency domains these residents failed to meet.\nWe found 116 cases of residents dismissed from their training programmes who challenged the decision of the program director before the board. In general, most residents were unable to meet the requirements of several CanMEDS competency domains (usually: medical expert, communicator, and professional). In surgery, all dismissed residents failed to meet the competency domain of the medical expert, while most of the dismissed psychiatry residents met this domain. In specialties with a primarily diagnostic task, more dismissed residents failed to meet the competency domain of the scholar, while dismissed general medicine residents (for example family medicine and nursing homecare) were less likely to do so.

Studies not specific to adult (only those >18 years old were included) patients with self-inflicted stabbing wounds were excluded. Included studies were separated into 2 groups: case reports and cohort studies. Simple summative statistical analyses were performed. The quality of evidence was assessed using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools.\nThirty-four case reports, 3 cohort studies, and zero systematic literature reviews met the inclusion and quality assessment criteria. A total of 184 cases of self-stabbing were identified, 66% of which included male patients. The mean age of cohort patients was 44 years. The mean age of case report patients was 47 years. The most common tool for stabbing was a knife. Common stabbing locations included the neck, chest, and abdomen. Commonly reported psychiatric diagnoses included mood disorders and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Self-stabbing characteristics important to psychiatry were inconsistently reported across studies.\nThis literature review found that self-stabbing appears to be a male-preferred method and may be associated with mood disorders. Inconsistent reporting of relevant psychiatric data such as psychiatric diagnosis, previous psychiatric history, suicidal intent, and intoxication is present in our review and is potentially due to a lack of reports from the psychiatric perspective.

It aims to build a bridge between two fields that are frequently siloed off from each other: interventional research and phenomenologically informed research. Recent years have witnessed a revival of phenomenological approaches in mental health, often - but not only - as a means of connecting the subjective character of experience with neurobiological explanatory accounts of illness. Rich phenomenological knowledge accrued in schizophrenia, and wider psychosis research, has opened up new opportunities for improving prediction, early detection, diagnosis, prognostic stratification, treatment and ethics of care. Novel qualitative studies of delusions and hallucinations have challenged longstanding assumptions about their nature and meaning, uncovering highly complex subjective dimensions that are not adequately captured by quantitative methodologies. Interdisciplinary and participatory research efforts, informed by phenomenological insights, have prompted revisions of pre-established narratives of mental disorder dominated by a dysfunction framework and by researcher-centric outcome measures. Despite these recent advances, there has been relatively little effort to integrate and translate phenomenological insights across applied clinical research, with the goal of producing more meaningful, patient-valued results. It is our contention that phenomenological psychopathology - as the basic science of psychiatry - represents an important methodology for advancing evidence-based practices in mental health, and ultimately improving real-world outcomes. Setting this project into motion requires a greater emphasis on subjectivity and the structures of experience, more attention to the quality and patient-centredness of outcome measures, and the identification of treatment targets that matter most to patients."}, {"Title": "Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the schizophrenia-spectrum: current developments in psychopathology research.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (SSD) frequently involve symptoms that usually are ascribed to nonpsychotic disorder spectra, such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS).

In this review, we provide an overview of recent literature within the field of OCS in SSD, with a focus on psychopathology research.\nOCS are seen in approximately a quarter of patients with SSD or at-risk mental state of psychosis. They are associated with more severe clinical features and specific temporal patterns of OCS may be linked with different clinical trajectories. However, the current definitions of OCS have been criticized for their overinclusive nature, which is a limiting step for differential diagnosis and more precise prognostic stratification. Specific phenomenological features, including a link with experiential anomalies (disorders of basic self), have been suggested to provide clinically relevant distinctions.\nThe presence of OCS in SSD is associated with more severe clinical features and invites a higher clinical attention and perspectival monitoring.

A clinical expert does not only have general textbook knowledge, but is sensitive to what is demanded for the individual patient in a particular situation. A method that can do justice to the subjective and situation-specific nature of clinical expertise is ethnography. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) involves an interpretive, evaluative process of optimizing stimulation parameters, which makes it an interesting case to study clinical expertise. The aim of this study is to explore the role of clinical expertise through an ethnography of the particular case of DBS optimization in OCD. In line with the topic of the special issue this article is a part of, we will also\u00a0use our findings to reflect on ethnography as a method to study complex phenomena like clinical expertise. This ethnography of DBS optimization is\u00a0based on 18\u00a0months of participant observation and nine in-depth interviews with a team of expert clinicians who have been treating over 80 OCD patients since 2005. By repeatedly observing particular situations for an extended period of time, we found that there are recurrent patterns in the ways clinicians interact with patients. These patterns of clinical practice shape the possibilities clinicians have for making sense of DBS-induced changes in patients' lived experience and behavior. Collective established patterns of clinical practice are dynamic and change under the influence of individual learning experiences in particular situations, opening up new possibilities and challenges. We conclude that\u00a0patterns of clinical practice and particular situations are mutually constitutive. Ethnography is ideally suited to bring this relation into view thanks to its broad temporal scope and focus on the life-world. Based on our findings, we argue that clinical expertise not only implies skillful engagement with a concrete situation but also with the patterns of clinical practice that shape what is possible in this specific situation.

Despite initial excitement, actual progress made by computational psychiatry seems stagnant. Meanwhile, understanding of the human brain has benefited tremendously from recent progress in intracranial neuroscience. Specifically, invasive techniques such as stereotactic electroencephalography, electrocorticography, and deep brain stimulation have provided a unique opportunity to precisely measure and causally modulate neurophysiological activity in the living human brain. In this review, we summarize progress and drawbacks in both computational psychiatry and invasive electrophysiology and propose that their combination presents a highly promising new direction-invasive computational psychiatry. The value of this approach is at least twofold. First, it advances our mechanistic understanding of the neural computations of mental states by providing a spatiotemporally precise depiction of neural activity that is traditionally unattainable using noninvasive techniques with human subjects. Second, it offers a direct and immediate way to modulate brain states through stimulation of algorithmically defined neural regions and circuits (i.e., algorithmic targeting), thus providing both causal and therapeutic insights. We then present depression as a use case where the combination of computational and invasive approaches has already shown initial success.

Long recognized to be heritable, recent evidence shows that psychiatric disorders are influenced by thousands of genetic variants acting together. Most of these variants are commonly occurring, meaning that every individual has a genetic risk to each psychiatric disorder, from low to high. A series of large-scale genetic studies have discovered an increasing number of common and rare genetic variants robustly associated with major psychiatric disorders. The most convincing biological interpretation of the genetic findings implicates altered synaptic function in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. However, the mechanistic understanding is still incomplete. In line with their extensive clinical and epidemiological overlap, psychiatric disorders appear to exist on genetic continua and share a large degree of genetic risk with one another. This provides further support to the notion that current psychiatric diagnoses do not represent distinct pathogenic entities, which may inform ongoing attempts to reconceptualize psychiatric nosology. Psychiatric disorders also share genetic influences with a range of behavioral and somatic traits and diseases, including brain structures, cognitive function, immunological phenotypes and cardiovascular disease, suggesting shared genetic etiology of potential clinical importance. Current polygenic risk score tools, which predict individual genetic susceptibility to illness, do not yet provide clinically actionable information. However, their precision is likely to improve in the coming years, and they may eventually become part of clinical practice, stressing the need to educate clinicians and patients about their potential use and misuse.

On the other hand, international studies have shown that psychiatric emergency departments (pED) experienced a decrease in presentations and admissions.\nRetrospective chart review of all pED presentations and admissions during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic in Germany (Covid-19 period: 3/2/20 to 05/24/20) in a psychiatric hospital in Berlin compared to 1 year earlier (pre-Covid-19 period). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed.\nWe observed no statistical significant changes in overall pED presentations and overall hospital admissions during the Covid-19 period compared to the pre-Covid-19 period (813 vs. 894, -\u20099.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.064 and (363 vs. 437, -\u200916.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.080 respectively). In the subgroup analysis, less patients with depressive disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.035) and with personality disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.002) presented to the pED, a larger number of presentations with schizophrenia was observed (p\u2009=\u20090.020). In the Covid-19 period, less patients with substance use disorder and paranoid schizophrenia were admitted to the hospital via the pED than in the pre-Covid-19 period (p\u2009=\u20090.035 and p\u2009=\u20090.006, respectively). Bed capacity was reduced in the Covid-19 period by -\u200932.8% (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001). Presentations in police custody were 13.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.029) higher during the Covid-19 compared to pre-Covid-19 period, with higher rates in female presentations (p\u2009=\u20090.008) and suicide attempts (p\u2009=\u20090.012) and less hospital admissions (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Logistic regression analyses revealed that positive predictors for pED presentation during Covid-19 period were police custody (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001), being redirected from another hospital (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001), suicide attempt (p\u2009=\u20090.038), suicidal thoughts (p\u2009=\u20090.004), presentation with paranoid schizophrenia (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and bipolar and manic disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.004), negative predictors were hospital admission (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001), depressive disorders (p\u2009=\u20090.021) and personality disorders (p\u2009<\u2009\u00a00.001).\nA larger number of presentations in police custody during the Covid-19 period may represent untreated medical needs. This was seen predominantly in female patients, suggesting this subgroup might have suffered particularly under lockdown measures. Patients with paranoid schizophrenia were the only subgroup, which increased in absolute numbers, also suggesting a particular lockdown effect. Reduced bed capacity due to infection curbing measures is suggestive to have played an important role in augmenting the threshold for hospital admissions."}, {"Title": "Genetic, individual, and familial risk correlates of brain network controllability in major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Many therapeutic interventions in psychiatry can be viewed as attempts to influence the brain's large-scale, dynamic network state transitions. Building on connectome-based graph analysis and control theory, Network Control Theory is emerging as a powerful tool to quantify network controllability-i.e., the influence of one brain region over others regarding dynamic network state transitions. If and how network controllability is related to mental health remains elusive. Here, from Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, we inferred structural connectivity and inferred calculated network controllability parameters to investigate their association with genetic and familial risk in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, n\u2009=\u2009692) and healthy controls (n\u2009=\u2009820). First, we establish that controllability measures differ between healthy controls and MDD patients while not varying with current symptom severity or remission status. Second, we show that controllability in MDD patients is associated with polygenic scores for MDD and psychiatric cross-disorder risk. Finally, we provide evidence that controllability varies with familial risk of MDD and bipolar disorder as well as with body mass index. In summary, we show that network controllability is related to genetic, individual, and familial risk in MDD patients. We discuss how these insights into individual variation of network controllability may inform mechanistic models of treatment response prediction and personalized intervention-design in mental health."}, {"Title": "Irving Kirsch opens a window on antidepressant medications.", "Abstract": "When it comes to antidepressant medications - popular, backbone drugs of modern psychiatry - even learned scholars and savvy clinicians find it difficult to separate honest, rigorous research from that which thrives on hidden agendas and ulterior motives.

Therefore, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) holds promise as a microbiota-modulating treatment for MDD. Yet, to date, there are no published controlled studies evaluating the use of FMT for MDD. This study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of FMT for MDD.\nThe study was an 8-week, double-blind, 2:1 parallel group, randomized controlled pilot trial (<i>n</i> = 15) of enema-delivered FMT (<i>n</i> = 10) compared with a placebo enema (<i>n</i> = 5) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD.\nRecruitment was completed within 2 months, with 0% attrition and 100% attendance at key study appointments. There were no major protocol deviations. The placebo and blinding strategies were considered successful; nurses and participants correctly guessing their treatment allocation at a rate similar to that anticipated by chance. No serious or severe adverse events were reported in either group, and there were no significant differences in mild-to-moderate adverse events between groups (median of 2 adverse events per participant reported in both groups). Furthermore, the 12/15 participants who completed the Week 2 participant satisfaction survey agreed or strongly agreed that the enema delivery was tolerable and that they would have the treatment again if required. Whilst the study was not designed to measure clinical outcomes, exploratory data also suggested that the active FMT treatment may lead to improvements in gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in this population, noting that irritable bowel syndrome is commonly comorbid with MDD.\nAll feasibility targets were met or exceeded. This study found that enema-delivered FMT is feasible, acceptable, well-tolerated, and safe in patients with MDD. The findings of this study support further research to evaluate clinical efficacy, and the use of this protocol is supported."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatric Symptom Burden across Neurodegenerative Disorders and its Association with Function.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are prevalent in neurodegenerative disorders, however, their frequency and impact on function across different disorders is not well understood. We compared the frequency and severity of NPS across Alzheimer's disease (AD) (either with mild cognitive impairment or dementia), Cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and explored the association between NPS burden and function.\nWe obtained data from Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) that included following cohorts: AD (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009111), CVD (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009148), PD (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u2009136), FTD (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200950) and ALS (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200936). We compared the frequency and severity of individual NPS (assessed by the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire) across cohorts using generalized estimating equations and analysis of variance.

Post-hoc comparisons suggested that this finding was driven by the FTD group, however, the differences did not remain significant following Bonferroni correction. There were no differences among cohorts in terms of the association between NPS burden and IADLs.\nNPS frequency and severity are markedly greater in FTD as compared to other neurodegenerative diseases.

This stems from prolonged periods of lockdowns, restricted support networks and media panic, alongside altered healthcare provision.\nWe aimed to review the evidence regarding the psychological impact on new and expecting mothers following changes to antenatal and postnatal service provision within the UK throughout the pandemic.\nWe conducted a narrative literature search of major databases (PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar). The literature was critically reviewed by experts within the field of antenatal and perinatal mental health.\nChanges to service provision, including the introduction of telemedicine services, attendance of antenatal appointments without partners or loved ones, and lack of support during the intrapartum period, are associated with increased stress, depression and anxiety. Encouraging women and their partners to engage with aspects of positive psychology through newly introduced digital platforms and virtual service provision has the potential to improve access to holistic care and increase mental well-being. An online course, designed by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in response to changes to service provision, focuses on postnatal recovery inspiration and support for motherhood (PRISM) through a 5-week programme. So far, the course has received positive feedback.\nThe pandemic has contributed to increased rates of mental illness among pregnant and new mothers in the UK.

They profoundly affect individuals' well-being and impose a substantial financial burden on societies and governments. However, despite decades of extensive research, the effectiveness of current therapeutics for mental disorders is often not satisfactory or well tolerated by the patient. Moreover, most novel therapeutic candidates fail in clinical testing during the most expensive phases (II and III), which results in the withdrawal of pharma companies from investing in the field. It also brings into question the effectiveness of using animal models in preclinical studies to discover new therapeutic agents and predict their potential for treating mental illnesses in humans. Here, we focus on rodents as animal models and propose that they are essential for preclinical investigations of candidate therapeutic agents' mechanisms of action and for testing their safety and efficiency. Nevertheless, we argue that there is a need for a paradigm shift in the methodologies used to measure animal behavior in laboratory settings. Specifically, behavioral readouts obtained from short, highly controlled tests in impoverished environments and social contexts as proxies for complex human behavioral disorders might be of limited face validity. Conversely, animal models that are monitored in more naturalistic environments over long periods display complex and ethologically relevant behaviors that reflect evolutionarily conserved endophenotypes of translational value. We present how semi-natural setups in which groups of mice are individually tagged, and video recorded continuously can be attainable and affordable. Moreover, novel open-source machine-learning techniques for pose estimation enable continuous and automatic tracking of individual body parts in groups of rodents over long periods. The trajectories of each individual animal can further be subjected to supervised machine learning algorithms for automatic detection of specific behaviors (e.g., chasing, biting, or fleeing) or unsupervised automatic detection of behavioral motifs (e.g., stereotypical movements that might be harder to name or label manually). Compared to studies of animals in the wild, semi-natural environments are more compatible with neural and genetic manipulation techniques. As such, they can be used to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying naturalistic behavior. Hence, we suggest that such a paradigm possesses the best out of classical ethology and the reductive behaviorist approach and may provide a breakthrough in discovering new efficient therapies for mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Examining the shared etiology of psychopathology with genome-wide association studies.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have ushered in a new era of reproducible discovery in psychiatric genetics. The field has now identified hundreds of common genetic variants that are associated with mental disorders, and many of them influence more than one disorder. By advancing the understanding of causal biology underlying psychopathology, GWAS results are poised to inform the development of novel therapeutics, stratification of at-risk patients, and perhaps even the revision of top-down classification systems in psychiatry. Here, we provide a concise review of GWAS findings with an emphasis on findings that have elucidated the shared genetic etiology of psychopathology, summarizing insights at three levels of analysis: <i>1</i>) genome-wide architecture; <i>2</i>) networks, pathways, and gene sets; and <i>3</i>) individual variants/genes. Three themes emerge from these efforts. First, all psychiatric phenotypes are heritable, highly polygenic, and influenced by many pleiotropic variants with incomplete penetrance. Second, GWAS results highlight the broad etiological roles of neuronal biology, system-wide effects over localized effects, and early neurodevelopment as a critical period. Third, many loci that are robustly associated with multiple forms of psychopathology harbor genes that are involved in synaptic structure and function. Finally, we conclude our review by discussing the implications that GWAS results hold for the field of psychiatry, as well as expected challenges and future directions in the next stage of psychiatric genetics."}, {"Title": "Hallucinations and Hallucinogens: Psychopathology or Wisdom?", "Abstract": "Hallucinations are currently associated almost exclusively with psychopathological states. While it is evident that hallucinations can indicate psychopathology or neurological disorders, we should remember that hallucinations also commonly occur in people without any signs of psychopathology. A similar case occurs in the case of hallucinogenic drugs, which have been long associated with psychopathology and insanity. However, during the last decades a huge body of research has shown that certain kinds of hallucinations, exerted by hallucinogenic drugs, may serve to improve mental health. We propose that, in light of historical, epidemiological, and scientific research, hallucinations can be better characterized as a common phenomenon associated sometimes with psychopathology but also with functional and even beneficial outcomes. In the last sections of the manuscript, we extend our argument, suggesting that hallucinations can offer a via regia to knowledge of the mind and the world. This radical shift in the cultural interpretation of hallucinations could have several implications for fields such as drug policy, civil law, and psychiatry, as well as for the stigma associated with mental disorders."}, {"Title": "[Results of the survey on care units and caring for eating disorders in Spain.

Methods: a cross-sectional, observational study based on a questionnaire sent online to members of the Spanish Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SENPE) and to the Nutrition Area of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition (SEEN). The data were analyzed according to number of beds of the hospitals surveyed (< 500/\u2265 500). Results: 23 responses from 8 autonomous communities. In 87 % of NUs care was given to eating disorders; 65.2 % had a specific process; 91.3 % collaborated with Psychiatry; 34.8 % had their own hospitalization area; 56.5 % had a day hospital, but 21.7 % participated in it; 39.1 % had a monographic consultation office; nutritional education was carried out in 87 %, especially by nursing; individualized diets and oral supplements were frequently prescribed in 39.1 % and 56.5 %, respectively; only the largest hospitals participated in research on EDs (62.5 %), and 21.7 % collaborated with patient associations.

Recently, an essential step was taken to replace TRD with difficult-to-treat depression (DTD), pointing to some drawbacks associated with this terminology and identifying addressable barriers. In line with the DTD concept, we discuss why terming this population of patients as TRD could be semantically and clinically misleading. We then suggest replacing TRD with quasi-tenacious depression (QTD), a model and terminology that are derived from a potentially measurable outcome, the tenacity index (TI). QTD predicts that in theory remission is achievable by providing suitable treatments at hand. QTD states that every patient with major depression (even those who respond well) has some degree of tenacity that needs to be overcome by the use of proper treatment modalities. Ergo, in patients with a higher TI, due to the dearth of available armamentaria, one might suffice to achieve a partial resolution of symptoms balanced with an optimal quality of life. However, QTD calls for an incessant pursuit of novel treatments and the identification of contributing factors leading to high TI. On a track toward personalized psychiatry, and in harmony with DTD, QTD embraces all key barriers leading to a failure to treatment response and tries to provide a measurable entity for a better clinical decision while conveying a dynamic positive outlook of the disorder for both patients and health care providers."}, {"Title": "Perinatal mental health in medical school curricula: a national scoping survey of British universities and student psychiatry societies.", "Abstract": "With increasing recognition of the prevalence and impact of perinatal mental health (PMH) disorders comes a responsibility to ensure that tomorrow's doctors can support families during the perinatal period.

Measurement-based care is an evidence-based approach to psychotherapy that improves outcomes for clients, clinicians, and organizations by routinely administering and evaluating measures to clients. Despite this, research on measurement-based care systems for autistic clients is sparse. To address this gap, we developed an autism-adapted measurement-based care (MBC-AUT) system for and with autistic people and pilot tested the system in an outpatient psychiatry clinic to investigate the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, benefits, and barriers to this system for clients and clinicians. Findings suggested that the MBC-AUT system was a feasible and acceptable system for the first 18 autistic youth, their caregivers, and autistic adults to use the system. In semi-structured interviews, clients and clinicians discussed the benefits of the MBC-AUT system to various therapeutic processes, as well as several important barriers to the use of the system. We offer potential solutions to address these barriers and to reduce client and clinician burden, and propose future directions for this line of research to increase access to more autistic people. As autistic clients continue to seek psychological services amid social landscapes of increasing complexity (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic), efforts to enhance the delivery of psychotherapy for this population are critical."}, {"Title": "Adjunctive minocycline for major depressive disorder: A sub-study exploring peripheral immune-inflammatory markers and associated treatment response.", "Abstract": "Adjunctive minocycline shows promise in treating affective and psychotic disorders; however, the therapeutic mechanism remains unclear.

We examine the extent to which 'alternatives' - including 'Postpsychiatry', 'Open Dialogue', the 'Power, Threat and Meaning Framework' and Service User Involvement in Research - really do depart from mainstream models in terms of theory, practice and empirical research and identify some shortcomings in each. We propose an approach which seeks more firmly to ground mental distress within the lifeworld of those who experience it, with a particular focus on the biopsychosocial niches within which we make our lives, and the impact of systematic disadvantage, structural violence and other toxic exposures within the spaces and places that constitute and constrain many everyday lives. Further, we argue that a truly alternative psychiatry requires psychiatric professionals to go beyond simply listening to the voices of service users: to overcome epistemic injustice requires professionals to recognise that those who have experience of mental health services have their own expertise in accounting for their distress and in evaluating alternative forms of treatment. Finally we suggest that, if 'another psychiatry' is possible, this requires a radical reimagination of the role and responsibilities of the medically trained psychiatrist within and outside the clinical encounter."}, {"Title": "Childhood Maltreatment and Mental Health Problems: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Quasi-Experimental Studies.", "Abstract": "Childhood maltreatment is associated with mental health problems, but the extent to which this relationship is causal remains unclear. To strengthen causal inference, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies examining the relationship between childhood maltreatment and mental health problems.\nA search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase was conducted for peer-reviewed, English-language articles from database inception until January 1, 2022. Studies were included if they examined the association between childhood maltreatment and mental health problems using a quasi-experimental method (e.g., twin/sibling differences design, children of twins design, adoption design, fixed-effects design, random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, natural experiment, propensity score matching, or inverse probability weighting).\nThirty-four quasi-experimental studies were identified, comprising 54,646 independent participants. Before quasi-experimental adjustment for confounding, childhood maltreatment was moderately associated with mental health problems (Cohen's d=0.56, 95% CI=0.41, 0.71). After quasi-experimental adjustment, a small association between childhood maltreatment and mental health problems remained (Cohen's d=0.31, 95% CI=0.24, 0.37). This adjusted association between childhood maltreatment and mental health was consistent across different quasi-experimental methods, and generalized across different psychiatric disorders.\nThese findings are consistent with a small, causal contribution of childhood maltreatment to mental health problems. Furthermore, the findings suggest that part of the overall risk of mental health problems in individuals exposed to maltreatment is due to wider genetic and environmental risk factors. Therefore, preventing childhood maltreatment and addressing wider psychiatric risk factors in individuals exposed to maltreatment could help to prevent psychopathology."}, {"Title": "The Precision in Psychiatry (PIP) study: Testing an internet-based methodology for accelerating research in treatment prediction and personalisation.", "Abstract": "Evidence-based treatments for depression exist but not all patients benefit from them. Efforts to develop predictive models that can assist clinicians in allocating treatments are ongoing, but there are major issues with acquiring the volume and breadth of data needed to train these models. We examined the feasibility, tolerability, patient characteristics, and data quality of a novel protocol for internet-based treatment research in psychiatry that may help advance this field.\nA fully internet-based protocol was used to gather repeated observational data from patient cohorts receiving internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) (N\u2009=\u2009600) or antidepressant medication treatment (N\u2009=\u2009110). At baseline, participants provided\u2009>\u2009600 data points of self-report data, spanning socio-demographics, lifestyle, physical health, clinical and other psychological variables and completed 4 cognitive tests. They were followed weekly and completed another detailed clinical and cognitive assessment at week 4. In this paper, we describe our study design, the demographic and clinical characteristics of participants, their treatment adherence, study retention and compliance, the quality of the data gathered, and qualitative feedback from patients on study design and implementation.\nParticipant retention was 92% at week 3 and 84% for the final assessment. The relatively short study duration of 4\u00a0weeks was sufficient to reveal early treatment effects; there were significant reductions in 11 transdiagnostic psychiatric symptoms assessed, with the largest improvement seen for depression. Most participants (66%) reported being distracted at some point during the study, 11% failed 1 or more attention checks and 3% consumed an intoxicating substance. Data quality was nonetheless high, with near perfect 4-week test retest reliability for self-reported height (ICC\u2009=\u20090.97).\nAn internet-based methodology can be used efficiently to gather large amounts of detailed patient data during iCBT and antidepressant treatment. Recruitment was rapid, retention was relatively high and data quality was good. This paper provides a template methodology for future internet-based treatment studies, showing that such an approach facilitates data collection at a scale required for machine learning and other data-intensive methods that hope to deliver algorithmic tools that can aid clinical decision-making in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "<i>Ongwen</i> and Mental Health Defenses at the International Criminal Court.", "Abstract": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) case against Lord's Resistance Army commander and former child soldier Dominic Ongwen of Uganda resulted in a guilty verdict and 25-year prison sentence. Mr. Ongwen unsuccessfully raised defenses based on mental health. These included fitness to stand trial, insanity under Article 31(1)(a) of the Rome Statute (a first at the ICC), mitigation in sentencing based on diminished mental capacity, duress (also a first), and the cumulative effects of mental health and duress. These defenses were hampered by limited and ambiguous textual support, which occurs in a politico-legal context that is cautious regarding such defenses. Another group of challenges comes from the inherent difficulty of international forensic practice. In regard to how mental health affects the duress defense, the text of the Rome Statute and the <i>Ongwen</i> decision create a burdensome legal framework for defendants, particularly where mental illness limits but does not \"destroy\" decision-making, as Article 31(1)(a) requires for an insanity acquittal. Going forward, defense teams may attempt to address the court's all-or-nothing conception of mental illness, perhaps arguing a diminished mental capacity theory that accounts for psychiatric function that is reduced but not destroyed."}, {"Title": "Resource Allocation and Forensic Ethics.", "Abstract": "Developing a comprehensive theory of forensic ethics has proved a challenge for the profession since Alan Stone questioned the presence of psychiatrists in the courtroom in 1982. Two schools of thought have developed: a \"principlist\" approach associated with Appelbaum and an approach focused on narrative and context associated with Griffith. Both approaches, and their intellectual progeny, focus primarily upon the relationship between forensic evaluator, forensic subject, and the legal system. Yet the scarcity of forensic psychiatrists renders them a resource whose allocation, often self-driven, has significant implications for ethics. Rather than focus primarily upon questions related to subject-evaluator relations and evaluator work product, a comprehensive ethic for forensic psychiatry must also prioritize the ethics concerns of resource allocation."}, {"Title": "Mental Health and Legal Implications of Access to the Outdoors during Incarceration.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of mental disorders and substance use disorders among incarcerated populations has called attention to the availability of mental health services in U.S. jails and prisons. Yet, structural factors, such as access to outdoor recreation, can also shape mental health in correctional environments, and U.S. jails and prisons often restrict incarcerated people from going outside. This article examines correctional policies on outdoor access, including mental health implications and related litigation. Research supports the widely held view that outdoor access can be an important determinant of mental health; nevertheless, U.S. courts have come to varying conclusions about the rights of incarcerated people to such access, leading to a patchwork of legal precedents and institutional practices with some striking inequities. For example, in California, pretrial detainees who have not been convicted of any crimes may be denied outdoor access for years, whereas convicted individuals on death row typically have access to weekly outdoor time. By examining mental health literature and case law, the authors suggest general principles for the provision of outdoor access to incarcerated individuals, as well as call for additional research on the adverse effects of the common practice of restricting such access."}, {"Title": "Delirium secondary to anticholinergics.", "Abstract": "We present a case of a young man who developed sudden deterioration in his physical and mental state whilst being treated as an inpatient for substance-induced psychosis.

An epidemiological examination at a national level can help to identify risk profiles and pathways of care in this population.\nWe explored the French nationwide hospital discharge database (Programme de M\u00e9dicalisation des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information, PMSI) to identify any MSSA taking place between 2012 and 2019. Relevant demographic and medical information was collected about the first MSSA of each attempter. Data from 2010 and 2011 were used to verify the absence of prior attempts.\nFirst occurrences of MSSAs amounted to 81 959 cases over 8 years, with a mean age of 45.8 years, and 53.6% women. Incidence was higher in women (18.1 <i>v</i>. 17.3 per 1 00 000). The most common suicide method was deliberate self-poisoning (64.9% of cases). In comparison, violent methods associated higher mortality and comorbidity and were more frequent in men. The most common mental disorders were mood disorders (55.6%) and substance use disorders (46.2%). A minority of MSSA survivors were hospitalised in psychiatry (32.5%), mostly women.\nMSSAs are frequent and easy to identify. There is a need to reinforce the continuity of psychiatric care for this population given the high risk of subsequent suicide, and the low rates of psychiatric hospitalisation after an MSSA even if violent methods are used. Specific care targeting this population could reduce treatment gaps."}, {"Title": "Safety and feasibility of faecal microbiota transplant for major depressive disorder: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are a leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease globally. Current conventional treatments for depression have significant limitations, and there have been few new treatments in decades. The microbiota-gut-brain-axis is now recognised as playing a role in mental and brain health, and promising preclinical and clinical data suggest Faecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT) may be efficacious for treating a range of mental illnesses. However, there are no existing published studies in humans evaluating the efficacy of FMT for MDD.\nThis protocol describes an 8-week, triple-blind, 2:1 parallel group, randomised controlled pilot trial (n = 15), of enema-delivered FMT treatment (n = 10) compared with a placebo enema (n = 5) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. There will be a further 26-week follow-up to monitor longer-term safety. Participants will receive four FMT or placebo enemas over four consecutive days. The primary aims of the study are to evaluate feasibility and safety of FMT as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in adults. Changes in gut microbiota will be assessed as a secondary outcome. Other data will be collected, including changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, and safety parameters.\nModification of the microbiota-gut-brain axis via FMT is a promising potential treatment for MDD, but there are no published rigorous clinical trials evaluating its use.

All students (n\u00a0=\u00a0147) starting rotations (psychiatry, surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, neurology, pediatrics, and medicine) could participate in quarterly, online, anonymous surveys comprised of validated screeners for: psychological symptoms, risk, coping, and protective factors, demographics, COVID-19 worries, and stressful clerkship-related events. Associations between variables were examined with Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, t-, Wilcoxon Rank Sum, one-way ANOVA, and McNemar tests. Significant univariate predictors of psychological distress were included in stepwise multivariable linear regression models. The baseline survey was completed by 110 (74.8%) students; ninety-two (62.6%) completed at least one other survey. During the year, 68 (73.9%) students screened positive for depression, anxiety, or PTSD. The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms peaked in June 2020 without significant changes in average scores over time. COVID-19 worries decreased over time but did not influence psychological symptoms at year-end. Eighty-three students (90.2%) experienced stressful clerkship-related events, which were traumatic and/or COVID-19-related for 26 (28.3%) and 22 students (24.0%), respectively.

We examined whether obesity compared to healthy weight controls is associated with differences in distinct subdomains of reward processing. To this end, we used two established paradigms, namely the Effort Expenditure for Rewards task (EEfRT) and the Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task (PRLT).\n30 individuals with obesity (OBS) and 30 healthy weight control subjects (HC) were included in the study. Generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze EEfRT choice behavior. PRLT data was analyzed using both conventional behavioral variables of choices and computational models.\nOur findings from the different tasks speak in favor of a hyposensitivity to non-food rewards in obesity. OBS did not make fewer overall hard task selections compared to HC in the EEfRT suggesting generally intact non-food reward motivation. However, in highly rewarding trials (i.e.,trials with high reward magnitude and high reward probability),OBSmadefewer hard task selections compared to normal weight subjects suggesting decreased sensitivity to highly rewarding non-food reinforcers. Hyposensitivity to non-food rewards was also evident in OBS in the PRLT as evidenced by lower win-stay probability compared to HC. Our computational modelling analyses revealed decreased stochasticity but intact reward and punishment learning rates in OBS.\nOur findings provide evidence for intact reward motivation and learning in OBS but lower reward sensitivity which is linked to stochasticity of choices in a non-food context. These findings might provide further insight into the mechanism underlying dysfunctional choices in obesity."}, {"Title": "The first appearance of EEG evidence in a UK court of law: a cautionary tale.", "Abstract": "Electroencephalogram-based evidence was accepted in a UK law court for the first time in 1939.

Pharmacogenomics aims to optimize drug choice and dose for individual patients by characterizing patients' pharmacologically relevant genes to identify variants of known impact.\nDNA was extracted from randomly selected remnant whole blood samples from Caucasian patients with previously performed complete blood counts. Samples were genotyped by mass spectrometry using a customized pharmacogenomics panel. A third-party result interpretation service used genotypic results to predict likely individual responses to frequently prescribed drugs.\nComplete genotypic and phenotypic calls for all tested Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and other genes were obtained from 152 DNA samples. Of these 152 unique genomic DNA samples, 140 had genetic variants suggesting dose adjustment for at least one drug. Cardiovascular and psychiatry drugs had the highest number of recommendations, which included United States Food and Drug Administration warnings for highly prescribed drugs metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, HLA-A, and VKORC1.\nRisk for each drug:gene pairing primarily depends upon the degree of predicted enzyme impairment or activation, width of the therapeutic window, and whether parent compound or metabolite is pharmacologically active.

The physiological and psychological effects of ASD include anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, systemic inflammation, stress responses, and disruptions of gut microbiota. However, the mechanisms involved in the ASD-associated circadian dysregulations with regard to gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, physiological modulation, and psychiatry disorders remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether central nervous system disorders induced by ASD are related to inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and circadian dysregulation. We also assessed impacts on microbiota succession. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly allocated to the control and sleep deprivation (SD) groups. Mice in the SD group were subjected to 72\u00a0h of paradoxical SD using the modified multiple-platform method for ASD induction (72\u00a0h rapid eye movement-SD). The effects of ASD on dietary consumption, behaviors, cytokines, microbiota, and functional genes were determined. The appetite of the SD group was significantly higher than that of the control group, but the body weight was significantly lower than that of the control group. The anxiety-like behaviors were found in the SD group. Alpha and beta diversity of microbiota showed significant decrease after ASD induction; the relative abundance of Candidatus_Arthromitus and Enterobacter was increased, whereas that abundance of Lactobacillus, Muribaculum, Monoglobus, Parasutterella, and others was decreased in the SD group. These effects were accompanied by reduction in fecal propionic acid. In the proximal colon, the SD group exhibited significantly higher inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1]) and dysregulation of the circadian rhythms (brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 [BMAL1] and cryptochrome circadian regulator 1 [CRY1]) and tight junction genes (occludin [OCLN]) than the control group. Gut barrier dysfunction slightly increased the plasma concentration of lipopolysaccharide and significantly elevated TNF-\u03b1. Inflammatory signals might be transduced through the brain via TNF receptor superfamily member 1\u00a0A (TNFRSF1A), which significantly increased the levels of microglia activation marker (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [IBA1]) and chemokine (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM1]) in the cerebral cortex. The serotonin receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor [5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R]) was significantly downregulated in the hippocampus.

Management of skin erosion and infection following DBS surgery constitutes a challenge in everyday clinical practice.\nSkin-related complications were evaluated in patients who underwent DBS surgery due to Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, essential tremor (ET), and other indications including Tourette syndrome (TS), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and epilepsy.\nA retrospective analysis of clinical data was performed on patients who underwent DBS surgery between November 2008 and September 2021 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw.\n525 patients who underwent 927 DBS leads implantations were included in the analysis. There were 398 patients with PD, 80 with dystonia, 26 with ET, 7 with drug-resistant epilepsy, 5 with Multiple Sclerosis, 4 with Holme's or cerebellar tremor, 3 with TS, and 2 with OCD. 42 patients (8,0%) had 78 skin infection episodes. The overall level of skin erosion was 3,8% (20/525 patients). The risk of developing infection episode was connected with younger age at diagnosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and at surgery (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), whereas the development of skin erosion was connected with the dystonia diagnosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Patients with dystonia showed the highest rate of infections and erosions (11/70 and 7/70 patients retrospectively).\nPostoperative skin complications are a serious side effect of DBS surgery.\nOur study suggests that dystonic patients are at higher risk of developing skin-related complications after DBS surgery."}, {"Title": "Psychotic Misdiagnosis of Racially Minoritized Patients: A Case-Based Ethics, Equity, and Educational Exploration.", "Abstract": "The overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of racially minoritized groups as having a primary psychotic disorder is one of psychiatry's longest-standing inequities born of real-time clinician racial bias. Evidence suggests that providers assign a diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder according to race more than any other demographic variable, and this inequity persists even in the absence of differences in clinician symptom ratings. This case report describes the journey of one young Black woman through her racialized misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and the process by which interdisciplinary, health equity-minded providers across the spectrum of medical education and practice joined together to provide a culturally informed, systematic rediagnosis of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Expert discussion is provided by three Black academic psychiatrists with expertise in social justice and health equity. We provide an evidence-based exploration of mechanisms of clinician racial bias and detail how the psychosis misdiagnosis of racially minoritized groups fails medical ethics and perpetuates iatrogenic harm to patients who truly need help with primary mood, trauma, and substance use disorders."}, {"Title": "Applications of Speech Analysis in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The need for objective measurement in psychiatry has stimulated interest in alternative indicators of the presence and severity of illness. Speech may offer a source of information that bridges the subjective and objective in the assessment of mental disorders. We systematically reviewed the literature for articles exploring speech analysis for psychiatric applications. The utility of speech analysis depends on how accurately speech features represent clinical symptoms within and across disorders. We identified four domains of the application of speech analysis in the literature: diagnostic classification, assessment of illness severity, prediction of onset of illness, and prognosis and treatment outcomes. We discuss the findings in each of these domains, with a focus on how types of speech features characterize different aspects of psychopathology. Models that bring together multiple speech features can distinguish speakers with psychiatric disorders from healthy controls with high accuracy. Differentiating between types of mental disorders and symptom dimensions are more complex problems that expose the transdiagnostic nature of speech features. Convergent progress in speech research and computer sciences opens avenues for implementing speech analysis to enhance objectivity of assessment in clinical practice. Application of speech analysis will need to address issues of ethics and equity, including the potential to perpetuate discriminatory bias through models that learn from clinical assessment data. Methods that mitigate bias are available and should play a key role in the implementation of speech analysis."}, {"Title": "Seeking the Psilocybiome: Psychedelics meet the microbiota-gut-brain axis.", "Abstract": "Moving towards a systems psychiatry paradigm embraces the inherent complex interactions across all levels from micro to macro and necessitates an integrated approach to treatment. Cortical 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are key primary targets for the effects of serotonergic psychedelics. However, the therapeutic mechanisms underlying psychedelic therapy are complex and traverse molecular, cellular, and network levels, under the influence of biofeedback signals from the periphery and the environment. At the interface between the individual and the environment, the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain axis, plays an important role in the unconscious parallel processing systems regulating host neurophysiology. While psychedelic and microbial signalling systems operate over different timescales, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, as a convergence hub between multiple biofeedback systems may play a role in the preparatory phase, the acute administration phase, and the integration phase of psychedelic therapy. In keeping with an interconnected systems-based approach, this review will discuss the gut microbiome and mycobiome and pathways of the MGB axis, and then explore the potential interaction between psychedelic therapy and the MGB axis and how this might influence mechanism of action and treatment response.

An important factor to the development of problem gaming is parent-child relationships. A cognitive behavioral therapy-based form of treatment, labeled relapse prevention, has been developed as a treatment for child and adolescent problem gaming or internet gaming disorder. However, no study has evaluated the effect of this treatment among Swedish children and youth nor the role of the parent-child relationships in this treatment.\nThis study aims (1) to evaluate a relapse prevention treatment for patients showing signs of problem gaming or internet gaming disorder recruited from child and youth psychiatric clinics and (2) to test whether the quality of parent-child relationships plays a role in the effect of relapse prevention treatment and vice versa-whether the relapse prevention treatment has a spillover effect on the quality of parent-child relationships. Moreover, we explore the carer's attitudes about parent-child relationships and child gaming, as well as experiences of the treatment among the children, their carers, and the clinicians who carried out the treatment.\nThis study is a 2-arm, parallel-group, early-stage randomized controlled trial with embedded qualitative components. Children aged 12-18 years who meet the criteria for problem gaming or internet gaming disorder will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (relapse prevention treatment) or control (treatment as usual), with a total of 160 (80 + 80) participants. The primary outcomes are measures of gaming and gambling behavior before and after intervention, and the secondary outcomes include child ratings of parent-child communication and family functioning. The study is supplemented with a qualitative component with semistructured interviews to capture participants' and clinicians' experiences of the relapse prevention, as well as attitudes about parent-child relationships and parenting needs in carers whose children completed the treatment.\nThe trial started in January 2022 and is expected to end in December 2023. The first results are expected in March 2023.\nThis study will be the first randomized controlled trial evaluating relapse prevention as a treatment for child and adolescent problem gaming and internet gaming disorder in Sweden. Since problem behaviors in children interact with the family context, investigating parent-child relationships adjacent to the treatment of child problem gaming and internet gaming disorder is an important strength of the study. Further, different parties, ie, children, carers, and clinicians, will be directly or indirectly involved in the evaluation of the treatment, providing more knowledge of the treatment and its effect. Limitations include comorbidity in children with problem gaming and internet gaming disorder and challenges with the recruitment of participants.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05506384 (retrospectively registered); https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05506384.\nDERR1-10.2196/44318."}, {"Title": "Risk of Psychiatric Disorders Among Spouses of Patients With Cancer in Denmark and Sweden.", "Abstract": "There is emerging evidence that spouses of patients with cancer may have a higher prevalence of mental illness, but these studies have been limited by pre-post designs, focus on a single mental illness, and short follow-up periods.\nTo assess the overall burden of psychiatric disorders among spouses of patients with cancer vs spouses of individuals without cancer and to describe possible changes in this burden over time.\nThis population based cohort study included spouses of patients with cancer (diagnosed 1986-2016 in Denmark and 1973-2014 in Sweden; exposed group) and spouses of individuals without cancer (unexposed group).

We used a standardised protocol and data collection procedure to record inpatients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.\nSignificant differences were found between hospitals from the two countries. Positive symptoms were the main reason for admission in the Chinese hospitals, while reported suicide and self-injury symptoms more frequently led to hospital admission in America. Moreover, there were more inpatients with combined substance abuse in the American hospital (97.6% vs. 1.9%, P\u2009<\u00a00.001). The length of stay\u00a0(LOS) in America was generally shorter than in China (10.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9 vs. 20.7\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4, P\u2009<\u00a00.001).

Regression analysis showed that male sex, older age, retirees, being admitted because of physical symptoms, and using higher doses of antipsychotic drugs were significantly associated with longer hospitalisation in the American hospital (P\u2009<\u00a00.05). Comparatively, patients who were divorced, experiencing suicidal ideation, admitted involuntarily, admitted because of physical, depression, or anxiety symptoms, and using higher doses of antipsychotic drugs had longer hospitalisation in Chinese hospitals (P\u2009<\u00a00.05).\nSignificant variations in clinical characteristics of inpatients were found between hospitals from Western China and America. The LOS in Chinese hospitals was significantly longer, but patients used higher doses of antipsychotic drugs in the American hospital. Admission due to physical symptoms and the use of higher dosage drugs were related to longer LOS in both countries."}, {"Title": "Paper Charts: A Continued Barrier to Psychiatric Care in the Midst of a Broken and Fragmented Mental Health System.", "Abstract": "The use of electronic medical records (EMRs) has increased dramatically over the last 15 years. However, psychiatry has lagged. EMRs are not being used by many mental health professionals. There are many reasons, including financial burden, lack of technological support, stigma, disaggregation of upfront costs, indirect benefits, and concerns about privacy and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance. Obtaining paper records is a lengthy process, making continuity of care and emergency care challenging. Even when records are made available, it is common for information to be incomplete. The objective of this article is to highlight how the continued use of paper charts may decrease the quality and timeliness of psychiatric care provided and to discuss the psychiatry-specific issues created by EMRs. A case illustrating the disruption of care by continued use of paper charts in psychiatric facilities is presented. The growing use of EMR creates new challenges that affect psychiatry in ways other fields are not affected. These challenges include confidentiality issues, the frequent change/spectrum of diagnoses, determining how much information should be recorded in a note, and what the implications are of the information recorded. This article will discuss the use of EMRs in psychiatry, as well as encourage medical students and residents to take a deeper dive into psychiatry-specific issues regarding the use of EMR. EMR use may have a profound impact on our patient outcomes, health care delivery system, shorter inpatient stay, as well as reduce health care costs."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Telepsychiatry Services Implementation in Medical and Psychiatric Inpatient Settings: A Mixed-Methods Study.", "Abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>Telepsychiatry consultation for rural providers may help address local staffing needs while ensuring timely and appropriate care from behavioral health experts.

We characterized transcriptomic dysregulation in a human model of <i>HNRNPU</i>-related disorder to explore the potential of such a paradigm. We identified widespread dysregulation in functionally relevant pathways and then compared dysregulation in a human model to transcriptomic differences in embryonic and perinatal mice to determine whether dysregulation in an <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> human model is partially replicated in an <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> model of <i>HNRNPU</i>-related disorder. Strikingly, we find enrichment of co-dysregulation between 45-day-old human organoids and embryonic, but not perinatal, mice from distinct models of <i>HNRNPU</i>-related disorder.

The case of a woman in her 30s presenting with coprophagia and psychotic symptoms following hypoxic brain injury is reported. The case is discussed and literature is reviewed. We investigate cariprazine, a relatively new atypical antipsychotic for treating coprophagia, associated with psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric evaluation revealed cognitive dysfunction and psychotic symptoms. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was treated with haloperidol resulting in resolution of coprophagia. Attempts at switching to alternative antipsychotics, due to side effects, resulted in recurrence of coprophagia. Subsequent relapses required higher doses of haloperidol for remission of coprophagia and psychotic symptoms. She finally responded to cariprazine.

Consequently, there is a behavioral healthcare provider shortage, particularly in rural areas, to support this need. Recently, primary care providers (PCPs) have shifted to incorporate behavioral health to their practice. However, many PCPs lack knowledge and skills to successfully manage their patients' behavioral health conditions. In response to the need for effective behavioral healthcare across the U.S. Weitzman ECHO launched the Advanced Primary Care (APC ECHO) Adult Psychiatry Module to provide continuing education (CE) for rural PCPs. This study presents the results from the APC ECHO pilot to demonstrate how CE can support PCPs in addressing their patients' mental health needs. Evaluators used a one-group repeated measures study design to assess the APC ECHO Module and understand learner outcomes and individual practice changes. Participant characteristics and individual practice changes were summarized using descriptive statistics, with support from open-ended responses to illustrate findings. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were applied to compare the differences in pre- and post-module learner outcomes.

Such tasks are commonly used in experimental psychology and psychiatry research, and have been shown to be sensitive biomarkers of depression and antidepressant drug action [1,2]. In addition, several of these tasks investigate self-referential processing i.e., the processing of information relevant to oneself; this has been shown to modify the way emotional words are encoded and remembered and may be a target that is amenable to treatment [3,4]. In practice, the development of such tasks for implementation in research studies often depends on the selection and matching of words according to characteristics such as valence or arousal, imageability, word frequency and word length to investigate differences in a chosen domain of interest whilst keeping important confounds constant. This introduces a need for ratings covering a range of word attributes that have been shown to affect processing. In particular, ratings of self-referential valence (how positively or negatively subjects feel about a word when this is used to describe themselves/their circumstances) have been seldom included in databases, despite the frequent investigation of the concept in research [1,5]. Other important attributes often considered in the process of matching and selection are word imageability and subjective frequency [6,7]. To facilitate the word selection and matching process required in cognitive-emotional task development, the present dataset provides subjective ratings for 150 positive and 150 negative adjectives describing personality characteristics. Across four online surveys, the 300 words were rated on self-referential valence, imageability and subjective frequency by representative samples of 200 UK-based, English-speaking adults. Basic demographics and data on depressive symptoms and state anxiety were collected from all participants. Comprehensive descriptive statistics and word length were calculated for each of the 300 words. All data cleaning and statistical analysis was performed in R.

We measured the prevalence of PIU and depressive symptoms using the PIU questionnaire (PIUQ-SF-6) and patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).\nThe estimations of the risk group for PIU and depressive symptoms among school-going adolescents were 80.04% and 77.80%, respectively. The latent profiling of PIU scores for obsession, neglect, and control sub-groups were 5.82, 6.12, and 6.35, respectively. Moreover, we observed mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms in 48.68%, 27.70%, and 1.43% of cases. Age, education level, medium of education, financial impression, internet connection, the device used, the purpose for internet use, and the living status of respondents were significantly associated with the PIU. Reported mental health issues was associated with education level, medium of education, financial impression, and internet connection.\nThe present study revealed an association of PIU and depressive symptoms with sociodemographic factors and internet usage patterns. Therefore, these results might have practical implications in clinical psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy. The healthcare professional can develop a context-specific comprehensive clinical intervention plan for children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "One Size Does Not Fit All: Methodological Considerations for Brain-Based Predictive Modeling in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric illnesses are heterogeneous in nature. No illness manifests in the same way across individuals, and no two patients with a shared diagnosis exhibit identical symptom profiles. Over the last several decades, group-level analyses of in\u00a0vivo neuroimaging data have led to fundamental advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric illnesses. More recently, access to computational resources and large, publicly available datasets alongside the rise of predictive modeling and precision medicine approaches have facilitated the study of psychiatric illnesses at an individual level. Data-driven machine learning analyses can be applied to identify disease-relevant biological subtypes, predict individual symptom profiles, and recommend personalized therapeutic interventions. However, when developing these predictive models, methodological choices must be carefully considered to ensure accurate, robust, and interpretable results. Choices pertaining to algorithms, neuroimaging modalities and states, data transformation, phenotypes, parcellations, sample sizes, and populations we are specifically studying can influence model performance. Here, we review applications of neuroimaging-based machine learning models to study psychiatric illnesses and discuss the effects of different methodological choices on model performance. An understanding of these effects is crucial for the proper implementation of predictive models in psychiatry and will facilitate more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and therapeutics."}, {"Title": "Impact of Students' Scheduling Choice on Clerkship Examination Score Performance in a Time-Varying Competency-Based Curriculum.", "Abstract": "Standardized end-of-clerkship examinations typically occur on the last day of the clerkship. However, recent trends toward time-varying competency-based medical education have offered students more test scheduling flexibility, creating an opportunity to study the impact of student-selected examination timing.\nStarting with the graduating class of 2018, students took the required standardized end-of-core clerkship examinations at any available time they chose during their clinical years. Before this change, these examinations were administered to all students on the last day of the clerkship. Students' examination dates relative to clerkship completion were analyzed between 2017 and 2020 (inclusive of before and after flexible exam timing) to assess the impact that student-selected exam timing had on test performance on National Board of Medical Examiners shelf clinical science examinations for required core clerkships.\nData on 146 medical students in 2017 (fixed exam timing) and 466 medical students between 2018 and 2020 (flexible exam timing) were included. Among students offered flexible exam timing, between 2.7% (internal medicine) and 14.6% (psychiatry) took their exam before actually taking clerkship, while between 22.7% (psychiatry) and 40.0% (surgery) took their exam more than 90 days after the clerkship ended. Exam scores were statistically higher for those who took the exam at a time of their choosing compared with those who were required to take it at the end of individual rotations and when the exam scores were combined (fixed exam timing mean = 73.9, standard deviation [SD] = 7.8; flexible exam timing mean = 77.4, SD = 6.0, P < .001). The percent of students with passing scores was statistically higher in internal medicine, pediatrics, and psychiatry.\nSelf-selection of shelf exam timing appears to increase shelf exam scores. As more medical schools transition to competency-based medical education, providing scheduling flexibility appears not to negatively affect student achievement."}, {"Title": "Implementation of a Medical Clearance Algorithm for Psychiatric Emergency Patients.", "Abstract": "Despite evidence demonstrating limited benefit, many clinicians continue to perform routine laboratory testing of well-appearing children to medically clear them before psychiatric admission.\nWe conducted a quality improvement project to reduce routine laboratory testing among pediatric patients requiring admission to our psychiatric unit. We convened key stakeholders whose input informed the modification of an existing pathway and the development of a medical clearance algorithm. Our outcome was a reduction in routine laboratory testing for children requiring psychiatric admission. Our balancing measure was the number of patients requiring transfer from the inpatient psychiatry unit to a medical service. We used run charts to evaluate nonrandom variation and demonstrate sustained change.\nBefore the introduction of the new medical clearance algorithm, 93% (n = 547/589) of children with psychiatric emergencies received laboratory testing. After implementing the medical clearance algorithm, 19.6% (n = 158/807) of children with psychiatric emergencies received laboratory testing. Despite a decreased rate of routine testing, there were no transfers to the medical service.\nImplementing a medical clearance algorithm can decrease routine laboratory testing without increasing transfers to the medical service among children requiring psychiatric admission."}, {"Title": "The Emotional and Personal Experiences of the COVID-19 Illness During the Early Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.", "Abstract": "Several studies report the incidence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders among patients who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, little is known about the emotional impact of acute COVID-19 illness and recovery on these survivors. Qualitative methods are ideal for understanding the psychological impact of a novel illness.\nTo describe the emotional experience of the acute COVID-19 illness and recovery in patients who contracted the virus during the early months of the pandemic.\nSemi-structured interviews conducted by consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatrists were used to elicit participant responses about the emotional impact of the acute and recovery phases of the COVID-19 illness. Participants recruited from the Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia area were interviewed which was audio recorded between June 2020 and December 2020. The research team extracted qualitative themes from the recordings using the principles of thematic analysis.\nOne hundred and one COVID-19 survivors (54 women; mean [SD] age, 50 [14.7] years) were interviewed at a mean of 5.16 months after their acute illness, and their responses were audio-recorded. Most participants were White (77%), non-Hispanic/Latino (86.1%), and not hospitalized for COVID-19 (87.1%). Coders identified 26 themes from participant responses. The most frequently coded themes included anxiety/worry (49), uncertainty (37), supportfrom others (35), alone/isolation (32), and positive reframe/positive emotions (32).\nSurvivors who contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the early months of the pandemic described both negative and positive valence emotions. They experienced emotional distress and psychosocial stressors associated with the acute illness and recovery but also drew upon personal resiliency to cope. This report highlights the utility of qualitative research methods in identifying emotional responses to a novel illness that may otherwise go unnoted.

There is a need to better understand the neurobiological correlates of attention and leverage these findings in healthcare settings. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if it is possible to build dimensional predictive models of attentional state in a sample that includes participants with neurodiverse conditions. Here, we use 5 datasets to identify and validate functional connectome-based markers of attention. In dataset 1, we use connectome-based predictive modeling and observe successful prediction of performance on an in-scan sustained attention task in a sample of youth, including participants with a neurodiverse condition. The predictions are not driven by confounds, such as head motion. In dataset 2, we find that the attention network model defined in dataset 1 generalizes to predict in-scan attention in a separate sample of neurotypical participants performing the same attention task. In datasets 3-5, we use connectome-based identification and longitudinal scans to probe the stability of the attention network across months to years in individual participants. Our results help elucidate the brain correlates of attentional state in youth and support the further development of predictive dimensional models of other clinically relevant phenotypes."}, {"Title": "Interpersonal attunement in social interactions: from <i>collective</i> psychophysiology to <i>inter-</i><i>personalized</i> psychiatry and beyond.", "Abstract": "In this article, we analyse social interactions, drawing on diverse points of views, ranging from dialectics, second-person neuroscience and enactivism to dynamical systems, active inference and machine learning. To this end, we define interpersonal attunement as a set of multi-scale processes of building up and materializing social expectations-put simply, anticipating and interacting with others and ourselves. While cultivating and negotiating common ground, via communication and culture-building activities, are indispensable for the survival of the individual, the relevant multi-scale mechanisms have been largely considered in isolation. Here, <i>collective psychophysiology</i>, we argue, can lend itself to the fine-tuned analysis of social interactions, without neglecting the individual. On the other hand, an interpersonal mismatch of expectations can lead to a breakdown of communication and social isolation known to negatively affect mental health. In this regard, we review psychopathology in terms of interpersonal misattunement, conceptualizing psychiatric disorders as disorders of social interaction, to describe how individual mental health is inextricably linked to social interaction. By doing so, we foresee avenues for an <i>inter-</i><i>personalized</i> psychiatry, which moves from a static spectrum of disorders to a dynamic relational space, focusing on how the multi-faceted processes of social interaction can help to promote mental health.

Patients who must spend time in seclusion are at their most vulnerable mental state and the often worn-down like environment can challenge the feeling of dignity. How environmental design can promote dignity in seclusion units have not been studied.\nTo reach suggestions for design changes enhancing dignity, we used service design that included a broad user group. The effect of design changes was evaluated by a questionnaire answered by the nursing staff during a 4-week period pre- and post refurbishment and included a control group.\nThe design concepts agreed upon were a welcoming atmosphere, contact with nature, room for privacy, close contact with staff, and a designated smoking area inside the unit. The evaluation found that the environmental design changes significantly supported the patients in their situation and the staff in their work.\nWe conclude that dignity design concepts are highly applicable also in an acute psychiatric setting and improve the situation of secluded mental health patients, which is much needed.

Psychiatric utilization of the ED has increased, particularly among younger patients. This investigation quantifies the effect of ED demand on throughput times and discharge disposition for pediatric psychiatric patients in the ED.\nUsing electronic medical record data from 1,151,396 ED visits in eight North Carolina EDs from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, we identified 14,092 pediatric psychiatric visits. Measures of ED daily demand rates included overall occupancy as well as daily proportion of non-psychiatric pediatric patients, adult psychiatric patients, and pediatric psychiatric patients. Controlling for patient-level factors such as age, sex, race, insurance, and triage acuity, we used linear regression to predict throughput times and logistic regression to predict disposition status. We estimated effects of ED demand by academic versus community hospital status due to ED and inpatient resource differences.\nMost ED demand measures had insignificant or only very small associations with throughput measures for pediatric psychiatric patients. Notable exceptions were that a one percentage point increase in the proportion of non-psychiatric pediatric ED visits increased boarding times at community sites by 1.06 hours (95% CI: 0.20-1.92), while a one percentage point increase in the proportion of pediatric psychiatric ED visits increased LOS by 3.64 hours (95% CI: 2.04-5.23) at the academic site. We found that ED demand had a minimal effect on disposition status, with small increases in demand rates favoring <1 percentage point increases in the likelihood of discharge. Instead, patient-level factors played a much stronger role in predicting discharge disposition.\nED demand has a meaningful effect on throughput times, but a minimal effect on disposition status. Further research is needed to validate these findings across other state and healthcare systems."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of adjunctive low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder refractory to medical treatment:A double-blind, randomized clinical trial.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric disorder. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat OCD in 2018. So far, various approaches to treat this disorder have been evaluated. We evaluated the effect of adjunctive low-frequency rtMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with OCD refractory to treatment.\nThe present clinical trial was done on 37 patients with OCD referring from the psychiatry clinic, 22 Bahman Hospital, Qazvin province, between 2018 and 2020 and patients were randomly divided into two groups. The intervention group received rTMS treatment at 1\u00a0Hz for 20\u00a0min (1200 pulses/day) over the left DLPFC area as adjunctive to the medical treatment three times a week and for five weeks, whereas those in the control group were subjected to only the sham condition plus their medical treatment. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOC.S) was completed by patients before the study, following sessions 5 and 10 during the intervention, at the end of the intervention, and three to six months after the intervention under the direct supervision of a psychiatrist. SPSS software version 26 was used to compare the results between the two groups.\nThe intervention group showed significantly lower mean Y-BOCS scores after the intervention and at follow-up (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and all patients of the intervention group showed significantly lower Y-BOCS scores than their own baseline scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Also, using antipsychotic agents along with the serotonergic agents yielded significantly lower scores in the intervention group at the end of the intervention (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All the patients were found with higher follow-up scores than their scores at the end of the intervention; however, this difference was not significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).\nAdjunctive low-frequency (1\u00a0Hz) rTMS over the left DLPFC is able to effectively reduce Y-BOCS score in OCD patients refractory to treatment following 15 sessions, and the reduction was durable even after three to six months.

Subjective experience during behavioral tasks is not well understood, even though it should be relevant to understanding the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior. When smartphone tasks are collected longitudinally, subjective feelings provide a potential means to bridge the gap between lab-based behavioral tasks and real-life behavior, emotion, and psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "A Prospective Cohort Study on the Intergenerational Transmission of Childhood Adversity and Subsequent Risk of Psychotic Experiences in Adolescence.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown a robust relationship between childhood adversity and subsequent psychotic symptoms.

Maternal history of childhood adversity was retrospectively assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire during pregnancy. Maternal psychopathology was assessed during and after pregnancy. Twenty-four offspring childhood adversities were assessed by maternal interview when the child was 10 years old. Offspring psychotic experiences were examined using self-report at 14 years.

To systematically analyze effects of inflammation on fear learning and extinction, we performed two complementary randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies combining experimental endotoxemia as a translational model of acute systemic inflammation with a two-day multiple-threat fear conditioning paradigm involving interoceptive and exteroceptive unconditioned stimuli (US). Healthy volunteers (N\u00a0=\u00a095) were randomized to receive intravenous injections of either endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS; 0.4\u00a0ng/kg) or placebo prior to fear acquisition (study 1) or extinction training (study2). Treatment effects on behavioral and neural responses to conditioned stimuli (CS) predicting interoceptive or exteroceptive threat were assessed during fear learning and extinction phases, along with US valence ratings. Despite robust inflammatory and emotional responses triggered by LPS, no direct effects of inflammation on US ratings or on the formation or extinction of conditioned fear, as assessed with CS valence ratings, were observed. However, in the group treated with LPS prior to acquisition (i.e., study 1), we found enhanced neural responses to the interoceptive but not the exteroceptive CS in key regions of the central fear circuitry during extinction learning. After extinction, this group further showed enhanced negative valence ratings selectively for the interoceptive US during unexpected US re-exposure when compared to the placebo group. Together, inflammation during fear acquisition may promote the establishment of a more robust neural signature of the interoceptive fear memory trace, which may contribute to altered interoceptive pain perception. The fear extinction circuitry engaged during interoceptive fear memory processing may be particularly vulnerable to inflammation, with transdiagnostic implications for gut-brain mechanisms underlying disturbed interoception in psychiatric conditions and chronic visceral pain."}, {"Title": "The computational psychiatry of antisocial behaviour and psychopathy.", "Abstract": "Antisocial behaviours such as disobedience, lying, stealing, destruction of property, and aggression towards others are common to multiple disorders of childhood and adulthood, including conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, psychopathy, and antisocial personality disorder. These disorders have a significant negative impact for individuals and for society, but whether they represent clinically different phenomena, or simply different approaches to diagnosing the same underlying psychopathology is highly debated. Computational psychiatry, with its dual focus on identifying different classes of disorder and health (data-driven) and latent cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms (theory-driven), is well placed to address these questions. The elucidation of mechanisms that might characterise latent processes across different disorders of antisocial behaviour can also provide important advances.

We suggest that the role of regulatory culture has been neglected in the history of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Innovation in mental health care: Bertram Mandelbrote, the Phoenix Unit and the therapeutic community approach.", "Abstract": "Bertram Mandelbrote was Physician Superintendent and Consultant Psychiatrist at Littlemore Hospital in Oxford from 1959 to 1988. A humane pragmatist rather than theoretician, Mandelbrote was known for his facilitating style of leadership and working across organisational boundaries. He created the Phoenix Unit, an innovative admission unit run on therapeutic community lines which became a hub for community outreach. Material drawn from oral histories and witness seminars reflects the remarkably unstructured style of working on the Phoenix Unit and the enduring influence of Mandelbrote and fellow consultant Benn Pomryn's styles of leadership. Practices initiated at Littlemore led to a number of innovative services in Oxfordshire. These innovations place Mandelbrote as a pioneer in social psychiatry and the therapeutic community approach."}, {"Title": "Ubiquitous computing in light of human phenotypes: foundations, challenges, and opportunities.", "Abstract": "The interest in human phenotypes has leveraged interdisciplinary efforts encouraging a better understanding of the broad spectrum of psychological and behavioral disorders.

However, the specific conditions demanding assessment are not clearly stipulated by law. Few studies have been conducted on the epidemiological characteristics and assessment of criminal responsibility in patients with mental disorders. This study aimed to analyze the features and identify influencing factors for assessment of criminal responsibility for patients with mental disorders in a single-center cohort.\nCases undergoing criminal responsibility assessment at the Center of Forensic Science, East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai (CFS, ECUPL) between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Criminal responsibility was categorized as criminal irresponsibility, diminished criminal responsibility, and full criminal responsibility. Differences among the groups were then statistically analyzed.\nIn the study period, 437 patients including 361 males (82.61%) were referred for criminal responsibility assessment. Their ages ranged from 15\u00a0years to 91\u00a0years. After assessment, the number of cases with criminal irresponsibility, diminished criminal responsibility, and full criminal responsibility were 196 (44.85%), 181 (41.42%), and 60 (13.73%), respectively. The Chi-square test and nominal regression analysis showed that influencing factors for assessment of criminal responsibility comprised crime in public places (OR\u00a0=\u00a014.734; 95% CI: 1.463-148.424), crime in victim's residence (OR\u00a0=\u00a010.852; 95% CI: 1.068-110.214), crime in suspect's residence (OR\u00a0=\u00a09.542; 95% CI: 1.046-87.092), forensic psychiatric diagnosis of F1X (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.014,0.011; 95%CI:0.001-0.261,0-0.5), F2X (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.75; 95%CI:1.315-23.145), F4X (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.077; 95%CI:0.016-0.38,) and F6X (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.112,0.075; 95% CI: 0.022-0.558,0.006-0.959), criminal object of property (OR\u00a0=\u00a09.989; 95% CI: 1.305-76.455), cases of theft (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.09, 0.087; 95% CI: 0.013-0.648,0.012-0.654), and cases of endangering public security (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.152, 0.205; 95% CI: 0.034-0.678, 0.045-0.931).\nCrime in public places, suspect's residence and victim's residence, forensic psychiatric diagnosis of F1X, F2X, F4X and F6X, criminal object of property, case types of theft and endangering public security were influencing factors in assessment of criminal responsibility. Therefore, special attention should be paid to patients with mental disorders under such circumstances in order to avoid bias on assessment of criminal responsibility."}, {"Title": "The clinical implications of digital technology.", "Abstract": "The proliferation of digital technology within the lives of children and young people (CYP) provides arguably one of the most significant clinical and ethical paradigm shifts in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. One can argue that mental health research has taken a myopic approach to understanding the interaction between young people's technology use and their mental health. Mental health clinicians also need a better understanding of the digital lives of CYP and how technology may be supporting or harming their mental health. Within this paper, we argue that greater longitudinal research is required, particularly in vulnerable groups, and that there is an essential need for a standardised digital use assessment (DUA) tool, which assimilates CYP use of technology and their vulnerabilities/resilience to online risks. We subsequently offer a series of questions clinicians can use to explore technology use by CYP. Such an aide memoire may empower clinicians to have wider discussions around digital technology use with CYP, while also helping to develop appropriate safety and management plans."}, {"Title": "Mapping the future of interventional psychiatry for the obsessive-compulsive related disorders: A scoping review.", "Abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), hoarding disorder (HD), skin-picking disorder (SPD), and hair-pulling disorder (HPD) are characterized by compulsive behaviours leading to distress and impairment.

Understanding nurses and other staff perspectives on the effects of seclusion is critical in the ongoing effort to minimize and eliminate seclusion. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of staff attitudes, experiences, and beliefs about the effects of seclusion on both themselves and patients. Thirty-one staff members (including 20 nurses) completed the Attitudes to Seclusion Survey and 24 participated in semi-structured interviews to explore their beliefs and experiences of seclusion use in adolescent psychiatric inpatient care. Analysis of the questionnaire showed overwhelming agreement in the negative impacts of seclusion on patients, while there was uncertainty around the positive impacts of seclusion. Using a combination of the intuitive approach and thematic analysis, five themes were identified from interviews with staff, three unique to nurses: (i) staff were reluctant to use seclusion but felt it was necessary, (ii) nurses felt under-resourcing led to increased chances of seclusion, (iii) staff believed seclusion negatively impacted the patients, (iv) nurses felt their relationships with patients were negatively impacted, and (v) seclusion also had a negative effect on nurses. Clinical recommendations included a systematic and structured approach to debriefing to repair ruptures in the therapeutic relationship; staffing to be based on the acuity of the unit rather than occupancy; alternatives to seclusion that meet the needs of service providers and consumers.

Responding programs were larger and more likely to have a CL fellowship than nonresponding programs. Of the 103 responding programs, 82.5% have more than the minimally required time on CL, with 46.6% reporting an increase in total CL time in the past decade. Since 2010, 18.4% of responding programs changed the placement of the CL rotation, with 43.7% now adherent to the 2014 Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine recommendation to include core CL training in the second half of residency. Thirty-five percent of responding programs require residents to rotate on more than 1 CL service, and 19.4% have a required outpatient CL component. Faculty full-time equivalent varies widely.

Ketamine is a beneficial antidepressant for many individuals with depression, but not all of the patients respond, and some even exhibit symptom deterioration. The discovery of repeatable and mechanistically relevant biomarkers would address a major gap in treatment response prediction. Numerous potential peripheral biomarkers have been reported, but their current utility is unclear. We conducted an umbrella review to evaluate the biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effect in individuals with depression. PubMed and copus were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until July 2022. Five systematic reviews and meta analyses including 108 studies with 4912 participants were included. Blood-based and neuroimaging biomarkers were investigated. The results of this review indicate that ketamine can produce an anti-inflammatory effect and decrease at least one inflammatory marker following administration. Data from neuroimaging studies demonstrated that the cingulate cortex is the key locus of ketamine's action. The majority of the blood-based, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological investigations reviewed herein indicate ketamine induced normalization of major depressive disorder pathogenesis via synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity. Currently, no biomarker/biosignature is sufficiently validated for clinical utility, but several are promising. Now that ketamine is more widely available, biomarker discovery and replication should be attempted in larger, real-world populations."}, {"Title": "Psychosis and conduct disorder in Greek forensic patients found not guilty by reason of insanity: Differences between patients with and those without a history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence.", "Abstract": "Much epidemiological evidence converges in identifying distinct types of individuals suffering from schizophrenia who exhibit aggressive behavior: those with and those without a history of conduct disorder (CD) in childhood or adolescence. In this study a sample of Greek forensic patients suffering from psychotic disorders was examined regarding demographic, clinical, legal and psychometric characteristics. All patients had committed a crime and were found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRIs) in a court of law. This study aims to clarify whether history of conduct disorder leads to greater violence or shapes the index offense in some way. It also aims to examine new parameters, such as psychopathology, personality traits, substance abuse and risk assessment, not included in the relevant literature so far, and whether they are relevant and why in this specific group of patients. The sample was divided in two groups depending on the history of CD or not, and subsequently statistically significant differences were explored between the groups. The research aimed to highlight specific characteristics of both groups with the ultimate goal of making more accurate prognosis regarding risk assessment, as well as determining different needs for treatment in each group (e.g. drug abuse). Overall, 78 forensic psychiatric records of NGRI offenders were identified throughout a five-year period in the Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki (January 2015 to January 2020), who were divided into two groups depending on the history of conduct disorder in childhood or adolescence (N\u00a0=\u00a030) or not (N\u00a0=\u00a048). The two groups were compared regarding hostility and aggression (with the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire-HDHQ and the Aggression Questionnaire), personality traits (with the Zuckerman- Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire-ZKPQ), dangerousness (with the Historical, Clinical and Risk Management 20- HCR-20 scale), addiction (with the Addiction Severity Index-ASI), previous violent behavior or convictions (with a semi-structured tool), and psychopathology current and at the time of the index (with the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale-PANSS). Comparing the two groups (with CD history vs. without CD history) we found that patients with a history of conduct disorder had significantly higher compulsory hospitalization rates up to the time of the perpetration of the offense and a significantly higher rate of illicit drug use. While they were more likely to exhibit violent behavior before the index offense, it was noted that they committed fewer crimes against life. They were younger at the index offense and they presented with more severe positive symptomatology at the time of the research and a steadily high risk assessment score. Our findings underline the importance of diagnosing CD in early life and subsequently raising awareness when this individual develops schizophrenic disorder, thus emphasizing the need for appropriately targeted interventions in each case. Our research also illustrates that forensic patients with both schizophrenia and a history of conduct disorder before the age of 15 exhibit more severe psychopathology after the index crime even after long hospitalization and treatment. Our findings illustrate that the diagnosis of CD in psychotic offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity affects their dangerousness in general, but not the severity of the crimes committed."}, {"Title": "Reactivity to neural tissue epitopes, aquaporin 4 and heat shock protein 60 is associated with activated immune-inflammatory pathways and the onset of delirium following hip fracture surgery.", "Abstract": "Activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and a deficiency in the compensatory immunoregulatory system (CIRS), neuronal injuries, and alterations in the glutamate receptor (GlutaR), aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) are involved in delirium. Increased serum levels of neurofilament protein (NFP), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) are biomarkers of neuronal injury. This investigation delineates whether elevated IgA/IgG reactivity against those self-antigens is associated with delirium severity and IRS activation.\nWe measured peak Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) scores on days 2 and 3 following surgery in 59 hip fractured older adults, and IgA and IgG antibody levels against MBP, NFP, GFAP and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluRs 1 and 5, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GLU<sub>1</sub> (NR<sub>1</sub>) and GLU<sub>2</sub> (NR<sub>2</sub>), APQ4 and HSP60.\nThe IgA antibody levels against those self-antigens, especially GFAP, MBP and HSP60, strongly predict peak DRS scores on days 2 and 3 post-surgery. IgA reactivity against NMDAR and baseline DRS scores explained 40.6% of the variance in peak DRS scores, while IgA against NMDAR, IgG against MBP and age explained 29.1% of the variance in the IRS/CIRS ratio. There was no correlation between DRS scores and IgG directed against other self-antigens.\nIncreased IgA levels against neuronal self-antigens, AQP4 and HSP60 are risk factors for delirium. Polyreactive antibody-associated breakdown of immune tolerance, IRS activation and injuries in the neuronal cytoskeleton, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, glial cells, and myelin sheath are involved in the pathophysiology of delirium."}, {"Title": "Mass Violence and the Complex Spectrum of Mental Illness and Mental Functioning.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry has struggled to clarify the types of mental turmoil that are associated with mass violence. While the problem is complex, it may present an opportunity to improve research, as well as inform public dialogue about what types of mental illness are actually associated with such mass tragedies.\nAssuring the diagnostic accuracy of those who commit mass violence is challenging due to the retrospective nature of the analysis and lack of reliable psychiatric data. Psychiatric research has begun to use a dimensional approach that may be well suited to the study of mental illness in perpetrators of mass violence. This approach aggregates psychiatric symptoms into 3 domains of psychopathology: (1) internalizing, (2) externalizing, and (3) psychotic experience. This approach has practical clinical use and research support. A dimensional approach may help clear up misconceptions about the rate of psychosis in mass violence perpetrators, as well as reveal the most common dimensions of mental functioning associated with perpetrators.\nImproved research methods are needed to clarify and prevent mass violence. More precisely identifying the symptoms and mental turmoil of perpetrators may be associated with improved early identification and prevention. Because adolescence is a critical and formative period in which internalizing and externalizing problems arise, early interventions may have the best chance of reducing future mass violence."}, {"Title": "Excursions in Rorschachlandia: Surveying the scientific and philosophical landscape of Hermann Rorschach's Psychodiagnostics.", "Abstract": "This article examines the milieu of Hermann Rorschach's Psychodiagnostics (1921/2021) under development between 1911 and his death in 1922 and explores new evidence about the direction Rorschach's test might have taken after publication of Psychodiagnostics. This includes direct and indirect influences from turn of the century continental philosophy and science and innovative colleagues in the Swiss psychiatric and psychoanalytic societies. The availability of newly translated scholarship, including the correspondence between Ludwig Binswanger and Hermann Rorschach following the 1921 publication of Psychodiagnostics, Binswanger's posthumous 1923 commentary in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis, and recent new translation of Psychodiagnostics, permits a fresh appraisal of the milieu and foundations of Rorschach's development. Understanding these sources and influences opens new vistas in reappraising the nature of Rorschach's \"test theory\" which Rorschach considered undeveloped at the time of his death. This paper presents new evidence that, under the influence of Rorschach's close colleague, Ludwig Binswanger, the Geisteswissenschaften and phenomenology might have figured prominently in future developments. The paper concludes that Rorschach, preoccupied with considerations of kinesthetic subjectivity in his innovative conceptualization of human movement responses, was a nascent phenomenologist whose untimely death cut short further developments in his theory of the test."}, {"Title": "Modelling mood updating: a proof of principle study.", "Abstract": "Recent developments in computational psychiatry have led to the hypothesis that mood represents an expectation (prior belief) on the likely interoceptive consequences of action (i.e. emotion).

Two ways to avoid spurious interactions.", "Abstract": "Studies across a broad range of disciplines-from psychiatry to cognitive science to behavioural neuroscience-have reported on whether the magnitude of contrast sensitivity alterations in one group or condition varies with spatial frequency. Significant interactions have often gone unexplained or have been used to argue for impairments in specific processing streams. Here, we show that interactions with spatial frequency may need to be re-evaluated if the inherent skew/heteroscedasticity was not taken into account or if visual acuity could plausibly differ across groups or conditions. By re-analysing a publicly available data set, we show that-when using raw contrast sensitivity data-schizophrenia patients exhibit an apparent contrast sensitivity impairment that lessens with spatial frequency, but that when using log-transformed data or when using generalized estimating equations, this interaction reversed. The reversed interaction, but not the overall contrast sensitivity deficit, disappeared when groups were matched on visual acuity. An analysis of the contrast threshold data yielded similar results. A caveat is that matching groups on acuity is probably only defensible if acuity differences arise from non-neural factors such as optical blur. Taken together, these analyses reconcile seemingly discrepant findings in the literature and demonstrate that reporting contrast sensitivity interactions with spatial frequency requires properly accounting for visual acuity and skew/heteroscedasticity."}, {"Title": "Sleep intervention and glycemic control in gestational diabetes mellitus: a feasibility study.", "Abstract": "Over 50% of pregnant people report poor sleep quality and insomnia, with approximately 25% reporting short sleep (<7 hours per night). Short sleep duration is associated with impaired glucose functioning, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although short sleep is associated with elevated blood glucose in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus, it is not known whether education on healthy sleep habits during pregnancy can improve sleep and thus glycemic control in these patients.\nWe developed a sleep education program specific to pregnancy and targeted to patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of this intervention in the setting of a randomized controlled trial.\nA sleep education program specific to pregnancy, \"Sleep-4-2,\" was developed via multidisciplinary collaboration between specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, sleep medicine, and psychiatry. The program was presented to focus groups of pregnant people and a separate group of healthcare providers to gauge acceptability of the program and to modify content. This program was then tested on a group of patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus. Participants were randomized to a group receiving standard gestational diabetes mellitus care or a group participating in the sleep education program. Baseline demographics, sleep knowledge, and self-reported sleep quality information were obtained from all participants at enrollment and again at 35 weeks of pregnancy. Change in sleep knowledge and quality and degree of glycemic control were compared between groups.\nBetween December 2017 and July 2019, 140 patients were screened and 74 were enrolled in the study and randomized. Recruitment to the study was acceptable, with >50% of eligible approached patients agreeing to participate, and retention in the intervention group was high at 94%.

My work has built on the \"estrogen hypothesis\", as stated by Hafner, Riecher-Rossler and Seeman in the 1990's. This hypothesis was that estrogen provides 'protection' against the early onset of severe schizophrenia in women, and with decreasing brain estrogens at the menopause, mental ill health worsens in women. In this paper, results from clinical trials conducted over many decades, that involved administering exogenous estrogen in different types and doses, show an overall positive impact - with improved symptoms of schizophrenia in women. This led to the conduct of further successful clinical trials of gonadal hormone treatment in women with PMDD and menopausal depression, plus understanding more about depression caused by hormone contraceptives. The role of estrogens in stress vulnerability is reflected in the sex-dependent reaction to childhood trauma, which has led to our new work in the neurobiological effects of early life trauma in women."}, {"Title": "Suicide hangings during pre-Covid-19 and Covid-19 - Myths debunked for the lower-middle-income group countries.", "Abstract": "The psyche about the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic has got fixed to a level of conviction that committing suicide is directly linked to coronavirus infection.

Language has been a crucial source of information that mirrors inner processes like thoughts. The development of a novel computational strategy that helps to understand language needs to consider social factors that could also impact human behavior. Ten years ago, I developed a computational approach based on graph theory to measure structural aspects of the narrative's mental organization expressed in spontaneous oral reports. It was possible to measure the decrease in narrative graph connectedness associated with the schizophrenia diagnosis and negative symptoms severity. However, I was worried that the psychiatric field neglected factors from diverse social realities (such as poor access to education). Formal education impacts language by mastering grammar and syntax. Changes in language structure could be related to symptoms and lack of exposure to formal education. Indeed, the same connectedness markers increase according to typical cognitive and academic development. In this paper, I describe the reasons and methods for investigating both factors (psychiatric symptoms and formal education) on language patterns. Further, I evaluate concerns and future challenges of using computational strategies that include social diversity in mental health conditions."}, {"Title": "The gut microbiome and child mental health: A population-based study.", "Abstract": "The link between the gut microbiome and the brain has gained increasing scientific and public interest for its potential to explain psychiatric risk.

In this cross-sectional study in 1,784 ten-year-old children from the multi-ethnic, population-based Generation R Study, we aimed to characterize associations of the gut microbiome with child mental health problems. Gut microbiome was assessed from stool samples using 16S rRNA sequencing. We focused on overall psychiatric symptoms as well as with specific domains of emotional and behavioral problems, assessed via the maternally rated Child Behavior Checklist. While we observed lower gut microbiome diversity in relation to higher overall and specific mental health problems, associations were not significant. Likewise, we did not identify any taxonomic feature associated with mental health problems after multiple testing correction, although suggestive findings indicated depletion of genera previously associated with psychiatric disorders, including Hungatella, Anaerotruncus and Oscillospiraceae. The identified compositional abundance differences were found to be similar across all mental health problems. Finally, we did not find significant enrichment for specific microbial functions in relation to mental health problems. In conclusion, based on the largest sample examined to date, we do not find clear evidence of associations between gut microbiome diversity, taxonomies or functions and mental health problems in the general pediatric population. In future, the use of longitudinal designs with repeated measurements of microbiome and psychiatric outcomes will be critical to identify whether and when associations between the gut microbiome and mental health emerge across development and into adulthood."}, {"Title": "Raising the alarm: Mental health status of the transgender community in Pakistan.", "Abstract": "In Pakistan, the transgender community faces many challenges.

Grassmann was critical of many of the highly speculative extant theories. Second, he reviewed most of the major methodologic concerns in the literature from what kinds of heredity to investigate to the problems with the global use of insanity as a diagnostic category. Third, he discussed in detail genetic theories associated with Degeneration theory, maintaining considerable skepticism. Fourth, he recognized nongenetic contribution to familial transmission. Fifth, he reviewed evidence for both homogeneous and heterogeneous transmission of forms of mental illness in families, suggesting that both were important. Sixth, while he noted that mania, melancholia, and cyclothymia commonly replaced each other in families, Verr\u00fccktheit (delusional psychoses) rarely co-segregated in families with these mood disorders.

Most of the studies selected were experimental designs involving individuals with misophonia.\nThe result of the review revealed abnormal activation and connection among the different higher cortical structures in participants with misophonia. By signifying various neurophysiological and neuroradiological findings, the review confirms that misophonia is a neurophysiological disorder that may border between audiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Assessment of study quality reported an overall low risk of bias.\nThis review highlights the need to include an audiologist as a team member in the evaluation and management of misophonia."}, {"Title": "Interdisciplinary considerations for diagnosing aphasia in the schizoaffective patient: A case report.", "Abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia present with both cognitive impairment as well as language difficulties. There are similarities in the language output of patients with schizophrenia and patients with aphasia, thus a differential diagnosis of patients who present with a question of dual diagnoses can be a clinical challenge. This case report highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to a patient with schizophrenia who benefitted from intervention from both psychiatry and speech-language pathology services due to the patient's unique verbal output.\nThe primary aim of this case report is to highlight the critical importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in this patient population. The secondary aim is to disseminate an interesting and unique clinical phenomenon whereby the patient demonstrated an awareness of two distinct speech patterns and the unique ability to 'code switch' between them, something not commonly appreciated in this clinical population.\nThis case report describes a patient seen as part of routine clinical care. Information shared was solely observational and involved dissemination of information regarding case history, assessment and treatment plan. No interventions were implemented as a part of this study.\nInterprofessional communication was critical in order to diagnose a patient with schizophrenia with an atypical speech pattern. The patient's language output did not manifest as a true aphasia but rather as two distinct language patterns that the patient could use at will. This ability to 'code switch' between languages is a unique clinical profile that is atypical of patients with schizophrenia.\nWhat is already known on this subject Contemporary literature discusses the similarities between the language patterns of patients with aphasia and those with schizophrenia. There has been debate about how to classify and identify the mechanism of schizophrenic language. It is unclear whether the tangential press of speech in schizophrenia is a consequence of a formal thought disorder, or whether it constitutes an actual disorder or expressive language. Additionally, the mechanism for this speech pattern is not well defined in the literature as there is no consensus on whether it is a breakdown in linguistic processing or simply a patient's disordered thoughts being put into words. A less robust literature exists that suggests that there is a cognitive mechanism responsible for these speech patterns, as tangential speech has been linked to poor goal maintenance in other types of cognitive tasks. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study adds an important discussion about the critical importance of interprofessional collaboration when differentially diagnosing this complex patient population. It highlights the importance of the clinical exchange of information between the two disciplines of psychiatry\u00a0and speech-language pathology about a patient population where clinical information is intertwined in the way described above. Regardless of the cause of the disordered output, what is lacking in the literature is evidence of how to address the complexities of the output of these patients and how to best manage the care of the patient. This study adds a practical clinical approach to collaborating on the assessment and management of this complex patient population. Importantly, it adds a description of a clinical manifestation of the language output of a patient with schizophrenia that we do not believe to have been previously published in the literature. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Implications of this study include a much-needed shift in the field in two regards. First, to include this patient population in the groups of patients that can benefit from interprofessional collaboration for differential diagnosis and consideration for speech and language therapy. Second, it offers a practical clinical approach to inter-professional management in this patient population, something the literature is currently lacking. Additionally, publication of this unique clinical manifestation provides foundational knowledge for other clinicians appreciating similar clinical patterns of language output. To our knowledge, this is the first published case in which a patient could volitionally inhibit certain speech characteristics and thus this case study may assist in future differential diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Journeying to Ixtlan: Ethics of Psychedelic Medicine and Research for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we examine the case of psychedelic medicine for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).

Twelve in-depht interviews were performed in November and December 2021 with family members of people with BPD and self-harming behaviour who have accessed BA. The phenomenological life-world perspective guided the analysis.\nFamilies' life-world was characterized by anxiety and constant protection of their loved one. They live with constant fear of how their loved ones are feeling and whether they will injure themselves. When access to BA was available this gave hope and provided conditions for families to maintain everyday routines and also enhanced relationships among family members. When families' loved ones were denied BA, they felt betrayed which contributed to negative feelings towards the medical profession, and the families lost confidence in psychiatry.\nBy interviewing families of people with BPD and self-harming behaviour who had access to BA, it emerged they possess valuable knowledge. BA can be developed if the needs of families are taken into consideration, and if families are given the opportunity to share emotions and the high burden of responsibility with staff or families in similar situations. If health care staff gives family members a more central role in care and makes their shared life-world visible it could thereby hopefully increase well-being and benefits for the whole family."}, {"Title": "Locked down or locked out?

The study period consisted of the first 34\u00a0weeks of 2019 and 2020. This period corresponded to the first five stages of Massachusetts's COVID-19 public health restrictions: pre-lockdown, lockdown, Phase I, II and III reopenings.

PES volume remained significantly lower during Phase I reopening compared to the previous year but returned to 2019 levels during Phase II. The covariate-adjusted proportion of weekly encounters that led to inpatient admission significantly increased by 16% (CI = [0.11, 0.21], <i>p</i> < 0.00) for mobile crisis teams (MCTs) and significantly declined by 13% (CI = [-0.19, -0.07], <i>p</i> < 0.00) for BEST-designated emergency departments during the lockdown period compared to the prior year.\nThe overall drop in PES utilization and the rise in inpatient admissions for MCT encounters suggests that during the early phases of the pandemic, patients delayed psychiatric care until they had a psychiatric crisis. Public health messaging about the lockdowns and absent equivalent messaging about the availability of telehealth services may have made patients more reluctant to seek psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Melancholia as psychalgia: the integration of psychophysiological theory and psychopathologic observation in the mid-19th century.", "Abstract": "While sufferers of major depression to the present day sometimes describe their experience as \"mental pain,\" limited attention has been given to one of the major etiologic theories of 19th century psychiatry: melancholia as psychalgia. I illustrate the development of this theory, which arose in the context of the early phases of the application of psychophysiology to mental illness, through German, French, and English psychiatric texts from the 1830-1870s. As clinical pathological correlation became a dominant paradigm in early 19th medicine, nervous diseases stood out as potential exceptions, sometimes demonstrating \"pain without lesions\" or neuralgia. Tic Douloureux was a paradigmatic example. The first descriptions of reflex actions in the spinal cord in the early 19th century resulted in a range of theories of reflexes in brain that expanded to include \"ganglia\" that could react to diverse complex social and mental stimuli, and whose actions could impact key mental functions including mood. Theories of neuralgia included a constitutional predisposition and an acute physical trauma producing a hypersensitivity so that normal stimuli (e.g., touch) were misinterpreted as excruciating pain. A parallel framework was conceptualized in the brain to produce psychalgia. A predisposition combined with a mental trauma could produce hypersensitivity in key brain ganglia. This psychophysiological framework explained how normal social and introspective experiences would, in melancholic patients, be interpreted in a distorted manner, reinforcing themes of inadequacy, failure, and worthlessness, and produce a sustained mood state of intense mental pain or psychalgia. I illustrate the development of this theory, which integrated brain and mind-based perspectives on mental illness, through the writings of four major 19th alienists: Guislain, Griesinger, Maudsley, and Krafft-Ebing."}, {"Title": "Anton Boisen Reconsidered: Psychiatric Survivor and Mad Prophet.", "Abstract": "Anton Boisen was a seminal figure in the psychology of religion and pastoral psychology, but scholars have remained skeptical about his theoretical contributions and have perpetuated the stigma surrounding his psychiatric diagnosis and incarceration.

Patients who were deemed incompetent to stand trial were less likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Those that had a higher body mass index (BMI), were diagnosed with multiple comorbid conditions, not prescribed involuntary medications, were offered incentives, and received the influenza vaccine were more likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Prior research suggests that adults with PTSD may have altered circulating eCB tone and a blunted mobilization of eCBs (particularly 2-AG) in response to stress (e.g., aerobic exercise), although our understanding has been limited in part due to heterogenous samples and small sample sizes.\nA subset of data was pooled from five studies in which women with and without PTSD (N\u00a0=\u00a098) completed questionnaires related to mood states and a blood draw prior to and following a bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in order to determine: 1) whether circulating eCBs differ between groups and whether depressive and PTSD symptom severity are associated with baseline eCBs, 2) whether a bout of aerobic exercise increases circulating eCBs in adult women with PTSD, and 3) whether circulating eCBs are associated with overall mood states and exercise-induced improvements in mood states in women with and without PTSD.\nPTSD diagnoses were not associated with baseline concentrations of eCBs. Greater depressive symptom severity and PTSD symptom severity within the negative alteration in cognition and mood cluster were associated with lower circulating AEA. Circulating AEA significantly increased following aerobic exercise for both groups, whereas circulating 2-AG only increased in women without PTSD. Greater circulating AEA within the PTSD group was associated with lower depressive mood, confusion, and total mood disturbance.\nThese findings suggest that greater circulating AEA is associated with better overall mood and lower depressive and PTSD symptom severity, and that an acute bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise increases circulating AEA (but not 2-AG) in adult women with PTSD. These findings are consistent with the idea that greater eCB tone (particularly AEA) following pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological manipulations may be beneficial for improving psychological outcomes (e.g., mood, cognition) among PTSD, and possibly other psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Thirty years of research on negative symptoms of schizophrenia: A scientometric analysis of hotspots, bursts, and research trends.", "Abstract": "Research on negative symptoms of schizophrenia has received renewed interest since the 1980s.

The scientific study of the biological basis of mental illness has generally focused on objective measures and observable behaviors, limiting the potential for our understanding of brain mechanisms of disease states and possible treatments. However, applying methods designed principally to interpret objective behavioral measures to the measurement and extrapolation of subjective states presents a number of challenges. In order to help bridge this gap, we draw on the tradition of phenomenology, a philosophical movement concerned with elucidating the structure of lived experience, which emerged in the early 20th century and influenced philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and psychiatry. A number of early phenomenologically-oriented psychiatrists made influential contributions to the field, but this approach retreated to the background as psychiatry moved towards more operationalized disease classifications. Recently, clinical-phenomenological research and viewpoints have re-emerged in the field. We argue that the potential for phenomenological research and methods to generate productive hypotheses about the neurobiological basis of psychiatric diseases has thus far been underappreciated. Using specific examples drawing on the subjective experience of mania and psychosis, we demonstrate that phenomenologically-oriented clinical studies can generate novel and fruitful propositions for neuroscientific investigation. Additionally, we outline a proposal for more rigorously integrating phenomenological investigations of subjective experience with the methods of modern neuroscience research, advocating a cross-species approach with a key role for human subjects research. Collaborative interaction between phenomenology, psychiatry, and neuroscience has the potential to move these fields towards a unified understanding of the biological basis of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Burning down the house: reinventing drug discovery in psychiatry for the development of targeted therapies.", "Abstract": "Despite advances in neuroscience, limited progress has been made in developing new and better medications for psychiatric disorders. Available treatments in psychiatry rely on a few classes of drugs that have a broad spectrum of activity across disorders with limited understanding of mechanism of action. While the added value of more targeted therapies is apparent, a dearth of pathophysiologic mechanisms exists to support targeted treatments, and where mechanisms have been identified and drugs developed, results have been disappointing. Based on serendipity and early successes that led to the current drug armamentarium, a haunting legacy endures that new drugs should align with outdated and overinclusive diagnostic categories, consistent with the idea that \"one size fits all\". This legacy has fostered clinical trial designs focused on heterogenous populations of patients with a single diagnosis and non-specific outcome variables. Disturbingly, this approach likely contributed to missed opportunities for drugs targeting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and now inflammation. Indeed, cause-and-effect data support the role of inflammatory processes in neurotransmitter alterations that disrupt specific neurocircuits and related behaviors. This pathway to pathology occurs across disorders and warrants clinical trial designs that enrich for patients with increased inflammation and use primary outcome variables associated with specific effects of inflammation on brain and behavior. Nevertheless, such trial designs have not been routinely employed, and results of anti-inflammatory treatments have been underwhelming. Thus, to accelerate development of targeted therapeutics including in the area of inflammation, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry must embrace treatments and trials focused on pathophysiologic pathways that impact specific symptom domains in subsets of patients, agnostic to diagnosis. Moreover, closer collaboration among basic and clinical investigators is needed to apply neuroscience knowledge to reveal disease mechanisms that drive psychiatric symptoms. Together, these efforts will support targeted treatments, ultimately leading to new and better therapeutics in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "mHealth in psychiatry: A pathway to person-centered care.", "Abstract": "Influenced by the field of epidemiology and the early ecological psychologists, my research focused on the role of person-environment interactions in the development and maintenance of psychopathology - a field I would name Contextual Psychiatry.

In a separate sample of SPARK participants, we confirmed higher rates of suicidal thoughts compared to non-autistic children from the ABCD cohort (combined N\u00a0=\u00a016,049, Odds Ratio\u00a0=\u00a06.8, p<2.2e-16), and further that autistic children with suicidal thoughts had significantly higher cognitive ability (p<2.2e-16) than those without. Elevated polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive performance were associated with increased suicidal thoughts (N\u00a0=\u00a01,983, Z=2.16,p=0.03), with PGS for educational attainment trending in the same direction (Z=1.4,p=0.17). Notably, similar results were found in parents of these autistic youth, where higher PGS for educational attainment was associated with increasing thoughts of suicide (N\u00a0=\u00a0736, Z=2.28,p=0.02). Taken together, these results suggest that on a phenotypic and genetic level, increasing cognitive ability is an unexpected risk factor for suicidal ideation in individuals diagnosed with, or at risk for autism."}, {"Title": "Mapping diagnostic trajectories from the first hospital diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder: a Danish nationwide cohort study using sequence analysis.", "Abstract": "A key clinical problem in psychiatry is predicting the diagnostic future of patients presenting with psychopathology for the first time. The objective of this study was to establish a comprehensive map of subsequent diagnoses after a first psychiatric hospital diagnosis.\nThrough the Danish National Patient Registry, we identified patients aged 18 years or older with an inpatient or outpatient psychiatric hospital contact and who had received one of the 20 most common first-time psychiatric diagnoses (defined at the ICD-10 two-cipher level, F00-F99) between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2008. For each first-time diagnosis, the 20 most frequent subsequent psychiatric diagnoses (F00-F99), and death, occurring during 10 years of follow-up were identified as outcomes. To assess diagnostic stability, we used social sequence analyses, assigning a subsequent diagnosis to each state with a length of 6 months following each first-time diagnosis. The subsequent diagnosis was defined as the last diagnosis given within each 6-month period. We calculated the normalised entropy of each sequence to show the uncertainty of predicting the states in a given sequence. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the risk of receiving a subsequent diagnosis (at the one-cipher level, F0-F9) after each first-time diagnosis.\nThe cohort consisted of 184\u2009949 adult patients (77\u2009129 [41\u00b77%] men and 107\u2009820 [58\u00b73%] women, mean age 42\u00b75 years [SD 18\u00b75; range 18 to >100). Ethnicity data were not recorded. Over 10 years of follow-up, 86\u2009804 (46\u00b79%) patients had at least one subsequent diagnosis that differed from their first-time diagnosis. Measured by mean normalised entropy values, persistent delusional disorders (ICD-10 code F22), mental and behavioural disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances (F19), and acute and transient psychotic disorders (F23) had the highest diagnostic variability, whereas eating disorders (F50) and non-organic sexual dysfunction (F52) had the lowest. The risk of receiving a subsequent diagnosis with a psychiatric disorder from an ICD-10 group different from that of the first-time diagnosis varied substantially among first-time diagnoses.\nThese data provide detailed information on possible diagnostic outcomes after a first-time presentation in a psychiatric hospital. This information could help clinicians to plan relevant follow-up and inform patients and families on the degree of diagnostic uncertainty associated with receiving a first psychiatric hospital diagnosis, as well as likely and unlikely trajectories of diagnostic progression.\nMental Health Services, Capital region of Denmark.\nFor the Danish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Children Enrolled in Medicaid.", "Abstract": "This study examined telepsychiatry use among children enrolled in Medicaid before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA retrospective analysis was conducted of claims data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System for children (ages 3-17) with any mental health service use in 2019 (N=5,606,555) and 2020 (N=5,094,446).\nThe number of children using mental health services declined by 9.1% from 2019 to 2020.

According to this approach, a process based on internationally valid diagnostic tools such as The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases (ICD), patient reports and the observation and experience of the physician is monitored. As in other fields of medicine, the search for biomarkers that can be used in processes related to diseases continues in psychiatry and various researches are carried out in this field.\nWithin the scope of this study, a dataset containing electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements of individuals diagnosed with different psychiatric diseases were analyzed by machine learning methods and the diseases were differentiated/classified with the models obtained. Thus, it was investigated whether EEG data could be a biomarker for psychiatric diseases.\nIn the dataset analyzed within the scope of the study, for 550 patients (81 bipolar disorder, 95 attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder - ADHD, 67 depression, 34 obsessive compulsive disorder - OCD, 75 opioid, 146 posttraumatic stress disorder - PTSD, 52 schizophrenia) and 84 healthy individuals, there are 634 samples (rows), 77 variables (columns) in total. 76 of the variables consist of absolute power values belonging to 4 frequency bands (alpha, beta, delta, theta) collected from 19 different electrodes. 80\u00a0% of the dataset was used for training the models and 20\u00a0% of the data was used for testing the performance of the models. The 5-fold cross validation (CV) method, which repeats 3 times in the training dataset, was used and with this method, the hyperparameters used in the models were also optimized. Different models have been established with the selected hyperparameters and the performance of these models has been tested with the test dataset. C5.0, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to build the models.\nWithin the scope of the study, the absolute power values obtained from EEG measurements performed using 19 electrodes were analyzed by machine learning methods. It was concluded that classification between disease groups was feasible with a high accuracy (C5.0-0.841, SVM_radial - 0.841, RF - 0.762). It was observed that ADHD, depression and schizophrenia diseases can be differentiated better (F-score\u00a0=\u00a01, balanced accuracy\u00a0=\u00a01) once the results were evaluated on a class category basis according to the F- measure and balanced accuracy values.\nThrough the medium of the analyzes made within the scope of this study, it was investigated whether EEG data could be used as a biomarker for the detection and diagnosis of psychiatric diseases. The findings obtained from this study revealed that by using EEG data as a biomarker, it can be highly predicted whether a person has a psychiatric disease or not. Once evaluated with broad strokes, it is feasible to assert that it is possible to analyze whether the person who consults a physician with a complaint is ranked among the psychiatric disease class with EEG measurement. When trying to differentiate between numerous and diverse disease categories, it may be claimed that some diseases (ADHD, depression, schizophrenia) can be distinguished better by coming to the fore on a model basis. Considering the findings, it is anticipated that the analyzes obtained as a result of this study will contribute to the studies to be conducted using machine learning in the field of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Cross-Modality Evidence for Reduced Choice History Biases in Psychosis-Prone Individuals.", "Abstract": "Predictive processing posits that perception emerges from inferential processes within a hierarchical cortical system. Alterations of these processes may result in psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations and delusions. Central to the predictive processing account of psychosis is the notion of aberrant weights attributed to prior information and sensory input. Based on the notion that previous perceptual choices represent a relevant source of prior information, we here asked whether the propensity towards psychotic experiences may be related to altered choice history biases in perceptual decision-making.\nWe investigated the relationship between choice history biases in perceptual decision-making and psychosis proneness in the general population. Choice history biases and their adaptation to experimentally induced changes in stimulus serial dependencies were investigated in decision-making tasks with auditory (experiment 1) and visual (experiment 2) stimuli. We further explored a potential compensatory mechanism for reduced choice history biases by reliance on predictive cross-modal cues.\nIn line with our preregistered hypothesis, psychosis proneness was associated with decreased choice history biases in both experiments. This association is generalized across conditions with and without stimulus serial dependencies. We did not find consistent evidence for a compensatory reliance on cue information in psychosis-prone individuals across experiments.\nOur results show reduced choice history biases in psychosis proneness. A compensatory mechanism between implicit choice history effects and explicit cue information is not supported unequivocally by our data."}, {"Title": "The NSW Emergency Psychiatry Network.", "Abstract": "Emergency Psychiatry is evolving.

It can come as the result of a direct experience when racism is enacted on you, vicariously-such as when you see videos of other people facing racism-and/or transmitted intergenerationally. More and more, research in child and adolescent psychiatry has supported that race-related stress and racialized violence has systemic roots and psychological and physiological consequences. The term \"emotion regulation\" is generally used to describe a person's ability to effectively manage and respond to an emotional experience and to adapt to the demands of their environment. At the time of writing this editorial, youth of color have witnessed a pandemic in which their families and communities have been disproportionately impacted and devastated, the death of George Floyd and other racialized violence against unarmed people of color, murder of their elders in grocery stores and churches, their peers shot by assault weapons while attending school, all compounded by discrimination against sexual and gender minority people in some regions, climate change heating up our earth, and immigrant children separated from parents or dying at the border. What will be the response of the adults around them to protect them? What is the role of emotion regulation skills for youth experiencing race-related stress and trauma in a dysregulated world?"}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatric aspects of long COVID: A comprehensive review.", "Abstract": "Although some patients have persistent symptoms or develop new symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, neuropsychiatric aspects of long COVID are not well known. This review summarizes and provides an update on the neuropsychiatric dimensions of long COVID. Its neuropsychiatric manifestations commonly include fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. There are no specific tests for long COVID, but some characteristic findings such as hypometabolism on positron emission tomography have been reported. The possible mechanisms of long COVID include inflammation, ischemic effects, direct viral invasion, and social and environmental changes. Some patient characteristics and the severity and complications of acute COVID-19 infection may be associated with an increased risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Long COVID may resolve spontaneously or persist, depending on the type of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although established treatments are lacking, various psychological and pharmacological treatments have been attempted. Vaccination against COVID-19 infection plays a key role in the prevention of long coronavirus disease. With differences among the SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the omicron variant, the aspects of long COVID are likely to change in the future. Further studies clarifying the aspects of long COVID to develop effective treatments are warranted."}, {"Title": "Dexmedetomidine in Psychiatry: Repurposing of its Fast-Acting Anxiolytic, Analgesic and Sleep Modulating Properties.", "Abstract": "Drug repurposing is a strategy to identify new indications for already approved drugs. A recent successful example in psychiatry is ketamine, an anesthetic drug developed in the 1960s, now approved and clinically used as a fast-acting antidepressant. Here, we describe the potential of dexmedetomidine as a psychopharmacological repurposing candidate. This \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist is approved in the US and Europe for procedural sedation in intensive care. It has shown fast-acting inhibitory effects on perioperative stress-related pathologies, including psychomotor agitation, hyperalgesia, and neuroinflammatory overdrive, proving potentially useful in clinical psychiatry. We offer an overview of the pharmacological profile and effects of dexmedetomidine with potential utility for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Dexmedetomidine exerts fast-acting and robust sedation, anxiolytic, analgesic, sleep-modulating, and anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, the drug prevents postoperative agitation and delirium, possibly via neuroprotective mechanisms. While evidence in animals and humans supports these properties, larger controlled trials in clinical samples are generally scarce, and systematic studies with psychiatric patients do not exist. In conclusion, dexmedetomidine is a promising candidate for an experimental treatment targeting stress-related pathologies common in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. First small proof-of-concept studies and then larger controlled clinical trials are warranted in psychiatric populations to test the feasibility and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in these conditions."}, {"Title": "What Were the Nursing Practices of Mental Health Nurses in Mental Institutions 1800 to 1960: A Scoping Review.", "Abstract": "This scoping literature review describes the practices of nurses working in mental asylums between 1800 and 1960 prior to the introduction of psychotropic drugs.

In trials, psychiatric rating scale scores employed as outcome variables are invalid and rely on folk psychology-like narratives. Using machine learning techniques, we developed a new precision nomothetic model of mood disorders with a recurrence of illness (ROI) index, a new endophenotype class, namely Major Dysmood Disorder (MDMD), characterised by increased ROI, a more severe phenome, and more disabilities. Nonetheless, our previous studies did not compute Research and Diagnostic Algorithmic Rules (RADAR) to diagnose MDMD and score ROI, lifetime (LT), and current suicidal behaviours, as well as the phenome of mood disorders. Here, we provide rules to compute bottom-up RADAR scores for MDMD, ROI, LT and current suicidal ideation and attempts, the phenome of mood disorders, and the lifetime trajectory of mood disorder patients from a family history of mood disorders and substance abuse to adverse childhood experiences, ROI, and the phenome. We also demonstrate how to plot the 12 major scores in a single RADAR graph, which displays all features in a two-dimensional plot. These graphs allow the characteristics of a patient to be displayed as an idiomatic fingerprint, allowing one to estimate the key traits and severity of the illness at a glance.

We show that all symptom domains (negative and PHEMFP) may be used to derive a single latent trait called overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS). In addition, neurocognitive test results may be used to extract a general cognitive decline (G-CoDe) index, based on executive function, attention, semantic and episodic memory, and delayed recall scores. According to partial least squares analysis, the impacts of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) on OSOS are partially mediated by increasing G-CoDe severity. The AOPs include neurotoxic cytokines and chemokines, oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, IgA responses to neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites, breakdown of the vascular and paracellular pathways with translocation of Gram-negative bacteria, and insufficient protection through lowered antioxidant levels and impairments in the innate immune system. Unsupervised machine learning identified a new schizophrenia endophenotype class, named major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP), which is characterised by increased negative symptoms and PHEMFP, G-CoDe and the above-mentioned AOPs. Based on these pathways and phenome features, MNP is a distinct endophenotype class which is qualitatively different from simple psychosis (SP).

Currently, 90% of psychiatrists work in the cities, and there are significant projected workforce shortages of psychiatrists throughout Australia, particularly in rural and remote locations. This qualitative study explores factors influencing medical students and junior doctors' decisions to pursue a career in rural psychiatry.\nUsing a phenomenological approach, data were collected through semi-structured interviews and focus groups and subjected to thematic analysis.\nSixteen participants were interviewed, 11 interviewees and five participants from two focus groups. This study identified enablers and challenges in pursuing rural psychiatry training in Australia. Clinical exposure to rural psychiatry, personal factors, rural lifestyle and workforce shortage awareness were identified as enablers. The lack of rural infrastructure, the attractiveness of urban psychiatry and the stigma toward rural psychiatry were identified as barriers.\nAustralian rural psychiatry workforce remains a complex issue.

The current study sought to further evaluate whether intimate relationship functioning is a motivator for mental health treatment seeking for male and female veterans and examine the impact of different types of trauma exposure on this association.\nUsing data from a longitudinal study, we examined whether intimate relationship functioning mediated the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and mental health service use (0 = no mental health services, 1 = any mental health services) in male and female veterans (<i>N</i> = 1,200). We used multiple groups path analysis to examine whether intimate relationship functioning mediated the association between PTSD symptom severity and mental health service use for male and female veterans.\nFor male veterans, greater PTSD symptom severity was related to poorer intimate relationship functioning, which in turn explained increased likelihood of mental health service use (<i>R</i>\u00b2 = .18). This mediation effect was not significant for female veterans.\nOur findings suggest that targeting intimate relationship functioning in treatment for male veterans may be beneficial because difficulties in these relationships appear to be a motivating factor for treatment seeking.

A Thematic Analysis of Peer to Peer Interviews.", "Abstract": "To include people with disabilities as equal citizens, CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) promotes direct or supported decision-making by people with disabilities. However, involuntary psychiatry admission is considered in many countries to be necessary for people with psychosocial disabilities. To overcome the tension and implement CRPD, it is essential to understand the experiences and concerns of service users, family members, and medical professionals in each country. To understand the process and the factors that make psychiatrists decide involuntary psychiatric admission in Japan, and explore their attitudes toward direct or supported decision-making by people with psychosocial disabilities. Psychiatrists who had authorized involuntary admission and who were in charge of the service users were recruited at hospitals in Japan. The interviews were individual, peer to peer, and semi-structured. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and the analysis followed reflexive thematic analysis using NVIVO 12. Six psychiatrists (five designated psychiatrists and one psychiatric resident) participated in the study at two hospitals in urban Japan. The study found that the psychiatrists assessed symptoms, behaviors, and perceptions of the service users together with supports and wishes of their families. The psychiatrists decided on involuntary admission when they saw self-harm or violence, weak insights and judgment abilities, family's wishes, or when they wanted to avoid the service users leaving the hospital with incomplete treatment. The psychiatrists felt that the service users would not understand any explanations, which made their communications minimal. The psychiatrists thought it was hard to imagine a system other than the current involuntary admission mechanism. If it was to change, they felt the essential things were to avoid abuse, clarify who is responsible, make plans medically valid and feasible, and assess and plan through everyday life, not just in crisis. During a crisis, the psychiatrists were most careful about complying with the Mental Health Act and responded to the family's wish. The psychiatrists justified involuntary admission as they believed that people in a psychiatric crisis cannot decide or understand and need protection. Related protocols, laws, and expectations from family members shapes the values and practices of psychiatrists in Japan. The paper concludes with several recommendations to regard people with psychosocial disabilities as equal citizens, and promoting the aim of reducing or ending involuntary admission."}, {"Title": "The Effect of Adding Sour Cherry Concentrate to The Usual Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder In 6 To 12 Years Old Children.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sour cherry concentrate in symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\nIn a randomized clinical trial, 70 children with ADHD referred to the psychiatric clinic of Ibn-e-Sina Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, in 2021 were selected.

Exposures were socio-demographic characteristics, lifetime psychiatric disorder, and COVID-related variables, including SARS-CoV-2 infection/illness with COVID-19. We identified four subsamples of participants without pre-pandemic experience of our outcomes: binge eating (n\u00a0=\u200924,211), low weight (n\u00a0=\u200924,364), suicidal and/or self-harm ideation (n\u00a0=\u200918,040), and self-harm (n\u00a0=\u200929,948). Participants reported on our outcomes at frequent intervals (fortnightly to monthly). We fitted multiple logistic regression models to identify factors associated with the new onset of our outcomes.\nWithin each subsample, new onset was reported by: 21% for binge eating, 10.8% for low weight, 23.5% for suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and 3.5% for self-harm. Shared risk factors included having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, not being in paid employment, higher pandemic worry scores, and being racially minoritized. Conversely, infection with SARS-CoV-2/illness with COVID-19 was linked to lower odds of binge eating, low weight, and suicidal and/or self-harm ideation.\nOverall, we detected shared risk factors that may drive the comorbidity between eating disorders and self-harm. Subgroups of individuals with these risk factors may require more frequent monitoring during future pandemics.\nIn a sample of 35,000 UK residents, people who had a psychiatric disorder, identified as being part of a racially minoritized group, were not in paid employment, or were more worried about the pandemic were more likely to experience binge eating, low weight, suicidal and/or self-harm ideation, and self-harm for the first time during the pandemic. People with these risk factors may need particular attention during future pandemics to enable early identification of new psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Growing inequities in mental health crisis services offered to indigent patients in Puerto Rico versus the US states before and after Hurricanes Maria and Irma.", "Abstract": "To assess changes in the availability of mental health crisis services in Puerto Rico relative to US states before and after Hurricanes Maria and Irma.\nNational Mental Health Services Surveys conducted in 2016 and 2020.\nRepeated cross-sectional design.

Many patients with FS report at least one prior TBI, and these patients typically present with more severe psychiatric comorbidities. TBI and psychopathology are linked to changes in neural network connectivity, but their combined effects on these networks and relationship to the effects of FS remain unclear. We hypothesised that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) would differ between patients with FS and TBI (FS+TBI) compared with TBI without FS (TBI only), with variability only partially explained by the presence of psychopathology.\nPatients with FS+TBI (n=52) and TBI only (n=54) were matched for age and sex. All participants completed psychiatric assessments prior to resting-state functional MRI at 3 T. Independent component analysis identified five canonical rsFC networks related to emotion and motor functions.\nFive linear mixed-effects analyses identified clusters of connectivity coefficients that differed between groups within the posterior cingulate of the default mode network, insula and supramarginal gyrus of the executive control network and bilateral anterior cingulate of the salience network (all \u03b1=0.05, corrected). Cluster signal extractions revealed decreased contributions to each network for FS+TBI compared to TBI only. Planned secondary analyses demonstrated correlations between signal and severity of mood, anxiety, somatisation and global functioning symptoms.\nThese findings indicate the presence of aberrant connectivity in FS and extend the biopsychosocial network model by demonstrating that common aetiology is linked to both FS and comorbidities, but the overlap in affected networks varies by comorbid symptoms."}, {"Title": "Provision of Mental Health Services in the Veterans Health Administration: A Nationwide Comparison With Other Providers.", "Abstract": "Public interest in developing a national health care system has grown in the United States, but so have concerns that a large system would provide poor care.

Extracted data included the child's age, sex, race-ethnicity, family makeup, insurance status, arrival status, referral source, diagnosis, disposition, treatment, number of CPEP and police encounters, and occurrences of aggression and suicidality. Multilevel and ordinary logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with a first and subsequent police arrival.\nOf 339 children with CPEP encounters from September 2017 to April 2018, 103 (30%) had had at least one police arrival. Children brought by police were more likely than peers brought by caregivers to be Black or Latinx, have Medicaid, come from families without two parents, and have aggressive outbursts or suicidal behavior. Results from multilevel logistic regression indicated that aggressive outbursts and suicidality were most significantly and consistently associated with experiencing both a first and subsequent police arrival.\nClinical and sociodemographic differences in police arrivals highlight the need for a comprehensive systems approach for children, especially marginalized youths, who need psychiatric emergency care."}, {"Title": "Consultation-Liaison Case Conference: Malignantly Catatonic and Unable to Receive Electroconvulsive Therapy.", "Abstract": "We present the case of a 65-year-old female with a past psychiatric history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety who recently underwent diagnostic laparoscopy in the setting of a recent computerized tomography scan revealing a peritoneal mass.

The phenotypic expression of episodes of bipolar depression is difficult to differentiate from major depressive disorder and can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire is a readily available screening tool for bipolar disorder that has been validated in previous studies for use in the general and perinatal populations. However, the discriminatory capacity of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire for perinatal people who screen positive for depression in nonpsychiatric settings is still unclear.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the discriminatory capacity of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire to identify bipolar disorder in perinatal people who screen positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.\nThis retrospective cohort study included individuals enrolled in the Collaborative Care Model for Perinatal Depression Support Services, a collaborative care program for perinatal mental health services implemented in a quaternary care setting, from January 2017 to April 2021. All individuals completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire and psychiatric evaluation by a licensed clinical social worker. Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared between those with and without a clinical diagnosis of bipolar disorder using bivariable analyses. The discriminatory capacity and test characteristics of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire were assessed at each score cutoff using the gold standard of a psychiatric clinical evaluation for comparison.\nFrom January 2017 to April 2021, 1510 birthing people were enrolled in the Collaborative Care Model for Perinatal Depression Support Services and included in this study. Among this group, 62 (4.1%) were diagnosed with bipolar disorder by psychiatric clinical evaluation using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria. A score of \u22657 on question 1 is often used in the general population to identify bipolar disorder, which has a 60% sensitivity and 88% specificity in our perinatal sample with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.76). Lowering the threshold to \u22654 improves sensitivity to 81% and the discriminatory capacity to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.80), at the expense of a reduction in specificity to 69%.\nThe administration of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire in the perinatal period can help to identify which individuals who have screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 are at risk of a bipolar or unipolar disorder. In this context, lowering the Mood Disorder Questionnaire score threshold from that used in the nonperinatal population down to 4 improves test characteristics and reduces the risk of a missed diagnosis of bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Major and Persistent Depressive Disorders.", "Abstract": "To enhance the quality of care and clinical outcomes for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD).

Evidence from meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/RTI-UNC review is also presented to support or refute the AHRQ findings. Guidance about the assessment and clinical implementation of treatments for MDD and PDD is informed by expert opinion and consensus as presented in previously published clinical practice guidelines, chapters in leading textbooks of child and adolescent psychiatry, the DSM-5-TR, and government-affiliated prescription drug information websites.\nPsychotherapy (specifically, cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have some rigorous (randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses) empirical support as treatment options. Because effective treatment outcomes are predicated in part upon accuracy of the diagnosis, depth of the clinical formulation, and breadth of the treatment plan, comprehensive, evidence-based assessment may enhance evidence-based treatment outcomes.\nDisproportionate to the magnitude of the problem, there are significant limitations in the quality and quantity of rigorous empirical support for the etiology, assessment, and treatment of depression in children and adolescents. In the context of a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent-trained behavioral health specialists, the demonstration of convenient, efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly delivery mechanisms for safe and effective treatment of MDD and PDD is a key research need.

The study conducted a thematic analysis to describe the health care staff's experiences with these guidelines and suggestions for improvement.\nMost participants reported appreciation for the implementation of clinical guidelines with an SUD focus, an area they considered to have previously been neglected, but also noted the need for more practical guidance in the administration of the assessments. Participants reported the dual roles of caregiver and warden as difficult to reconcile and a similar, hindering division was also present in the health care staff's attitudes toward SUD. Participants' reports also described an imbalance prior to the implementation, whereby SUD was rarely assessed but treatment was still initiated. One year after the implementation, an imbalance still existed, but in reverse: SUD was more frequently assessed, but treatment was difficult to initiate.\nDespite indications of some ambivalence among staff regarding the necessity of the assessment and treatment guidelines, many participants considered it helpful to have a structured way to assess and treat SUD in this patient group. The imbalance between frequent assessment and infrequent treatment may have been due to difficulties transitioning patients across the \"gap\" between assessment and treatment. To bridge this gap, mental health services should make efforts to increase patients' insight concerning their SUD, flexibility in the administration of treatment, and the motivational skills of the health care staff working with this patient group. Participants considered important for enhancing treatment quality a shared knowledge base regarding SUD, and increased collaboration between different professions and between in- and outpatient services."}, {"Title": "Psychopathy subdomains in violent offenders with and without a psychotic disorder.", "Abstract": "Violence in psychosis has been linked to antisocial behavior and psychopathy traits.

The increasing activity of emergency departments in recent years and the recurrent psychiatric bed shortages have shed light upon the weaknesses of this key link in the mental healthcare process. The Seine-Saint-Denis is a department of France located in the Grand Paris metropolis in the \u00cele-de-France region. Ranked third in terms of population size in France, it is marked by social precariousness. With regard to mental health, it has one of the lowest rates of psychiatric beds per capita in France. A great deal of thought has been ongoing for five years on how best to upgrade the offer of unscheduled psychiatric care, particularly the management of emergencies. The growing imbalance between demand and supply depending on living areas urges a rapid equalization of resources. This operation requires an accurate activity characterization, allowing more effective organizations and adequate resource allocation. We sought to characterize the activity of psychiatric emergencies by selecting quantitative and qualitative indicators by means of a consensus method, the Delphi Method, which consists of iterative questioning of an expert group. We first submitted 36 potential criteria to twenty-five experts. Twenty obtained a weak to a strong consensus. Seventeen were then selected as potentially useful for activity characterization. In a second time, we tested the consensus on selected indicators by interviewing a panel of 19 experts. A strong consensus was found on four criteria: \"Number of visits for psychiatric advice>2000/year\", \"Number of emergency room visits>40,000/year\", \"Density of adult hospital beds<150 per 100,000 inhabitants\", \"Passage rate for homeless patients and/or outside the sector>10%\". Using these criteria in the classification of UUPs would test their validity and provide a potentially helpful tool for improving organizations and resource allocation."}, {"Title": "Pro re nata medications in mental health: Results of a transversal study.", "Abstract": "Pro re nata are frequent in psychiatry. The risks engendered by this treatment requires that their prescription and administration be made safer. The frequency of administration of pro re nata depends mainly on the nurse's clinical judgment.\nOur first objective was to assess nurses' satisfaction about the quality of doctors' pro re nata prescriptions. Our second objective was to assess the nurses' self-reported practices for administering pro re nata treatments as written in the prescription.\nSelf-administered questionnaires were sent by the hospital's internal mail between November 13, 2014, and December 10, 2014 to all nurses in our psychiatric establishment in France. The questionnaire included multiple-choice questions and questions based on clinical vignettes.\nThe response rate was 51.9% (124/239). Overall, 75.6% considered that the quality of the prescriptions in terms of dosage was satisfactory. However, regardless of the quality of the doctor's pro re nata prescription, nurses did not contact the doctor even when the prescription quality was poor. Unexpectedly, we found that 88.7% have administered medication \"as needed\" without a doctor's prescription and sometimes acted without consulting doctors.\nThe nurses appeared globally satisfied with doctors' prescriptions of pro re nata medications. On the other hand, most administered some medications without any prescription, that is, illegally. Physicians must be rigorous in the quality of their PRN prescriptions. At the same time, nurses must comply with the medical prescription or contact the physician if the quality of the PRN prescription appears poor."}, {"Title": "[Stigmatisation of patients with mental disorders by medical interns specialising in general practice: A national survey].", "Abstract": "The objective was to assess the level of stigmatisation of psychiatric patients by medical interns specialising in general practice (GP), and to assess the influencing factors of stigmatisation.\nA national survey was carried out among interns in general practice (GP) contacted through their local associations from December 10, 2019 to March 9, 2020. An online questionnaire was diffused. The validated French version of the Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) was used to measure stigmatising attitudes towards psychiatry and persons with psychiatric disorder by the interns. This 16-item scale is designed to measure attitudes of health care professionals towards people with mental illness with scores ranging from 16 to 96 (the most stigmatizing). Several covariates were collected: socio-demographics, personal experiences with mental health, and mental health trainings during medical studies. All questionnaires were strictly anonymized. Comparative analyses of the MICA score by group were performed using Student's tests.\nA total of 389 interns responded. The majority of respondents were female (n=277; 71%) and the mean age was 27years [standard deviation (SD)\u00b12.39]. The mean MICA rate was 40.64 (SD\u00b18.09) for a neutral score of 56, reflecting low overall stigmatizing attitudes. MICA scores were significantly lower among female interns (40.11 vs. 41.95; P=0.042), those who had benefited from personal psychological or psychiatric support (38.70 vs. 41.61; P=0.001), and those who had completed a psychiatric externship (39.47 vs. 42.16; P=0.001).\nGP interns had an attitude that is generally not very stigmatizing even if its improvement should still be sought. This is particularly verified among those who have completed a psychiatric internship during their externship. This suggested association should be supported by other studies. The stakes are high for the future management of patients since stigmatisation by a physician is strongly implied in the worse healthcare management of patients with psychiatric disorders, leading them to a shorter lifespan."}, {"Title": "Help-seeking strategies and treatment experiences among individuals diagnosed with Bipolar Spectrum Disorder in Iran: A qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Social, cultural, and structural factors are associated with delays in seeking help from mental health professionals and poor treatment adherence among patients with mood disorders. This qualitative study examined the perspectives on the services and response to treatments of individuals diagnosed with Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BSD) in Iran through 37 in-depth semi-structured interviews with patients who had received BSD diagnosis and treatment (excluding Bipolar-I). Interviews explored two broad areas: 1) coping and help-seeking strategies; and 2) barriers to treatment and expectations of outcomes from treatment. Multiple factors influenced the help-seeking strategies and trajectories of patients with BSD diagnoses in Iran, including: structural limitations of the mental healthcare system; modes of practice of biological psychiatry; characteristics of the official psychology and counseling services permitted by Iran's government; popular psychology and consultation (offered through social media from the diaspora) by Iranian psychologists and counsellors in the diaspora; and alternative spiritual and cult-based groups. To improve the quality and accessibility of mental health services, it is essential to have structural changes in the healthcare system that prioritize human rights and individuals' values over the political and ideological values of the state and changes in the professions that promote secular training of mental healthcare providers and an ecosocial model of care."}, {"Title": "Genomic Stratification of Clozapine Prescription Patterns Using Schizophrenia Polygenic Scores.", "Abstract": "Treatment-resistant schizophrenia affects approximately 30% of individuals with the disorder. Clozapine is the medication of choice in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but optimizing administration and dose titration is complex. The identification of factors influencing clozapine prescription and response, including genetics, is of interest in a precision psychiatry framework.\nWe used linear regression models accounting for demographic, pharmacological, and clinical covariates to determine whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia would be associated with the highest dose recorded during clozapine treatment. Analyses were performed across 2 independent multiancestry samples of individuals from a UK patient monitoring system, CLOZUK2 (n\u00a0= 3133) and CLOZUK3 (n\u00a0= 909), and a European sample from a Norwegian therapeutic drug monitoring service (n\u00a0= 417). In a secondary analysis merging both UK cohorts, logistic regression models were used to estimate the relationship between schizophrenia PRSs and clozapine doses classified as low, standard, or high.\nAfter controlling for relevant covariates, the schizophrenia PRS was correlated with the highest clozapine dose on record for each individual across all samples: CLOZUK2 (\u03b2\u00a0= 12.22, SE\u00a0= 3.78, p\u00a0= .001), CLOZUK3 (\u03b2\u00a0= 12.73, SE\u00a0= 5.99, p\u00a0= .034), and the Norwegian cohort (\u03b2\u00a0= 46.45, SE\u00a0= 18.83, p\u00a0= .014). In a secondary analysis, the schizophrenia PRS was associated with taking clozapine doses >600 mg/day (odds ratio\u00a0= 1.279, p\u00a0= .006).\nThe schizophrenia PRS was associated with the highest clozapine dose prescribed for an individual in records from 3 independent samples, suggesting that the genetic liability for schizophrenia might index factors associated with therapeutic decisions in cohorts of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Neuroanatomical Correlates of Emotion-Related Impulsivity.", "Abstract": "Emotion-related impulsivity (ERI) refers to chronically poor self-control during periods of strong emotion. ERI robustly predicts psychiatric disorders and related problems, yet its neuroanatomical correlates are largely unknown. We tested whether local brain morphometry in targeted brain regions that integrate emotion and control could explain ERI severity.\nOne hundred twenty-two adults (ages 18-55 years) with internalizing or externalizing psychopathology completed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, the Three-Factor Impulsivity Index, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. The Three-Factor Impulsivity Index measures two types of ERI and a third type of impulsivity not linked to emotion. Cortical reconstruction yielded cortical thickness and local gyrification measurements. We evaluated whether morphometry in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens was associated with ERI severity. Hypotheses and analyses were preregistered.\nLower cortical gyrification in the right lateral OFC was associated with high ERI severity in a full, preregistered model. Separate examinations of local gyrification and cortical thickness also showed a positive association between gyrification in the left lateral OFC and ERI. An integrated measure of hemispheric imbalance in lateral OFC gyrification (right < left) correlated with ERI severity. These findings were specific to ERI and did not appear with non-emotion-related impulsivity.\nLocal gyrification in the lateral OFC is associated with ERI severity. The current findings fit with existing theories of OFC function, strengthen the connections between the transdiagnostic literature in psychiatry and neuroscience, and may guide future treatment development."}, {"Title": "[Mother brain: Bayesian theory of maternal interoception during pregnancy and postpartum].", "Abstract": "The perinatal period, including pregnancy and postpartum, causes major morphological, endocrinal, and thermal transitions in women. As the fetus grows, abdominal muscle fibers stretch, internal organs such as the bladder or colon move, and the uterine anatomy changes. Many of these changes involve interoception, the perception of internal body signals such as muscle and visceral sensations. Despite the importance of these interoceptive signals, few studies have explored perinatal interoception. We propose an innovative theory of maternal interoception based on recent findings in neuroscience. We show that interoceptive signals processing during pregnancy is crucial for understanding perinatal phenomenology and psychopathology, such as maternal perception of fetal movements, maternal-infant\u00a0bonding, denial of pregnancy, phantom fetal movements after childbirth, pseudocyesis or even puerperal delusion. Knowing the importance of these interoceptive mechanisms, clinicians in obstetrics, gynecology and mental health should be particularly vigilant to maternal interoception during the perinatal period."}, {"Title": "Hepatitis C virus monitoring in inpatient psychiatry: Doctors' practice.", "Abstract": "Current guidelines recommend routine Hepatitis C virus (HCV) monitoring in people with serious mental illness.

Chi-squared analysis and Fisher's exact test were performed to compare the two groups.\nScreening rates for HCV-associated risk factors varied according to the specific risk factor explored (prior incarceration 61%; intravenous drug use 55%; and tattoos/piercings 6%). Of 30 patients identified as having at least one HCV-associated risk factor, only 27% (<i>n</i> = 8) were tested for HCV during their admission, and the likelihood of testing was significantly higher in the long stay group.

I follow the integration of mental health in primary health care centers. Three key tensions emerge: First, integrating mental health led to separating mental health from socioeconomic conditions. Second, culture was simultaneously conceived as a barrier to therapy and a local context requiring adaptation. Third, the use of personality disorders as psychological interpretations of social life resulted in psychologizing gender and class.

Kernberg pioneered the description, understanding, and treatment of pathological narcissism. Narcissism has emerged as a clinical construct of considerable interest in clinical psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis and has often been featured in the literature on personality and social psychology. Considerable discussion in recent years has focused on whether levels of narcissism seen among young adults have been increasing. Nearly all of that discussion has been focused on changes in successive cohorts in normative (normal-range) expressions of narcissism. No direct prospective longitudinal study of the same individuals has assessed for pathological narcissism during college, the period that has been the specific focus of such lively debate. This study aimed to fill that gap in the literature.\nThis multiwave, longitudinal study explored pathological narcissism during college by enrolling first-year undergraduate students (N=250) from the Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders and by using individual growth curve (IGC) analysis. Participants were assigned to either a possible personality disorder or no personality disorder group, according to results from the International Personality Disorder Examination.\nBy the third wave of assessments, 16% of the sample received a probable or definite diagnosis of at least one axis II personality disorder.

Personality predictors of this pattern of change are also discussed.\nThis study highlights the need for a fine-grained prospective study of the same participants over time to illuminate patterns of change in narcissism."}, {"Title": "Reward-Mediated, Model-Free Reinforcement-Learning Mechanisms in Pavlovian and Instrumental Tasks Are Related.", "Abstract": "Model-free and model-based computations are argued to distinctly update action values that guide decision-making processes. It is not known, however, if these model-free and model-based reinforcement learning mechanisms recruited in operationally based instrumental tasks parallel those engaged by pavlovian-based behavioral procedures. Recently, computational work has suggested that individual differences in the attribution of incentive salience to reward predictive cues, that is, sign- and goal-tracking behaviors, are also governed by variations in model-free and model-based value representations that guide behavior. Moreover, it is not appreciated if these systems that are characterized computationally using model-free and model-based algorithms are conserved across tasks for individual animals. In the current study, we used a within-subject design to assess sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviors using a pavlovian conditioned approach task and then characterized behavior using an instrumental multistage decision-making (MSDM) task in male rats. We hypothesized that both pavlovian and instrumental learning processes may be driven by common reinforcement-learning mechanisms. Our data confirm that sign-tracking behavior was associated with greater reward-mediated, model-free reinforcement learning and that it was also linked to model-free reinforcement learning in the MSDM task. Computational analyses revealed that pavlovian model-free updating was correlated with model-free reinforcement learning in the MSDM task. These data provide key insights into the computational mechanisms mediating associative learning that could have important implications for normal and abnormal states.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Model-free and model-based computations that guide instrumental decision-making processes may also be recruited in pavlovian-based behavioral procedures. Here, we used a within-subject design to test the hypothesis that both pavlovian and instrumental learning processes were driven by common reinforcement-learning mechanisms. Sign-tracking and goal-tracking behaviors were assessed in rats using a pavlovian conditioned approach task, and then instrumental behavior was characterized using an MSDM task. We report that sign-tracking behavior was associated with greater model-free, but not model-based, learning in the MSDM task. These data suggest that pavlovian and instrumental behaviors may be driven by conserved reinforcement-learning mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Identification of spatial patterns with maximum association between power of resting state neural oscillations and trait anxiety.", "Abstract": "Anxiety affects approximately 5-10% of the adult population worldwide, placing a large burden on the health systems. Despite its omnipresence and impact on mental and physical health, most of the individuals affected by anxiety do not receive appropriate treatment. Current research in the field of psychiatry emphasizes the need to identify and validate biological markers relevant to this condition. Neurophysiological preclinical studies are a prominent approach to determine brain rhythms that can be reliable markers of key features of anxiety. However, while neuroimaging research consistently implicated prefrontal cortex and subcortical structures, such as amygdala and hippocampus, in anxiety, there is still a lack of consensus on the underlying neurophysiological processes contributing to this condition. Methods allowing non-invasive recording and assessment of cortical processing may provide an opportunity to help identify anxiety signatures that could be used as intervention targets. In this study, we apply Source-Power Comodulation (SPoC) to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in a sample of participants with different levels of trait anxiety. SPoC was developed to find spatial filters and patterns whose power comodulates with an external variable in individual participants. The obtained patterns can be interpreted neurophysiologically. Here, we extend the use of SPoC to a multi-subject setting and test its validity using simulated data with a realistic head model. Next, we apply our SPoC framework to resting state EEG of 43 human participants for whom trait anxiety scores were available. SPoC inter-subject analysis of narrow frequency band data reveals neurophysiologically meaningful spatial patterns in the theta band (4-7 Hz) that are negatively correlated with anxiety. The outcome is specific to the theta band and not observed in the alpha (8-12 Hz) or beta (13-30 Hz) frequency range. The theta-band spatial pattern is primarily localised to the superior frontal gyrus. We discuss the relevance of our spatial pattern results for the search of biomarkers for anxiety and their application in neurofeedback studies."}, {"Title": "Superiority and stigma in modern psychology and neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Bias in early psychological and neuroscientific research distorted conclusions about women and people of color.

The focus of the guidelines was eight lifestyle domains: physical activity and exercise, smoking cessation, work-directed interventions, mindfulness-based and stress management therapies, diet, sleep, loneliness and social support, and green space interaction. The following electronic bibliographic databases were searched for articles published prior to June 2020: PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register), CINAHL, PsycINFO. Evidence grading was based on the level of evidence specific to MDD and risk of bias, in accordance with the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry criteria.\nNine recommendations were formed. The recommendations with the highest ratings to improve MDD were the use of physical activity and exercise, relaxation techniques, work-directed interventions, sleep, and mindfulness-based therapies (Grade 2). Interventions related to diet and green space were recommended, but with a lower strength of evidence (Grade 3). Recommendations regarding smoking cessation and loneliness and social support were based on expert opinion. Key implementation considerations included the need for input from allied health professionals and support networks to implement this type of approach, the importance of partnering such recommendations with behaviour change support, and the need to deliver interventions using a biopsychosocial-cultural framework.\nLifestyle-based interventions are recommended as a foundational component of mental health care in clinical practice for adults with Major Depressive Disorder, where other evidence-based therapies can be added or used in combination. The findings and recommendations of these guidelines support the need for further research to address existing gaps in efficacy and implementation research, especially for emerging lifestyle-based approaches (e.g. green space, loneliness and social support interventions) where data are limited. Further work is also needed to develop innovative approaches for delivery and models of care, and to support the training of health professionals regarding lifestyle-based mental health care."}, {"Title": "The design and process of a family and community-based intervention for relapse prevention in people living with schizophrenia in Iran.", "Abstract": "People living with schizophrenia (PLS) suffer frequent relapse accompanied by emergency room visits, premature mortality, lower quality of life and a substantial social and economic burden on families and health systems.

Thus, parental involvement will impact further treatment, especially concerning the acute management of self-harming behavior of their children. Parental burden or low parental motivation for treatment can significantly affect the success of the intervention. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating how especially motivational factors of the adolescents and parents, as well as stressors of the parents, affect the course of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) after an acute psychiatric emergency presentation.\nNinety-six adolescents aged 11-18 years who have been presented to an emergency service at a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic for suicidal and/or NSSI behavior were recruited together with their accompanying parents within the framework of a specified diagnostic procedure. This included detailed questionnaire and interview procedures for psychiatric assessment. The extent of parental stress and parents' motivation for treatment and its relations to adolescents' NSSI and own treatment motivation have been investigated in a follow-up examination in the aftermath of the acute presentation. We predicted adolescents' NSSI at follow-up based on their own motivation and parental motivation and stress.\nData analysis demonstrated that higher adolescents' treatment motivation was associated with higher parental stress. Also, higher parental treatment motivation was correlated with a higher degree of parental distress. Furthermore, parents showed lower treatment motivation when their children engaged in NSSI for a longer duration. Finally, lower adolescents' motivation and lower parental stress due to own parental concerns were predictive for higher adolescents' NSSI frequency at follow-up investigation.\nPatients as well as their parents who present for an emergency service are especially likely to be exposed to increased stress and strain factors. During treatment, additional focus should be placed on parental stress and parental and adolescents' treatment motivation. Identifying and addressing deficits in motivation, increases in parental stress, as well as offering support could favorably impact future NSSI behavior."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic Safety in Liver Disease: A Narrative Review and Practical Guide for the Clinician.", "Abstract": "Clinicians treating psychiatric disorders in medically ill patients need a comprehensive resource for comparing the risk and types of liver injury associated with antipsychotic therapy.\nWe conducted a narrative review aimed at developing a comprehensive resource comparing antipsychotics with regard to risk of inducing or worsening liver injuries, types of liver injury, associated pharmacokinetic changes, dosing, monitoring, and patient counseling recommendations.\nWe conducted database searches of LiverTox.nih.gov, DailyMed.nlm.nih.gov, and PubMed through June of 2022. Sources describing premarketing data, observational studies, case reports and case series of antipsychotic-induced liver injuries, types of hepatic dysfunction, interventions, recovery, and treatment for 15 antipsychotics were included. Duplicate reports were excluded. Antipsychotics were graded as low, low to moderate, moderate, moderate to high, or high risk for causing or worsening a liver disease.\nOf the 1861 publications, 21 papers met criteria and were included. Evidence shows antipsychotic-induced liver dysfunction is uncommon to rare. Chlorpromazine, clozapine, and olanzapine pose the greatest risk of hepatoxicity; quetiapine and risperidone pose a moderate risk with haloperidol considered to pose low to moderate risk. Paliperidone, aripiprazole, lurasidone, and loxapine are lower-risk agents with no reports of liver failure. Transaminitis that is mild and self-limiting is the most common antipsychotic-induced liver injury followed by hepatocellular disease, steatosis, and mixed liver injury. A careful risk-benefit analysis should guide the decision to discontinue the antipsychotic in cases of severe liver disease. Dose adjustments and careful monitoring are recommended for a mild to moderate disease when the benefits of treating psychosis outweigh the risks. Patients without an existing liver disease initiating a treatment with a higher-risk antipsychotic should be counseled to report symptoms of liver injuries along with regular lab monitoring.\nAntipsychotic selection, dosing, monitoring, and counseling should be individualized based on whether a patient has an existing liver disease and if they are receiving an agent that poses a higher risk of liver injury. The consultation-liaison psychiatry provider can guide the primary team in management through thoughtful integration of the known pathophysiologic changes in hepatic disease and risk-benefit analysis of antipsychotic safety profiles."}, {"Title": "Psychedelics therapeutics: What we know, what we think, and what we need to research.", "Abstract": "Psychedelic therapy is perhaps the most exciting new development in psychiatry.

This review utilized a systematic review process to identify articles examining MHT tools. Several benefits of using MHT tools are described; however, in general, the supportive evidence for their use is lacking. A modified Australasian Triage Scale has the strongest evidence base for use in emergency settings; however, further data are needed to establish improved outcomes. There is limited evidence for the use of MHT tools in ambulatory or primary care settings.

The current study sought to further evaluate whether intimate relationship functioning is a motivator for mental health treatment seeking for male and female veterans and examine the impact of different types of trauma exposure on this association.\nUsing data from a longitudinal study, we examined whether intimate relationship functioning mediated the association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and mental health service use (0 = no mental health services, 1 = any mental health services) in male and female veterans (<i>N</i> = 1,200). We used multiple groups path analysis to examine whether intimate relationship functioning mediated the association between PTSD symptom severity and mental health service use for male and female veterans.\nFor male veterans, greater PTSD symptom severity was related to poorer intimate relationship functioning, which in turn explained increased likelihood of mental health service use (<i>R</i>\u00b2 = .18). This mediation effect was not significant for female veterans.\nOur findings suggest that targeting intimate relationship functioning in treatment for male veterans may be beneficial because difficulties in these relationships appear to be a motivating factor for treatment seeking.

The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) project was designed to build on the potential benefits of using tasks and tools from cognitive neuroscience to better understanding and treat cognitive impairments in psychosis. These benefits include: (1) the use of fine-grained tasks that measure discrete cognitive processes; (2) the ability to design tasks that distinguish between specific cognitive domain deficits and poor performance due to generalized deficits resulting from sedation, low motivation, poor test taking skills, etc.; and (3) the ability to link cognitive deficits to specific neural systems, using animal models, neuropsychology, and functional imaging. CNTRICS convened a series of meetings to identify paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that maximize these benefits and identified the steps need for translation into use in clinical populations. The Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for Schizophrenia (CNTRaCS) Consortium was developed to help carry out these steps. CNTRaCS consists of investigators at five different sites across the country with diverse expertise relevant to a wide range of the cognitive systems identified as critical as part of CNTRICs. This work reports on the progress and current directions in the evaluation and optimization carried out by CNTRaCS of the tasks identified as part of the original CNTRICs process, as well as subsequent extensions into the Positive Valence systems domain of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We also describe the current focus of CNTRaCS, which involves taking a computational psychiatry approach to measuring cognitive and motivational function across the spectrum of psychosis. Specifically, the current iteration of CNTRaCS is using computational modeling to isolate parameters reflecting potentially more specific cognitive and visual processes that may provide greater interpretability in understanding shared and distinct impairments across psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Preventive interventions for children of parents with depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder: A quasi-experimental clinical trial.", "Abstract": "To investigate the effectiveness of preventive interventions for 8-17-year-old children of patients diagnosed with depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.\nSixty-two families including 89 children received either the more extensive Family Talk Intervention (FTI; n\u00a0=\u00a035), the brief Let's Talk about Children (LTC; n\u00a0=\u00a016), or Interventions as Usual (IAU; n\u00a0=\u00a038) in routine care in adult psychiatry.

Efforts over the past decade to enhance the workforce have had a limited impact. This study sought to identify the critical components of a medical student mentorship network designed to increase recruitment into the subspecialty.\nThe authors conducted interviews via synchronized videoconferencing of network site leaders and medical students at 14 schools throughout the USA. In addition, they analyzed verbatim transcripts using a thematic-phenomenological qualitative approach.\nThe authors interviewed thirty-eight program participants during seven focus group sessions: nine program directors and 29 medical students or graduates, a median of five participants per session. They constructed a framework consisting of two overarching domains, comprised of three themes each: (1) life cycle of a subspecialty mentorship network (Origins, Initiation, and Continuity); and (2) next steps to improve the program (Refining goals, Increasing accessibility, and Defining a path forward).\nPreliminary data have already documented the positive impact of participation in this mentorship program on medical student match rates into psychiatry. The qualitative model of this study provides a blueprint to develop, maintain, and optimize this and similar efforts aimed at increasing the child and adolescent psychiatry workforce."}, {"Title": "3-year incidence and predictors of metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia in the national FACE-SZ cohort.", "Abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a major health epidemic of Western countries and patients with schizophrenia is a particularly vulnerable population due to lifestyle, mental illness and treatment factors. However, we lack prospective data to guide prevention. The aim of our study is then to determine MetS incidence and predictors in schizophrenia.\nParticipants were recruited in 10 expert centers at a national level and followed-up for 3\u00a0years. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Inverse probability weighting methods were used to correct for attrition bias.\nAmong the 512 participants followed-up for 3\u00a0years, 77.9% had at least one metabolic disturbance. 27.5% were identified with MetS at baseline and excluded from the analyses. Among the rest of participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0371, mean aged 31.2 (SD\u00a0=\u00a09.1) years, with mean illness duration of 10.0 (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.6) years and 273 (73.6%) men), MetS incidence was 20.8% at 3\u00a0years and raised to 23.6% in tobacco smokers, 29.4% in participants receiving antidepressant prescription at baseline and 42.0% for those with 2 disturbed metabolic disturbances at baseline. Our multivariate analyses confirmed tobacco smoking and antidepressant consumption as independent predictors of MetS onset (adjusted odds ratios (aOR)\u00a0=\u00a03.82 [1.27-11.45], p\u00a0=\u00a00.016, and aOR\u00a0=\u00a03.50 [1.26-9.70], p\u00a0=\u00a00.0158). Antidepressant prescription predicted more specifically increased lipid disturbances and paroxetine was associated with the highest risk of MetS onset.\nThese results are an alarm call to prioritize MetS prevention and research in schizophrenia.

Inclusion criteria included a pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment PROMIS score. Patient demographics and previous treatments tried were recorded. Documented events other than acupuncture that were thought to interfere with PROMIS scores were recorded, and no further scores were used after these events. A maximum of nine visits after the initial visit were used. The PROMIS domains assessed included anxiety, depression, pain interference and physical function.\nSeventy-two patients who had been treated with SMA met the inclusion criteria. Sixty-five of the patients (90%) had chronic pain. For their presenting complaint, 59 (82%) had previously sought treatment from another non-operative provider, 60 (83%) had tried physical therapy, and 20 (28%) had even had surgery. Despite this, SMA appeared to be able to significantly improve PROMIS anxiety at visits 1-3 and PROMIS depression at visit 3. After just one treatment, minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were reached in 32%-44% of patients for PROMIS anxiety, 17%-36% for PROMIS depression, 28%-29% for PROMIS physical function, and 21%-36% for PROMIS pain interference, based on low and high cut-offs of a range of quoted MCID values.\nIn a difficult patient population with musculoskeletal pain, SMA is a technique that can likely be used to improve PROMIS anxiety and depression, although no firm conclusions can be drawn from this uncontrolled clinical audit. Of note, MCIDs were sometimes obtained even after just one treatment."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Joint Specialist Case Conferences in Improving Diabetes Control in Patients With Schizophrenia on Clozapine.", "Abstract": "Clozapine treatment for schizophrenia is typically long-term and is associated with a high rate of diabetes. Mental health and diabetes specialist teams at a local hospital in Australia have undertaken a series of joint specialist case conferences (JSCCs) where the diabetes team works with the psychiatry team to improve diabetes management. In this retrospective cohort study conducted between 2013 and 2018, we found that glycemic control in clozapine clinics linked with JSCCs was improved significantly compared with that in the non-JSCC clinics. In the non-JSCC clozapine clinics (control), the poor glycemic control rates stayed at a similar level: 23% in 2013 and 24% in 2018. In contrast, whereas the control patients' poor glycemic rate in JSCC clozapine clinics in 2013 was 24%, it decreased markedly in 2018 to 13%. This study indicates that JSCCs can improve diabetes outcomes in a group of patients with severe mental illness."}, {"Title": "Stigma Toward Mental Illness Among Saudi Medical Students: Pre and Post Psychiatry Course Comparison.", "Abstract": "This cross-sectional study aims to compare pre- versus post-psychiatry course stigma levels toward mental illnesses among King Saud University medical students and identify which factors could affect stigma degree. The sample included 384 randomly chosen students. The overall scores of the used scale, the 15-item Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC-15), indicated no statistically significant difference between the before- and the after-psychiatry-course groups. The univariate analysis for differences in OMS-HC-15 score according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the pre psychiatry course group indicated that the factors associated with the total OMS-HC-15 score were sex ( p < 0.001), being diagnosed with mental illness ( p < 0.001), and having a relative diagnosed with mental illness ( p = 0.005). Among the post psychiatry course group, the univariate analysis indicated that the same factors, namely, sex ( p = 0.001), being diagnosed with mental illness ( p = 0.006), and having a relative diagnosed with mental illness ( p = 0.007), were associated with the total OMS-HC-15 score.

MGO is a major cell-permeant precursor of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), since it readily reacts with basic phospholipids and nucleotides, as well as amino acid residues of proteins, such as arginine, cysteine, and lysine. The AGEs production induced by MGO are widely associated with several pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the impact of MGO metabolism and AGEs formation in the central nervous system (particularly in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) on behavior and psychiatric diseases is not fully understood. Here, we briefly present background information on the biological activity of MGO in the central nervous system. It was gathered the available information on the role of MGO metabolism at the physiological processes, as well as at the neurobiology of psychiatry diseases, especially pain-related experiences, anxiety, depression, and cognition impairment-associated diseases. To clarify the role of MGO on behavior and associated diseases, we reviewed primarily the main findings at preclinical studies focusing on genetic and pharmacological approaches. Since monoamine neurotransmitter systems are implicated as pivotal targets on the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatry and cognitive-related diseases, we also reviewed how MGO affects these neurotransmission systems and the implications of this phenomenon for nociception and pain; learning and cognition; and mood. In summary, this review highlights the pivotal role of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) and MGO levels in modulating behavioral phenotypes, as well as related cellular and molecular signaling. Conclusively, this review signals dopamine as a new neurochemical MGO target, as well as highlights how MGO metabolism can modulate the pathophysiology and treatment of pain, psychiatric and cognitive-related diseases."}, {"Title": "Operationalizing Depression Screening in Ambulatory Palliative Care: A Quality Improvement Project.", "Abstract": "Depression is common in the palliative care setting and impacts outcomes.

A study of this text provides us with a \"before\" picture-a view of the canvas of psychiatric diagnostic categories-from which Kraepelin worked. Studying what Spitzka's diagnostic categories contain and what they are missing highlights the key steps Kraepelin took in the development of his nosologic synthesis. For example, Spitzka does not describe a commonality in symptoms or outcome in katatonia, hebephrenia, and the move severely ill delusional monomaniacs, nor did he link together mania, melancholia, and circular insanity, but instead comments on wide differences in outcome among these three syndromes."}, {"Title": "On the role of artificial intelligence in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Recently, there has been growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency and personalisation of mental health services.

Seven studies (319 BD and 43 MDD patients), including one RCT (n\u00a0=\u00a0173), three prospective (n\u00a0=\u00a0105), and three retrospective (n\u00a0=\u00a084) studies, met the study criteria with a study duration range from 8 to 60.9\u2009weeks. The mean age of this pooled data is 14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009years. LAM daily dosage varied from 12.5 to 391.3\u00a0mg/day among the studies. In an important finding, the RCT reported favorable outcomes with LAM (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.46; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) in 13- to 17-year-old age group as compared with 10- to 12-year-old age group (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.93; p\u00a0=\u00a00.88). In addition, time to occurrence of a bipolar event trended toward favoring LAM over placebo. All the studies identified LAM as an effective and safe drug in PMDs especially, BDs. Overall, LAM was well tolerated with no major significant side effects and no cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\nMost studies suggested that LAM was safe and effective in pediatric patients with mood disorders.

While attainment of fellowship has reached gender parity, academic psychiatry has disappointingly lagged, with 80% of its senior leadership roles across Australia and New Zealand still held by men, with a similar situation in the United Kingdom and the United States as well as many other countries. Encouraging women into academic psychiatry is not only critical to progress as a profession but also will help address the current blindness to sex differences in biological psychiatry, as well the social impact of restrictive gender norms and the effects of gender-based violence on mental health. This potentially creates opportunities for significant gains and insights into mental disorders. However, addressing the barriers for women in academia requires tackling the entrenched disparities across salaries, grant funding, publications, teaching responsibilities, keynote invitations and academic promotions alongside the gender-based microaggressions, harassment and tokenism reported by many of our female academics. Many women must grapple with not just a 'second shift' but a 'third shift', making the burden of an academic career unreasonable and burnout more likely. Addressing this is no easy task. The varied research in academic medicine reveals no quick fixes, although promoting gender equity brings significant potential benefits. Areas such as academic psychiatry need to recognise our community's growing discomfort with workplaces that choose to maintain status quo. Gender equity must be a critical part of any quest to revive this important area of practice for our profession."}, {"Title": "The multifaceted role of neurofilament light chain protein in non-primary neurological diseases.", "Abstract": "The advancing validation and exploitation of CSF and blood neurofilament light chain protein as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage has deeply changed the current diagnostic and prognostic approach to neurological diseases. Further, recent studies have provided evidence of potential new applications of this biomarker also in non-primary neurological diseases. In the present review we summarize the state of the art, future perspectives, but also limitations, of neurofilament light chain protein as a CSF and blood biomarker in several medical fields, including intensive care medicine, surgery, internal medicine and psychiatry. In particular, neurofilament light chain protein is associated with the degree of neurological impairment and outcome in patients admitted to intensive care units or in the perioperative phase and it seems to be highly interconnected with cardiovascular risk factors. Beyond that, interesting diagnostic and prognostic insights have been provided by the investigation of neurofilament light chain protein in psychiatric disorders as well as in the current coronavirus disease-19 pandemic and in normal ageing. Altogether, current data outline a multifaceted applicability of CSF and blood neurofilament light chain protein ranging from the critical clinical setting to the development of precision medicine models suggesting a strict interplay between the nervous system pathophysiology and the health-illness continuum."}, {"Title": "The decoupling of structural and functional connectivity of auditory networks in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis.", "Abstract": "Disrupted auditory networks play an important role in the pathophysiology of psychosis, with abnormalities already observed in individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR). Here, we examine structural and functional connectivity of an auditory network in CHR utilising state-of-the-art electroencephalography and diffusion imaging techniques.\nTwenty-six CHR subjects and 13 healthy controls (HC) underwent diffusion MRI and electroencephalography while performing an auditory task. We investigated structural connectivity, measured as fractional anisotropy in the Arcuate Fasciculus (AF), Cingulum Bundle, and Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus-II. Gamma-band lagged-phase synchronisation, a functional connectivity measure, was calculated between cortical regions connected by these tracts.\nCHR subjects showed significantly higher structural connectivity in the right AF than HC (<i>p</i> < .001). Although non-significant, functional connectivity between cortical areas connected by the AF was lower in CHR than HC (<i>p</i> = .078). Structural and functional connectivity were correlated in HC (<i>p</i> = .056) but not in CHR (<i>p</i> = .29).\nWe observe significant differences in structural connectivity of the AF, without a concomitant significant change in functional connectivity in CHR subjects. This may suggest that the CHR state is characterised by a decoupling of structural and functional connectivity, possibly due to abnormal white matter maturation."}, {"Title": "Staff attitudes and perceptions towards the use of coercive measures in psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "The failure of efforts to significantly reduce the use of physical coercive measures (PCMs) in psychiatric hospitals remains a global concern. There is a gap in the understanding of staff's characteristics that may affect their attitudes and perceptions towards PCMs. This study used a cross-sectional design to examine the attitudes and perceptions of staff working at a mental health centre in Israel regarding the use of PCMs and to explore whether staff attitudes differed depending on their professional and demographic background. This study also sought to explore staff willingness to accept a policy of reducing the use of PCMs. The data were collected from 149 staff members (nurses, physicians, and auxiliary staff) working at mental health centre, using a questionnaire developed for this study. The findings indicate a low degree of support for use of PCMs among participants who were older, female, more qualified psychiatric nurses, with longer duration of employment, and those who have not participated in coercive intervention in the past year. The majority of the sample reported a low willingness to reduce the use of PCMs, and a lack of institutional support after participating in a coercive event. High hospital occupancy and insufficient staffing were perceived as contributing factors to coercive incidents. Therefore, availability of trained and experienced staff, elimination of organizational barriers, along with creating and maintaining a safe clinical environment should be a priority. Alternative non-coercive interventions should further be taught and used for managing aggressive and violent behaviour in the psychiatric clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Barriers to Client Engagement and Strategies to Improve Participation in Mental Health and Supported Employment Services.", "Abstract": "A few clients in every mental health center present challenging behaviors, have difficulty engaging in services, and create stress within the treatment team. The authors provided consultations on clients with these characteristics over 4 years in the Social Security Administration's Supported Employment Demonstration (SED).\nFour experienced community mental health leaders provided consultations on 105 of nearly 2,000 clients receiving team-based behavioral health and employment services in the SED. Using document analysis, consultants coded their notes and identified themes that described barriers to client engagement and strategies teams used to overcome them.\nClients who were difficult to engage experienced complex and interacting behavioral health, medical, and social conditions, which made it hard for therapists to develop therapeutic relationships and help clients find employment. Faced with engagement barriers, staff were often discouraged and felt hopeless about achieving success. To address these barriers, consultants and teams developed several strategies: using supervisors and teammates for support, providing persistent outreach, pursuing referrals and consultations to help with complex conditions, and developing realistic goals.\nSupervisors, team leaders, and consultants in community mental health settings should help staff develop realistic strategies to manage the small number of clients whose behaviors present the greatest challenges. Effective strategies involve providing team-based outreach and support, fostering staff morale, obtaining specialist consultations regarding complex conditions, and calibrating realistic goals."}, {"Title": "Affordability of Forensic Assertive Community Treatment Programs: A Return-on-Investment Analysis.", "Abstract": "In this study, the authors assessed return on investment (ROI) associated with a forensic assertive community treatment (FACT) program.\nA retrospective secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial comprising 70 legal-involved patients with severe mental illness was conducted in Rochester, New York. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either FACT or outpatient psychiatric treatment including intensive case management. Unit of service costs associated with psychiatric emergency department visits, psychiatric inpatient days, and days in jail were obtained from records of New York State Medicaid and the Department of Corrections. The total dollar value difference between the two trial arms calculated on a per-patient-per-year (PPPY) basis constituted the return from the FACT intervention. The FACT investment cost was defined by the total additional PPPY cost associated with FACT implementation relative to the control group. ROI was calculated by dividing the return by the investment cost.\nThe estimated return from FACT was $27,588 PPPY (in 2019 dollars; 95% confidence interval [CI]=$3,262-$51,913), which was driven largely by reductions in psychiatric inpatient days, and the estimated investment cost was $18,440 PPPY (95% CI=$15,215-$21,665), implying an ROI of 1.50 (95% CI=0.35-2.97) for FACT.\nThe Rochester FACT program was associated with approximately $1.50 return for every $1 spent on its implementation, even without considering potential returns from other sources, including reductions in acute medical care, crime-related damages, and public safety costs. ROI estimates were highly dependent on context-specific factors, particularly Medicaid reimbursement rates for assertive community treatment and hospital stays."}, {"Title": "Long-Acting Injectable Therapy for People with HIV: Looking Ahead with Lessons from Psychiatry and Addiction Medicine.", "Abstract": "Long-acting injectable antiretroviral medications are new to HIV treatment.

A Qualitative Study.", "Abstract": "The role and nature of conflict in the development and manifestation of dissociative identity disorder (DID) remains underexplored beyond theoretical deduction. In this qualitative instrumental case study, we explored the subjective experience and nature of conflict in a group of adult psychiatric patients diagnosed with DID. We purposively selected typed transcriptions of 28 previously recorded in-depth individual interviews with 15 patients, their audio recordings and associated field notes. The data were thematically analyzed and constant comparison was applied. Two main themes emerged from the transcriptions, namely, participants' experiences of having one or more incompatible and conflicting worldviews about their DID, and the type and nature of conflict that arises between dissociative identities, i.e., conflict of information in awareness, conflicting actions or behaviors, conflicting emotions, conflicting goals, conflicting values, and a battle of wills. Patients with DID have contextually and culturally variable comprehension of the origin of their DID. Conflict between dissociative identities was pervasive, multifaceted, and exacerbated by a lack of awareness between identities. The study provides insight into the complexities of conflict between dissociative identities, as well as highlights the role of inter-identity awareness in conflict."}, {"Title": "Brain functional connectivity mirrors genetic pleiotropy in psychiatric conditions.", "Abstract": "Pleiotropy occurs when a genetic variant influences more than one trait. This is a key property of the genomic architecture of psychiatric disorders and has been observed for rare and common genomic variants. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the microscale genetic overlap (pleiotropy) across psychiatric conditions and cognitive traits may lead to similar overlaps at the macroscale brain level such as large-scale brain functional networks. We took advantage of brain connectivity, measured by resting-state functional MRI to measure the effects of pleiotropy on large-scale brain networks, a putative step from genes to behaviour. We processed nine resting-state functional MRI datasets including 32 726 individuals and computed connectome-wide profiles of seven neuropsychiatric copy-number-variants, five polygenic scores, neuroticism and fluid intelligence as well as four idiopathic psychiatric conditions. Nine out of 19 pairs of conditions and traits showed significant functional connectivity correlations (rFunctional connectivity), which could be explained by previously published levels of genomic (rGenetic) and transcriptomic (rTranscriptomic) correlations with moderate to high concordance: rGenetic-rFunctional connectivity = 0.71 [0.40-0.87] and rTranscriptomic-rFunctional connectivity = 0.83 [0.52; 0.94]. Extending this analysis to functional connectivity profiles associated with rare and common genetic risk showed that 30 out of 136 pairs of connectivity profiles were correlated above chance. These similarities between genetic risks and psychiatric disorders at the connectivity level were mainly driven by the overconnectivity of the thalamus and the somatomotor networks. Our findings suggest a substantial genetic component for shared connectivity profiles across conditions and traits, opening avenues to delineate general mechanisms-amenable to intervention-across psychiatric conditions and genetic risks."}, {"Title": "Computational psychiatry: from synapses to sentience.", "Abstract": "This review considers computational psychiatry from a particular viewpoint: namely, a commitment to explaining psychopathology in terms of pathophysiology. It rests on the notion of a generative model as underwriting (i) sentient processing in the brain, and (ii) the scientific process in psychiatry. The story starts with a view of the brain-from cognitive and computational neuroscience-as an organ of inference and prediction. This offers a formal description of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks; and how certain kinds of dysconnection lead to aberrant belief updating and false inference. The dysconnections in question can be read as a pernicious synaptopathy that fits comfortably with formal notions of how we-or our brains-encode uncertainty or its complement, precision. It then considers how the ensuing process theories are tested empirically, with an emphasis on the computational modelling of neuronal circuits and synaptic gain control that mediates attentional set, active inference, learning and planning. The opportunities afforded by this sort of modelling are considered in light of in silico experiments; namely, computational neuropsychology, computational phenotyping and the promises of a computational nosology for psychiatry. The resulting survey of computational approaches is not scholarly or exhaustive. Rather, its aim is to review a theoretical narrative that is emerging across subdisciplines within psychiatry and empirical scales of investigation. These range from epilepsy research to neurodegenerative disorders; from post-traumatic stress disorder to the management of chronic pain, from schizophrenia to functional medical symptoms."}, {"Title": "[The application of virtual reality in the treatment of mental disorders].", "Abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) enables immersion in an interactive digital world with realistic experiences, that can be applied for controlled and personalized interventions. This review summarizes the current research on VR in the treatment of mental disorders.\nSelective literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar.\nAn increasing number of publications report the therapeutic application of VR for the treatment of mental disorders. Most VR applications are based on established therapy approaches, such as exposure therapy. According to meta-analytic data, virtual exposure therapy (VRET) for specific phobia and agoraphobia with panic disorder is as effective as traditional in vivo exposure therapy. VRET for the treatment of social phobia is significantly more effective than waitlist and placebo control groups with, however, currently inconsistent metanalytic results when compared to in vivo exposure therapy. VRET for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is similar in effectiveness compared to active psychotherapy. For psychosis, positive results have been reported for the VR-based treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations. For patients with a\u00a0substance use disorder, VR can induce craving, with still unverified diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.\nVRET can broaden the psychotherapy options for anxiety disorders.

Stemming from the results of a critical ethnography of the Ontario Review Board, this article unpacks the central role of forensic psychiatric nursing, as an example of a 'psych' discipline (e.g., psychiatry and psychology), in a system that is built to produce risky persons and to legitimize their detention and supervision. By using excerpt of interviews conducted with nurses, ethnographic observations of Review Board hearings, and other documentary artifacts, the findings illustrate how rationalizations of risk and dangerousness are contingent on space, time, and observer. Depending on the time of the assessment or on the health-care professional who performs it, different elements including, but not limited to, mental illness, interpersonal relationships, financial instability, and sexual vulnerability, are relied upon in very fluid, interchangeable, and discretionary ways to justify findings of dangerousness. Such a dynamic expands the reach of psychiatry's legitimacy at identifying risky conduct and controlling risky persons to domains very loosely associated with the notion of dangerousness.

Great efforts are made to understand the underlying genetical, neurophysiological, and cognitive mechanisms, which eventually may explain the clinical outcome. One tacit assumption of these \"deep rooting\" approaches is that paradigms tap into common and representative aspects of the disorder. Here, we analyzed the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) of 121 schizophrenia patients and 75 controls. Using multiple signal processing methods, we extracted 194 EEG features. Sixty-nine out of the 194 EEG features showed a significant difference between patients and controls, indicating that these features detect an important aspect of schizophrenia.

Here, we suggest that positive emotion dysregulation requires additional clinical and research attention.\nFirst, we present a developmental approach to the study of positive emotion regulation within a temperament framework. Second, we describe emerging research findings regarding dysregulation of positive emotion in early childhood. Third, we integrate neuroscientific approaches to positive emotion regulation and introduce a framework for future investigations and clinical applications.\nDysregulation in positive affect can be examined from temperamental, developmental, clinical, and neuroscientific perspectives. Both temperamental surgency, which includes positive affect, and the proposed clinical extension, excitability, are associated with increased risk of externalizing symptoms and clinical impairment in youth.\nStudying the role of both temperamental surgency and clinically impairing positive affect, or excitability, in developmental psychopathology will help to elucidate the full spectrum of emotion dysregulation and to clarify the neural basis of dysregulation.

Among 130 patients with a capacity determination, 95 (53% of total sample) were determined not to have capacity, an outcome that did not differ by race but was more likely to occur among patients diagnosed as having delirium. Sixty-seven patients with no capacity (37% of total sample) experienced a change in treatment, an outcome that was less likely to occur among Hispanic patients in the univariable analysis.\nSignificant racial disparities were observed during the placement of a decisional capacity consultation. These findings reveal the potential biases introduced with both the initial challenge to a patient's capacity and the subsequent outcomes of the consultation.

Patient-directed discharge did not change, remaining at 14% before and after. Thirty-day readmissions increased 12.4% to 15.7% ( P = 0.05065). Receiving any OAT was associated with increased PDD and readmission, but only within the postintervention cohort.\nA guideline to facilitate generalist management of opioid withdrawal in hospitalized patients improved the process of care, increasing the use of OAT and decreasing workload on the psychiatry consult services.

However, cellular neurophysiologists have identified two broad classes of plasticity. Hebbian forms of plasticity alter synaptic strength in a synapse specific manner in the same direction of the initial conditioning stimulation. In contrast, homeostatic plasticities act globally over longer time frames in a negative feedback manner to counter network level changes in activity or synaptic strength. Recent evidence suggests that homeostatic plasticity mechanisms can be rapidly engaged, particularly by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine to trigger behavioral effects. There is increasing evidence that several neuropsychoactive compounds either directly elicit changes in synaptic activity or indirectly tap into downstream signaling pathways to trigger homeostatic plasticity and subsequent behavioral effects. In this review, we discuss this recent work in the context of a wider paradigm where homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms may provide novel targets for neuropsychiatric treatment advance."}, {"Title": "From Subjective Opinion to Medical Fact: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Mental Health Nursing Education.", "Abstract": "Using various methods and strategies of Critical Discourse Analysis, this article demonstrates how certain influential nursing texts generate a certain biomedical framing of the mental health nursing assessment.

All clinicians employed by five specialized CAP centres across the Netherlands were invited to fill in a questionnaire that was specifically developed to study CAP clinicians' impressions of telepsychiatry during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1065 clinicians gave informed consent and participated in the study. A significant association was found between pre-COVID-19 training and/or use of telepsychiatry and CAP clinicians' impressions of telepsychiatry. By far, the most favourable impressions were reported by participants that were both trained and made use of telepsychiatry before the pandemic. Participants with either training or use separately reported only slightly more favourable impressions than participants without any previous training or use. The expertise required to provide telepsychiatry is not one-and-the-same as the expertise that is honed through face-to-face consultation.

Yet, there is also a strong case for the view that psychiatry often works through improving patient morality and, therefore, should aim to do so. Our goal is to offer a practical and ethical path through this conflict. We argue that the default psychiatric approach to patient morality should be procedural, whereby patients are helped to express their own moral beliefs. Such a procedural approach avoids the brunt of objections to psychiatric involvement in patient morality. However, in a small subset of cases where patients' moral beliefs are sufficiently distorted or underdeveloped, we claim that psychiatrists should move to a substantive approach and shape the <i>content</i> of those beliefs when they are relevant to psychiatric outcomes.

First, we recall the regulatory aspects of ECT. National guidelines define means of implementation and conditions of administration of ECT. Second, we remind of the indications and levels of evidence of ECT in the main psychiatric disorders, including catatonia. Then, we synthetize the place of ECT alongside other brain stimulation therapies, especially repetitive Trancranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Furthermore, we explain the general effects of ECT: increased neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis, enhancement of the stress axis, resistance to oxidative stress, improved vascular endothelial function, activation of microglia and astrocytes, decrease in inflammatory events by upregulation of neuroinflammatory cytokines, and production of mitochondrial ATP. These effects appear from the first sessions and continue during the course of ECT treatment, suggesting activation of endogenous neuroprotection. Finally, we remember that most patients perform as well or better on neuropsychological assessments after ECT, relative to pre-ECT results, and this improvement continues over the following months. Memory disorders reported post-ECT are not all attributable to ECT. They may be subjective in nature or linked to residual depressive (and possibly comorbid neurogenerative) symptoms later attributed to ECT, on the basis of preexisting negative representations.

This study aims to re-evaluate this topic, 19\u2009years after it was last studied.\nFour Irish papers including the tabloid, broadsheet, online and compact paper with the highest readership were analysed daily for a 12-week period. Using pre-determined definitions based on previous studies, all articles or headlines incorporating psychiatry-related material were examined for tone, content, utilisation of terminology, reference to self-harm, suicide and violence.\nIn total, 735 articles (2.19/paper/day) were identified and analysed. The majority of articles were found to have a supportive or factual tone. A higher proportion of judgemental or sensationalist articles were found in the tabloid newspaper. An improvement was noted compared to previous Irish studies. A decrease in articles written by mental health professionals was noted. Only 5% of articles portrayed psychotic disorders, with many of these referring to violence. Compliance with relevant guidelines for reporting of suicide was good overall.\nThere has continued to be an improvement in the tone and content of articles since previous Irish studies.

Furthermore, consolidated risk factors for ADHD were not included among its predictors.\nParticipants were 1905 children and adolescents from a community-based sample and followed from ages 6 to 14\u2009years at baseline to ages 14 to 23\u2009years (mean age 18) at follow-up. We applied the intercept and weights of the original model to the data, calculating the predicted probability of each participant according to the set of predictors collected in childhood, and compared the estimates with the actual outcome (ADHD) collected during adolescence and young adulthood. We explored the performance of the original model, and of models including novel predictors (prematurity, family history of ADHD, and polygenic risk score for ADHD).\nThe observed area under the curve of the original model was .76 (95% Confidence Interval .70 to .82). The multivariable demographical model outperformed single variable models using only prematurity, family history, or the ADHD PRS. Adding either of these variables, or all at once, did not improve the performance of the original demographical model.\nOur findings suggest that the originally developed ADHD predictive model is suitable for use in different settings for clinical and research purposes."}, {"Title": "Use of a Novel Standardized Administration Protocol Reduces Agitation Pro Re Nata (PRN) Medication Requirements: The Birmingham Agitation Management (BAM) Initiative.", "Abstract": "Agitation management is a principal challenge on inpatient psychiatric units. Overreliance on common prescribing strategies of pro re nata (PRN) medication administration is problematic, given the tendencies to have overlapping or unclear indications.\nPiloted project to determine whether a standardized protocol for agitation intervention may reduce PRN medication administration.\nThe Birmingham Agitation Management (BAM) interdisciplinary team uniquely connected the Br\u00f8set Violence Checklist (BVC) for assessment of agitation severity to a standardized PRN medication order set. Nurses on the piloted unit were trained on how to score the BVC and administer medications. Patients were assessed by the BVC every 4 hours and, based on their score, would receive no medication, low-dose benzodiazepine, high-dose benzodiazepine, or high-dose benzodiazepine plus antipsychotic. The primary end point compared the number of PRNs administered after novel protocol implementation with a retrospective cohort. Secondary measures included analysis of medication-related effects, seclusion, and physical restraint rates.\n377 patients were included in the final analyses (184 pre-BAM, 193 BAM intervention group). No significant differences were seen in patient characteristics between groups. The total number of PRNs administered decreased by 42.5%, with both the mean and median number of administrations decreasing significantly (95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.68-5.75]; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A trend was noted between the number of PRNs administered and seclusion rates, but did not reach statistical significance (95% CI = [-7.28 to 60.31]; <i>P</i> = 0.124).\nIn seemingly the first initiative of its kind, we found that a standardized agitation management protocol can help decrease the total number of PRN administrations for agitation without worsening of restraint rates and may possibly reduce the risk of adverse effects.

At www.marokko.nl, the largest online discussion platform for young Moroccan-Dutch people, contributors discuss a broad variety of subjects, including societal, cultural, religious, and mental health issues. Combining deductive and inductive approaches to qualitative data analysis, we analysed 22 forum discussions at marokko.nl about mental health problems, after which data saturation was reached. Contributors described feeling isolated and experiencing discrimination in their social environment. Contributor comments identified social challenges arising from Dutch society, Dutch culture (e.g., being too individualistic), Moroccan culture (e.g., strict parenting style), and living between these two cultures. These social challenges are perceived to be associated with mental health problems. Furthermore, we created a model describing the different types of explanations contributors used for mental health problems, being: religious (e.g., possession); medical (i.e., a bio-psycho-social cause); or a combination of both. This model can help clinicians in delivering culturally sensitive mental health care.

A preliminary phase with open-ended questions was the basis to elaborate a Delphi questionnaire consisting of 14 questions on didactic and clinical training, which was then used in two successive Delphi rounds. Twenty-nine international experts in DP participated throughout the study.\nA series of hierarchical lists on how to improve DP training were elaborated. Regarding didactic training, the experts valued the contents and educational methods, as well as recommended authors and texts. Regarding clinical training, the experts valued educational methods, desirable characteristics in clinical supervisors, how to improve the supervisors' expertise, useful aspects and facilitating questions for direct supervision, and the suitability of including other evaluators besides the supervisor.

Patients were assessed for suicidality using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-Clinical Practice Screener and for agitation using either the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale or Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. We hypothesized that a screener based on the presence of either suicidality or agitation would be more sensitive to suicide risk than the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-Clinical Practice Screener alone. The screener's performance is described, and multivariable regression evaluates the correlations between screening and outcomes.\nThe sample comprised 16,467 patients seen in the ED who had available suicide screening and agitation data. Thirteen patients (0.08%) died by suicide within 90 days after ED discharge. The sensitivity and specificity of the screener combining suicidality and agitation for predicting suicide was 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.94) and 0.74 (0.44-0.94), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for agitation combined with positive suicide screening for self-harm within 30 days were 0.95 (0.89-1.00) and 0.73 (0.73-0.74). For both outcomes, augmenting the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-Clinical Practice Screener with a measure of agitation improved both sensitivity and overall performance compared to historical performance of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-Clinical Practice Screener alone.\nCombining a brief objective measure of agitation with a common suicide screening instrument improved sensitivity and predictive performance for suicide and self-harm risk after ED discharge.

Panel members included a psychiatrist, neurointensivist, and critical care specialist, and attendee comments were solicited with the goal of developing a statement. Discussion was focused on a reappraisal of delirium and, in particular, its disparate terminology and history in relation to acute encephalopathy. The authors endorse a recent joint position statement that describes acute encephalopathy as a rapidly evolving (<4 weeks) pathobiological brain process that presents as subsyndromal delirium, delirium, or coma and suggest the following points of refinement: (1) to suggest that \"delirium disorder\" describe the diagnostic construct including its syndrome, precipitant(s), and unique pathophysiology; (2) to restrict the term \"delirium\" to describing the clinical syndrome encountered at the bedside; (3) to clarify that the disfavored term \"altered mental status\" may occasionally be an appropriate preliminary designation where the diagnosis cannot yet be specified further; and (4) to provide rationale for rejecting the terms acute brain injury, failure, or dysfunction. The final common pathway of delirium appears to involve higher-level brain network dysfunction, but there are many insults that can disrupt functional connectivity. We propose that future delirium classification systems should seek to characterize the unique pathophysiological disturbances (\"endotypes\") that underlie delirium and delirium's individual neuropsychiatric symptoms. We provide provisional means of classification in hopes that novel subtypes might lead to specific intervention to improve patient experience and outcomes. This paper concludes by considering future directions for the field. Key areas of opportunity include interdisciplinary initiatives to harmonize efforts across specialties and settings, enhance underrepresented groups in research, integration of delirium and encephalopathy in coding, development of relevant quality and safety measures, and exploration of opportunities for translational science."}, {"Title": "The State of the Catatonia Literature: Employing Bibliometric Analysis of Articles From 1965-2020 to Identify Current Research Gaps.", "Abstract": "Since Kahlbaum's classic 19th-century description of catatonia, our conceptualization of this syndrome, as well treatment options for it, has advanced considerably. However, little is known about the current state of the catatonia literature since a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of it has not yet been undertaken.\nThe purpose of this study was to conduct a bibliometric analysis, along with a content analysis of articles reporting new findings, to better understand the catatonia literature and how catatonia research is changing.\nUsing the search term \"Title(catatoni\u2217)\" in Web of Science Core Collection for all available years (1965-2020), all available publications (articles, proceeding papers, reviews) pertaining directly to catatonia were identified, and metadata extracted. Semantic and coauthorship network analyses were conducted. A content analysis was also conducted on all available case reports, case series, and research articles written in English.\nA total of 1015 articles were identified representing 2861 authors, 346 journals, and 15,639 references. The average number of publications per year over the last 20\u00a0years (31.3) more than doubled in comparison to that in the 20\u00a0years prior (12.8). The top 3 most common journals were Psychosomatics/Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry, Journal of ECT, and Schizophrenia Research, which represented 12.6% of all publications. Content analysis revealed that catatonia articles are increasingly published in nonpsychiatric journals. There was a notable paucity of clinical trials throughout the study period. Since 2003, articles on catatonia secondary to a general medical condition, as well as articles including child/adolescent patients and patients with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability, have made up increasing shares of the literature, with a smaller proportion of articles reporting periodic or recurrent catatonia. We noted a decrease in the proportion of articles detailing animal/in\u00a0vitro studies, genetic/heredity studies, and clinical trials, along with stagnation in the proportion of neuroimaging studies.\nThe catatonia literature is growing through contributions from authors and institutions across multiple countries. However, recent growth has largely been driven by increased case reports, with significant downturns observed in both clinical and basic science research articles. A dearth of clinical trials evaluating potential treatments remain a critical gap in the catatonia literature."}, {"Title": "Needs of forensic psychiatric patients with schizophrenia in five European countries.", "Abstract": "The purpose was to compare the frequency of needs of patients with schizophrenia in forensic services across five European countries as assessed by both the patients and their care staff.\nPatients with schizophrenia and a history of significant interpersonal violence were recruited from forensic psychiatric services in Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland and England. Participants' needs were assessed using the Camberwell Assessment of Needs-Forensic Version (CANFOR). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify predictors of numbers of needs.\nIn this sample, (n\u2009=\u2009221) the most commonly reported need according to patients (71.0%) and staff (82.8%) was the management of psychotic symptoms. A need for information was mentioned by about 45% of staff and patients. Staff members reported a significantly higher number of total needs than patients (mean 6.9 vs. 6.2). In contrast, staff members reported a significantly lower number of unmet needs than patients (mean 2.0 vs. 2.5). Numbers of total needs and met needs differed between countries. Unmet needs as reported by patients showed positive associations with the absence of comorbid personality disorder, with higher positive symptom scores and lifetime suicide or self-harm history. Significant predictors of unmet needs according to staff were absence of comorbid personality disorder and higher positive as well as negative symptom scores according to PANSS.\nStaff rated a significantly higher number of total needs than patients, while patients rated more unmet needs. This indicates that patients' self-assessments of needs yield important information for providing sufficient help and support."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) 5.0 for use among youth in mental health services.", "Abstract": "Among youth with psychiatric disorders, the transition from child to adult mental health services is a period of vulnerability to discontinuous care and service disengagement. Regular assessment of transition readiness has been identified as a core component of transition planning, contributing to successful care transitions. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) 5.0 is a 20-item questionnaire that measures transition readiness in youth preparing to transition to adult care. Although the TRAQ has been validated and used across many health settings, it has not been validated in youth with primarily mental health concerns. The objective of this study was to validate the TRAQ for use among youth accessing mental health services.\nThis study used the Longitudinal Youth in Transition Study baseline cohort, which consists of 237 clinically referred youth (aged 16-18\u2009years) receiving outpatient mental health treatment. Psychometric evaluation of the TRAQ 5.0 included confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), assessment of internal consistency, testing convergent validity using the Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEAS) and Difficulty in Emotional Regulation (DERS) scales, criterion validity using a question on whether the participant had talked about transition with their clinician and known-group testing based on age.\nThe CFA indicated adequate fit of the five-factor TRAQ structure. The overall scale (=.86) and three of the subscales demonstrated adequate internal consistency. As hypothesized, overall TRAQ scores were higher for youth who had discussed transition and those aged 18. Small correlations were found between the overall TRAQ score and measures of developmental maturity (IDEAS) and emotional awareness (DERS); however, certain subscales did not demonstrate correlation with these constructs.\nThe TRAQ 5.0 appears to be valid tool to assess the transition readiness of youth in outpatient mental health services.

The patients filled out the WHODAS 2.0; their clinicians provided clinical information and performed GAF ratings blinded to the patients' assessments. Analyses of correlations, variance components, and ROC curves were performed to investigate the validity of the WHODAS 2.0 through comparison with the GAF. The variance component analyses included working status, psychosocial problems, number of diagnostic groups, and remission status. GAF ratings were separated as total (GAF-T), symptoms (GAF-S), and functioning (GAF-F).\nThere was significant correlation (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) between WHODAS 2.0 total and domain scores and GAF-S, GAF-F, and GAF-T ratings. The correlations varied from <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.29 to <i>r</i>\u2009=\u20090.48, with the highest being between GAF-F rating and WHODAS 2.0 total score.

There was no change in the total number of emergency admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 before Corona, but in 2021 emergency admissions increased by 40.1%. The pre-Corona (2018/19) gender ratio of 65.4% girls to 34.6% boys did not change in 2020. In 2021, the proportion of girls increased to 74.4%. In the COVID-19 pandemic, acute suicidality increased (+48.3%) while aggression decreased (-51.0%). Acute intoxications increased in the first Corona year and decreased again in 2021. The present study results show that the mental health needs of children and adolescents increased significantly in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and that this was also reflected in child and adolescent psychiatry.

The study of developmental language disorder (DLD), more specifically, has been further hindered by a lack of consensus regarding its definition. These limitations increase the risk of under-detection and lifelong consequences for affected children. This paper aims (1) to document which individual RF allow differentiating DLD from other MD and (2) to compare the cumulative RF between children with DLD versus other MD. This case-control design study used medical records of a psychiatric sample of 795 preschoolers (mean age 4:11, 75% boys). A logistic regression measured the predictive value of potential RF on DLD. Later first sentences, maternal immigration and family history of language delay were identified as significant in explaining 30% of the variance for DLD diagnosis. An ANCOVA revealed that children with DLD were exposed to a significantly higher number of RF than were children with other MD. Public health policies informed with the knowledge of specific RF associated with DLD, and their cumulative impact, could improve early detection and reduce the cascade of negative consequences associated with DLD."}, {"Title": "<i>Sakshi</i> and <i>Dhyana</i>: the origin of mindfulness-based therapies.", "Abstract": "Mindfulness-based therapies (MBTs) have shown promising results in non-psychotic disorders.

Long ALOSs are often related to sequential assessments of patients with high suicide risk or patients awaiting an inpatient bed. Safety planning may provide opportunities for diverting patients to the community and for reducing ED ALOS. This study reports on the impact of a safety-planning approach based on the PROTECT (proactive detection) framework for suicide prevention.\nA complex intervention (comprising leadership, governance, and innovation) was instrumental in embedding a new clinical culture of proactive detection and positive risk management through safety planning at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Practice as usual continued at a comparator nonintervention site (NIS). In total, 24,515 psychiatric presentations over 24 months were grouped into monthly averages for key outcomes, providing a sample size of 24 at each site. A difference-in-differences analysis across sites, preintervention (January-November 2019) and postimplementation (December 2019-December 2020), was used to estimate the intervention's impact.\nED ALOS for psychiatric presentations, patients with an ALOS >12 hours, patients with an ALOS >24 hours, and inpatient psychiatric admissions decreased significantly compared with NIS (p<0.01) pre- and postimplementation of the safety-planning intervention.\nEmbedding a recovery-oriented culture of safety significantly reduced ED ALOS for psychiatric evaluations.

Chords and islands of pinealocytes constitute the secretory parenchyma, while glial tissue and calcifications represent degenerative changes. This study examined human postmortem pineal glands to microscopically assess morphological changes possibly associated with clinical data, by using digital techniques. A retrospective autopsy study has been performed on 72 paediatric and adult autopsy cases. The glands have been processed for histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining with synaptophysin (SYN), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and neurofilament (NF). Slides were digitally scanned. Morphometric data were obtained using CaseViewer and ImageJ. The comorbidities used for correlation with morphometric data were obesity, type 2 diabetes, adrenal gland adenoma, goitre, chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and mixed dementia. Thirty-three females and 39 males were included in the study. Increased secretory parenchyma was found in patients with chronic pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, and adrenal gland adenoma. Reduced activity was found in patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity, advanced pineal calcification, mixed dementia, and old age. There were no changes associated with goitre, cachexia, or Willis's polygon atherosclerosis. No significant differences between gender were found. The activity of the pineal gland can be assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry of neuroendocrine and structural pinealocyte markers and observation of glial tissue and calcifications.

Novel applications for PET imaging in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Early applications of positron emission tomography (PET) in psychiatry sought to identify derangements of cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The need for more specific neurochemical imaging probes was soon evident, and these probes initially targeted the sites of action of neuroleptic (dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors) and psychoactive (serotonin receptors) drugs. For nearly 30\u2009years, the centrality of monoamine dysfunction in psychiatric disorders drove the development of an armamentarium of monoaminergic PET radiopharmaceuticals and imaging methodologies. However, continued investments in monoamine-enhancing drug development realized only modest gains in efficacy and tolerability. As patent protection for many widely prescribed and profitable psychiatric drugs lapsed, drug development pipelines shifted away from monoamines in search of novel targets with the promises of improved efficacy, or abandoned altogether. Over this period, PET radiopharmaceutical development activities closely parallelled drug development priorities, resulting in the development of new PET imaging agents for non-monoamine targets. In part two of this review, we survey clinical research studies using the novel targets and radiotracers described in part one across major psychiatric application areas such as substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Important limitations of the studies described are discussed, as well as key methodologic issues, challenges to the field, and the status of clinical trials seeking to exploit these targets for novel therapeutics."}, {"Title": "Do we know the mind of others?

The aim of this study is to survey how often doctors in psychiatric emergency units in a public, free-of-charge, mental health service suspect that patients are malingering, and which diagnoses, symptom complaints and suspected reasons for malingering doctors ascribe to their patients.\nQuestionnaires were distributed in three psychiatric emergency departments in Denmark. Suspected simulation and exaggeration were rated with a 5-point scale. Doctors were encouraged to write down the symptoms and perceived causes for suspected malingering.\n362 questionnaires were filled in. 25% of all patients were suspected of simulating to some degree. 8% of patients were highly suspected or definitely believed to be simulating. Patients complaining of suicidal ideation were most frequently suspected of malingering. '<i>Attention seeking</i>' was the most common suspected reason for malingering. Patients with diagnoses of substance use and personality disorder were the most suspected of malingering.\nThis is the first study to investigate doctors' suspicions of psychiatric malingering in a European setting. Patients with established personality and substance use disorder are at higher risk of being suspected of malingering, which potentially affects the course of treatment significantly.

Furthermore, it presents the ways in which Hitchcock subtly undermines popular conceptions about the relationship between mental illness and crime, and the role of psychiatry in explaining unusual behaviour."}, {"Title": "Integrating static and modifiable risk factors in violence risk assessment for forensic psychiatric patients: a feasibility study of FoVOx.", "Abstract": "Risk assessment is integral to forensic psychiatry. Previous work has highlighted the benefits of using scalable and evidence-based actuarial risk tools developed within forensic populations, such as the online Forensic Psychiatry and Violence Oxford (FoVOx) violence risk assessment tool. We examined the feasibility of using FoVOx in a Swedish forensic cohort and tested whether adding modifiable (dynamic) factors would increase its useability to clinicians.\nWe completed FoVOx assessments on all patients discharged from forensic psychiatric hospitals in Stockholm County, Sweden, between 2012 and 2017 and investigated recidivism rates. In addition, interviews were conducted with the clinicians responsible for each patient on the perceived accuracy, usefulness, and impact of FoVOx, which was examined using thematic analysis.\nNinety-five discharges from forensic psychiatric hospitals were followed up. The median FoVOx score was a 7% likelihood of violent reoffending in two years after discharge. Six discharged patients (6%) were confirmed as violent recidivists using official records with a similar distribution of FoVOx risk categories as the rest of the sample. FoVOx was considered accurate by clinicians in more than half of cases, who suggested that modifiable risk factors could be added to increase acceptability. All clinicians thought that FoVOx was useful, and in 20% of discharges, it would have materially altered patient care. Overall, FoVOx was thought to impact decision-making and risk management, was practical to use, and could be completed without reference to written case material.\nCompleting FoVOx in forensic psychiatric hospitals can complement current approaches to clinical decision-making on violence risk assessment and management."}, {"Title": "Craniofacial microsomia - more than a structural malformation.", "Abstract": "To analyse the prevalence and distribution of craniofacial microsomia (CFM) cases in Finland and their most frequent comorbidities. The second aim was to analyse the patients' need for specialized healthcare services.\nData were gathered from two complementary registers: The Register of Congenital Malformations and the Care Register for Social Welfare and Health Care (Hilmo) of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).\nThe prevalence of CFM patients in Finland was 1:10\u00a0057. They were evenly distributed across the five university hospital districts. Their most frequently used ICD-10 diagnosis codes were F40-48 (Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders), 60% of patients in adolescent and adult psychiatry; Q67.0 (Facial asymmetry), 43% in plastic surgery; Z00.4 (General psychiatric examination, not elsewhere classified), 31% in child psychiatry; Z31.5 (Genetic counselling), 28% in clinical genetics and Q67.40 (Other congenital deformities of the skull, face and jaw, Hemifacial atrophy), 18% in dental, oral and maxillofacial diseases. Of the patients, 70% had had visits in clinical genetics, 60% in plastic surgery, 41% in dental, oral and maxillofacial diseases, 28% in adolescent/adult psychiatry and 21% in child psychiatry. The majority of the patients' plastic surgery visits were concentrated in one university hospital. Other services were mainly provided by patients' own hospital districts.\nEven though the majority of CFM patients' visits in specialized healthcare services are related to correction of facial asymmetry and ear malformations, the obvious need for psychiatric care was apparent in all age groups."}, {"Title": "Using TikTok for public and youth mental health - A systematic review and content analysis.", "Abstract": "Globally, TikTok is now the fastest growing social media platform among children and young people; but it remains surprisingly under-researched in psychology and psychiatry. This is despite the fact that social media platforms have been subject to intense academic and societal scrutiny regarding their potentially adverse effects on youth mental health and wellbeing, notwithstanding the inconsistent findings across the literature. In this two part study, we conducted a systematic review concerning studies that have examined TikTok for any public health or mental health purpose; and a follow-up content analysis of TikTok within an Irish context. For study 1, a predetermined search strategy covering representative public and mental health terminology was applied to six databases - PSYCINFO, Google Scholar, PUBMED, Wiley, Journal of Medical Internet Research, ACM - within the period 2016 to 2021. Included studies were limited to English-speaking publications of any design where TikTok was the primary focus of the study. The quality appraisal tool by Dunne et al., (2018) was applied to all included studies. For study 2, we replicated our search strategy from study 1, and converted this terminology to TikTok hashtags to search within TikTok in combination with Irish-specific hashtags. As quantified by the app, the top two \"most liked\" videos were selected for inclusion across the following three targeted groups: official public health accounts; registered Irish charities; and personal TikTok creators. A full descriptive analysis was applied in both studies. Study 1 found 24 studies that covered a range of public and mental health issues: COVID-19 (<i>n</i> = 10), dermatology (<i>n</i> = 7), eating disorders (<i>n</i> = 1), cancer (<i>n</i> = 1), tics (<i>n</i> = 1), radiology (<i>n</i> = 1), sexual health (<i>n</i> = 1), DNA (<i>n</i> = 1), and public health promotion (<i>n</i> = 1). Studies were predominately from the USA, applied a content analysis design, and were of acceptable quality overall. In study 2, 29 Irish TikTok accounts were analysed, including the accounts of public health authorities (<i>n</i> = 2), charity or non-profit (<i>n</i> = 5), and personal TikTok creators (<i>n</i> = 22). The overall engagement data from these accounts represented a significant outreach to younger populations: total likes <i>n</i> = 2,588,181; total comments <i>n</i> = 13,775; and total shares <i>n</i> = 21,254. TikTok has been utilised for a range of public health purposes, but remains poorly engaged by institutional accounts. The various mechanisms for connecting with younger audiences presents a unique opportunity for youth mental health practitioners to consider, yet there were distinct differences in how TikTok accounts used platform features to interact. Overall, there is an absence of high quality mixed methodological evaluations of TikTok content for public and mental health, despite it being the most used platform for children and young people."}, {"Title": "No Pills, but Letters. Saul Bellow's Herzog: The Recovery of a Depressed Academic.", "Abstract": "In this article, I discuss the illness and recovery of the depressed Moses Herzog, the protagonist of Saul Bellow's novel Herzog (1964). Using this novel as a case study, I criticize a one-sided (neuro)biological and drug-based approach to depression. Referring to the hermeneutic anthropology of philosophers like Paul Ricoeur and Marya Schechtman, I argue that the treatment of depression could benefit from a broader approach that takes into account existential and social-cultural factors as well as biological factors. I suggest that narrative psychiatry offers a framework wherein various models of mental illness may be combined in ways that move beyond a pro/contra bio-psychiatry binary. By investigating depression using philosophical ideas and a literary text, this article aims to illustrate how the humanities may contribute to our thinking about depression."}, {"Title": "Children and young people's mental health outcome measures in paediatrics.", "Abstract": "Paediatricians are increasingly likely to encounter children and young people with mental health difficulties, either as primary presentations or as comorbidities linked with chronic illnesses.

The current paper aims to provide a go-to guide for paediatricians when considering the use of mental health and well-being outcome measures, including how to select, administer and interpret measures effectively. It also provides practical guidance on the most common mental health outcome measures used in children and young people's mental health services across the UK and elsewhere, which paediatricians are likely to encounter in their practice. Paediatricians may also find these measures useful in their own practice to screen for potential mental health difficulties, monitor the impact of chronic health conditions on a young person's mental health and well-being, or to provide evidence when referring young people to mental health services."}, {"Title": "Caring for the Caregiver (C4C): An Integrated Stepped Care Model for Caregivers of Children With Medical Complexity.", "Abstract": "Children with medical complexity (CMC) are a medically fragile subset of children who rely on parental caregivers for substantial care needs. Caregivers of CMC often experience adverse health outcomes such as depression and anxiety, sleep deprivation, financial hardships, and social isolation. Caregivers of CMC are at risk of premature mortality, which is thought to be mediated by chronic and elevated stress, as well as psychiatric morbidity risk. Access to mental health care, where the needs of both the caregiver and child are considered, can enable caregivers to meet high caregiving demands and improve both child and caregiver outcomes. We describe the Caring for the Caregiver (C4C) model, a novel integrated stepped care model consisting of collaboration between a psychiatrist and a pediatric complex care program. This model provides support in 3 steps: 1) early identification of distress, 2) social work assessment, intervention and psychotherapy, and 3) psychiatric care, including diagnosis or medication initiation, for caregivers of CMC. This innovative model will be the first to embed support for the mental health needs of caregivers of CMC within a pediatric team, facilitating access to psychiatric care and serving as a foundation for future integrated stepped care models."}, {"Title": "Medical Students' Learning Process During Simulated Patient Consultations in Psychiatry: A Grounded Theory Study.", "Abstract": "Recent changes in psychiatric care and teaching, which limit patient contact for medical students, can be partially overcome by simulation-based education in psychiatry. The authors explored the learning processes of medical students during meetings with simulated patients to inform efforts to improve this teaching.\nAfter recruiting 81 undergraduate medical students from 3 universities to participate in 6 simulation sessions in psychiatry, the authors purposively sampled 21 students to participate in face-to-face individual semistructured interviews analyzed with constructivist grounded theory. Integration of this analysis with those of the simulation consultation videotapes and the debriefing audiotapes improved the triangulation process.\nThree organizational themes were identified: developing and structuring representations of psychiatry; integrating subjectivity into learning; and refining and developing psychiatric praxis. Given the broad and in-depth learning that occurs, simulation in psychiatry should respect content validity of SP portrayals to ensure appropriate learning. However, psychological fidelity seems to provide adequate realism while retaining feasibility. Psychiatric simulation also requires the encouragement of student self-confidence and well-being. Within a reflective framework, simulation triggers cognitive reframing, which can alleviate fears and prejudice toward people with mental disorders.\nThe holistic interactive learning process involved in simulation can address the complexity of the personal and interpersonal features needed in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Emerging trends in domestic homicide/femicide in Greece over the period 2010-2021.", "Abstract": "Temporal trends in epidemiological parameters of domestic homicide and femicide in Greece over the last decade have not yet been studied. We conducted this study to fulfill this purpose. Specifically, we conducted a retrospective epidemiological study using 11-year data from the official nationwide Hellenic Police Archives and statistically analyzed data regarding domestic homicide and femicide. Overall, 1370 records of homicides among which 236 domestic homicides were identified. The pattern emerging from the statistical results of the present study highlighted the phenomenon of femicide as the gravest current issue to be interpreted and addressed. Nationally, the average number of homicides was 114.2/year, among which 19.7 domestic homicides. However, in 2021, while a decrease was recorded in homicides in general to 89 incidents per year, domestic homicides skyrocketed to 34 cases, reaching the highest annual number ever nationally recorded. On average, domestic homicides account for 18.2% of all homicides in Greece. In 2021, however, this percentage rose to 38.2%. The number of male victims of domestic homicide has declined over the years, with a further decline in 2021, in stark contrast to the number of women escalating over time and even more sharply in 2021. The proportion of female victims of domestic homicides in Greece was fourfold higher on average. The fact that cases of domestic homicide and femicide have received a lot of media attention, the recent Greek financial crisis, as well as increased alcohol and drug consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic constitute possible aggravating factors."}, {"Title": "Setting Common Standards for Reproductive Psychiatry Education: Effectiveness of the National Curriculum in Reproductive Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The National Curriculum in Reproductive Psychiatry (NCRP) provides standardized education for psychiatry residency training programs. The authors hypothesized that residents' preparedness to treat reproductive psychiatric concerns and their medical knowledge would improve following teaching with the NCRP.\nPre- and post-assessments were administered to residents enrolled in two waves of pilot NCRP training (Early-Modules and All-Modules). Data were collected by individual survey, and pre- and post-responses matched via anonymous ID. Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.5.3 and included paired Student's t-tests and a chi-square test.\nThirty-eight residents completed the Early-Modules survey and 16 the All-Modules survey. In both groups, there was significant improvement in preparedness to treat pregnant and postpartum women with mental illness (p<0.05). Scores on the 29-point knowledge test rose by 2.5 points in the Early-Modules group and 4.3 points in the All-Modules group (p<0.001 for both). In both cohorts, a majority of residents felt reproductive psychiatry was among the top three specialties needed to become competent independent adult psychiatrists.\nClassroom training with local faculty using a standardized curriculum is feasible and results in substantial and significant improvements in both feelings of preparedness and medical knowledge. Psychiatry trainees view training in reproductive psychiatry as an important and missing aspect of their education. Dissemination of a standardized curriculum may help to forge a path toward subspecialty certification for reproductive psychiatry, and can be used as a model for other specialties."}, {"Title": "Online Virtual Patient Cases vs. Weekly Classroom Lectures in an Internal Medicine Clerkship: Effects on Military Learner Outcomes.", "Abstract": "Virtual patient cases (VPCs), a type of simulated, interactive electronic learning, are a potentially important tool for military health care providers in austere or pandemic settings to maintain skills but need more validation.

Although there is no national database collection process, available data shows that individuals experiencing an acute mental health crisis and Black youth are both at a significantly elevated risk of being harmed or killed by law enforcement during any encounter. This brief analytic essay explores whether advising the public to call 911 is truly the best practice recommendation for Black youth in a mental health crisis. An alternative to the traditional law enforcement response is a mobile unarmed crisis response program.

In this review, we summarize the recent achievements in the genetics of BD, particularly those from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of common variants and next-generation sequencing analysis of rare variants. These include the identification of dozens of robust disease-associated loci, deepening of our understanding of the biology of BD, objective description of correlations with other psychiatric disorders and behavioral traits, formulation of methods for predicting disease risk and drug response, and the discovery of a single gene associated with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum with a large effect size.

The forms depicted by him largely corresponded to the offences, which were referred to as typically female in their nature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nHow did Kraepelin classify \"impulsive insanity\" and what forms did he describe? Did Kraepelin also see these disorders predominantly prevailing in women, did he establish a\u00a0connection with women's criminality and how did this fit into the discourses of the time on femininity, criminal legislation and degeneration?\nThis study focused on the clinical picture \"impulsive insanity\" as described by Emil Kraepelin in his main work, the 8th edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry published between 1909 and 1915. His description was analyzed in detail and embedded in a\u00a0historical context on the basis of secondary literature.\nIn rudiments Kraepelin's clinical classification is still comprehensible today, although there are major differences to how literature in later years treated this issue. Kraepelin clearly sees \"impulsive insanity\" as a\u00a0driving disorder predominantly prevailing in women.\nElaborating his concept of \"impulsive insanity\", Kraepelin positioned himself in relation to important scientific discourses of the early twentieth century, such as the debate on criminal legislation and the theory of degeneration. On the basis of the individual forms of \"impulsive insanity\" described by Kraepelin, various concepts of constructing and pathologizing femininity can be identified. Apparently, it also aims to explain common female crimes within the patriarchal hegemony."}, {"Title": "Pupillary response in reward processing in adults with major depressive disorder in remission.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired reward processing and reward learning. The literature is inconclusive regarding whether these impairments persist after remission. The current study examined reward processing during a probabilistic learning task in individuals in remission from MDD (<i>n =</i> 19) and never depressed healthy controls (<i>n =</i> 31) matched for age and sex. The outcome measures were pupil dilation (an indirect index of noradrenergic activity and arousal) and computational modeling parameters.\nParticipants completed two versions (facial/nonfacial feedback) of probabilistic reward learning task with changing contingencies. Pupil dilation was measured with a corneal reflection eye tracker. The hypotheses and analysis plan were preregistered.\nHealthy controls had larger pupil dilation following losses than gains (<i>p</i> <.001), whereas no significant difference between outcomes was found in individuals with a history of MDD, resulting in an interaction between group and outcome (<i>\u03b2</i> = 0.81, <i>SE</i> = 0.34, <i>t</i> = 2.37, <i>p</i> = .018). The rMDD group also achieved lower mean score at the last trial (<i>t</i>[46.77] = 2.12, <i>p</i> = .040) as well as a smaller proportion of correct choices (<i>t</i>[46.70] = 2.09, <i>p</i> = .041) compared with healthy controls.\nImpaired reward processing may persist after remission from MDD and could constitute a latent risk factor for relapse. Measuring pupil dilation in a reward learning task is a promising method for identifying reward processing abnormalities linked to MDD. The task is simple and noninvasive, which makes it feasible for clinical research."}, {"Title": "Fungal Forces in Mental Health: Microbial Meddlers or Function Fixers?", "Abstract": "In the mental health field, the gut-brain axis and associated pathways represent putative mechanisms by which gastrointestinal (GI) microbes and their gene products and metabolites can access and influence the central nervous system (CNS). These GI-centered investigations focus on bacteria, with significant information gaps existing for other microbial community members, such as fungi. Fungi are part of a complex and functionally diverse taxonomic kingdom whose interactions with hosts can be conversely deadly and beneficial. As serious sources of morbidity and mortality, fungal pathogens can quickly turn healthy microbiomes into toxic cycles of inflammation, gut permeability, and dysbiosis. Fungal commensals are also important human symbionts that provide a rich source of physiological functions to the host, such as protection against intestinal injuries, maintenance of epithelial structural integrities, and immune system development and regulation. Promising treatment compounds derived from fungi include antibiotics, probiotics, and antidepressants. Here I aim to illuminate the many attributes of fungi as they are applicable to overall improving our understanding of the mechanisms at work in psychiatric disorders. Healing the gut and its complex ecosystem is currently achievable through diet, probiotics, prebiotics, and other strategies, yet it is critical to recognize that the success of these interventions relies on a more precisely defined role of the fungal and other non-bacterial components of the microbiome."}, {"Title": "Beyond monoamines: I. Novel targets and radiotracers for Positron emission tomography imaging in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "With the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) in the late 1970s, psychiatry had access to a tool capable of non-invasive assessment of human brain function. Early applications in psychiatry focused on identifying characteristic brain blood flow and metabolic derangements using radiotracers such as [<sup>15</sup> O]H<sub>2</sub> O and [<sup>18</sup> F]FDG. Despite the success of these techniques, it became apparent that more specific probes were needed to understand the neurochemical bases of psychiatric disorders. The first neurochemical PET imaging probes targeted sites of action of neuroleptic (dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors) and psychoactive (serotonin receptors) drugs. Based on the centrality of monoamine dysfunction in psychiatric disorders and the measured success of monoamine-enhancing drugs in treating them, the next 30\u2009years witnessed the development of an armamentarium of PET radiopharmaceuticals and imaging methodologies for studying monoamines. Continued development of monoamine-enhancing drugs over this time however was less successful, realizing only modest gains in efficacy and tolerability. As patent protection for many widely prescribed and profitable psychiatric drugs lapsed, drug development pipelines shifted away from monoamines in search of novel targets with the promises of improved efficacy, or abandoned altogether. Over this period, PET radiopharmaceutical development activities closely paralleled drug development priorities resulting in the development of new PET imaging agents for non-monoamine targets. Part one of this review will briefly survey novel PET imaging targets with relevance to the field of psychiatry, which include the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), purinergic P<sub>2</sub> X<sub>7</sub> receptor, type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<sub>1</sub> ), phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A), and describe radiotracers developed for these and other targets that have matured to human subject investigations.

Mental health clients and their caregivers were recruited to participate in pre- and post-intervention surveys to evaluate the impact of the intervention on their perceptions of COVID-19 public health guidelines, testing, and vaccination. Mental health therapists delivered four lessons of the COVID-19 educational intervention with 254 clients from March to June 2021, when vaccine availability was widely available. Of those clients, we collected 180 baseline and 115 follow-up surveys. The main outcome was the uptake in COVID-19 vaccine.\nThere was a positive shift in participant vaccine acceptance and receptivity. Pre-intervention survey shows that only 56% of adult clients and 48% of caregivers had indicated a likelihood of getting the vaccine for themselves at baseline. Post-intervention documented that more than 57% of each group had been vaccinated, with another 11-15% of the unvaccinated individuals reporting that they were somewhat or very likely to get the vaccine.\nThis study demonstrated that multidisciplinary academic-community and theoretical-based educational intervention delivered by mental health therapists is an effective strategy in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and reducing the negative impact and disruption that COVID-19 caused in the daily life of mental health patients and caregivers."}, {"Title": "Avoidance of cutaneous adverse drug reactions induced by antiepileptic drugs based on pharmacogenomics.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a research area aimed at identifying genetic factors that are associated with drug responses, including drug efficacy, adverse drug reactions, and the appropriate drug dosage on a case-to-case basis.

We concluded, that MD may be related to impaired glucose/insulin homeostasis in the long-term but not in early disease stages. Now, we performed a complementary analysis of the canonical insulin signalling pathway containing the set of control and FEMD samples from the study mentioned above. The first node (pS312-IRS-1, pY-IRS-1) and downstream pathway which affects glucose and lipid homeostasis (phosphorylated proteins: pS473-AKT, pS9-GSK3\u03b2, pS2448-mTOR, pT389-p70S6K; total proteins AKT, GSK3\u03b2, mTOR, p70S6K) were analyzed by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) in neuronal\u00a0extracellular vesicles (nEVs) enriched for L1 neural cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) expression.

The report discusses \"fine discrepancies in everyday borderline transgressions\" \"from today's viewpoint\". These borderline transgressions were seen especially in the missing, inadequate or undocumented informed consent of patients and in the usage of test substances, which varied between the (mostly) accepted or not refused intake and the camouflaged or (seldom) threatened application via injection. Thus, the report shows on the one hand, the considerable development of the normative context of treatment of mentally ill patients in the past 70\u00a0years and on the other hand, with its detailed descriptions, it can sensitize today's therapists to the pertinent context. But most of all this is the story of Roland Kuhn, the responsible psychiatrist and the drug testing discoverer of the antidepressive effect of imipramine. This story of the discovery is judged from very differing perspectives and is thus relativized, all the way from observations of a\u00a0\"provincial psychiatrist\" to consideration for the Nobel Prize. At the same time critically evaluated traits of Kuhn's personality seem to have influenced the occasionally negative comments of the commission report.

All visits with psychiatry consultation underwent further chart review (172 pre- and 217 post-) to compare number, length of stay (LOS) and demographics for psychiatric evaluations pre- and post- use of C-SSRS screening.\nBoth groups were predominantly male with previous psychiatric diagnoses. Within the post-screening group, individuals tended to be older with lower likelihood of previously diagnosed psychiatric illness. No significant differences were seen in gender, psychiatric diagnosis, or outpatient psychiatric treatment. Incidence of psychiatric evaluation was slightly higher post-screening (18%) without meeting statistical significance, with more patients discharged home in the post- cohort. LOS was slightly lower after implementation of C-SSRS, without reaching statistical significance.\nImplementation of universal screening showed increased demand for psychiatric evaluations, without meeting clinical significance in this limited analysis. Although there were slightly more psychiatric evaluations, more patients were discharged to home. LOS showed no statistical increase, even trending toward shorter duration for patients screened to be evaluated by psychiatry. Based on these results, efficient suicide screening may help identify at-risk individuals without overwhelming psychiatric resources or causing unnecessary increase in LOS.

Men are more likely to have cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia whereas women are more likely to have more severe cognitive symptoms with major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is important to understand sex and gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities with and without disease. Sex differences are noted in performance across various cognitive domains - with males typically outperforming females in spatial tasks and females typically outperforming males in verbal tasks. Furthermore, there are striking sex differences in brain networks that are activated during cognitive tasks and in learning strategies. Although rarely studied, there are also sex differences in the trajectory of cognitive aging. It is important to pay attention to these sex differences as they inform researchers of potential differences in resilience to age-related cognitive decline and underlying mechanisms for both healthy and pathological cognitive aging, depending on sex. We review literature on the progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease, as an example of pathological cognitive aging in which human females show greater lifetime risk, neuropathology, and cognitive impairment, compared to human males. Not surprisingly, the relationships between sex and cognition, cognitive aging, and Alzheimer's disease are nuanced and multifaceted. As such, this chapter will end with a discussion of lifestyle factors, like education and diet, as modifiable factors that can alter cognitive aging by sex. Understanding how cognition changes across age and contributing factors, like sex differences, will be essential to improving care for older adults."}, {"Title": "Poor sleep quality may contribute to dysfunctional illness perception, physical and emotional distress in hospitalised patients: results of a national survey of the Italian Society of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Distress associated with physical illness is a well-known risk factor for adverse illness course in general hospitals. Understanding the factors contributing to it should be a priority and among them dysfunctional illness perception and poor sleep quality may contribute to it. As poor sleep quality is recognised as a major risk factor for health problems, we aimed to study its association with illness perception and levels of distress during hospitalisation. This cross-sectional study included a consecutive series of 409 individuals who were hospitalised in medical and surgical units of different hospitals located throughout the Italian national territory and required an assessment for psychopathological conditions. Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh (Sleep Quality Index), emotional and physical distress with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and illness perception with the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). Differences between groups, correlations and mediations analyses were computed. Patients with poor sleep quality were more frequently females, with psychiatric comorbidity, with higher scores in the ESAS and BIPQ. Poor sleep quality was related to dysfunctional illness perception, and to both emotional and physical distress. In particular, by affecting cognitive components of illness perception, poor sleep quality may, directly and indirectly, predict high levels of distress during hospitalisation. Poor sleep quality may affect >70% of hospitalised patients and may favour dysfunctional illness perception and emotional/physical distress.Assessing and treating sleep problems in hospitalised patients should be included in the routine of hospitalised patients."}, {"Title": "Serious Mental Illness and Sexual Offending in Forensic Psychiatric Patients.", "Abstract": "The role of serious mental illness among those who sexually offend is not well understood.

Antipsychotic nonadherence is the most common reason for schizophrenia relapse, and is associated with increased rates of relapse, readmission to hospital and suicide. This article examines available literature to discover how culture can affect antipsychotic nonadherence, and considers culture-based solutions that could enhance antipsychotic adherence. Acknowledging the importance of the therapeutic alliance and sociocultural aspects in antipsychotic adherence, I argue that current cultural competence training provided to clinicians is inadequate.

However, the suicidal risk assessment has many evolving and moving parts, and is one of the most heavily researched fields in psychiatry. Although it is clear from current empirical research that suicide cannot accurately be predicted, the standard of care from regulatory bodies and professional organizations dictates the use of established measures and following consensus guidelines. However, the legal system has different parameters to assess for the deviation from these standards and views it from a different vantage point. Therefore, it is imperative to know these critical multifaceted panoramas of suicide assessment.

In contrast, the nexus of food, memory, psychological trauma, and disordered eating has been less explored. The aim of this interdisciplinary article is to synthesize available knowledge on this topic by engaging with research literature in fields such as food history, anthropology, sociology, and psychiatry as well as autobiographical works, cookbooks, etc. One main section of the article focuses on the role of food and cooking in exile and refuge. Another section deals with the role of food in the aftermath of historical trauma, whereas a final section discusses various works on disordered eating in the wake of traumatic experiences. In sum, the dual nature of food and cooking-at once concrete and abstract, material and symbolic-offers an arena in which ambivalent memories of trauma can take on tangible form. The concept of postmemory may be useful in understanding how food and cooking can function both as a vehicle and as a remedy for intergenerational trauma."}, {"Title": "Role Distinctions and Role Overlap Among Behavioral Health Providers.", "Abstract": "Integrated behavioral health care (IBHC) models are a growing trend for health care delivery, particularly in the primary setting. Clinicians working within IBHC contexts provide a spectrum of behavioral health services, including screening, prevention and health promotion, assessment, and treatment services. Integration of behavioral health providers into primary and specialty medical settings addresses the significant need for behavioral health services, improves care quality, improves patient experience, and reduces costs of care, access issues, and delays in service provision. While benefits are clear, what type of model to implement and which behavioral health care providers to include in that model remain elusive. This is partly due to the failure of IBHC models to include all behavioral health providers in their design, a lack of clarity of the expertise of each provider, and how providers work together. IBHC models are also complicated by contextual issues such as the relative availability of each profession, population health needs in different clinic populations, and financial factors. The purpose of this manuscript is to the clarify roles and responsibilities of different behavioral health professions including similarities and differences in their training, areas of unique expertise (role distinctions), shared responsibilities (role overlap), and relative cost and availability in the United States."}, {"Title": "The Forensic Psychiatric Network of Observation and Documentation: At the Intersection of Review Board Hearings and Nursing Practice.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatric nursing is a specialty at the junction of two well-researched intersecting systems with two mandates: criminal justice and health care. Nurses' involvement at one of the systems' points of juncture, review board (RB) hearings, has largely been left unexplored. At RB hearings, a panel of legal and healthcare professionals determines if persons unfit to stand trial (UST) or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCR) represent significant threats to the safety of the public and orders conditions aimed at keeping the community safe. The aim of this article is to present the results of a critical ethnography that explored how psychiatric and public safety discourses construct the identity of persons UST or NCR during RB hearings as well as nurses' contribution to such identity construction. The main finding is that the forensic psychiatric structure leverages nursing interventions and documentation as evidence of deviancy, so that persons UST or NCR can be objectified and produced as dangerous. Structures sustaining the forensic psychiatric system inscribe nursing care within a disciplinary scheme, rendering the care-and-custody dichotomy insufficient to explain the complex processes at play in forensic psychiatry. These findings have implications for the practice of nurses working in forensic psychiatric settings and for that of other nurses who practice on the medicolegal borderland."}, {"Title": "Narrative Review: Impairing Emotional Outbursts: What They Are and What We Should Do About Them.", "Abstract": "Impairing emotional outbursts, defined by extreme anger or distress in response to relatively ordinary frustrations and disappointments, impact all mental health care systems, emergency departments, schools, and juvenile justice programs. However, the prevalence, outcome, and impact of outbursts are difficult to quantify because they are transdiagnostic and not explicitly defined by current diagnostic nosology. Research variably addresses outbursts under the rubrics of tantrums, anger, irritability, aggression, rage attacks, or emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Consistent methods for identifying and assessing impairing emotional outbursts across development or systems of care are lacking.\nThe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Presidential Task Force (2019-2021) conducted a narrative review addressing impairing emotional outbursts within the limitations of the existing literature and independent of diagnosis.\nExtrapolating from the existing literature, best estimates suggest that outbursts occur in 4%-10% of community children (preschoolers through adolescents). Impairing emotional outbursts may respond to successful treatment of the primary disorder, especially for some children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose medications have been optimized. However, outbursts are generally multi-determined and often represent maladaptive or deficient coping strategies and responses.\nEvidence-based strategies are necessary to address factors that trigger, reinforce, or excuse the behaviors and to enhance problem-solving skills. Currently available interventions yield only modest effect sizes for treatment effect. More specific definitions and measures are needed to track and quantify outbursts and to design and assess the effectiveness of interventions. Better treatments are clearly needed."}, {"Title": "Premature mortality of people with severe mental illness: a renewed focus for a new era.", "Abstract": "This perspective article applies public health principles to improve the physical health of selected populations with mental disorders. Two preventable adverse outcomes, poorer physical health and premature mortality, are described across mental disorders. Evidence of the lifetime effects of adverse childhood experiences and inequalities is presented: these are the 'causes of the causes'. Seven drivers of physical disorders are illustrated that drive preventable deaths and as doctors, psychiatrists must lead from the front to reverse rising mortality. Evidence supports universal and selective interventions and even the most difficult challenges such as weight gain and opioid misuse are an opportunity for psychiatry to engage with individual patients and their organisations, public health colleagues, health systems and beyond. Interventions complement and do not replace existing clinical practices that reduce self-harm and prevent suicide.

The sociodemographic characteristics of these patients, clinical features of the disease, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and treatment approaches have been studied.\nOur results showed that TTM was more common in girls, hair and eyebrow plucking was the most common, and symptoms and features accompanying TTM changed with age, but not with gender. Again, 79.7% of these children had at least one psychiatric comorbid disorder (most common being anxiety disorders and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder), comorbidity was closely related to TTM severity, 93.7% used at least one pharmacotherapeutic agent, and positive response rates to treatment were found to be low. Moreover, TTM severity was found to increase with age and disease duration.\nStudy findings support that clinical presentation, disease severity and comorbidity rates may change with age in children and adolescents with TTM, and early intervention is important to prevent clinical progression/worsening and mental health sequela."}, {"Title": "The effect of the Development and Well-Being Assessment as an adjunct to standard referral letters on referral decisions by child and adolescent mental health services - a randomized feasibility trial.", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> High rejection rates for referrals to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are common.

Their strong psychoactive effect was discovered accidentally in 1943 after the synthesis of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in 1937. These drugs became a mainstream area of research following the synthesis of LSD; however, several political and social factors led to their ban in 1966, after which research on psychedelics remained limited. These drugs became a major topic of scientific and ethical debate in the 1990's and the recent times have seen a 'Psychedelic renaissance' where the therapeutic value of psychedelics is being reconsidered. This article reports the historical perspective of psychedelics, pharmacologic action by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonism, and psychological effects and compares the proposed therapeutic uses, including uses in depression, PTSD, anxiety- related disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, neurodegenerative diseases, and auto-immune diseases to potential harms including the development of tolerance, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, and potential psychosis.

Many residents and physicians do not feel comfortable working with patients with OUD. Social stigma promotes negative attitudes toward these patients and is a roadblock to delivering equitable and effective care. This study sought to (1) characterize medical students' experiences with patients with OUD, (2) understand the features that make a patient encounter memorable, (3) explore factors that influence future practice, and (4) describe the influence on stigma toward patients with OUD. <b>Approach:</b> A study was conducted using qualitative descriptive theory and purposive sampling of fourth-year medical students (M4s) enrolled at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM). Data collection consisted of a free-text question as a part of a larger survey to M4s in the Class of 2019 and 2020, followed by semi-structured interviews. The goal of the survey was to gain a broad understanding of student encounters with patients with OUD. The goal of the interviews was to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of these encounters on future practice and stigma. Thematic analysis was used to analyze all data. <b>Findings:</b> One-hundred-seventy out of 237 students (RR = 71.7%) completed the free text question describing a memorable encounter with a patient with OUD. Twelve students then completed interviews. Patient encounters occurred in three primary settings: Emergency department, inpatient clerkship, or Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) meetings during psychiatry clerkship. Clinical encounters were memorable when there was: (1) conflict with patients or teams, (2) complicated care, (3) inadequate care, and (4) relevance to the student's future career. Memorable encounters influenced future practice by changing students' approaches to: (1) future treatment, (2) future communication, or (3) allowing students to practice professionalism. Regarding opioid stigma, students reported that these encounters made them: (1) more aware of stereotypes in medicine, (2) stereotypes in their personal lives, and (3) generated actions that students want to take in the future. <b>Insights:</b> A single, influential clinical encounter has the potential to substantially influence medical students' approach to patients with OUD, including both clinical management and attitudes toward care. Affecting encounters increased knowledge of OUD and fostered empathy and perspective-taking. Not all encounters had a defining impact on students' stigma toward OUD. Medical schools need to create opportunities that will have lasting impact by encouraging students to fully engage with patients with OUD.\nSupplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/10401334.2022.2038175 ."}, {"Title": "Brainmarker-I Differentially Predicts Remission to Various Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Treatments: A Discovery, Transfer, and Blinded Validation Study.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by neurobiological heterogeneity, possibly explaining why not all patients benefit from a given treatment.

The content-related discussion in this field took place in particular in the area of forensic psychiatric expertise in criminal law, to which, among others, the most well-known forensic psychiatrist of the GDR, Hans Szewczyk, made important contributions. After the introduction of the Criminal Code in 1968 and the accompanying legal changes regarding reduced or abolished criminal responsibility of delinquents, a discourse took place until the beginning of the 1980s on various questions on the improvement of the quality of expert opinions and further development of their work. The focus was on the assessment of criminal responsibility rather than on the assessment of prognosis, which probably resulted from the abolition of the \"Ma\u00dfregelvollzug\" in 1968. Only a few sources refer to the placement and treatment of forensic psychiatric patients. Mentally ill offenders were hardly ever accommodated in specific departments, which were apparently established in a few clinics from the mid-1970s onwards. There was also a lack of specially developed structural treatment concepts specifically for forensic psychiatric patients. Especially for mentally ill lawbreakers with a high level of delinquency, inpatient placement was apparently hardly possible due to a new legislation after 1968.

In this article, I trace the historical development of the notions of drug dependence as a neuronal and behavioral problem in the local research context of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany. Focusing on the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, I argue that the neuroscientific and behaviorist understanding of \"dependence\" had two different trajectories that were yoked together under the same institution of self-proclaimed basic research: (a) the neuroscientific notion derived from an older toxicological approach to drug effects that was then accompanied by biochemical methods from the 1950s onwards, and neurochemical approaches from the 1960s and 1970s; and (b) the behaviorist notion had predecessors in psychotherapeutic approaches to addiction that emerged in the 1950s and took a psychodynamic orientation at the Institute. When the Institute positioned itself as a basic research establishment and developed a unified structure during the 1960s, these psychodynamic approaches were excluded for being \"too applied.\" Soon afterward, behaviorist psychotherapeutic approaches to drug dependence emerged in the 1970s, emphasizing their foundation in basic research. Even though neuroscientific and behaviorist notions had some overlaps through the use of animal experimentation and by referring to basic research, researchers using the two approaches remained separate in their respective units during the time period under analysis. When conceptualizing the local scientific occupation with \"drug dependence,\" I apply here the history of science concept of a \"split object.\" Like the \"boundary object,\" the split object is plastic enough to adapt to local conditions and robust enough to maintain its genuine identity. Compared with the boundary object, however, the split object does not invite scientific collaboration.

Data were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 12.\nThe participants believed that mechanical restraints should be used as a last resort and that safeguarding patients during implementation is important; however, their assessments of the patients' physical and mental conditions varied. A clear difference emerged in how management qualified professionals handled situations prior to and during the implementation of mechanical coercive measures.\nThe findings emphasise the need to focus on the assessment of patients prior to and during restraint, ensure the quality of safe implementation in a risk-of-harm situation, prioritise competence in education, and practice, and improve management.\nThe findings highlight the importance of assessing the physical and mental condition of patients while implementing restraints, as well as aiding the management, nurses and ward staff in tailoring safety procedures."}, {"Title": "Visceral Visions: Rethinking Embodiment and Desire in Global Mental Health.", "Abstract": "The globalization of biomedicine poses the problem of finding cross-culturally valid criteria for mental health. Undue pathologization is a major risk for global health, especially when diagnoses rely exclusively on Western nosology. This article focuses on the clinical conflation between involuntary\u00a0mass possession and conversion disorder. Originally, the diagnosis of \"conversion disorder\" evolved from the notion of hysteria. Even though the category of hysteria disappeared from psychiatry many decades ago, some of its undergirding assumptions have survived under the new label of conversion. Namely, the assumption that hysteria/conversion is caused by repressed sexual desire is still implicit in widespread explanatory models for mass possession worldwide. Drawing upon an ethnography of demonic possession (grisi siknis) among the Afro-Indigenous Miskitos of Nicaragua, I argue that (1) the label of conversion is eurocentric and inappropriate for mass possession; and (2) emic perspectives on mass possession offer a critical counterpoint to rethink Euro-American and globalized understandings of embodiment and desire."}, {"Title": "Brain research on Nazi \"euthanasia\" victims: Legal conflicts surrounding Scientology's instrumentalization of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society's history against the Max Planck Society.", "Abstract": "In 1985, historian G\u00f6tz Aly published an article showing that the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research, neuropathologist Julius Hallervorden (1882-1965), had acquired brains of Nazi \"euthanasia\" victims and brain specimens of at least 33 children gassed at the Brandenburg killing center on October 28, 1940, which were still kept by the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research. Aly criticized that the Max Planck Society had suppressed articles by journalist Hermann Brendel in the 1970s claiming that institutes of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society had conducted brain research within the framework of \"euthanasia.\" New sources show that these articles, which were the subject of a lawsuit, were published in a newspaper called <i>Freiheit</i> run by the German branch of Scientology, of which Brendel was editor-in-chief. The articles were part of Scientology's antipsychiatry campaign. They mixed historical facts about racial hygiene and \"euthanasia\" in Nazi Germany with ludicrous and unfounded accusations alleging that violent, racist, and dehumanizing research methods typical in Nazi research were still carried out at the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry. The legal conflict between the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) and Scientology about the role of brain researchers in the Nazi era is analyzed here through combining perspectives from the history of neuroscience and socio-legal history. In contrast to trials of Nazi war crimes against \"euthanasia\" perpetrators, the civil law case of the MPG against Scientology from 1972 until 1975 instead concerned the instrumentalization of the Nazi past of psychiatry and brain research for ideological and commercial motives. The Scientology case caused social and legal ripples, and its after effects extended to 1986, when the MPG considered taking legal steps against Aly's publication."}, {"Title": "Translation, cross-cultural adaptation, and validation of the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) for the Brazilian population.", "Abstract": "Few instruments are available in Brazil to evaluate psychomotor activity in psychiatric emergency, clinical, and research settings. This study aimed to perform a cross-cultural adaptation of the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS) into Brazilian Portuguese and assess the adapted scale's psychometric properties.\nAn expert consensus committee conducted a translation and back-translation of the original scale, resulting in the BARS-BR. Four pairs of physicians administered the BARS-BR and the Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS) to patients in a hospital psychiatry emergency room and patients in the hospital's psychiatric wards. The BARS-BR was compared to the SAS to assess concurrent validity and internal consistency was evaluated with the Bland-Altman technique.\nIn the emergency room, the correlation coefficients between the first and second assessments were rho = 0.997 and rho = 1.0, respectively. In the hospital wards, the correlation coefficient between the pair of evaluators was rho = 0.951. There were strong correlations between the BARS-BR score of the first examiner and the SAS score of the second examiner (rho = 0.903) and between the SAS score of the first examiner and the BARS-BR score of the second examiner (rho = 0.893).\nThe BARS-BR showed good psychometric properties, and we recommend its use because it constitutes an easy method for assessment of changes in psychomotor activity.

The current study surveyed clinicians in a pediatric psychiatric ED to examine differences in attitudes on suicide-related care for autistic and non-autistic patient populations. While clinicians rated addressing STB in ASD as important and adaptations to care as necessary, less than half identified ASD as a suicide risk factor and confidence ratings were significantly lower for autistic patients. Previous ASD training predicted confidence and accounted for approximately 25% of the variance in confidence scores. Findings highlight the urgency to develop and disseminate ED clinician training, and address the lack of validated assessment tools, adapted suicide prevention practices, and evidence-based treatments for STB in autistic youth."}, {"Title": "Systemic Inflammatory Biomarkers in DSM-5-Defined Disorders and COVID-19: Evidence From Published Meta-analyses.", "Abstract": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) as a global pandemic.

This mixed methods study evaluated the effectiveness of pain management telementoring in improving provider knowledge, attitudes, and perceived competence.\nThe study was conducted at Madigan Army Medical Center. Using a non-randomized quasi-experimental approach, 25 providers were assigned to intervention arm and control arm (14 intervention and 13 control). Providers in the intervention group attended telementoring sessions. Videoconference technology was used to deliver weekly 90-minute TelePain sessions to the PCPs in the intervention group. The first 25-30\u2009minutes of each session consisted of a didactic presentation led by a panel of interdisciplinary pain management clinicians. During the remaining 60\u2009minutes, all PCPs in the intervention group presented clinical histories and asked specific management questions regarding patients of their choosing. An interdisciplinary panel of pain management clinicians provided telementoring consultations. The panel included experts from pain medicine, primary care, psychology or psychiatry, chiropractic, clinical pharmacy, and nursing. Changes in provider knowledge, attitudes, and perceived competence were evaluated using the Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain, KnowPain-12, and the Perceived Competence Scale (n\u2009=\u200923; 12 intervention and 11 control). Qualitative interviews were conducted among a subset of providers (n\u2009=\u200912; 8 intervention and 4 control), and provider narratives were analyzed using content analysis.\nIncreased provider knowledge (Z\u2009=\u20092.0, P\u2009=\u2009.046 [KnowPain-12]) and perceived competence (Z\u2009=\u20092.1, P\u2009=\u2009.033) were observed among intervention group providers. Provider narratives supported more implementation of non-pharmacological pain management strategies, use of strategies to engage patients in reducing reliance on opioids, and perception of TelePain as a helpful resource especially in the context of inadequate preparation in chronic pain management during professional training.\nTelementoring may hold significant potential to support providers in their efforts to decrease use of prescription opioids.

We explore the intersections of climate change and mental health which has been under-recognised to date. Climate change can affect mental health directly through the effects of extreme weather events such as heat, drought and flooding, and indirectly through increasing rates of migration and inequality. Vulnerable individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders will be particularly at risk. Emerging evidence is also\u00a0showing effects of air pollution on brain development. Mitigation efforts related to reducing carbon emissions will have both direct and indirect effects on mental health. A further consideration demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic is that the spread of infectious disease can have substantial effects on the mental health of the population.

Almost two thirds of those promoting tobacco cessation reported lacking time to combine psychiatric and physical examination during one session. The psychiatrists who reported not promoting tobacco smoking cessation also reported never dealing with physical health in case of the absence of a general practitioner and thinking that physical examination may have a negative impact on the therapeutic relationship. Almost all (96%) reported promoting the need for a general practitioner for their patients. We found no significant difference between the public and private sectors (P>0.05).\nYoung psychiatrists are more prone than their elders to promote smoking cessation but report lacking time to include it in their daily practice.

Results suggest that forensic psychiatric patients with SSD who self-injured were younger both at the time of onset and at the time of first entry into the federal criminal record. They exhibited more severe psychopathological symptoms at the time of admission, including higher levels of depression and anxiety and greater difficulty with abstract reasoning. Of all the predictors identified, symptoms of depression and anxiety may be the most promising treatment targets for the prevention of self-injury in inpatient forensic patients with SSD due to their modifiability and should be further substantiated in future studies."}, {"Title": "Treatment outcome of an intensive psychiatric home treatment for children and adolescents: a non-randomized controlled pilot evaluation.", "Abstract": "Home treatment (HT) may offer an effective and cost-efficient alternative to inpatient treatment for children and adolescents with acute mental disorders.

Consequently, molecular pathway-based therapeutic interventions for different cancer typologies, namely tumor type- and site-agnostic treatments, have been developed, encouraging the real-world implementation of a paradigm shift in medicine. Given the breakthrough nature of the new-generation translational research and drug development in oncology, there is an increasing rationale to transfertilize this blueprint to other medical fields, including psychiatry and neurology. In order to illustrate the emerging paradigm shift in neuroscience, we provide a state-of-the-art review of translational studies on the \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) and its most studied downstream effector, neuregulin, which are molecular orchestrators of distinct biological pathways involved in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. This body of data aligns with the evidence of a shared genetic/biological architecture among Alzheimer's disease, schizoaffective disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. To facilitate a forward-looking discussion about a potential first step towards the adoption of biological pathway-based, clinical symptom-agnostic, categorization models in clinical neurology and psychiatry for precision medicine solutions, we engage in a speculative intellectual exercise gravitating around BACE-related science, which is used as a paradigmatic case here. We draw a perspective whereby pathway-based therapeutic strategies could be catalyzed by highthroughput techniques embedded in systems-scaled biology, neuroscience, and pharmacology approaches that will help overcome the constraints of traditional descriptive clinical symptom and syndrome-focused constructs in neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Public mental health: a psychiatry and public health perspective.", "Abstract": "Mental health issues are fast becoming one of society's greatest health challenges with evidence of higher levels of illness and strain on psychiatric services.

This nationwide study explores the changes in length of stay, recurrent hospitalization, functioning level, suicidality, violence and diagnoses of CAP inpatients in Finland in 2000, 2011 and 2018. We obtained comprehensive questionnaire data on each study year from 93 to 95% of all CAP wards in Finland. We split the 1276 inpatients into two age groups in each study year: under 13 and 13-18. The median length of stay in inpatient treatment decreased from 82.0\u00a0days in 2000 to 20.5\u00a0days in 2018 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and recurrent hospitalization increased from 38 to 46%. General functioning, which was evaluated by the Children's Global Assessment Scale, deteriorated by an average of six points between 2000 and 2018. Violent threats decreased from 21.5 to 16.6% and violent acts decreased from 26.9 to 20.3%. Suicidal threats decreased from 42.6 to 23.3% in those aged under 13 and remained stable among those aged 13-18. In the 13-18 group, there was an increase in the diagnoses of ADHD, from 5.0 to 16.9% and depression, from 25.1 to 41.7%. However, psychosis decreased from 23.2 to 12.6% in the older age group. In the whole cohort, anxiety disorders increased from 7.6 to 15.6%. The overall picture does not show that CAP inpatients have become more disturbed. While the general functioning of CAP inpatients deteriorated somewhat over the 2000-2018 study period, symptoms of suicidality and violence remained stable or decreased.

This avoids the biases of chronicity and selection inherent in clinical samples, guides models of shared aetiology within psychiatric disorders and informs the development and implementation of interventions. We applied Gaussian mixture modelling to measures of mental phenomena from two general population cohorts: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n\u2009=\u20093018) and the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (NSPN, n\u2009=\u20092023). We defined classes according to their patterns of both positive (e.g. wellbeing and self-esteem) and negative (e.g. depression, anxiety,\u00a0and psychotic experiences) phenomena. Subsequently, we characterized classes by considering the distribution of diagnoses and sex split across classes. Four well-separated classes were identified within each cohort. Classes primarily differed by overall severity of transdiagnostic distress rather than particular patterns of phenomena akin to diagnoses. Further, as overall severity of distress increased, so did within-class variability, the proportion of individuals with operational psychiatric diagnoses. These results suggest that classes of mental phenomena in the general population of adolescents may not be the same as those found in clinical samples. Classes differentiated only by overall severity support the existence of a general, transdiagnostic mental distress factor and have important implications for intervention."}, {"Title": "Implementing an occupational therapy specific mental health intervention in a multi-professional context - the case of Balancing Everyday Life (BEL).", "Abstract": "The occupation-based intervention Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) was found effective under controlled conditions but should also be studied in a natural clinical practice context.\nThe aim was to study the implementation process of BEL when provided in a multi-professional mental health team. The focus was particularly on how BEL was received and functioned.\nThis qualitative study was based on manifest content analysis and used semi-structured telephone interviews with 13 occupational therapists and three managers.\nThree themes were identified: '1 - Conditions and opportunities in the setting', '2 - Putting the BEL intervention into practice' and '3 - Experiences of practicing BEL'. BEL was a welcomed alternative, as stated by managers and occupational therapists. The team helped to recruit BEL participants, but the occupational therapists had to give rigorous information to team members and prospective participants for this to work. The social, physical and political contexts were essential for the implementation.\nSuccessful implementation of an occupational therapy-specific intervention such as BEL requires a reasonable match between existing team policies and the underpinnings of the intervention.

Confirmatory multilevel factor models examined the generalizability of the multilevel factor solutions to Samples 2 and 3. Across all samples, the results suggested strong support for a two-factor solution for trait affect and a seven-factor solution for state emotion. Taken together, these results suggest that positive affect and negative affect can be used to describe differences across people, but at least seven differentiated emotions are experienced within persons across time.

The use of this tool is even being adopted by healthcare ethics consultants (HECs) in US hospitals as part of their work in navigating conflict at the bedside. Anecdotal evidence of their increasing popularity among clinical ethicists, for example, can be found at professional bioethics meetings and conversations and idea-sharing among practitioners on HEC social media. While there are a handful of papers gesturing toward a bioethical critique of behavior contracts of various types, the use of behavior contracts in the context of interpersonal conflict has not been vetted by bioethicists to determine their ethical legitimacy or efficacy.

Amidst calls for greater recognition of her pivotal contribution in the genesis of autism conceptualisation and categorisation, this article provides a biographical and historical background. Sukhareva's wide-ranging psychiatric work is adumbrated and her pioneering efforts in conceptualising both schizophrenia and autism are elucidated. The article reflects on possible explanations for the belated and incomplete recognition of Sukhareva's role. The current article indicates how Sukhareva's work was ahead of its time in reflecting modern criteria for autism diagnoses and in its focus on female case studies.

The FSD integrates psychopathology with normative individual differences in personality and behavior, and allows researchers to draw principled distinctions between broad clusters of disorders, as well as identify functional subtypes within current diagnostic categories.

In particular, cross-sectional studies suggest that affective symptoms may influence the emergence of psychotic symptoms. However, longitudinal analysis offers a more compelling test for causation: the European Schizophrenia Cohort (EuroSC) provides data suitable for this purpose. We predicted that the persistence of psychotic symptoms would be driven by the continuing presence of affective disturbance.\nEuroSC included 1208 patients randomly sampled from outpatient services in France, Germany and the UK. Initial measures of psychotic and affective symptoms were repeated four times at 6-month intervals, thereby furnishing five time-points. To examine interactions between symptoms both within and between time-slices, we adopted a novel technique for modelling longitudinal data in psychiatry. This was a form of Bayesian network analysis that involved learning dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\nOur DAG analysis suggests that the main drivers of symptoms in this long-term sample were delusions and paranoid thinking. These led to affective disturbance, not vice versa as we initially predicted. The enduring relationship between symptoms was unaffected by whether patients were receiving first- or second-generation antipsychotic medication.\nIn this cohort of people with chronic schizophrenia treated with medication, symptoms were essentially stable over long periods. However, affective symptoms appeared driven by the persistence of delusions and persecutory thinking, a finding not previously reported. Although our findings as ever remain hostage to unmeasured confounders, these enduring psychotic symptoms might nevertheless be appropriate candidates for directly targeted psychological interventions."}, {"Title": "Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent psychiatric services after 1 year (February/March 2021): ESCAP CovCAP survey.", "Abstract": "In April 2020, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) Research Academy and the ESCAP Board launched the first questionnaire of the CovCAP longitudinal survey to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) services in Europe.

While the lockdown has been eased after a few weeks, the respect of hygiene rules and barrier gestures still impacts the therapeutic framework of the institution. This article aims to document reflections on the effects that the current arrangements, inherent to the pandemic health situation, seem to produce over the organization of care in psychiatric children's hospitals, using the example of therapeutic meals. The latter should not be taken for granted, even though the minimal conditions for this caring time have been reinstated. Such conditions include a repetitive, structuring and reassuring framework with schedules, collective arrangements characterized by the regular presence pattern of the caregivers and their availability, as well as feedback sessions in the form of institutional meetings. After the reopening of the center, specific phenomena that were not so identifiable during the other care times were noticed during the meals of individual and group of patients. A situational analysis was led, based on observations, experience with patients and cross-examination (institutional psychotherapy and phenomenology) in order to understand these movements and highlight what seems to be irreducible for a meal to be therapeutic."}, {"Title": "Childhood externalizing, internalizing and comorbid problems: distinguishing young adults who think about suicide from those who attempt suicide.", "Abstract": "While childhood externalizing, internalizing and comorbid problems have been associated with suicidal risk, little is known about their specific associations with suicidal ideation and attempts. We examined associations between childhood externalizing, internalizing and comorbid problems and suicidal ideation (without attempts) and attempts by early adulthood, in males and females.\nParticipants were from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children, a population-based study of kindergarteners in Quebec from 1986 to 1988 and followed-up until 2005. We captured the co-development of teacher-rated externalizing and internalizing problems at age 6-12 using multitrajectories. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule administered at age 15 and 22, we identified individuals (1) who never experienced suicidal ideation/attempts, (2) experienced suicidal ideation but never attempted suicide and (3) attempted suicide.\nThe identified profiles were no/low problems (45%), externalizing (29%), internalizing (11%) and comorbid problems (13%). After adjusting for socioeconomic and familial characteristics, children with externalizing (OR 2.00, CI 1.39-2.88), internalizing (OR 2.34, CI 1.51-3.64) and comorbid (OR 3.29, CI 2.05-5.29) problems were at higher risk of attempting suicide (<i>v.</i> non-suicidal) by age 22 than those with low/no problems. Females with comorbid problems were at higher risk of attempting suicide than females with one problem. Childhood problems were not associated with suicidal ideation. Externalizing (OR 2.01, CI 1.29-3.12) and comorbid problems (OR 2.28, CI 1.29-4.03) distinguished individuals who attempted suicide from those who thought about suicide without attempting.\nChildhood externalizing problems alone or combined with internalizing problems were associated with suicide attempts, but not ideation (without attempts), suggesting that these problems confer a specific risk for suicide attempts."}, {"Title": "Developing a predictive signature for two trial endpoints using the cross-validated risk scores method.", "Abstract": "The existing cross-validated risk scores (CVRS) design has been proposed for developing and testing the efficacy of a treatment in a high-efficacy patient group (the sensitive group) using high-dimensional data (such as genetic data). The design is based on computing a risk score for each patient and dividing them into clusters using a nonparametric clustering procedure. In some settings, it is desirable to consider the tradeoff between two outcomes, such as efficacy and toxicity, or cost and effectiveness. With this motivation, we extend the CVRS design (CVRS2) to consider two outcomes. The design employs bivariate risk scores that are divided into clusters. We assess the properties of the CVRS2 using simulated data and illustrate its application on a randomized psychiatry trial. We show that CVRS2 is able to reliably identify the sensitive group (the group for which the new treatment provides benefit on both outcomes) in the simulated data. We apply the CVRS2 design to a psychology clinical trial that had offender status and substance use status as two outcomes and collected a large number of baseline covariates. The CVRS2 design yields a significant treatment effect for both outcomes, while the CVRS approach identified a significant effect for the offender status only after prefiltering the covariates."}, {"Title": "The relationship between cognitive functioning and psychopathology in patients with psychiatric disorders: a transdiagnostic network analysis.", "Abstract": "Patients with psychiatric disorders often experience cognitive dysfunction, but the precise relationship between cognitive deficits and psychopathology remains unclear. We investigated the relationships between domains of cognitive functioning and psychopathology in a transdiagnostic sample using a data-driven approach.\nCross-sectional network analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between domains of psychopathology and cognitive functioning and detect clusters in the network. This naturalistic transdiagnostic sample consists of 1016 psychiatric patients who have a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using various questionnaires. Core cognitive domains were assessed with a battery of automated tests.\nNetwork analysis detected three clusters that we labelled: general psychopathology, substance use, and cognition. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, verbal memory, and visual attention were the most central nodes in the network. Most associations between cognitive functioning and symptoms were negative, i.e. increased symptom severity was associated with worse cognitive functioning. Cannabis use, (subclinical) psychotic experiences, and anhedonia had the strongest total negative relationships with cognitive variables.\nCognitive functioning and psychopathology are independent but related dimensions, which interact in a transdiagnostic manner. Depression, anxiety, verbal memory, and visual attention are especially relevant in this network and can be considered independent transdiagnostic targets for research and treatment in psychiatry. Moreover, future research on cognitive functioning in psychopathology should take a transdiagnostic approach, focusing on symptom-specific interactions with cognitive domains rather than investigating cognitive functioning within diagnostic categories."}, {"Title": "Pliny the Elder: Lessons from the Naturalist as an Early Neuroscientist.", "Abstract": "Pliny the Elder was a prolific Roman author, naturalist, and military leader. Yet, his impact on modern-day neuroscience, psychiatry, and neurology has been little explored. Here, we aimed to trace the origins of our current understanding of the brain in ancient Rome through Pliny and his work, <i>Natural History</i>. As his magnum opus, this 37-book tome catalogs the facts and observations of natural life collected by Pliny, reflecting the knowledge of his time. Following the cephalocentric school of thought, Pliny places the brain as an agent for consciousness and details its diseases. Further, we explore Pliny's methods, which allow him to build a thorough collection of clinical descriptions and remedies. This body of work serves as an important lesson for future neuroscientists on the power of observation, the role of the humanities, and the necessity of understanding the origin of modern scientific thinking."}, {"Title": "A public health perspective on mental health: lessons for population health in\u00a0the 21<sup>st</sup> century.", "Abstract": "In December 2019, clinicians and academics from the disciplines of public health and psychiatry met in Dublin at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), to restate their shared commitment to population health.

All PRN antipsychotic and benzodiazepine orders, administrations, documentation practices, and attempted nonpharmacological strategies were assessed for each order and patient. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data.\nThirty-two patients with a total of 123 physicians' orders and 1,179 PRN administrations of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were reviewed. Of the total administrations, 720 (61%) were combinations with at least two psychotropic agents. Forty-one (33%) physicians' orders had a prescribed indication, and 559 (47%) administrations had an attempted nonpharmacological method prior to PRN administration. Eight patients (25%) had antipsychotic PRN orders, which exceeded the total daily maximum dose.

There has been a debate in psychiatry about whether or not we can infer a cause-and-effect relationship between the use of cannabis and psychotic disorders. In this editorial, we first present and critically discuss the evidence to date of the association between heavy cannabis use and psychosis. We argue that while the biological mechanisms underlying individual susceptibility to develop a psychotic disorder following heavy cannabis use are still unknown, heavy cannabis use remains the most modifiable risk factor for the onset of psychotic disorders and for its clinical and functional outcome. This demands a clear move towards both primary and secondary prevention intervention to reduce the impact of heavy cannabis use on the incidence and prevalence of psychotic disorders."}, {"Title": "Socio-economic functioning in patients with bipolar disorder and their unaffected siblings - results from a nation-wide population-based longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "Few studies have reported real-life data on socio-economic functioning in patients with bipolar disorder and their unaffected first-degree relatives.\nWe used Danish nation-wide population-based longitudinal register linkage to investigate socio-economic functioning in 19 955 patients with bipolar disorder, their 13 923 siblings and 20 sex, age and calendar-matched control individuals from the general population.

The best models for transition to psychosis included the severity of positive symptoms, especially delusions, and negative symptoms. Exploratory models revealed baseline negative symptoms, low functioning, delusions, and sleep problems in combination to be the best predictor of psychiatric hospitalization in the upcoming years.\nIncluding the severity levels of both positive and negative symptomatology proved beneficial in predicting psychosis.
