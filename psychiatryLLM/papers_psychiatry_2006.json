[{"Title": "SSRIs, suicide and violent behavior: is there a need for a better definition of the depressive state?", "Abstract": "To what extent do SSRIs increase the risk of suicide or violent behavior? Recent data indicate that some SSRIs lack a favorable 'risk-benefit' profile for treating childhood and adolescent depression. In addition, certain recent documents have cast doubt on previous conclusions dissociating antidepressant from violence. Beyond the debate on the need for improved transparency in clinical studies, this controversy raises other critical issues of SSRI use that merit our consideration. Firstly, is there an overuse of antidepressants, and does the risk of suicide increase with the prescription of antidepressants in the whole population? Secondly, is the response to antidepressants modified during adolescence? If so, by what mechanisms? We know that SSRI treatment can trigger mood changes in undiagnosed young bipolar patients resulting in agitation and disinhibition, and such effects may lead to suicide and violence. Thirdly, recent extensive literature has shown that some cases of depression are worsened by antidepressants and new data has suggested that bipolar depression can be improved by atypical antipsychotics. Finally, current criteria defining the depressive state are very similar to those employed during the 19th century, a pre-therapeutic period. Currently, while it is recognised that depressive mood is a very broad construct, there is still only one definition in international classifications to describe a major depressive episode. There is a clear need to develop an evidence-based approach to psychiatry aiming at delineating diagnostic categories predictive of the response to treatments."}, {"Title": "An algorithm for defining somatization in children.", "Abstract": "Defining somatization in pediatric populations presents a unique challenge, because DSM-IV somatization criteria may be inadequate for identifying a child with somatization. Two approaches exist. Child somatization has frequently been rooted in a questionnaire model, focusing on child or parent responses to assess how well a child conforms to a specific mental health profile. Others use a medical diagnosis model, designating a child with somatization as those for whom a limited number of medical measures have failed to reveal a pathological source of symptoms.\nWe incorporate concepts based upon a literature review from January 1994 to June 2005 of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL on classification and diagnosis of somatization in children ages 6 to 12. Our goal is to understand in depth the topic and suggest a way to better understand and classify somatization in children.\nWe incorporate an integrative approach toward defining child somatization and propose an algorithm to step-by-step classify children with somatic symptoms into three distinct groups: sick, somatizers, and well. This approach includes information from self-report questionnaire, physician questionnaire, and the child's medical chart.\nThis new algorithm suggests an approach for differentiating primary care pediatric clinic visitors into three distinct groups. Although used in clinical practice, empirical validation is necessary to further validate this algorithm."}, {"Title": "A methodology for conducting retrospective chart review research in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Retrospective research has become largely undervalued and underutilized in child and adolescent psychiatry with the increasing singular focus on randomized control trials, despite the wealth of clinically relevant data available in historical medical records.

A self-rated questionnaire was given to all the final year medical students at the University of Papua New Guinea. The results showed that the medical students in general had a negative attitude towards psychiatry as a career option and, although they were accepting of the mentally ill in a professional setting as colleagues or patients, they had a negative attitude towards close social contact with them as neighbours or as in-laws. Several students believed mental illness could be caused by sorcery or by spending much time with the mentally ill. Most students believed mental illness could be treated by prayer, one in five believed in the effectiveness of traditional healers and one in five did not believe modern medicine could treat mental illness. Apart from a reduction in stigma and in prejudice against a mentally ill neighbour, there was no significant difference in attitude between students who had rotated in psychiatry and those who had not. There was no significant difference in attitude between male and female respondents. There were, however, significant differences in attitude between students who had a positive family history of mental illness and those who did not. It was concluded that psychiatry was an unpopular choice for specialization and that students' attitudes towards mental illness were influenced more by their cultural beliefs and their family history of mental illness than by their rotation in psychiatry. These external variables that are independent of their medical training need to be considered during undergraduate medical training in order to optimize the provision of health care to the mentally ill in Papua New Guinea."}, {"Title": "The return of fixed combinations in psychiatry: fluoxetine and olanzapine combination.", "Abstract": "Fixed combination psychotropics, such as a combination of a tricyclic and a typical antipsychotic, were widely prescribed a generation ago. These products were plagued by a number of problems, including serious side effects, which caused them to fall out of favor. More recently, a fixed combination of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine has been approved in the US for the treatment of bipolar I depression. Although the combination produced a robust clinical response relative to placebo or olanzapine alone, the response from practitioners has been mixed. The reasons for this are likely to be varied. Some practitioners who remember the earlier era of fixed combinations may simply be resistant to using products of this type. Moreover, the two constituents are available and many clinicians prescribe them independently. Finally, adverse events associated with olanzapine may make practitioners hesitant. For example, weight gain is a common side effect with olanzapine, and may be associated with hyperlipidemia or type II diabetes. Aggressive management of this problem appears to be helpful in preventing or reversing weight gain. It is not clear how weight gain is going to impact the uptake of this effective treatment."}, {"Title": "[Introduction: ethnopsychiatry].", "Abstract": "This introduction is a literature review of the two major models of intervention in ethnopsychiatry: transcultural psychiatry and ethnopsychoanalysis.

By virtue of its multiple associations, forensic psychiatry is an archetype of such specialties ; it works within a set of values that might be viewed as antithetical, even irreconcilable, with other aspects of psychiatry. The extensive scope of action of forensic psychiatry compels its practitioners to hold alternate world views and to apply decisional rules that may clash with the classical values and ethical considerations of medicine (Weisstub, 1980).

Although investigators have begun to address diagnostic equivalency in telehealth clinics, few published studies reflect strong research design. The two presented telehealth programs completed randomized controlled trials in real-world clinical settings that addressed some of the methodologic shortcomings of prior studies. Diagnostic equivalency studies were completed across five telehealth specialty clinics: physical therapy, speech therapy, ambulatory pediatrics, child psychiatry, and developmental disabilities services. The two research teams encountered similar decision points in designing and implementing the equivalency protocols. This article addresses methodologic issues in choosing design, participants, technology, and evaluation measures.

Eye movement artifacts contaminate EEG signals and can produce errors in this analysis. Regression based technique is considered the 'gold standard' artifact removal procedure and other techniques have been developed the last years, but few works have shown an objectively evaluation of the efficiency of these methods because it is impossible to record pure EEG and EOG signals. In this study, an artificially reproduction of bidirectional contaminated EEG and EOG data is proposed in order to simulate a real case. A comparative study between automatic second-order statistics techniques (PCA, AMUSE and SOBI) and multiple regression analysis is performed. Effectiveness of removal techniques is evaluated by calculating the errors in spectral parameters between sources and corrected EEG signals. Average values and topographic brain distribution of these errors are considered. Errors are located in the anterior leads especially in the frontopolar ones. Results show that AMUSE and SOBI methods preserve more cerebral activity than other techniques. We conclude that AMUSE and SOBI algorithms overcome the limitations of the regression based approach in the bidirectional contamination between ocular and neural activity."}, {"Title": "Telemedicine for the medicare population: update.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine services are increasingly utilized by patients, clinicians, and institutions. Although private and Federal insurers are covering some telemedicine services, the rationale for these coverage decisions is not always evidence-based.\nThe goal of this report was to assess the peer-reviewed literature for telemedicine services that substitute for face-to-face medical diagnosis and treatment that may apply to the Medicare population. We focused on three distinct areas: store-and-forward, home-based, and office/hospital-based services. We also sought to identify what progress had been made in expanding the evidence base since the publication of our initial report in 2001 (AHRQ Publication No. 01-E012).\nOvid MEDLINE, reference lists of included studies, and non-indexed materials recommended by telemedicine experts.\nIncluded studies had to be relevant to at least one of the three study areas, address at least one key question, and contain reported results. We excluded articles that did not study the Medicare population (e.g., children and pregnant adults) or used a service that does not require face-to-face encounters (e.g., radiology or pathology diagnosis).\nOur literature searches initially identified 4,083 citations. Using a dual-review process, 597 of these were judged to be potentially relevant to our study at the title/abstract level. Following a full-text review, 97 studies were identified that met our inclusion criteria and were subsequently included in the report's evidence tables.\nStore-and-forward services have been studied in many specialties, the most prominent being dermatology, wound care, and ophthalmology. The evidence for their efficacy is mixed, and in most areas, there are not corresponding studies on outcomes or improved access to care. Several limited studies showed the benefits of home-based telemedicine interventions in chronic diseases. These interventions appear to enhance communication with health care providers and provide closer monitoring of general health, but the studies of these techniques were conducted in settings that required additional resources and dedicated staff. Studies of office/hospital-based telemedicine suggest that telemedicine is most effective for verbal interactions, e.g., videoconferencing for diagnosis and treatment in specialties like neurology and psychiatry.\nThere are still significant gaps in the evidence base between where telemedicine is used and where its use is supported by high-quality evidence.

Criminal law imposes strict punishments for such crimes as rape. Psycho-pathologically, rape is among the gravest of crimes, often associated with extremely deviated behavior. This article deals with the forensic aspects of sexual violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from 2000 - 2004. We report about sexual assaults, personality of delinquents, motives and consequences of rape.\nTwo groups of violent offenders were compared in the study: perpetrators of rape (NA = 90), and perpetrators of other criminal offences (N = 90 - recidivists). The control group included young males (N = 90).\nThe results of the study show a high level of violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rape rate equals the level of homicide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rape offenders are mostly people with personal disorders (70%), but they also present with other illnesses and behavior disorders.\nThe significance of rape as a violent crime has not been sufficiently studied. High incidence of violence and rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina is extremely disturbing. The most disturbing aspect is the increase of violence and failure to take certain measures.

Psychiatric education in Korea during the forced Japanese annexation of Korea (1910-1945)].", "Abstract": "In the second report in our series on the historical investigation on the introduction of western psychiatry into Korea, authors deal with the status of psychiatric education during the Japanese forced annexation of Korea. The first lecture on psychiatry in Korea under the title \"Mental Diseases\" was held in Dae-han-eui-won around 1910. In 1913, the Department of Psychiatry branched off from the Department of Internal Medicine of Chosen-sotoku-fu-iing, the Colonial Governmental Clinic, the successor of Dae-han-eui-won. The chairman, Professor Suiju Sinji; and the Korean assistant Sim Ho-seop administered the psychiatric ward with 35 beds. Since 1913, an Australian missionary psychiatrist, Dr. McLaren began to teach neurology and psychiatry at Severance Union Medical College and established a Department of Psychiatry in 1923. Dr. McLaren was a faithful Christian and open minded toward Oriental religious thought such as in Buddhism and Taoism. He devoted himself to the humanitarian care of mentally ill patients and served there until 1937 when he had to leave the land due to Japanese persecution. His disciple, Dr. Lee Jung Cheol succeeded the chair of the Psychiatric Department of Severance Medical College and served until 1939. In 1916, Keijo (Seoul) Medical College was established and in 1928, Keijo Teikoku Daigaku (Imperial University). From 1929 to 1941, the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry of Keijo Imperial University grew under the chairmanship of Professor Kubo Kioji followed by Professor Watanabe until 1945. Many assistants including a few Koreans were gathered to the Department for training and research. The main textbook used for the psychiatric education for medical students in Korea was on Kraepelinian German Psychiatry translated and edited by Japanese psychiatrists. Lectures and clerkships for Neurology and Psychiatry were allocated generally in the curriculum for senior students for weekly 1-3 hours. Postgraduate professional training for the psychiatrists was carried out according to the tutorial system under the supervision of professors and staff. In regard to a wide range of references discovered in the library of the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Keijo Imperial University the trainees seem to have had opportunity to contact with diverse subspecialties of psychiatry and also to exercise specific laboratory examinations in the setting of the German linik\". Comparisons of psychiatry in Korea and Japan during Japanese occupation suggest the following conclusions: 1. Extreme discrimination against Korean trainees in their academic careersprobably due to colonial policy. After 35 years of Japanese occupation of Korea only ten Korean neuro-psychiatrists and neurologists were left; 2. Somewhat narrow academic interests of psychiatrists in Korea in research fields focusing on neuropathology and opium addiction etc and the lackness of the interest in social psychiatric issues: for example, the rights of the mentally ill patient or non-restraining care systems as seen in Japanese psychiatry in Japan. 3. Extremely limited number of psychiatry teaching staffs in Korea.

Two swedish scientists, the physician Bror Gadelius (1862-1938) and his friend the philosopher Axel Herrlin (1870-1937), inspired by the French psychologist Theodule Ribots (1839-1916) \"psychology without a soul\", denied all fixed demarcation lines between abnormity and normality. All humans are natures creatures ruled by physiological laws, not ruled by God or convention.

These shifts in the doctor's emphasis or behavior included: (1) making an entirely unexpected statement; (2) advocating strongly for the youngster; (3) confessing personal flaws and/or frustrations to the patient; (4) feeding or rewarding the young patient; and (5) inquiring deeply into something personal with the child. A gesture never given--in this instance, an undelivered inquiry into incest--is shown to have left an adolescent patient unchanged. The young people described in this report suffered from anxiety, trauma, neglect, cancer; anorexia, bulimia, and personality disorders. Two were institutionalized at the time of their dramatic changes. One had been previously hospitalized 4 times. Another small child had suffered a double amputation. These children came with a far broader spectrum of problems than the relatively mild disorders for which child-psychodynamic psychotherapy was originally tailored. Although we were not primarily concerned with the \"ground\" on which the doctor's gesture fell, in 5 of our cases there had been little to no therapeutic relationship prior to the gesture; in 4, the relationship had been primarily positive; and, in 2, it had been negative.\nDoctors' gestures are usually given on impulse and unexpectedly during psychotherapy. To the child, these gestures appear counter-intuitive and surprising. From the therapist's perspective, they first generate a brief sense of confusion in the patient, and then a strong sense of connection between the young person and the adult. In the cases we report, the physicians'gestures created a new alliance. The tone of the therapy switched, leading to a noticeable psychic shift in the child.\nA doctor's gesture may elicit a dramatic turn-around in a young patient. This therapeutic climax is implicitly understood between the two parties and then may be converted to consciousness and worked with explicitly. Therapeutic \"moments\" occur in a broad range of disorders, that in many cases are also being treated simultaneously with medications, and with family or institutional counseling."}, {"Title": "Clinical holistic medicine: psychodynamic short-time therapy complemented with bodywork. A clinical follow-up study of 109 patients.", "Abstract": "This is a study of 109 patients who attended the Research Clinic for Holistic Medicine in Copenhagen during the 2004-2006 period, grouped according to the symptoms they presented with. Every new patient was asked to answer a 10-question composite questionnaire containing QOL1, QOL5, and four questions on ability to function socially, ability to function sexually, ability to love, and ability to work, rated on a 5-point Likert scale, on initial contact and after 1-3 months, when the patient had received about five treatments, the patient was asked to complete the questionnaire again, and finally again after 1 year. All had been to their general practitioner first with their problems and 30% had been in psychological/psychiatric treatment before. The patients were treated with short-time psychodynamic therapy (less than 40 sessions) including bodywork when necessary. More than half the patients had a bad or very bad self-assessed mental health before treatment, but after treatment only 15% reported a bad or very bad mental health (p < 0.001). Most had a complex of mental, somatic, existential, and sexual problems. Of the patients, 69.72% did the retest after treatment. We conclude that clinical holistic medicine was able to help the majority of these patients, even when patients had not been sufficiently helped by drugs, psychiatry, or psychology before. We found that outcome of therapy was not connected with severity of initial condition, but probably with the former experience of treatment. If psychiatric or psychological treatment had already failed, the patients were more difficult to help. The Square Curve Paradigm was used to document a large, immediate and lasting effect of the therapy."}, {"Title": "Clinical holistic medicine: the case story of Anna. I. Long-term effect of childhood sexual abuse and incest with a treatment approach.", "Abstract": "The nervous breakdown of a 22-year-old, young woman was caused by severe sexual abuse in childhood, which was repressed over many years. During therapy, the patient accumulated resources to start the painful integration of these old traumas. Using holistic existential therapy in accordance with the life mission theory and the holistic process theory of healing, she finally was able to confront her old traumas and heal her existence. She seemingly recovered completely (including regaining full emotional range) through holistic existential therapy, individually and in a group. The therapy took 18 months and more than 100 hours of intensive therapy. In the beginning of the therapy, the issues were her physical and mental health; in the middle of the therapy, the central issue was her purpose of life and her love life; and at the conclusion of the therapy, the issue was gender and sexuality. The strategy was to build up her strength for several months, mobilizing hidden resources and motivation for living, before the old traumas could be confronted and integrated. The therapy was based on quality of life philosophy, on the life mission theory, the theory of ego, the theory of talent, the theory of the evil side of man, the theory of human character, and the holistic process theory of healing. The clinical procedures included conversation, philosophical training, group therapeutic tools, extended use of therapeutic touch, holistic pelvic examination, and acceptance through touch was used to integrate the early traumas bound to the pelvis and scar tissue in the sexual organs. She was processed according to 10 levels of the advanced toolbox for holistic medicine and the general plan for clinical holistic psychiatry. The emotional steps she went through are well described by the scale of existential responsibility. The case story of Anna is an example of how even the most severely ill patient can recover fully with the support of holistic medical treatment, making her feel, understand, and let go of her negative beliefs and life-denying decisions."}, {"Title": "Study of depression among geriatric population in Nepal.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the commonest psychiatric disorders among the elderly patients attending the outpatient department of the tertiary care hospital. The consequence of unrecognized and untreated depression in the elderly population may include excessive use of health care services, decreased treatment compliance and increased morbidity and mortality related to underlying medical illness and from suicide. The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of depression according to Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and to find out the association of GDS with ICD-10 Diagnostic Criteria for Research (ICD-10 DCR) among older adults in the Nepalese population. A study group of 100 elderly patients aged 65 years and above were randomly selected from the psychiatry, medicine and general practice outpatient departments of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal. MMSE scale is administered and the patients scoring more then 24 were administered the GDS and clinical diagnosis was made according to ICD-10 DCR. 53.2% of the samples were found to experience depressive illness according to GDS which includes 34.2% of mild and 19% of severe depression. 83.3% of the patients diagnose with probable depression with GDS were also diagnose clinically with ICD-10 DCR (p<0.001).

These items were: interacting with the resident alone outside of supervision e.g. playing tennis (p = .0005), publishing identifiable content of supervision discussions with resident's consent (p = .0006), and disclosing the supervisor's prior struggles with substance abuse (p = .0008).

Also explored is the issue of multiple maladaptive behaviours and whether or not these are interrelated. The period of the sample comprised 2002-2003 admissions (N = 3694) to a clinic for child and adolescent psychiatry and psychosomatics. Measures were taken from medical-psychological documentation (\"Ba-Do\") and self-report questionnaire and included items relating to self-injurious behaviour, suicidal intent and socially disruptive and threatening behaviour (FAPS). Self and expert ratings of suicidal and self-injurious behaviour were significantly statistically correlated. Overt aggression was unrelated to suicidal behaviour. Suicidal and self-injurious behaviour were more common among female than male adolescents. Age, disharmony within the family and excessive parental demands were major global determinants of suicidal behaviour for both genders, but unrelated to self-injurious or socially disruptive behaviour, the latter being more associated with parental under-involvement and feelings of hostile rejection. Intelligence and age were significant predictors of overt aggression among females; intellectual functioning, number of siblings and disability among family members emerged as major determinants of suicidal behaviour among males.

Many people with ID suffer from psychiatric/behavioral/emotional disturbances (known as \"dual diagnosis\"). Specialist psychiatric services are needed to address these problems effectively, but are not currently available in most countries, including Israel. This article sets out to describe the problems, current services in Israel, approaches in other countries and proposed solutions for Israel. We believe it important to enforce laws against discrimination based on disability, to raise the general awareness, knowledge and skills among generic mental health professionals on the topic of intellectual disability by inclusion in university, postgraduate and in-service training curricula, to work towards a form of subspecialty within psychiatry along the lines of the model in the United Kingdom and to establish specialized psychiatric services, possibly functioning as back-up to the generic psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "[Julius Ludwig August Koch (1841-1908). Psychiatrist, philosopher, and Christian].", "Abstract": "Julius Ludwig August Koch was born 1841 in the small town of Laichingen (W\u00fcrttemberg) in the Southwest of Germany. After working as a chemist for about seven years, he studied medicine in T\u00fcbingen from 1863 to 1867. First he worked as a physican and later in a private mental hospital in G\u00f6ppingen. From 1874 to 1898, he was director of a state mental hospital in Zwiefalten (W\u00fcrttemberg). Koch died in 1908 after a long period of suffering in Zwiefalten. Being deeply routed in a Christian faith and having much interest in moral and ethical issues, Koch published some philosophical works 'Epistomological investigations' (Erkenntnistheoretische Untersuchungen, 1882), 'Outline of philosophy' (Grundriss der Philosophie, 1885) and 'Reality and its knowledge' (Die Wirklichkeit und ihre Erkenntnis, 1886). In this papers he tried to bring together critical Kantian philosophy and Christian conviction. In 1888 he published a 'Short Textbook of Psychiatry' (Kurzgefasster Leitfaden der Psychiatrie), where he mentioned the term \"psychopathic inferiority\" for the first time (Psychopathische Minderwertigkeiten). The following work, focussing on this issue with the title 'Psychopathic Inferiority' (Die psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten, 1891-1893), became one of the fundamental texts concerning the concept of disorders of personality, which are in use today. In this book, published in three parts, he tried to describe the hole field between psychic normality and psychoses. Only the first and biggest part deals with psychopathological symptoms which we now think to be essential for personality disorders. Koch differentiates between \"disposition\" (Disposition), \"burden\" (Belastung) and \"degeneration\" (Degeneration), assuming a graduation. \"Disposition\" should be the mildest disorder, turning into normality, whereas \"degeneration\" turns to psychosis. Koch believed, that on the basis of all degrees of \"psychpathic inferiority\" there was a congenital defect of the constitution of the brain. To be consistent, he demanded that the individuals in question should not be punished as hard as people without this disorder by the courts, and proposed to open up special institutions beside the usual prisons. Beside this, Koch describes in the other parts of his book vividly for example acute and chronical organic psychoses and obsessions. Although psychiatric disorders are classified different today, Kochs work keeps its great importance for the concept of personality disorders, further more one can find very exact and detailed descriptions of a multitude of psychpathological symptoms, which are worth reading them today."}, {"Title": "[\"The main cause of his insanity, ... self-pollution\".

G. is admitted to the respected Prussian Siegburg Asylum in 1835. After six years he is discharged from the Siegburg having been diagnosed \"incurably insane\". In search of possible causes for the illness, the participants involved in the discussion, his father, doctors and the clergyman, come to the conclusion that it is his continuous \"self-pollution\" that is to be blamed. Their opinion runs in accordance with the discourse within the medical profession that \"self-pollution\" among young men is a prominent cause of insanity. The young man's patient record makes it possible to reconstruct the forms of \"therapy\" which are undertaken to cure his feeble state and to keep Georg from his dangerous habit. His record elucidates the interplay between medical theory and medical treatment. The methods of treatment undertaken in the asylum intended to bring Georg back to reason which includes a disciplined behaviour. His case record also opens up new possibilities for research in the history of psychiatry, as, in contrast to previous results, this patient neither attributed his state to his \"immoral\" behaviour, nor did he take any notice of the attempts his surroundings underwent to prevent him from continuing his actions."}, {"Title": "'Mind in general' by Sir Alexander Crichton.", "Abstract": "The history of the 'philosophies of psychiatry' can be defined as the contextualized study of past theoretical views on the nature, understanding and management of madness and related notions. The application of an hermeneutic apparatus to past psychiatric narratives gives rise to the history of psychiatry; its application to current narrative gives origin to the philosophy of psychiatry. If the latter employs off-the-shelf, ready-made, external philosophies, it follows a centripetal approach; if it starts from the inside of psychiatry and generates its own tools and meta-language, it follows a centrifugal approach. Psychiatry is burdened by intrinsic and extrinsic philosophical problems. The former result from its hybrid nature, i.e., from the fact that psychiatry unsteadily straddles the natural and human sciences. The latter are borrowed from the conceptual frames into which psychiatry has been inscribed since the 19th century. The philosophy of psychiatry may anticipate or follow empirical research. The ante rem mode is based on the idea that empirical research requires conceptual supervision, audit and guidance, for it is always ideology- and theory-laden. The post rem mode is based on the view that science is the only way to 'truth' and hence all that the philosophy of psychiatry can (or should) do is facilitate, interpret, justify, defend or glorify empirical findings. The Classic Text that follows was written by Sir Alexander Crichton at the end of the 18th century, and is a good example of the centripetal mode of philosophy-making."}, {"Title": "Hysteria and catatonia as motor disorders in historical context.", "Abstract": "It is difficult to imagine motor symptoms in psychiatry as different as hysteria and catatonia. The mechanism of hysteria is presumed to be psychogenic, while catatonia has always been considered to be among the most organic syndromes in psychiatry. Yet hysteria and catatonia have historically been regarded as allied conditions, an observation borne out by recent developments in neuroscience as well as by a growing awareness that the presentation of both conditions has changed over the years. In hysteria, the main shift has been from motor symptoms to sensory complaints such as chronic fatigue; in catatonia, the major change has been the virtual disappearance of negativistic or oppositional behaviour. It is possible that catatonia as well as hysteria may be responsive to changing cultural norms."}, {"Title": "Behaviorally-based disorders: the historical social construction of youths' most prevalent psychiatric diagnoses.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry in the USA controls the definitions of mental health disorders and diagnosis through required practice utilization of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and fiscal reimbursement using it.

Many cities and states have implemented effective policies to reduce tobacco use; public health and government leaders should learn from these experiences. Because smokeless tobacco use may increase in the United States, it will be increasingly important to understand net population harms related to use of smokeless tobacco.

Our objectives were to determine how many and which patients are transported, to measure how much time is spent in the peri-transport process and to document any morbidity or mortality associated with these periods of transitional care.\nIn this retrospective, observational health records review, we obtained health records during February, June and October 2002 for patients evaluated in any 1 of 3 adult EDs from a single Canadian city and subsequently transferred for admission to 1 of the other 2 hospitals. Data included the reason for transport, admitting service, transport process times and administration of key medications (asthma, cardiac, diabetes, analgesic or antibiotics).\nFive hundred and thirteen records of transported patients were reviewed, and 507 were evaluated. Of those, 372 (73.4%) transfers were capacity-related and 135 (26.6%) were transferred for specialty services. Of the capacity transports, 219 (58.9%) were admissions for psychiatry and 123 (33.1%) for medicine. Median wait time at the first hospital was 6.7 hours, being longest for psychiatric patients. Thirty patients (8.1%) missed 1 or more doses of a key medication in the peri-transport process, and 8 (2.2%) missed 2 or more.\nOvercrowding of hospitals is a significant problem in many Canadian EDs, resulting in measurable increases in lengths of stay. Transfers arranged to other facilities for admission further prolong lengths of stay. Increased boarding times can result in missed medications, which may increase patient morbidity.

However, Korea and Japan have been enriched by the influence of Western cultures along with modernization, and mutual exchanges between the two countries have thus decreased in numerous fields including mental health and psychiatry. Prof. Masahisa Nishizono and Prof. Byun-Kun Min, who are leaders in the field of psychiatry in both Japan and Korea, have established \"The Joint Workshop for Psychiatric Residents of Korea and Japan\", which has been held alternately in Fukuoka or Seoul every summer since 2000. This Joint Workshop provides young psychiatrists with real experiences and many opportunities to learn about transcultural psychiatry regarding both countries. The participants are able to obtain a better mutual understanding of psychiatric epidemiology, recent developments in biological psychiatry while also learning about different concepts regarding the stigma of mental disorders. All participants could also increase their knowledge about the traditional culture and social changes related to the field of psychiatry in both countries. The workshop has helped to build friendship and mutual cooperation between both nations. Contemporary societies are continually becoming more and more diversified and complicated. For young psychiatrists who have to treat patients with modern difficulties and various complicated problems, such cross-cultural experiences may be useful for establishing potentially new and effective treatments for such patients.

Since the initiation of Korean national economic development plan in 1960s, the number of mental institutions grew gradually but a large portion of patients suffering from psychosis and alcohol dependence still remained in the asylum.

Cesarean delivery on maternal request should not be performed prior to 39 weeks of gestation or without verification of lung maturity, because of the significant danger of neonatal respiratory complications. Maternal request for cesarean delivery should not be motivated by unavailability of effective pain management. Efforts must be made to assure availability of pain management services for all women.

American civil commitment law has reflected the swinging pendulum of social attitudes towards civil commitment, oscillating between more and less restriction for both procedural and substantive standards. These standards have evolved from a \"need for treatment\" approach to a \"dangerousness\" rationale, and now may be moving to a position in which these justifications are combined, particularly in the context of involuntary outpatient commitment.

In forensic practice, NPE usually focuses on competency to stand trial, the mental state at the time of the offense, risk for future violence and malingering/aggravation issues. Real-time computerized NPE shows more accurate results than traditional pen-and-paper tests and provides quantitative data in a relatively standard format. It permits detection of any manipulation by the examinee in \"real time.\" Therefore, it makes it possible not only to analyze the final results, but also to monitor closely the sequence of single acts of the assessment procedure. Thus, the computerized NPE attenuates possible examinee-related manipulations, which may distort the test results. The real-time NPE report of these elementary behavioral parameters can be used in the courts as acceptable evidence under cross-examination. This method leaves less room for bias; however, a cautious interpretation is always essential since the computerized data do not transform subjective methods into objective ones. Establishing a standard testing procedure and further utilization of real-time computerized tools could improve significantly the quality of NPE in forensic psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "The impossible dialogue between psychiatry and the judicial system: a language problem.", "Abstract": "The interface between psychiatry and law is complex and has the potential for gross misunderstanding. Each discipline has its own concerns with regard to the psychiatric patient, and there is a significant language gap between the two disciplines. The language of the medical discipline describes the patient's state on a continuum that ranges from extremely ill to completely healthy.

Patients with RSD have frequently undergone many unnecessary investigations such that the diagnosis and treatment may be considerably delayed. The pathophysiology remains unclear; however, a number of psychological problems were frequently suggested to play a role in this disorder. We describe a 13-year-old girl diagnosed as pediatric RSD who was admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatry unit with a history of severe pain in the right hand, increasing disability and symptoms of nervousness and withdrawal from social activities.

The clinic features of autism are variable; the autonomy degree, the speech quality, the mental retardation associated and specially the existence of an organic disease change its clinic expression. A good knowledge of the basic signs is important to put diagnosis. This work, propose to describe a clinic and a Para clinic profile of Tunisian population of children with autism. The study included 63 children referred to the child psychiatry department between January 1998 and September 2003 and diagnosed with autistic disorder according to DSMIV and ADI-R criteria. The population profile studied is drawn as following : The sex ratio was of 3/1, the average age was of 8 years+/-3 years. Parents were related in 39.3% of cases. On the clinical plan, 51.2% of children with autism studied did not have expressive speech. They presented a mental retardation associated in 60.8% of cases. Epilepsy was presented in 21 children out of 63. This profile links literature study except in 2 points: - The rate of relatives with autism (8.6%) is superior to the rate found in literature(3%). This result can be explained by the high rate of consanguinity in the Tunisian studied population (39.3%). - Importance of associated organic pathologies (mental retardation)."}, {"Title": "Approach to attention deficit disorder in adults.", "Abstract": "To review the etiology, diagnosis, and management of attention deficit disorder (ADD) in adults.\nPsycINFO, PubMed, and Psychiatry 24x7.com were searched.

Although ADD is a well established brain disorder, the diagnosis remains controversial. Attention deficit disorder has been called a fad, not a legitimate diagnosis, but it is a well established, well documented, medical condition that can cause much suffering if left untreated. At one time we thought children would outgrow ADD at puberty, but we now know that many will continue to have residual symptoms throughout adolescence and adulthood. If left untreated, ADD can interfere with relationships, employment, and self-esteem. Treatment with stimulants and adjunctive care is often effective.\nAttention deficit disorder in adults represents a substantial burden of illness.

The multidimensional treatment program implemented in the Department includes parent counselling, but not the whole family in a family therapy procedure. It has been demonstrated better outcome for patients who underwent family therapy in comparison to patients who underwent individual therapy.

In psychiatry, particularly, the insight has been considered close to the concept of disease consciouness and, consequently, the presence and the degree of intensity of insight have been put in relation with the adhesion to the treatments (the compliance) and the prognostic development of the mental disorders. With regard to the insight, through the analysis of several interpretative models, the authors emphasize how to draw the history of a possible passage of this concept from the side of individual psychopathology to the bi-personal side of therapeutic relationship, where the insight of the patient meets regarding its desease and that of the therapeutist regarding the objects of the treatment."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia should be renamed to help educate patients and the public.", "Abstract": "A new name for schizophrenia, reflecting a biopsychosocial conceptualization, may have utility in educating patients and the public.

The decision to use coercive measures, such as involuntary admission or detention, seclusion, mechanical or chemical restraint or involuntary treatment, is challenging for clinicians as they have to deal, not only with the patient and his or her parents who are in a disturbed emotional state, but also with some complex legal regulations. To protect the rights of patient and parents in these difficult situations and to prevent legal consequences for clinical personnel for unlawful acts, it is essential that staff be familiar with all concerned legal rules and procedures. Interdisciplinary co-operation between the involved professionals should be encouraged to ensure a standardised procedure according to legal specifications. A growing number of mental hospitals for children and adolescents have no special locked door units but open wards that can be locked when required. A placement of voluntarily and involuntarily committed patients in the same unit can cause problems if the freedom of voluntary patients is restraint due to the placement of an interned patient. Unlawful restraint must be avoided by a sufficient number of staff and clear proceeding guidelines."}, {"Title": "[Quality characteristics of freedom-restricting coercive measures in child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Putting into practice legal prescriptions of both children's rights and the personal freedom guaranteed by the German basic constitutional law requires a reflected and sensitive use of freedom-restricting coercive measures.

For statistics, a fully structured self-assessment form was applied some months after dismission, partly drawn up independently and partly containing items from the inventory for quality of life in children and adolescents (ILK). The initial psychological state was less favourable in patients who were admitted under constraint. However, both patient groups showed a comparable outcome. Positive effects of the patient information on their compliance and attitude towards the therapy were demonstrated, as well as a positive influence of the confidence in the therapeutic staff. Regarding the quality of life obtained at the end of treatment, the admission mode is apparently less important or is put into perspective by staff-patient-relations within the therapeutic relationship. On the other hand, the possibilities for participation and the patients' feeling to be taken seriously play a major role in improving compliance and, as a moderator variable, for therapeutic success as well. The results underline the importance of improving participation processes of hospitalized adolescent patients in psychiatry. This seems to be constitutive for a positive long-term treatment outcome."}, {"Title": "[A prospective analysis of coercive measures in an inpatient department of child and adolescent psychiatry].", "Abstract": "So far the discussion of coercive measures in the work with children and adolescents relies more on individual experiences than on empirical data. In the department of child and adolescent psychiatry \"Die Weissenau\" all coercive measures in the past six years have been evaluated prospectively. 178 patients (9.2 %) of 1939 patients totally admitted between 1999 and 2004 received coercive measures. For each measure there was a documentation of personal data, reason and duration of the coercive measure. The proportion of patients affected by coercive measures in this department was lower compared to other studies. Female patients were more often subject to coercive measures. Mostly coercive measures were used in the means of protection against self-directed aggressive behaviour. The average duration of coercive measures has been reduced after the implementation of a stringent documentation system and ensuing discussions of the topic. It can be concluded that a stringent documentation, an evaluation and reflection of coercive measures can help to assume quality in the process of coercive measures."}, {"Title": "[The first psychiatrists in Serbia].", "Abstract": "Founders of modern Serbian psychiatry came from the first psychiatric hospital named \"Home for the lost minded\" established at Guberevac, Belgrade, in 1861.

We could enumerate several representative instances: (1)application of the \"theory of mind\" to autistic or related disorders (-->\"reasoning of psychological state of others\"), (2) neuropsychological studies on the \"social brain\" concerning emotional recognition or social recognition (-->\"amygdale, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial ventral frontal cortex\"), (3) identifying related cerebral areas (-->\"superior temporal sulcus\") to detect eye or body movements of others, (4) discovering the mirror neuron and mirror systems in monkeys and humans (-->\"imitation of the behavior of others in the brain\"), and (5) intracerebral processes which may occur precedent to conscious intention (-->\"consciousness as post-hoc phenomena\"). These novel paradigms might lead us to the \"deconstruction\" of psychiatry. We believe that the fundamental assignments of neuropsychology should inquire into \"cognitive representation\", \"conscious representation\", and \"cerebral representation\" about the inner processes of human activities. As these assignments would be almost the same for the psychiatric symptoms, we do not have any necessity to fundamentally distinguish psychiatric and neuropsychologial symptoms. These two kinds of signs will be attributed finally to the same dimension. The specificity of psychiatry resides in \"conscious representation\" and its cerebral foundations. We reconsidered the \"Theory of Neural Group Selection\" proposed by Edelman and the excellent experimental results on the relationship between intention and movements reported by Libet, et al.. All these results strongly indicate the absolute necessity to reconsider conscious causality and psychogenesis. Finally, we have presented two main neuropsychological hypotheses on the manifestation mechanism of Capgras syndrome. These are the \"mirror impairment of prosopagnosia\" hypothesis and the \"self-other confusion resulting from right hemisphere dysfunction\" hypothesis. We insisted on the importance of the right cerebral predominance hypothesis about self-other understanding processes and also the absolute necessity to shake ourselves free from language dependent consciousness theory. Common specificity in neuropsychology and psychiatry should be converged to, and symbolized by the novel concept of sociality, which is characterized for instance by emotional cognition or social decision making supported by the social brain and by shared cerebral representations for self-other understanding and consciousness processes."}, {"Title": "[Studies of risk factors and preventive care for neuroleptic malignant syndrome].", "Abstract": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening complication of anti-psychotic treatment and can occur any time during the course of treatment. Since NMS can occur in any subject treated with anti-psychotic drugs, causing senously adverse side effects, prevention of NMS is one of the most important issues in clinical psychiatry. Although therapeutic guidelines for NMS have been proposed and gradually put in place, the pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Prevention of NMS consists of three approaches: removal of pathogenetic factors, understanding of initial symptoms and consideration of the administration of preventive drugs. Risk factors for NMS are inherited factors, individual factors and environmental factors. The overlapping of these factors might lead to fulminant NMS. These risk factors such as environmental factors are enumerated in DSM-IV. We meta-analyzed the case-control studies of the risk factors for NMS, because the evaluation of each risk factor has not been studied yet. The results were as follows: mental retardation, psychiatric manifestations such as agitation and excitement as individual factors. High dosage administration, rapid increase and parenteral administration of antipsychotic drugs are the drug factors.

As is customary in behavior analysis, the efficacy of these treatments has been established using direct-observation assessment methods. Although behavior-analytic treatments have enjoyed acceptance and integration into mainstream health care practices for tic disorders (e.g., psychiatry and neurology), the use of direct observation as a primary assessment tool has been neglected in favor of less objective methods. Hesitation to use direct observation appears to stem largely from concerns about the generalizability of clinic observations to other settings (e.g., home) and a lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate and feasible techniques for conducting and scoring direct observation. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate and establish a reliable, valid, and feasible direct-observation protocol capable of being transported to research and clinical settings. A total of 43 children with tic disorders, collected from two outpatient specialty clinics, were assessed using direct (videotape samples) and indirect (Yale Global Tic Severity Scale; YGTSS) methods. Videotaped observation samples were collected across 3 consecutive weeks and two different settings (clinic and home), were scored using both exact frequency counts and partial-interval coding, and were compared to data from a common indirect measure of tic severity (the YGTSS). In addition, various lengths of videotaped segments were scored to determine the optimal observation length. Results show that (a) clinic-based observations correspond well to home-based observations, (b) brief direct-observation segments scored with time-sampling methods reliably quantified tics, and (c) indirect methods did not consistently correspond with the direct methods."}, {"Title": "Use of treatment algorithms for depression.", "Abstract": "Depression continues to be a treatment challenge for many physicians-psychiatrists and primary care physicians alike-in part because of the nature of the disorder, but also because of the wide variety of medications and other treatments available, each with a distinct efficacy and safety profile.

This trial exposed a perverse system of the criminal use of medicine in the fields of public health and human research. These practices, in which racial hygiene constituted one of the fundamental principles and euthanasia programmes were the most obvious consequence, violated the majority of known bioethical principles. Psychiatry played a central role in these programmes, and the mentally ill were the principal victims. The aim of the present work is to review, from the historical perspective, the antecedents of the shameful euthanasia programmes for the mentally ill, the procedures involved in their implementation and the use of mentally ill people as research material. The Nuremberg Code, a direct consequence of the Doctors' Trial, is considered to be the first international code of ethics for research with human beings, and represented an attempt to prevent any repeat of the tragedy that occurred under Nazism. Nevertheless, the last 60 years have seen continued government-endorsed psychiatric abuse and illegitimate use of psychoactive drugs in countries such as the Soviet Union or China, and even in some with a long democratic tradition, such as the United States. Even today, the improper use of psychiatry on behalf of governments is seen to be occurring in numerous parts of the globe: religious repression in China, enforced hospitalization in Russia, administration of psychoactive drugs in immigrant detention centres in Australia, and the application of the death penalty by lethal injection and psychiatric participation in coercive interrogation at military prisons, in relation to the USA.

The overall goals were to propose a treatment framework that gives primacy to therapeutic outcomes and to provide a rationale for psychiatry to quantify and measure patient outcome.\nArticles proposing definitions for remission were identified using a MEDLINE search (1966-April 2005) of the English-language literature (key terms: remission, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia).\nOperationalizing and quantifying critical end points in psychiatric disorders may help sharpen the focus of therapeutic activity and benefit patient outcome. In the absence of a validated biomarker of psychiatric illness activity, symptomatic remission and functional restoration are the only available markers of wellness in psychiatry. There is an emerging consensus regarding a definition for remission in major depressive disorder; several working definitions for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders have been proposed. Developments in adult mood disorders-albeit incomplete-have been informative; managing psychiatric disorders that first appear in childhood (eg, ADHD) may also benefit by objectifying patient outcome.\nResearch is needed to determine the impact of applying a remission-focused model of illness management--emphasizing quantifiable, objective, and measurable end points--on overall patient outcomes."}, {"Title": "[A case of a gastric cancer patient who obtained good treatment in spite of a nontreatment decision].", "Abstract": "The patient was a 57-year-old male who had received schizophrenia and alcoholism treatments for ten years.

Urine NTP measurement was compared to the diagnostic categorization of the patients as probable or possible AD (according to National Institute of Neurological Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] criteria), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (according to Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [AAN] criteria) or definite non-AD. Clinical diagnoses were made without reference to UNTP measurement; the testing laboratory was blinded to both patient identity and clinical diagnoses.\nA total of 168 enrolled and consented patients provided qualifying urine samples and completed specialized diagnostic workups. There were 91.4% of subjects with probable AD, 37.7% of subjects categorized as possible AD, and 48.6% of subjects with MCI who had an elevated NTP measurement (>22 microg/mL). There were 90.7% of subjects diagnosed as definite non-AD who had a normal NTP measurement (< or =22 microg/mL).\nNoninvasive UNTP test results are potentially helpful as part of the workup of dementia for the nonspecialist to help in the decision as to whether referral and/or more detailed investigation is advisable."}, {"Title": "Beyond trauma-focused psychiatric epidemiology: bridging research and practice with war-affected populations.", "Abstract": "This article examines the centrality of trauma-focused psychiatric epidemiology (TFPE) in research with war-affected populations. The authors question the utility of the dominant focus on posttraumatic stress disorder and other disorders of Western psychiatry, and they identify a set of critical research foci related to mental health work with communities affected by political violence. Core assumptions of TFPE and its roots in logical positivism and the biomedical model of contemporary psychiatry are explored. The authors suggest that an alternative framework--social constructivism--can serve as a bridge between researchers and practitioners by helping to refocus research efforts in ways that are conceptually and methodologically more attuned to the needs of war-affected communities and those working to address their mental health needs."}, {"Title": "Costs of nine common mental disorders: implications for curative and preventive psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Mental disorders are highly prevalent and are associated with substantial disease burden, but their economic costs have been relatively less well researched. Moreover, few cost-of-illness studies used population-based psychiatric surveys for estimating direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs, and were able to do so for several well diagnosed mental disorders.\nTo calculate the cost of nine common mental disorders. The costs were calculated at individual level (per capita costs), and at population level per one million population for both prevalence (current cases) and incidence (new cases).\nData were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (Nemesis), a population-based psychiatric cohort study among 5,504 adults in the age bracket of 18-65 years. DSM-III-R disorders were assessed with help of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The costs of health service uptake, patients' out-of-pocket costs, and production losses were calculated for the reference year 2003. Robust regression methods, with 1,000 bootstrap replications, were used to estimate the excess costs of the distinct mental disorders and their 95% confidence intervals, while adjusting for physical illnesses and concurrent mental disorders in the regression equation.\nThe annual per capita excess costs of the mood disorders (5,009 euros) were higher than those of the anxiety disorders (3,587 euros) and alcohol-related disorders (1,431 euros). Being more prevalent, the excess costs of anxiety disorders are higher than those of mood disorders at population level. The annual influx of new cases (incidence) accounts for 39.2% of the costs at population level. It appeared that in the general population, in the productive age of 18-65 years, the bulk of the costs (85%) were related to production losses.\nThe study has some strengths and limitations. The data were derived from a large and representative population-based sample. Disorders were assessed with a reliable instrument. The costs were comprehensive in that they included direct medical, direct non-medical and indirect costs. The costs attributable to mental disorders were obtained with robust regression models while adjusting for the presence of somatic illnesses. For several reasons the costs figures must be seen as conservative lower bounds of the true costs. (i) People who were hospitalised were likely to be underrepresented in the sample, and it is well known that hospitalisation is one of the major cost drivers. (ii) Resource use was based on self-report, and this is likely to have resulted in underreporting. (iii) Work loss days were included in the analysis, but work cutback data were unavailable, while it is known that the costs due to work cutback can be substantial.\n(i) The costs of mental disorders are comparable to those of physical illnesses. This throws some light on the allocation of budgets for research and development in mental versus physical illnesses. (ii) At population level a substantial part of the costs are caused by new cases, and this is a strong argument for strengthening the role of preventive psychiatry in public health with the aim to reduce incidence and avoid the future costs. (iii) In particular, reducing the incidence of major depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia and dysthymia should be considered as public health priorities, because these disorders are associated with substantial disability, and have, in addition, important economic ramifications. (iv) The bulk of the costs are due to production losses; this makes employers pertinent stakeholders in mental health promotion, and thoughts should be given to the question how to involve them more actively in health promotion. (v) It is well to emphasise that adoption of the above mentioned policies will require that first more prevention trials and cost-effectiveness studies are conducted in the selected disorders."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of needs in early post-stroke rehabilitation in Poland].", "Abstract": "According to European Stroke Initiative (EUSI) recommendations every stroke patient should undergo rehabilitation. We aimed to evaluate the needs of comprehensive stroke in-patient rehabilitation in Poland.\nWe designed and distributed a questionnaire evaluating rehabilitation departments in Poland, where stroke patients undergo early rehabilitation. Comprehensive rehabilitation was defined as: kinesitherapy (minimum 60 minutes/day), speech therapy (minimum 30 minutes 5 days a week), rehabilitation of other cognitive impairments and group kinesitherapy. We separated rehabilitation departments where comprehensive post-stroke rehabilitation is conducted, and calculated the number of beds in these departments only for stroke patients. We estimated the number of acute stroke patients in Poland. We evaluated the number of patients requiring in-patient rehabilitation based on results from the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, where all stroke patients who need in-patient rehabilitation have such a possibility. We estimated the number of beds required in rehabilitation departments for stroke patients in Poland.\nWe obtained responses from 115 out of 172 (66.9%) rehabilitation departments. Comprehensive post-stroke rehabilitation is conducted in 11 departments. 159 beds in these departments are for stroke patients. From 64,896 acute stroke patients 9,927 will need in-patient rehabilitation. We need 604 more beds in rehabilitation departments for stroke patients in Poland.\nOnly 10% of rehabilitation departments could provide comprehensive stroke rehabilitation in Poland. At present, the number of beds in rehabilitation departments for stroke patients covers about 20.8% of actual needs. An increased number of rehabilitation beds for stroke patients could result in a decreased number of disabled post-stroke patients."}, {"Title": "Blood transfusion in Europe: basic principles for initial and continuous training in transfusion medicine: an approach to an European harmonisation.", "Abstract": "Over the past few decades, transfusion medicine and haemotherapy have evolved into complex medical disciplines comprising a broad field of subspecialties such as immunohaematology, blood component production, haemapheresis and haemostaseology. Transfusion medicine is thus an important qualification at the interfaces of analytical laboratory medicine, pharmaceutical production and clinical disciplines such as internal medicine, anaesthesiology or surgery. Physicians specialising in transfusion medicine are valuable and competent partners for these related disciplines when it comes to safe, effective and tailored haemotherapy. Why has transfusion medicine become so complex? On the one hand, one can discern problems such as infectious diseases like the HIV disaster in the past century, resulting in guidelines, directives and laws such as the transfusion law in Germany. Thereby, we now enjoy the highest level of blood product safety ever regarding viral transmission thanks to the broad implementation of PCR testing. On the other hand, there are numerous positive reasons for the increasing complexity of transfusion medicine: Modern medical therapies like stem cell transplantation, cellular therapy, transplantation of solid organs, regenerative medicine and surgery cannot exist without a safe supply of blood products and high quality standard as well as special blood products and laboratory services provided by blood banks and transfusion medicine specialists. Good laboratory practice (GLP), good manufacturing practice (GMP), quality management systems and quality control on the pharmaceutical manufacturer's level are only few examples of the standards in today's blood banking. European directives in the field of blood products, stem cell preparations and tissue have led to higher uniform quality standards for biological preparations in a unified Europe, which is the desired outcome, but which also increases the complexity of this field. In contrast, directives 93/16/EEC and 2001/19/EC, the directives of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications of European doctors currently in force, as well as the impending directive 2005/36/EC, which has to be translated into national law until October 2007, do not include transfusion medicine, blood transfusion or immunohaematology at all. Other medical specialities, which like our field, are not common to all member states of the European Union, are listed in the above mentioned directives with the minimum length of training and minimal requirements for the qualifications. Examples include clinical biology, biological haematology, microbiology-bacteriology, biological chemistry, immunology, thoracic, paediatric or vascular surgery as well as physiotherapy, stomatology, neuro-psychiatry, dermato-venerology, occupational medicine, allergology, geriatrics, gastro-enterological surgery, community medicine, nuclear medicine, pharmacology, accident and emergency medicine or tropical medicine. Most of the above are medical specialities in some member states, but not in all. A concerted initiative inaugurated by the European Network of Transfusion Medicine Societies (EuroNet-TMS) and the European Blood Alliance (EBA) aims to compile the situation of the transfusion medicine speciality throughout Europe. A preliminary summary of the current situation in 15 European states was prepared in 2005 after a first set of questions, which was sent out by us via the EBA platform. The authors appreciate Clair Watts' compilation of the answers provided by the 15 European colleagues. A summary of these answers is depicted in Table 1. However, the initiative aims at a more complex analysis of the different requirements and constituent parts of the qualification in transfusion medicine in different countries. A long-term objective of this initiative might be to introduce the transfusion medicine specialisation into the above mentioned EC directives in order to facilitate mutual recognition of transfusion medicine qualifications throughout Europe."}, {"Title": "A cross-sectional study of the prevalence of cognitive and physical symptoms during long-term antidepressant treatment.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant therapies have been associated with a variety of side effects of both physical and psychological nature. Until recently, however, the majority of the studies focusing on side effects of antidepressants have not routinely included assessment of cognitive side effects. The purpose of the present work is to examine cross-sectionally the prevalence of cognitive and physical side effects of antidepressants during long-term treatment of depression.\nPatients at least 18 years of age who were deemed responders to antidepressant therapy following at least 3 months of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) (diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria) and whose MDD was considered to be in partial or full remission were eligible for inclusion in this study. Eligible patients were enrolled between January 2003 and December 2004. Study participants were administered the Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National Depression Screening Day (HANDS) scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ), and a study-specific questionnaire inquiring about the emergence of specific side effects such as apathy, fatigue, and inattentiveness.\n117 MDD patients (mean +/- SD age: 43.4 +/- 12.6 years; women: N = 78 [66.7%]) met criteria for response according to the HANDS (score < 9). Cognitive symptoms (apathy, inattentiveness, forgetfulness, word-finding difficulty, and mental slowing) were each reported on both the CPFQ and the study-specific questionnaire by more than 30% of the responders on antidepressants. The physical symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness/sedation were reported by over 40% of the responders on both the CPFQ and the study-specific questionnaire. A significant, positive relationship was found between the CPFQ and the severity of residual depressive symptoms as measured by the HANDS total score (F = 15.3, p = .0002).\nPhysical and cognitive symptoms are frequently reported by MDD patients who have responded to antidepressants and are treated in the long term with these agents. It is likely that these symptoms are both side effects of the antidepressants as well as residual symptoms of MDD."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of therapeutics in psychiatry: clinical trials and evaluation of psychotherapies].", "Abstract": "Clinical trial methodology is well established in the field of somatic disorders, but what about psychiatric treatments?

It is postulated that cognitive dysfunction is caused by an alcohol-induced region-selective brain damage, particularly to the prefrontal region, and grey and white matter may be affected differently. We used a proteomics-based approach to compare protein expression profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9 (BA9)) from human alcoholic and healthy control brains. Changes in the relative expression of 110 protein 'spots' were identified in the BA9 grey matter, of which 54 were identified as 44 different proteins. In our recent article, 60 protein spots were differentially expressed in the BA9 white matter and 18 of these were identified (Alexander-Kaufman, K., James, G., Sheedy, D., Harper, C., Matsumoto, I., Mol.

Thiamine-dependent enzymes transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1\u03b2 ubunit) were among the proteins identified. To our knowledge, this is the first time a disruption in thiamine-dependent enzymes has been demonstrated in the brains of 'neurologically uncomplicated' alcoholics. By identifying protein expression changes in prefrontal grey and white matter separately, hypotheses may draw upon more mechanistic explanations as to how alcoholism causes the structural alterations associated with alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Omega-3 fatty acids: evidence basis for treatment and future research in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To determine if the available data support the use of omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFA) for clinical use in the prevention and/or treatment of psychiatric disorders.\nThe authors of this article were invited participants in the Omega-3 Fatty Acids Subcommittee, assembled by the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments of the American Psychiatric Association (APA).\nPublished literature and data presented at scientific meetings were reviewed. Specific disorders reviewed included major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, dementia, borderline personality disorder and impulsivity, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Meta-analyses were conducted in major depressive and bipolar disorders and schizophrenia, as sufficient data were available to conduct such analyses in these areas of interest.\nThe subcommittee prepared the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by the following APA committees: the Committee on Research on Psychiatric Treatments, the Council on Research, and the Joint Reference Committee.\nThe preponderance of epidemiologic and tissue compositional studies supports a protective effect of omega-3 EFA intake, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in mood disorders. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials demonstrate a statistically significant benefit in unipolar and bipolar depression (p = .02). The results were highly heterogeneous, indicating that it is important to examine the characteristics of each individual study to note the differences in design and execution. There is less evidence of benefit in schizophrenia. EPA and DHA appear to have negligible risks and some potential benefit in major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, but results remain inconclusive in most areas of interest in psychiatry. Treatment recommendations and directions for future research are described. Health benefits of omega-3 EFA may be especially important in patients with psychiatric disorders, due to high prevalence rates of smoking and obesity and the metabolic side effects of some psychotropic medications."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and psychology in medieval Persia.", "Abstract": "The history of psychological sciences and especially the ways in which related disorders were treated in medieval Persia are not well known in the West.

Data for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, the Internet, references from relevant articles and books, the Astan-e-Ghods Razavi Library, the Tehran University Library, the Mashhad University Library, and the files of the authors. Search terms included psychiatry, psychology, Persian, medieval, Avicenna, and pharmacotherapy.\nThe medieval practitioners defined various signs and symptoms, apparent causes, and hygienic and dietary rules for prevention of these disorders. Medieval Persian medical writings encouraged the treatment of psychological disorders by tackling the conditions that cause or contribute to the disorder and through the use of electrical-shock therapy, phlebotomy, psychotherapy, music and color therapy, and especially prescription of long lists of medicaments.\nSome of the approaches of doctors in medieval Persia are accepted today, although most remain largely unexamined.

Given the ubiquity of this type of behavior in the repertoires of human beings and its complete absence in those of non-humans, the argument is made that animal models of human disorders, in which disturbances of conventional behaviors constitute defining features, are not sufficiently analogous to these conditions in humans to be pursued with good result. Because conventional behavior of the linguistic type is ubiquitous in the repertoires of normally developed human adults, it is suggested that the behavior of pre-verbal infants and/or non-verbal persons is preferable to that of adults as the phenomenal source for the construction of animal models of human psychological events. The observation and measurement of psychological events is held to be complicated by a number of their characteristics, including their complexity by virtue of whole organism participation, their essential complementarily with stimulus events, and the corrigibility of both form and function over their repeated occurrences, among others.

The patterns of regular prescriptions for benzodiazepines were compared among the clinical departments (i.e., Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, and Others). A logistic regression model was used to assess the effects of patient gender and age, and the clinic visited on the issuing of regular prescriptions for benzodiazepines.\nRegular benzodiazepine users were 3,204 (14.5%). Benzodiazepines were more likely to be prescribed for women (61.3%) than for men and were prescribed most often by psychiatrists (31.7%), followed by internists (20.1%). Multivairate logistic regression model showed that being female and elderly, and being prescribed by a psychiatrist were significantly associated with regular benzodiazepine prescriptions. With regard to the pharmacological half-life, internists were more likely to prescribe short half-life benzodiazepines than were psychiatrists (p < 0.001).\nA large number of outpatients at a Japanese university hospital appeared to be maintained on a regular supply of benzodiazepine drugs.

Three quarter of the patients become seizure free, however the remaining patients experience seizures after resection. In our study we analyzed retrospectively the possible electro-clinical, neuroimaging and surgery-related outcome predictors in 94 adult patients who had anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) from the material of Epilepsy Centre of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Budapest since the beginning of the surgery program in 1989 until 2001. Three outcome endpoints were chosen: the seizure status at the last visit, the longest seizure free period and the time to the first non-acute postoperative seizure. The predictors were assessed by multivariate and Cox regression methods. After one year of surgery 72% of the patients were seizure free, after two years 67% and after five years 59%. Factors predicting favorable outcome in TLE surgery were: typical temporomesial aura, strictly unilateral interictal anterotemporal spikes, unilateral ictal onset, slow contralateral propagation, hippocampal sclerosis (HS) as etiology. Factors predicting poor outcome in TLE surgery were: increase in seizure frequency in the last two preoperative years, presence of preoperative psychiatric disturbances, ictal contralateral propagation, MRI lesion distant from the surgery site, incongruency of data of preoperative investigations, postoperative sequels and non-HS type MR residuum."}, {"Title": "Mental health model of care programmes after the tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia.", "Abstract": "Before the tsunami, there was no systematic training provided for General Practitioners (GPs) and nurses in issues related to mental health and psychosocial support in times of disasters.

The clinical epidemiology of bipolar I disorder.", "Abstract": "The last few decades have seen a rapid change in our understanding of the epidemiology of bipolar disorder, which has only recently started to achieve major research attention. This article reviews recent developments. In addition to electronic searches using MEDLINE and PsycLIT, references from articles were identified, major journals hand searched, and major textbooks of psychiatry and epidemiology reviewed. Studies may have overestimated the prevalence of mania, and underestimated incidence. The incidence of mania may be increasing in recent generations, but the data remain inconclusive. Age at onset of mania is earlier than previously believed, and there are gender differences in epidemiology and clinical course. Ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical course of bipolar disorder are highlighted. Comorbid alcohol and substance abuse are common in patients suffering from bipolar disorder and are associated with a more severe clinical course and a worse outcome.

Animal models provide the opportunity to decipher the relationships between the nervous system and behavior and they are an obligatory step for drug tests. Mouse models or rat models to a lesser extent could help to test for the implication of a gene using gene targeting or transfecting technologies. One of the main problem for the development of animal models is to define a marker of the psychiatric disorder. Several markers have been suggested for schizophrenia and autism, but for the moment no markers or etiopathogenic mechanisms have been identified for these disorders. We examined here animal models related to schizophrenia and autism and discussed their validity and limitations after first defining these two disorders and considering their similarities and differences. Animal models reviewed in this article test mainly behavioral dimensions or biological mechanisms related to autistic disorder or schizophrenia rather than providing specific categorical models of autism or schizophrenia. Furthermore, most of these studies focus on a behavioral dimension associated with an underlying biological mechanism, which does not correspond to the complexity of mental disorders. It could be useful to develop animal models relevant to schizophrenia or autism to test a behavioral profile associated with a biological profile. A multi-trait approach seems necessary to better understand multidimensional disorders such as schizophrenia and autism and their biological and clinical heterogeneity. Finally, animal models can help us to clarify complex mechanisms and to study relationships between biological and behavioral variables and their interactions with environmental factors. The main interest of animal models is to generate new pertinent hypotheses relevant to humans opening the path to innovative research."}, {"Title": "The Barents project in psychiatry: a systematic comparative mental health services study between Northern Norway and Archangelsk County.", "Abstract": "There is virtually no readily accessible systematically recorded evidence on how the organization of mental health services in Europe's largest country, Russia, may differ from other national systems.

These include principles derived from the Enlightenment concerning the dignity of the individual and the value of careful observation. During the 20th century, however, American psychiatry began to diverge, initially due to a much stronger emphasis on psychoanalytic principles, particularly in comparison with Great Britain. By the 1960s and 1970s, studies such as the US-UK study and the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia demonstrated that the psychodynamic emphasis had gone too far, leading to diagnostic imprecision and inadequate evaluation of traditional evaluations of signs and symptoms of psychopathology. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition (DSM-III) was developed in this context, under the leadership of representatives from institutions that had retained the more traditional British-European approaches (eg, Washington University, Iowa). The goal of DSM-III was to create a comprehensive system for diagnosing and evaluating psychiatric patients that would be more reliable, more valid, and more consistent with international approaches. This goal was realized in many respects, but unfortunately it also had many unintended consequences. Although the original creators realized that DSM represented a \"best effort\" rather than a definitive \"ground truth,\" DSM began to be given total authority in training programs and health care delivery systems. Since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, there has been a steady decline in the teaching of careful clinical evaluation that is targeted to the individual person's problems and social context and that is enriched by a good general knowledge of psychopathology. Students are taught to memorize DSM rather than to learn complexities from the great psychopathologists of the past. By 2005, the decline has become so severe that it could be referred to as \"the death of phenomenology in the United States.\""}, {"Title": "Recommendations for best practices in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in managed care.", "Abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are increasingly recognized as important causes of impaired cognition, function, and quality of life, as well as excess medical care utilization and costs in the elderly Medicare managed care population. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for ADRDs were published in 2001. More recent studies have resulted in the approval of new agents and demonstrated an expanded role for antidementia therapy in various types of dementia, settings of care, stages of disease, and the use of combination therapy. However, these clinical guidelines have not been updated in the past few years.\nThe goal of this article was to provide practical recommendations developed by a panel of experts that address issues of early diagnosis, treatment, and care management of ADRDs. The panel also addressed the societal and managed care implications.\nA panel of leading experts was convened to develop consensus recommendations for the treatment and management of dementia based on currently available evidence and the panel's informed expert opinion. The panel comprised 12 leading experts, including clinical investigators and practitioners in geriatric medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and psychology; managed care medical and pharmacy directors; a health systems medical director; and a health policy expert. In addition, articles were collected based on PubMed searches (2000-2005) that were relevant to the key issues identified. Search terms included Alzheimer's disease, dementia, clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, screening and assessment, and managed care.\nADRDs represent a significant clinical and economic burden to individuals and society, including Medicare managed care organizations (MCOs). Appropriate utilization of antidementia therapy and care management is vitally important to achieving quality of life and care for dementia patients and their caregivers, and for managing the excess costs of Alzheimer's disease. The recommendations address relevant, practical, and timely concerns that are faced on a daily basis by practitioners and by Medicare MCO medical management programs in the care of dementia patients. These consensus recommendations attempt to describe a reasonable current standard for the provision of quality care for patients with dementia. The panel recommendations support the use of screening for cognitive impairment and the use of antidementia therapy for ADRDs in different stages of disease and types of dementia in all clinical settings. The panel members evaluated the use of the 3 marketed cholinesterase inhibitors-donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine-as well as the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist memantine. Recommendations for using these medications are made with an appreciation of the difficulties in translating the results from investigational clinical trials into clinical practice.\nThe recommendations of the expert panel represent a clear consensus that nihilism in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of ADRDs is unwarranted, impairs quality of care, and is ultimately not costeffective."}, {"Title": "Association between amygdala volume and anxiety level: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in autistic children.", "Abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate brain-behavior relationships between amygdala volume and anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist in a well-characterized population of autistic children. Volumes for the amygdala, hippocampus, and whole brain were obtained from three-dimensional magnetic resonance images (MRIs) captured from 42 children who met the criteria for autistic disorder. Anxious/depressed symptoms were assessed in these children by the Anxious/Depressed subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist. To investigate the association between anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist and amygdala volume, data were analyzed using linear regression methods with Pearson correlation coefficients. A multivariate model was used to adjust for potential covariates associated with amygdala volume, including age at MRI and total brain size. We found that anxious/depressed symptoms were significantly correlated with increased total amygdala volume (r = .386, P = .012) and right amygdala volume (r = .469, P = .002). The correlation between anxious/depressed symptoms and left amygdala volume did not reach statistical significance (r = .249, P = .112). Child Behavior Checklist anxious/depressed scores were found to be a significant predictor of amygdala total (P = .014) and right amygdala (P = .002) volumes. In conclusion, we have identified a significant brain-behavior relationship between amygdala volume and anxious/depressed scores on the Child Behavior Checklist in our autistic cohort. This specific relationship has not been reported in autism. However, the existing literature on human psychiatry and behavior supports our reported evidence for a neurobiologic relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression with amygdala structure and function. Our results highlight the importance of characterizing comorbid psychiatric symptomatology in autism. The abundance of inconsistent findings in the published literature on autism might reflect differences between study populations regarding age at MRI, level of impairment within autistic subjects, and underlying anxiety level in the selected study groups."}, {"Title": "A sociodemographic, phenomenological, and long-term follow-up study of patients with body dysmorphic disorder in Brazil.", "Abstract": "The main characteristic of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance in a normal-appearing person or an excessive preoccupation with appearance in a person with a small physical defect.

We used the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS), which provides a system for differentially recording the patient's compliance and coping potential (total score for the TERS items 3-10). Following standardization using the basic psychooncological documentation (PO-BADO), the demographic variables were recorded. We also identified the internal processes which each patient used to deal with the disease using criteria established by K\u00fcbler-Ross as well as the phases of cancer experience according to Fawzy.\nTwenty-three variables were checked for their relationship to the coping and compliance potential. For 13 of these, the Mann-Whitney U-test or Spearmann-Rank correlation calculated exceeded the required Bonferroni-adjusted significance level. The calculation of an ordinal regression model containing these significant single variables showed that the following variables are associated with a lower compliance and coping potential according to their estimate (Beta-value): aggression as the dominant form of dealing internally with cancer (K\u00fcbler-Ross), pre-existing DSM IV Axis 1 psychiatric disorders, carcinoma-induced psychiatric disorders, necessity of treatment with neuroleptics and male gender. Acceptance as the dominant form of dealing internally with cancer (K\u00fcbler-Ross) is strongly associated with a higher compliance and coping potential.\nThe results show that the compliance and coping potential of oncological in-patients can be comprehensively described by the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale.

Yet in the 1930s it was the most widely used of the major somatic treatment innovations in Britain's public mental hospitals, where its relative simplicity and safety gave it preference over the elaborate and hazardous insulin coma procedure. Devised on a dubious hypothesis of biological antagonism, Cardiazol armed psychiatry with an immediately effective weapon in the battle against schizophrenia, an enduring and debilitating condition responsible for over half of the mental hospital population. What made Cardiazol work - or appear to work? This account shows how evaluation of convulsive therapy was skewed by naive outcome measurement and diagnostic discrepancies, and how its therapeutic indication evolved from schizophrenia to affective disorders. Psychological mechanisms are considered, with the suggestion that the intense fear experienced during treatment--the major reason for abandoning Cardiazol in favour of electroshock--was therapeutically advantageous."}, {"Title": "Music, madness and the body: symptom and cure.", "Abstract": "Building on Sander L.

Foucault, a 'historical philosopher' concerned with power relations, would have answered this question in the affirmative. Possibly, however, the psychiatrist's sovereign power is weaker than it was a century ago because some of the psychiatrist's tasks have been re-allocated. Some have been assigned to the growing number of specialist groups in the mental health service, others have been put in the hands of 'health managers' who form part of our country's growing bureaucracy and put a financial and economic burden on our health service. Nevertheless, the procedural power of psychiatrist has not been weakened; psychiatrists are able to deprive patients of their freedom, pronounce them unfit for work and reduce punishments and sentences for serious crime on the grounds of diminished responsibility. This procedural power is accentuated by the increasing influence of psychology in society. The power of psychiatric knowledge has shifted from an archaic to a demonstrative discourse about truth which is rooted in evidence-based medicine and which enhances the power of psychiatrists still further. This may also mean that the 19th century concept of hysteria is perpetuated in psychiatric practice in all kinds of modern clinical forms."}, {"Title": "[From ontological compartimentalisation to ontological complexity].", "Abstract": "Discussions about the foundations of psychiatry show repetitive traits.

On the one hand Kandel uses formulations that are compatible with (classical) psychophysical identity theories; on the other hand he expresses views that actually have more in common with non-eliminative physicalism (or epiphenomenalism). In addition, he weakens his position by using misleading metaphors an analogies. This can lead to what is known as the 'mereological fallacy'. The final part of the article examines what this ambiguity tells us about Kandel's views on psychotherapy and the social justification for psychiatry. Kandel's approach can lead to a pointless narrowing down of the psychiatrist's normative role and to an over-restrictive attitude to psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "[The psychopathology of Karl Jaspers: then and now].", "Abstract": "The book entitled 'Allgemeine Psychopathologie' by the German psychiatrist-philosopher Karl Jaspers, first published in 1913, has had a lasting influence on the way in which psychiatry defines subjective psychiatric symptoms--phenomena. His psychopathology of meaningful connections, however, which purports to provide an empathic 'understanding' of the causes of mental disorders, is more controversial, particularly now that neurobiology claims it can explain all material causes. This article presents an enthusiastic summary of Jaspers' original work and culminates with a plea for a re-appraisal and revaluation of Jaspers phenomenology and methodological dualism.

In common with many writers then and now, he believed that the evolutionary past is conserved in the mind and the brain. Today the \"evolutionary Freud\" is nearly forgotten. Even among Freudians, he is regarded to be a red herring, relevant only to the extent that he diverts attention from the enduring achievements of the authentic Freud. There are three ways to explain these attitudes. First, the evolutionary Freud's key work is the \"Overview of the Transference Neurosis\" (1915). But it was published at an inopportune moment, forty years after the author's death, during the so-called \"Freud wars.\" Second, Freud eventually lost interest in the \"Overview\" and the prospect of a comprehensive evolutionary theory of psychopathology. The publication of The Ego and the Id (1923), introducing Freud's structural theory of the psyche, marked the point of no return. Finally, Freud's evolutionary theory is simply not credible. It is based on just-so stories and a thoroughly discredited evolutionary mechanism, Lamarckian use-inheritance. Explanations one and two are probably correct but also uninteresting. Explanation number three assumes that there is a fundamental difference between Freud's evolutionary narratives (not credible) and the evolutionary accounts of psychopathology that currently circulate in psychiatry and mainstream journals (credible).

Healers and physicians had access to this aspect of their patient's lives, were expected to use it constructively, and often did so. The contemporary biomedical theory of disease no longer assigns to illness such metaphysical connotations. While general physicians are permitted - perhaps even advised - to avoid involvement in morally laden dialogues tied to illness and the self, such dilemmas are more prominent and qualitatively different in psychiatry, as psychiatric conditions often entail changes in self-conception, psychological disaffection, unacceptable behavior, and untoward personal reactions to social circumstances. Manifestations of psychiatric conditions can overwhelm an individual's control in areas of cognition, emotion, autonomy, social responsibility, behavior, and body functions - exactly those matters that \"modern\" individualistic minds are supposed to master. Consequently, psychiatric conditions challenge basic presuppositions of the modern, secular credo about personhood, disease, and behavior. They comprise a species of human problems ontologically distinct from the conditions handled by other medical disciplines."}, {"Title": "Modeling sensitization to stimulants in humans: an [11C]raclopride/positron emission tomography study in healthy men.", "Abstract": "In animals, repeated exposure to stimulant drugs leads to an enhanced drug-induced psychomotor response and increased dopamine release.

Consistent with a sensitization-like phenomenon, 14 and 365 days after the third dose of amphetamine there was a greater psychomotor response and increased dopamine release (a greater reduction in [11C]raclopride binding), relative to the initial dose, in the ventral striatum, progressively extending to the dorsal caudate and putamen.

This study explored whether residing in single- versus multiple-bed rooms in a psychiatric ward was associated with psychiatric patients' opinions about seclusion. More specifically, it was studied whether patients who had shared a room with other patients prior to seclusion rated seclusion more favorably. It was thought that they would rate seclusion more favorably due to the lack of rest they previously experienced in their regular room.

A significant association was found between residing in multiple-bed rooms prior to seclusion and a less negative view on seclusion. This finding suggests that the ward environment may have a rather large impact on how seclusion is perceived.

The paper will at first analyse the discourse on \"Querulantenwahnsinn\". In a second step the \"patient's view\" (Porter) on that social and psychiatric phenomenon will be constructed on the basis of medical records of the Landesheilanstalt Marburg (asylum). The inquiry of patient's experience demands a reflection of the fact that the clinical picture of \"Querulantenwahnsinn\" was very plausible. It had been created by psychiatrists as a reaction to the critiques on asylum psychiatry. Every attempt to question the pathologisation of a critical position on asylum psychiatry, every resistance results in a consolidation of the psychiatric diagnosis. Consequently the pathologisation, the confinement into an asylum influenced the auto-perception of the patients--so they possibly enroled in the discourse on \"Querulantenwahnsinn\" against their explicit will. The paper points out that the discourse on \"Querulantenwahnsinn\" is an expression of social conflicts and the legal culture in the Wilhelmine society."}, {"Title": "[\"Keine Angst vor Psychiatern.\" Psychiatry, critics of psychiatry and the public in the Federal Republic of Germany 1960-1980].", "Abstract": "Whenever psychiatry became object of public interest it was object of criticism. Since psychiatry has been established as a medical discipline in the beginning of the 19th century, the diagnostic, therapeutic and juridical practices have been subjected to fundamental attacks. Conversely psychiatrists periodically complained about misconception in the public and press of the mentally ill, their medical treatment and the psychiatrists themselves. In their opinion the general public ignored psychiatric information and, therefore, impeded any innovation. Medical knowledge, however, appeared as a sustained means to overcome the \"latent terror of colloquial language\" and to improve the social status of the mentally ill. The text focuses on the discussion among West-German social-psychiatrists from 1960 to 1980 and the conception of the public as revealed in their statements. Using Thomas Gieryn's concept of professional \"boundary work\" it looks more closely at two controversies which attracted public as well as professional attention (and caused their irritation) in the 1970s, i.e. Frank Fischers's book \"Irrenh\u00e4user.

The so-called \"crisis of psychiatry\" concerned two subjects, the professionals' behaviour towards the patients and the legal procedure of hospitalisation. The most important events were the Hollywood-film The Snake Pit, several reports about asylums in the media and especially the trial against Martin-Heinrich Corten. The debates and the solutions developed at that time focused on legal aspects; the deeper reasons for the bad state of the asylums were not discussed. Besides psychiatrists refused the criticism, so that the \"crisis of psychiatry\" did not induce any structural changes."}, {"Title": "[Labour, silence and order: visualizing modern psychiatry--strategies for legitimizing Swiss asylum psychiatry in the context of occupational therapy in the interwar period].", "Abstract": "In the 1930s Swiss psychiatrists were engaged in a singular public campaign to promote a new image of their profession. The result of this campaign was a series of booklets about psychiatric institutions. These asylum-monographs, as they were called, encompassed a large number of photographic illustrations, most of which showed patients at work. Taking the visual omnipresence of patients' work in the asylum-monographs as a starting point, this contribution examines the status of occupational therapy in psychiatric discourse and practice in Switzerland at the beginning of the 1930s. The first part of the contribution describes and outlines the development of patients' work in several psychiatric institutions after World War I. Then it turns to the discussion about the introduction of a new and more active form of occupational therapy (\"aktivere Therapie\") in this period. The second part of the contribution analyzes the meanings of therapeutic work in psychiatric discourse. It shows that the enthusiasm occupational therapy produced among Swiss psychiatrists was mainly due to its ability to change the visual appearance of the asylums. Furthermore it points to several traits of Eugen Bleuler's concept of schizophrenia, especially the assumption of different ranks of primary and secondary symptoms and the notion of autism, which were both crucial to the contemporary understanding and handling of occupational therapy. Finally, it argues that a medical interpretation of patients' work, which identified therapy with working discipline, was a necessary precondition for the omnipresence of patients' work in Swiss psychiatry's public campaign in the 1930s."}, {"Title": "[\"Zerqu\u00e4lte Ergebnisse einer Dichterseele\"--literary critiques on psychiatry around 1900].", "Abstract": "In the last decade of the 19th century dozens of \"mad\" people from the respectable bourgoisie went public with most stigmatizing details of their private lives. The authors told about healthy people branded as insane, and incarcerated in insane asylums. They took their cases to the \"court of public opinion\". These stories became the stuff of public scandals and also the basis of an organized \"lunatics' rights\" movement, which was a protest movement against the power and competency of psychiatric expertise. Inspired by this movement some authors and playwriters took up the criticism towards psychiatry and wrote novels and stage plays in which they told frightening and desparate stories of restrained people who had to suffer from arbitrary decisions of psychiatrists. The paper deals with three novels and stage plays written between 1908 and 1917 by Heinrich Mann, Frederik van Eeden, and Waldemar M\u00fcller-Eberhart. It analyses the gloomy picture of the asylum and the practice and attitudes of the asylum doctors painted by the three authors. I argue that the narratives had an impact on the public as well as the professional discourse on the problem of psychiatric arbitrariness, and that the authors not only conveyed citicism but also pointed out a concept of a humaine interaction between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" people."}, {"Title": "[The \"case H\u00e4gi\" at the Burgh\u00f6lzli in Zurich: the reaction of psychiatry and the authorities to criticism concerning state-run asylums].", "Abstract": "In 1894 Gottlieb H\u00e4gi, a former guard at the mental institution Burgh\u00f6lzli in Zurich, published a brochure in which he heavily critizised the conditions in the asylum, its management, the board of supervision and the responsible authorities. This report attracted great public notice and led to an extended investigation. With the example of the \"case H\u00e4gi\", the present work analyzes the position of critics and defendors of mental institutions and studies the roles played by the government and the authorities in this area of conflict. Beyond this particular debate, the reaction of government and authorities at critics of the psychiatry of mental institutions after the \"case H\u00e4gi\" is investigated by an analysis of the complaints procedures against the psychiatric institutions of the canton Zurich which were initiated between 1870 and 1970. It is concluded that in complaint procedures a tight connection existed between authorities and psychiatry. In case of conflicts, the mental institutions could count on the support of the government and this played an important role for legitimating psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The psychiatric criticism of social prejudices as a medical strategy of legitimation].", "Abstract": "The subject of this article is the relation between psychiatric knowledge and social prejudice. This will be observed from the perspective of the medical discourse and the perspective of the history of science in a case study on epilepsy. In context of an increasing democratization of science and society a discussion on the social discrimination of epileptic patients entered the medical discourse in the 1960s and 70s. In the medical discourse the cause for discrimination is ascribed to emotionally determined prejudices found in the population, that are to be countered by educating the population with scientific knowledge. From the perspective of the history of science it however becomes apparent, that the prejudices found in the population are a result of a popularization of psychiatric knowledge beginning in the end of the 19th and reaching well into the 20th century. Thus, it is science and not the population that is the source of these so called prejudices. In the closing remarks these findings are discussed as different 'discourse' strategies for the legitimation of psychiatry and psychiatric objects."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatrists criticising psychiatry: the asylum director Gustav Kolb (1870-1938) and his struggle for social reforms and professional aims].", "Abstract": "Against a background of public criticism of institutional psychiatry, which had been growing since around 1900, the director of the institute in Erlangen, Gustav Kolb, devised and set up what was known as \"open care\", with the intention of reforming clinical psychiatric care. This led to the creation of a new type of outpatient care clinic, which became a defining characteristic of public mental health care during the time of the Weimar Republic. A closer examination of it as a concept and in practice shows, however, that Kolb was primarily pursuing aims related to the politics of the profession, for with \"open care\", he considerably extended the area of competence of institutional psychiatry. He also sought to improve the professional situation of institutional psychiatrists, which was constantly being complained about by members of the profession at the time, by creating the position of \"care doctor\" and with it a new career perspective for doctors at institutions. Kolb's model of \"open care\" can thus be interpreted as being the professionalisation strategy of a member of the psychiatric profession during the Weimar Republic."}, {"Title": "[Associative disorder. On the relationship between the interpretation of disorder and society in the early writings of Eugen Bleuler].", "Abstract": "Around 1900 the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler developed a new interpretative model of mental illnesses: schizophrenia. He named the breaking of associative threads of thought as the core symptom of the disorder. Shortly after the publication of his \"Dementia Praecox or the Groups of Schizophrenias\" in 1911, the concept quickly gained popularity outside the discipline of psychiatry. His contempories noticed early on the peculiar relationship that existed between the crisis diagnosed as schizophrenia and the broader societal \"crisis of modernity\" around 1900.

Psychiatry became one of the leading disciplines because it put the theory of racial hygiene into practice, which was closely linked to the National Socialists' ideology. Coercive sterilizations performed in hundreds of thousands cases could only be carried out with the help of many deeply convinced psychiatrists. From the late 1930s on tables started to be turned: psychiatrists were more and more eclipsed by administration officers. Time consuming therapies, which were still favoured by some psychiatrists, were replaced by economy measures. The killing of patients in the years 1940/41 in the so called \"Aktion T4\" marked a complete change of direction. Psychiatrists' eugenic activities and their propagation of sterilizations during the 1930s were not directly linked to the so called \"euthanasia\". On the contrary, there was a massive shift from the elimination of diseases to the elimination of patients. This shift caused society to withdraw its formerly strong trust in psychiatry. Because psychiatrists had participated in murdering their clients the clinical practice of psychiatry and psychiatric research became superfluous. As a consequence psychiatry faced the problem how to justify its existence. During the years 1941/42 the futile quest of a psychiatric \"project for the future\" began. Psychiatrists tried to justify the existence of their profession by research and modernization. An attempt that was doomed to failure."}, {"Title": "[Asylum for curing or securing? The confinement of forensic patients as a challenge of asylum psychiatry in Imperial Germany].", "Abstract": "Asylum for curing or securing? The confinement of forensic patients as a challenge of asylum psychiatry in Imperial Germany. In Imperial Germany psychiatrists sought to give their asylums the character of modern medical hospitals. Due to the increase of insanity defence these efforts were obstructed by the high number of inmates with a criminal background. Special departments for mentally ill criminals were founded both in asylums and in prisons. But the clientele was not welcome in any of these institutions. Thus, there was a high fluctuation between prisons and asylums. A new definition of criminal responsibility was needed. In order to keep criminals out of their hospitals psychiatrists developed the medical concept of psychopathy referring to a mental defect without lack of responsibility. On the other hand penal law reformers plead to introduce preventive measures, such as security confinement, into the criminal law book. Since the resolution of the 'law against habitual criminals' in November 1933 judges are allowed to sentence mentally ill offenders to indefinite confinement in psychiatric institutions."}, {"Title": "[\"Norms and autonomy. Southern German clinical psychiatrists' strategies of legitimation and power of interpretation in the first half of the 19th century\"].", "Abstract": "In the present article the Southern German states of Baden and Bavaria are analyzed to exemplify the ways in which during the first half of the 19th century clinical psychiatrists advanced to experts and how they gained within and outside the institutional sphere a psychiatric sovereignty of interpretation (\"psychiatrische Deutungsmacht\"). One aspect in this development are strategies with which their position as physician was legitimized and ensured. Another aspect analyzed are the conditions under which physicians were able to act. It is to be noted that the rise of the psychiatric profession took place in two phases: Up until the 1820s, during the so called establishing phase of institutional psychiatry, the physician's active horizont was limited to the clinical sphere. Then, a process of \"professional self-discovery\" set in. Only with the institutional differentiation from the 1830s onwards, clinical psychiatrists also began to appear outside the clinics as experts and critical councellors. However, the fact that there was a gradual gain in autonomy and the establishment of a psychiatric sovereignty of interpretation also within state bureaucracy cannot be explained solely by tendencies toward professionalization. It was rather a multilayered process involving different participants and vested interests. The role of the state is of special importance: Motivated by its interest in solving the problem of deviance through medicalization, the state not only helped to bring institutional psychiatry into being, but also paved the way for the rise of clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Hospitals in Hesse in the view of enlightened travellers].", "Abstract": "The \"Hohen Hospit\u00e4ler\", hospitals founded by landgrave Philipp dem Grossm\u00fctigen during the years 1533-1542, were seen as an expression of greatest caritas in Early Modern times. These protestant institutions for the poor and sick underlings of Hesse were appreciated as charitable shelters by noblemen and commoners. This situation changed dramatically at the end of the 18th century. The first critics were travelling philosophers of the Enlightenment, who visited the \"mad houses\" of Hesse as well as other oddities. They published their experiences in travel reports. Although the hospitals as integrated institutions still cared for both psychiatric and somatic patients, these authors only concentrated on the mad inmates. The fact that these were kept in \"dark and dirty cloistral corridors\" was the central point of criticism. This negative situation was confronted by the travellers not only with a demand for more hygiene but also with a call for an academically trained physician. Furthermore, they claimed for dissecting deceased patients in order to explore the nature of madness. A comparison of these travel reports with the first psychiatric publications of the early 19th century discloses a literary discourse. It leads from the reports of travellers with a general interest to specialist literature of early psychiatry. Obviously it had a formative influence on the self-conception of this new medical field, which benefited from the criticism concerning the allegedly inhumane conditions in the old hospitals. Three questions follow from this statement: 1. Which were the images produced or reproduced by the travellers in their reports? 2. Which were the standards against which the critics measured their reports? 3. In how far were the philanthropic aims of the enlightened travellers related to the self-conception of the hospitals and their inmates? Travelling reports are compared with the circumstances in the hospitals. This comparison throws light in the \"invention\" of the genre psychiatry.

CSF-orexin-A was measured and correlated with ratings of psychiatric symptoms.\nThere were significant and negative correlations between CSF-orexin and the symptoms lassitude (difficulty to initiate activities) and slowness of movement, as well as the ratings of global illness (p<0.005 for all three items, Spearman's rho).\nCorrelation analysis is an indirect method of investigation and does not demonstrate causal relationships.\nLow CSF-orexin levels are related to pronounced symptoms of inertia and reduced motor activity in suicidal patients. Interestingly, the lower the orexin levels, the higher were ratings of overall illness, as observed by a specialist in psychiatry. Our results suggest that reduced orexin levels are involved in the etiology of specific psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "What can we learn from the first community-based epidemiological study on stalking in Germany?", "Abstract": "There is a lack of community-based studies on prevalence rates of stalking and the impact of stalking on victims in continental European countries. The authors published the first community-based epidemiological study on stalking in Germany. The purpose of this paper is to discuss possible implications of these epidemiological data for the mental health system, forensic psychiatry and legal regulations in Germany. For these reasons some data of our epidemiological study are outlined and reanalyzed. To examine lifetime and point prevalence rates of stalking, behavioural and psychological consequences for victims and the impact of stalking on current psychological well-being in a German community sample, a postal survey was conducted with 2000 inhabitants randomly selected from Mannheim (response rate 34.2%, n=679). The survey included a stalking questionnaire and the WHO-5 well-being scale. Almost 12% of the respondents reported having been stalked. This study identified a high lifetime prevalence of stalking in the community. Effects on victims' psychological health were significant and there was a high rate of physical (31%) and sexual (19%) violence in the context of stalking. Our data suggest that the phenomenon deserves more attention in future forensic psychiatric research and practice. Implications for forensic psychiatric assessment and treatment of stalkers as well as for management of stalking victims are discussed."}, {"Title": "Psychopathology in great apes: concepts, treatment options and possible homologies to human psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Many captive great apes show gross behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypies, self-mutilation, inappropriate aggression, fear or withdrawal, which impede attempts to integrate these animals in existing or new social groups. These abnormal behaviors resemble symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders in humans such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Due to the outstanding importance of social interaction and the prolonged period of infantile and juvenile dependence, early separation of infants from their mothers and other adverse rearing conditions, solitary housing, and sensory deprivation are among the major albeit non-specific sources of psychopathology in apes. In contrast to the wealth of research in monkeys, psychopathology in apes has been under-studied, and only a few studies have examined how to alleviate abnormal behavior in captive apes. Recent studies have shown that the enrichment of living conditions and behavioral treatment (conditioning) may ameliorate some pathological features, and careful familiarization with novel physical and social environments can help re-socialize behaviorally disturbed animals, but usually not to the extent of successful mating and raising offspring. The possibility of psychopharmacological treatment of the most severe disturbed animal patients has only been reluctantly considered, but a few case reports have revealed encouraging results. This article proposes the need to expand research into ape psychopathology, which would require an essentially interdisciplinary approach of primatology and psychiatry, ultimately to the benefit of both."}, {"Title": "Ethics in psychiatry: a framework.", "Abstract": "Defining bioethics as the rational use of dialogue in the formulation, justification, and application of ethical principles, with the aim ofgenerating good practices in research, clinical practice, and advocacy, this paper focuses on methods for bioethical deliberation relevantto psychiatry. Stressing that bioethics fuses the two main ethical traditions in Western thought, the deontological and the teleological, thepaper emphasizes the three conditions that any intervention, if considered in the context of bioethics, should fulfil: it should be appropriateto the problem at hand, it should be good (in the sense that it does good to those who receive it but also to those who perform it),and it should be just (in the sense that its outcomes can be generalized to the whole of society). Some implications of these notions for thepractice and teaching of psychiatry are presented."}, {"Title": "Should general psychiatry ignore somatization and hypochondriasis?", "Abstract": "This paper examines the tendency for general psychiatry to ignore somatization and hypochondriasis. These disorders are rarely included in national surveys of mental health and are not usually regarded as a concern of general psychiatrists; yet primary care doctors and other physicians often feel let down by psychiatry's failure to offer help in this area of medical practice. Many psychiatrists are unaware of the suffering, impaired function and high costs that can result from these disorders, because these occur mainly within primary care and secondary medical services. Difficulties in diagnosis and a tendency to regard them as purely secondary phenomena of depression, anxiety and related disorders mean that general psychiatry may continue to ignore somatization and hypochondriasis. If general psychiatry embraced these disorders more fully, however, it might lead to better prevention and treatment of depression as well as helping to prevent the severe disability that may arise in association with these disorders."}, {"Title": "Lifelong learning: skills and online resources.", "Abstract": "Advances in information technology enable the practicing psychiatrist's quest to keep up-to-date with new discoveries in psychiatry, as well as to meet recertification requirements. However, physicians' computer skills do not always keep up with technology, nor do they take advantage of online search and continuing education services. This article describes the rationale for using electronic databases and training, as well as basic computer skills, computer equipment, and important online resources for psychiatrists to meet their continuing education and recertification needs quickly, easily, and conveniently.\nA literature review was performed using PUBMED and Google to find articles related to recertification, physician's technology adoption and computer skills, evidence-based medicine, and basic approaches to lifelong learning using computers and the Internet, and resources for lifelong learning.\nPsychiatrists are required to master a discrete set of information for board certification, and to maintain that knowledge for recertification. Surveys have shown that although most physicians use computers, the majority use them for personal or business purposes, and not for accessing Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs (1). The Council on Graduate Medical Education requires the acquisition of medical informatics skills for the Undergraduate Medical Education for the 21st Century (UME-21) curriculum project (2). There is a growing body of literature outlining basic computer skills and competencies for physicians to access online textbooks, databases, journals, and CME programs.\nPsychiatrists can benefit from learning how to use computers and the Internet to keep current with the advances in the field.

Once a new technology is available, information about its availability and benefits must be made available to the community of users, with opportunities to try the innovations and find them worthwhile, despite organizational resistances.\nThe authors reviewed the literature from psychiatry, psychology, sociology, business, and technology to distill common denominators for success and failure related to implementing technology.\nBeneficial technological innovations that are simple to use and obviously save everyone time and effort are easy to inaugurate. However, innovations that primarily serve management rather than subordinates or front-line utilizers may fail, despite considerable institutional effort. This article reviews and outlines several of the more prominent theoretical models governing successful institutional change.\nSuccessful implementation of difficult technological changes requires visionary leadership that has carefully considered the benefits, consulted with influence leaders at all organizational levels to spot unintended consequences and sources of resistance, and developed a detailed plan and continuous quality assurance process to foster implementation over time."}, {"Title": "Population pharmacokinetics in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Although geriatric patients are the major recipients of drugs, most research during drug development is conducted in healthy younger adults. Safe and effective drug therapy in the elderly requires an understanding of both drug disposition and response in older individuals. One of the major issues in studying the elderly relates to the ability to study a large number of people in a minimally invasive way. Population pharmacokinetics can be used to model drug concentrations from a large population of sparsely sampled individuals. Population pharmacokinetics characterizes both the interindividual (between-subject) and intraindividual (within-subject) variability, and can identify factors that contribute to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability. Population pharmacokinetics can be used to aid in designing large clinical trials by simulating virtual data based on the study design. It can also be used to assess consistency of drug exposure and evaluate its effect on clinical outcome. This article reviews the methods used in pharmacokinetic modeling, as well as providing examples of population pharmacokinetic modeling, highlighting its application to geriatric psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Genetic counselling for psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Family, adoption and twin studies demonstrate that many adult psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder, have a clear genetic component. The aetiology of psychiatric disorders is a complex combination of both genetic and environmental components. While potential susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders have been identified, interaction with the environment is a crucial component in disease development. Pharmacogenetics and genetic testing have the potential to play key roles in the future of clinical psychiatry. At present, an increased risk of psychiatric disorders can be identified through a detailed family history. The empirical risk of developing a disorder has been determined for many psychiatric disorders and can be used as a general guide. Genetic counselling can extend and enhance patient care by providing information to patients about the complexities of inheriting psychiatric disorders and the associated risks of recurrence. The genetic counselling process can facilitate informed decision making, alleviate misconceptions and reduce stigma through an improved understanding of the genetic cause of psychiatric disorders, and offer support to patients and their families."}, {"Title": "Older people with enduring or recurrent severe mental illness in the Eastern Region of Ireland.", "Abstract": "There has been no specific planning for older people with enduring or recurrent severe mental illness in Ireland.

The impact of social desirability bias on questionnaire responses was also explored. Gender and nationality subgroups in the cohort were examined in more detail to determine whether these variables had any bearing on attitude change.\nFifth year medical students at NUI Galway completed the Attitudes to Psychiatry-30 questionnaire at the beginning and end of the psychiatric curriculum. This was coupled to the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (13 items) to determine the effect of this potential bias on responses to the attitudinal scale. Anonymity was ensured by using unique identification codes on the questionnaires, which facilitated individual comparisons of pre- and post-teaching responses.\nAttitudes toward psychiatry were positive prior to training but significantly improved following the teaching programme. There was no difference in attitudinal change between male and female subgroups. While students from outside the EU did show an improvement in mean scores on the ATP-30 this increase failed to reach significance. This finding was in contrast to the results for students from EU states whose mean increase on the ATP-30 was highly significant. Social desirability questionnaire scores fell significantly between the first and second administration, lending support to the findings being a true reflection of the students' attitudes toward psychiatry.\nThese findings suggest that a teaching programme has the ability to influence students' attitudes.

Currently the majority of US medical schools require passage of USMLE Step 1 for either promotion to the third year or graduation from medical school. Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine (VCUSOM) requires that students take the USMLE but does not require passing of USMLE Step 1 for promotion or graduation. This policy enabled the authors to analyze performance outcomes during clinical rotations and monitor the residency match for a group of students who failed USMLE Step 1 on the first attempt.\nThird year clerkship grades and residency match results were reviewed for 64 students of the graduating classes of 1999-2005 who failed Step 1 on the first attempt. An equal number of students who passed Step 1 were randomly selected from each class as a comparison group. Average clinical performance ratings, NBME subject exam scores and final third year clerkship grades for the two groups were compared. Residency match rates and specialty certification were also compared.\nThe USMLE Fail Group had more Pass and fewer Honors clerkship grades than the comparison group. Subject exam scores were significantly lower in the USMLE Fail Group in all clerkships. Clinical performance ratings were significantly lower in the Fail group in three out of six clerkships: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry. However, 82% of the USMLE Fail Group later passed USMLE Step 1 and 2. Fifty-nine of the 64 students in the USMLE Fail Group matched for a residency, whereas all of the students in the Pass Group matched for a residency.\nStudents who fail USMLE Step 1 have lower final clerkship grades due in part to lower NBME subject exam scores.

Controversial aspects of each technique are discussed, as are broader areas of criticism, such as commercial interests and standards of evidence. The published literature is selectively reviewed, and qEEG's applicability is assessed for disorders of childhood (learning and attentional disorders), dementia, mood disorders, anxiety, panic, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Emphasis is placed primarily on studies that use qEEG to aid in clinical diagnosis, and secondarily on studies that use qEEG to predict medication response or clinical course. Methodological problems are highlighted, the availability of large databases is discussed, and specific recommendations are made for further research and development. As a clinical laboratory test, qEEG's cautious use is recommended in attentional and learning disabilities of childhood, and in mood and dementing disorders of adulthood."}, {"Title": "Survey of medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia--Korean ADHES data.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated the partial adherence to medication in schizophrenic patients in Korea.\nThe Adherence in Schizophrenia (ADHES) survey was conducted worldwide, including Asian countries. Through questionnaires for clinicians, caregivers and patients, information about medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia and factors affecting adherence were identified. This survey involved 131 psychiatrists from 80 psychiatry clinics and 2824 patients with schizophrenia were enrolled.\nPartial adherence in patients with schizophrenia was prevalent (over 60%) in Korea. From the psychiatrists' point of view, the most prevalent factors associated with partial adherence in their patients were poor awareness of the illness (85%) and embarrassment at having to take medication daily (80%). Psychiatrists believed that most patients (83%) needed help from someone to remind them to take the medication regularly. Of patients, 57% reported feeling upset at having to take medication daily and 76% of caregivers reported preferring long-acting medications.\nBased on the study results, a specific strategy to deal successfully with the prevalent partial adherence to medication in patients with schizophrenia should be developed, and long-acting medication may be one solution to improve partial adherence problems."}, {"Title": "A method for studies of madness.", "Abstract": "In these series of articles honouring John Marshall for his contributions to psychology, linguistics, the history of ideas and many other fields we should not forget his contribution to psychiatry.

In addition, we used UEMS and EFPT annual forum minutes and web sites of national CAP societies to validate the data.\nThe structure of CAP training has many differences between 34 European countries. For instance, in 32.4% of the countries, CAP is not a specialty in its own right but is mostly linked to general psychiatry. After medical school, the minimum training duration to become a CAP specialist ranges between 12 and 96 (mean: 59.71 +/- 17.1) months. While, a trainee should pass an examination to begin CAP training in 37.9% of the countries, 64.7% have an examination to graduate and both is the case in 29.7% of the countries.\nBy the year 2006, European countries still have large differences in the structure of CAP training. It is assumed that the same holds true for content of training, which was not the focus of this documentation.

However, psychiatric genetics and epidemiology have often worked as independent research fields.\nTo review the evidence about the gene-environment interplay involved in the development of schizophrenia.\nSystematic review of medical and psychological databases.\nOn one hand, quantitative and molecular genetics showed high heritability for schizophrenia and identified genes likely to be involved in its pathophysiology. The strength of the association between candidate genes and schizophrenia is however modest, and the need for a more appropriate conceptualization of the genetic risk has been claimed. On the other hand, psychiatric epidemiology described several environmental factors liked with the onset or the course of schizophrenia. The observational nature of epidemiology, however, may hamper inference on causation. Gene-environment correlations and interactions influence the exposure and the vulnerability to the environment, respectively. Current findings suggest that gene-environment correlations and interactions may be common phenomena in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

It means that, far from traditional statistical proceedings, it does not give any priority to the temptation of a cumulative and accumulative collection of data, for which it even receives their greatest misgivings, leaving it out of its procedures. This method also owes a lot to Bergson's insistence on the qualitative characteristics of the \"immediate data of consciousness\" and of experienced temporality, for which analytical and chronological fragmentations can do nothing but distort the authentically comprehensive grasping, and make them loose their specificity, unity and thus the indecomposability that, by nature, they precisely contain. According to Eugene Minkowski, the psychopathical break-up, proceeding from the deep heart of life, is essentially going to express itself, with its own properties, as a qualitative modification. In this way, the study of some cases carefully chosen, in accordance with their \"typical\" value, is more important than a blind acquisition of data, i.e. without previous option, orientation or perspective. Starting from their spontaneous words collected during a conversation, the meticulous analysis of the language of the patients, put in resonance with the vivid metaphors of the language in which they are expressed, as Minkowski will so brilliantly show, or via mediations connecting image and language, as in the experiment of the Rorschach--particularly approached in its essential mechanisms by his wife Francoise Minkowska--represents, from this point of view, a mediator and an irreplaceable instrument of a qualitative approach of a normal as well as a pathological personality and, more widely, of the person itself."}, {"Title": "Cognitive and emotion recognition deficits in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Previous investigations have demonstrated impaired recognition of facial affect and cognitive dysfunction in several psychiatric disorders.

We argue that current evidence- or value-based models of health care reasoning, despite their virtues, are insufficient to account for responses to such problems exhaustively. At the same time, we offer reasons for contending that health professionals in fact engage in forms of reasoning of a kind described for millennia under the concept of wisdom. Wisdom traditions refer to forms of deliberation which combine knowledge, reflection and life experience with social, emotional and ethical capacities. Wisdom is key in dealing with problems which are vital to human affairs but lack prescribed solutions. Uncertainty and fluidity must be tolerated in seeking to resolve them. We illustrate the application of wisdom using cases in psychiatry, where non-technical aspects of problems are often prominent and require more systematic analysis than conventional approaches offer, but we argue that our thesis applies throughout the health care field. We argue for the relevance of a threefold model of reasoning to modern health care situations in which multifaceted teamwork and complex settings demand wise judgement. A model based on practical wisdom highlights a triadic process with features activating capacities of the self (professional), other (patient and/or carers and/or colleagues) and aspects of the problem itself.

It has played a role in the discovery of prototype psychotropic drugs that led to modern pharmacological treatment in psychiatry. It has also played a role in the discovery of several drugs that have had an impact on the development of psychiatry. \"Serendipity\" in drug discovery implies the finding of one thing while looking for something else. This was the case in six of the twelve serendipitous discoveries reviewed in this paper, i.e., aniline purple, penicillin, lysergic acid diethylamide, meprobamate, chlorpromazine, and imipramine. In the case of three drugs, i.e., potassium bromide, chloral hydrate, and lithium, the discovery was serendipitous because an utterly false rationale led to correct empirical results; and in case of two others, i.e., iproniazid and sildenafil, because valuable indications were found for these drugs which were not initially those sought The discovery of one of the twelve drugs, chlordiazepoxide, was sheer luck."}, {"Title": "The role of psychosomatic-medicine psychiatrists in bioethics: a survey study of members of the academy of psychosomatic medicine.", "Abstract": "The Bioethics Subcommittee of The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine developed a survey to assess the involvement of psychosomatic-medicine psychiatrists in bioethics and the extent of their participation on bioethics committees and in the teaching of bioethics.

This paper aims to review the evidence for this need and to suggest the parameters in which this dimension might be applied.\nThe phenomenology of spirituality and its relevance to psychiatry is considered, the concept of the psychiatrist and the clinician as a healer visited, and the evidence for the need for spirituality and religiosity for patients examined.\nPatients' spiritual needs should be addressed at different levels. Using previous data and experience, the authors suggest what psychiatrists might and might not do, in order that these issues are attended to in an ethical and sensitive manner.\nIn considering the spiritual dimension of the patient, the psychiatrist is able to send an important message that he or she is concerned with the whole person, a message that enhances the patient-physician relationship.

In order to isolate the role of visual familiarity in face recognition, we used fMRI to measure the response to faces characterized by experimentally induced visual familiarity that carried no biographical information or emotional content. The fMRI results showed a stronger response in the precuneus to the visually familiar faces consistent with studies that implicate this region in the retrieval of information from long-term memory and imagery. Moreover, this finding supports the hypothesis of a key role for the precuneus in the acquisition of familiarity with faces [H. Kosaka, M. Omori, T. Iidaka, T. Murata, T. Shimoyama, T. Okada, N. Sadato, Y. Yonekura, Y. Wada, Neural substrates participating in acquisition of facial familiarity: an fMRI study, Neuroimage 20 (2003) 1734-1742]. By contrast, the visually familiar faces evoked a weaker response in the fusiform gyrus, which may reflect the development of a sparser encoding or a reduced attentional load when processing stimuli that are familiar. The visually familiar faces also evoked a weaker response in the amygdala, supporting the proposed role of this structure in mediating the guarded attitude when meeting someone new."}, {"Title": "Osteoporosis and depression: a historical perspective.", "Abstract": "In the early 1980s, researchers studying osteoporosis noted that depression was one of the major negative consequences of bone loss and fractures. These researchers believed that osteoporosis and fractures occurred first, causing a reactive depression. Meanwhile, a similar but distinct psychiatry literature noted that osteoporosis or bone loss appeared to be an undesirable consequence of major depression. Here, depression was seen as the causal factor, and osteoporosis was the outcome. The psychiatric perspective is more biological, based on the presence of hypercorticoidism in depressed individuals. Those who believe that osteoporosis leads to depression point out that depression is a consequence of many chronic illnesses. Regardless of the correct causal order, the strong positive relationship between osteoporosis and depression merits further clinical and research attention in the future."}, {"Title": "[Clinical ethics in psychiatry: the experience at Douglas Hospital].", "Abstract": "The authors present a brief overview of the clinical ethics committee within their mental health university institute as well as its evolving mandates over the past few decades.

Besides the scientific domain of psychiatry, time consciousness is a topic that has been extensively studied both by theoretical philosophy and cognitive neuroscience. It can be shown that both approaches exemplified by the philosophical analysis of time consciousness (Husserl) and the neuroscientific theory of cross-temporal contingencies (binding of cognitive processes over time) as the neurophysiological basis of human consciousness implemented in the prefrontal cortex (Fuster) converge in 2 respects. Firstly, a tripartite conception of consciousness divides human cognition in 3 different temporal domains comprising retention, presentation, and protention (Husserl) and the past, the present, and the future corresponding to working memory, interference control, and preparatory set (Fuster). Secondly, both concepts refer to the present as an extended duration that integrates information from the recent past and the future. We propose that the integration of phenomenological and neuroscientific approaches can stimulate the development of enriched pathophysiological concepts of mental disorders. This approach appears to be particularly fruitful with respect to schizophrenia that is interpreted as a structural disturbance of time consciousness."}, {"Title": "Performing a cure for schizophrenia: insulin coma therapy on the wards.", "Abstract": "Most historians of psychiatry regard insulin coma therapy (ICT) either as an embarrassing stumble on the path to modern biological psychiatry or as one member of a long line of somatic therapies used to treat mental illness in the mid-twentieth century. This article explores the ICT era, roughly 1933-60, as a key moment in the development of American psychiatry. Developed only ten years after insulin had been embraced as a \"miracle drug\" for the treatment of diabetes, ICT was perceived by psychiatrists as a means of bringing their field closer to mainstream medicine, particularly to neurology. In addition, the story of ICT reveals how a treatment never quite proven on paper was unquestionably efficacious in the local world in which it was performed. An institutionally-based treatment, ICT was administered in a specific area of the mental hospital deemed the insulin unit, a room with its own staff, practices, and attitudes toward mental illness. There, psychiatrists often experienced wondrous recoveries of individual, formerly intractable patients. These intense personal experiences allowed psychiatrists to feel truly efficacious, enabling them to reinvent themselves as medical doctors rather than behavioral and disciplinary supervisors. The confidence they derived from this capacity, along with the operating room-like setting of the insulin unit, the unit's specialized staffing and group bond, and the availability of both risk-assessment tests and a medley of treatments that countered side effects and complications, allowed ICT to be understood as an efficacious treatment for schizophrenia within the local world in which it was administered."}, {"Title": "[Homage to Kraepelin, honouring his 150th birthday--\"Zerfahrenheit\", Kraepelin's specific symptom for schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Kraepelin described but one single specific sign for all forms of dementia praecox (later: schizophrenia) and coined a new word for it, \"Zerfahrenheit\" (various translations: distraction, dilapidation, incoherence, among others). What he meant by it, clearly results from Kraepelin's description even now. The origin of the idea could been found in German philosophy of the times of enlightenment, when it had been described already in a distinct way. That time coined the word \"Verr\u00fccktheit\" for it (usual translation: mental derangement; better translations would be the same as for \"Zerfahrenheit\"). Because of the influence of French psychiatry with its quite different background and the hurly burly about paranoia (Heinroth's Greek translation for \"Verr\u00fccktheit\") the knowledge of the sign got lost. Kraepelin restored the original meaning, without referring however to the sources directly. In spite of having been acknowledged as a specific sign for dementia praecox by all German psychiatrists, only one decade after the first description a new process of unclearing recommenced. This bow curved from Eugen Bleuler via Kurt Schneider and others to DSM III/IV and ICD-10. In the current paper we follow Kraepelin's process of clearing via all 9 editions of his textbook of psychiatry. Since the German original of Kraepelin's first extended description currently can be found only in larger libraries, the integral text of it is being reprinted (in English a recent translation by Jacques M. Quen is available). No corrections or changes are necessary.

Since subjective experience is tied to First-Person-Perspective and investigation of the brain is possible only in Third-Person-Perspective, the question how subjective experience can be linked to neuronal processes is raised in psychiatry. We suggest a novel methodological approach, First-Person-Neuroscience where subjective experience can be linked directly and systematically to neuronal processes. Due to complexity of the structures and contents of subjective experience, localization in specific brain regions seems inappropriate. Instead, the interplay and coordination of neuronal activity across several brain regions, so-called neuronal integration, should be considered in First-Person-Neuroscience. This is illustrated by two principles of neuronal integration, top-down modulation and reciprocal modulation, whose abnormal function can be related to subjective experience of patients with catatonia and depression. It is concluded that First-Person-Neuroscience can contribute to reveal abnormal brain function in psychiatric disorders and ultimately to development of diagnostic and therapeutic markers."}, {"Title": "[Estimation of patient eligibility for thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke based on a hospital stroke registry in Warsaw].", "Abstract": "Thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stoke was introduced and licensed in Poland in 2003.

GSK3 is a widely influential enzyme that is capable of phosphorylating, and thereby regulating, over forty known substrates. Four mechanisms regulating GSK3 (phosphorylation, protein complexes, localization, and substrate phosphorylation) combine to provide substrate-specific regulation of the actions of GSK3. Several intracellular signaling cascades converge on GSK3 to modulate its activity, and several neurotransmitter systems also regulate GSK3, including serotonergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic systems. Because of changes in these neurotransmitter systems and the actions of therapeutic drugs, GSK3 has been linked to the mood disorders, bipolar disorder and depression, and to schizophrenia. Inhibition of GSK3 may be an important therapeutic target of mood stabilizers, and regulation of GSK3 may be involved in the therapeutic effects of other drugs used in psychiatry. Dysregulated GSK3 in bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia could have multiple effects that could impair neural plasticity, such as modulation of neuronal architecture, neurogenesis, gene expression, and the ability of neurons to respond to stressful, potentially lethal, conditions.

The most prevalent groups of psychiatric disorders among general hospital inpatients are organic mental illness, depressive disorders, and alcohol dependence or abuse. The prevalence rates of organic brain syndromes, adjustment disorders with depressed mood, and alcohol dependence in general hospital inpatients are above those of the general population. In nearly half of the studied general hospital inpatients receiving a psychiatric diagnosis Consultation-Liaison (C-L) psychiatry interventions were found to be necessary. However, psychiatric consultation rates found in most recently presented studies in Germany and Austria range from 2.66% to 3.30%, and remain low when compared to the reported prevalence figures of psychiatric disorders and the demonstrated necessity for specific therapeutic interventions among general hospital inpatients. There is also evidence stemming from newly presented C-L follow-up studies that the remarkable advances in intensive care treatment, organ transplantation medicine and cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass within the past decade have an important impact on the general hospital inpatients; psychosocial outcome. One follow-up study of long-term acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors using the Structural Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID) has shown that 43.5% of these patients met the criteria for a full posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 8.9% of these patients for a subthreshold or partial PTSD (sub-PTSD) at hospital discharge, and 23.9% of them still suffered from full PTSD, 17.8% of them from sub-PTSD. ARDS-Patients with PTSD symptomatology exhibited major impairments in a variety of dimensions of health-related quality of life. Another outcome study examining concurrently psychiatric morbidity and quality of life in intermediate-term survivors of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) survivors has documented that 5.4% of these patients had a full PTSD, and 17.3% of them a sub-PTSD at 4 year-follow-up. OLT- related PTSD symptomatology was associated with maximal decrements in health-related quality of life. The duration of intensive care treatment, the number of medical complications, and the occurrence of acute rejection were positively correlated with the risk of PTSD symptoms subsequent to OLT. Finally, one prospective 1-year outcome study has focused on psychiatric morbidity including postoperative delirium in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery employing cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative delirium developed in 32.4% of these patients, however, only in 5.9% of them severe delirium was noted. Short-term consequences of cardiac surgery included adjustment disorders with depressed features (32.4%), acute full in-hospital PTSD (17.6%), and in-hospital major depression (17.6%). The diagnostic status of in-hospital PTSD was linked to postoperative delirium. At 12 months, the severity of depression and anxiety disorders including PTSD improved and returned to the preoperative level. However, patients who were found to have major depression or PTSD before discharge, C-L psychiatric consultations were conducted. In conclusion, PTSD symptoms following medical illness and treatment are not rare. If they are untreated, PTSD symptoms such as intrusive recollections, avoidance and hyper-arousal may impair the patients; quality of life more than the primary disease. This seems to be also true for a subthreshold PTSD. To adequately diagnose and treat patients at risk of developing PTSD, close collaboration between physicians of all subspecialties and C-L psychiatrists will be necessary."}, {"Title": "[Behavior disturbances in emergency psychiatry or fronto-temporal dementia diagnosis? A challenge for psychiatrists].", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) represents a challenge for the psychiatrist, especially since this insidious pathology partly mimics other psychiatric diseases.\nWe present a clinical case that illustrates the difficulty of FTD diagnosis particularly well. A 32 year-old woman without previous medical history presented with psychomotor agitation, logorrhea and flight of ideas. The criteria for bipolar disorder according to DSM IV were met and the patient was referred to an outpatient clinic where a mood stabilizer was initiated (lithium, 400 mg/day). An in-depth interview with her husband revealed mild but progressive modification of her personality and behavior over the course of two years. She showed signs of mild fatigue and irritability that evolved into a loss of interest for both leisure and domestic activities. In addition, she showed increasing erratic behavior and emergence of frequent episodes of verbal abuse. After the birth of her second child, the patient's clinical state worsened with the appearance of uninhibited behavior, loss of personal hygiene, sleep disturbances and nightmares. The patient was forced to stop her work as a cleaner, a steady employment that she had maintained for 10 years. The hypomanic state worsened and psychotic symptoms such as delusions and echolalia appeared within a few weeks. These events culminated in a first hospitalization in a psychiatric unit. We evoked both diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. In the following months, we conducted neurological examinations on account of the progressive deterioration of her cognitive functions. Neuroradiological results (CT scan with contrast agents, MRI, cerebral scintigraphy) coupled with her clinical evolution (neurological examination and neuropsychological testing) permitted diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia.\nFronto-temporal dementia usually presents itself as an autosomal dominant disease in 89% of reported cases, with an insidious onset associated with thymic symptoms and behavioral disturbances. The first consultation often concludes with a suspicion of a psychiatric disorder in 33% of the cases (unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol dependence). The clinical description of such a heterogenic and neuro-psychiatric disorder should be widely disseminated, so that psychiatrists can distinguish early symptoms and diminish the risk of misdiagnosis of FDT.\nSuch case reports emphasize the importance for psychiatrists to be aware of the clinical prodromal FDT symptoms, particularly since the neuro-imaging data of dementia are often delayed."}, {"Title": "[Characteristics of the population under care from 1990 to 2000, Department of Psychiatry, Yalgado Ouedraogo University Hospital, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso].", "Abstract": "Mental disorders constitute an important portion of the world sickness ratio.

Within the scope of the study, 7 313 patients (60% men and 40% women) were analysed. The average age of the patients was 31.06 +/- 13.07 years. Among these patients, 80.60% had been exclusively under ambulatory care and 19.40% had been hospitalized at least once. The main categories of the available diagnoses were listed according to recurrence: acute psychotic disorders (20.68%), schizophrenia (17.25%) and depression (15.13%). In the men, the main diagnosis was acute psychotic disorders, whereas depression came top of the list for women. In the present state of socio-economic and cultural development in Burkina Faso, we note that only very serious mental disorders and/or those who cannot obtain favourable response with the traditional care system, come to medical centers. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the population as a whole, and to assess their need for medical care in this domain."}, {"Title": "[Distinction, limits and complementarity between efficacy and effectiveness studies: new perspectives for psychotherapy research].", "Abstract": "Perron et al. (2004) criticize the collective expertise conducted by the INSERM on the efficacy of different psychotherapy methods for different mental disorders. They say the work is biased in favour of Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT), while there is a negative bias regarding other methods, in particular psychodynamic therapies. Philippe Cialdella, a specialist of methodology and quantitative analysis in psychiatry, exposes an counter-argument in 10 points and brings welcome clarifications on the methodology and statistics. There is neither statistical bias in the INSERM report (which anyway is not a meta-analysis, but a literature analysis), nor in the first or second level studies on which it is based, mainly Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT). Though some arguments of P. Cialdella could be discussed in detail, his work comes to the conclusion that we can thus trust the results of the INSERM on one point: positive results can be obtained by psychotherapy with the experimental patients involved in the RCTs, and these findings are reliable. This is an important result in favour of psychotherapy, but it does not answer a very fundamental question: do we have reliable evidence that there is no systematic difference between the population constituted of patient-treatment-therapist (as a whole) found in RCTs, and the population constituted of patient-treatment-therapist (as a whole) in real contexts? A detailed analysis of what are efficacy studies and their methodology shows that this is not the case, and that it is hence not possible to generalize the results obtained by RCTs to clinical practice in real situations. Comorbidities and complex pathologies, choice of the therapist by the patient, interpersonal factors, conditions of use of manuals, contextual and social parameters, amongst other parameters make the real situation radically different from the RCT one, and the results impossible to generalize. Effectiveness studies in real situations do not solve the problem either. They have low internal validity, and though the population studied is close to a real one, too many uncontrolled parameters make the results unreliable. Moreover, outcome studies, whether they are efficacy or effectiveness studies, generally test a therapy \"as a whole\" versus another one, as defined in a manual, or by psychotherapy \"trademarks\". This design totally fails to offer a detailed view of what really happens during the therapy between the patient and the therapist, and it gives no possible insights into the change process elements. Only clinically highly representative quasi-experimental prospective studies can help us to understand change processes in real situations and incrementally improve treatment procedures. Daniel B. Fishman in the year 2000 made an ambitious and really interesting proposal about using pragmatic case studies in a systematic and scientific manner. Numerous reliable methodological tools, such as the Psychotherapy Process Q-Sort for example, as well as the tremendous innovations made in information and communication technologies make it possible today to implement such a proposal. It will enable us to really compare the resulting differences between the different approaches used in clinical settings, in relations with the type of intervention carried or in the real therapies, during clinically significant periods of time, and with various and ecologically valid samples. This is a possible solution to the difficult question of the use of outcome research to improve psychotherapy practice."}, {"Title": "Anxiety sensitivity as a moderator of association between smoking status and panic-related processes in a representative sample of adults.", "Abstract": "The present investigation evaluated a moderational role of anxiety sensitivity (fear of anxiety and anxiety-related states; [McNally RJ.

Those in charge were convinced these soldiers were cowards or malingerers who deserved stern discipline or to be court-martialled. A number of physicians, by contrast, initially assumed that these alarming symptoms resulted from close exposure to explosions and called it shell shock. Later, they realized that it was a psychological reaction and came up with psychotherapeutic treatments. But it was only in World War II that military psychiatrists, particularly those in the USA, began to implement treatment methods for this phenomenon in a systematic way. Their thinking and the treatments they devised had significant consequences for the future of American psychiatry, which in turn influenced the development of psychiatry and military psychiatry world-wide."}, {"Title": "A fully automated method for quantifying and localizing white matter hyperintensities on MR images.", "Abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH), commonly found on T2-weighted FLAIR brain MR images in the elderly, are associated with a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and late-life depression. Previous MRI studies of WMHs have primarily relied on the subjective and global (i.e., full-brain) ratings of WMH grade. In the current study we implement and validate an automated method for quantifying and localizing WMHs. We adapt a fuzzy-connected algorithm to automate the segmentation of WMHs and use a demons-based image registration to automate the anatomic localization of the WMHs using the Johns Hopkins University White Matter Atlas. The method is validated using the brain MR images acquired from eleven elderly subjects with late-onset late-life depression (LLD) and eight elderly controls. This dataset was chosen because LLD subjects are known to have significant WMH burden. The volumes of WMH identified in our automated method are compared with the accepted gold standard (manual ratings). A significant correlation of the automated method and the manual ratings is found (P<0.0001), thus demonstrating similar WMH quantifications of both methods. As has been shown in other studies (e.g. [Taylor, W.D., MacFall, J.R., Steffens, D.C., Payne, M.E., Provenzale, J.M., Krishnan, K.R., 2003. Localization of age-associated white matter hyperintensities in late-life depression. Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry. 27 (3), 539-544.]), we found there was a significantly greater WMH burden in the LLD subjects versus the controls for both the manual and automated method. The effect size was greater for the automated method, suggesting that it is a more specific measure. Additionally, we describe the anatomic localization of the WMHs in LLD subjects as well as in the control subjects, and detect the regions of interest (ROIs) specific for the WMH burden of LLD patients. Given the emergence of large NeuroImage databases, techniques, such as that described here, will allow for a better understanding of the relationship between WMHs and neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic monitoring of valproate in psychiatry: how far have we progressed?", "Abstract": "Valproate (VPA) is a well-established anticonvulsant drug that has found increasing use as a psychotherapeutic agent. The drug is currently used in the management of bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and psychotic disorders; alcohol withdrawal and dependence; agitation associated with dementia; and borderline personality disorder. Despite such widespread use, studies focusing on the concentration-response relationship of VPA in psychiatry are limited. This article examines the rationale for therapeutic monitoring of VPA in psychiatric disorders and reviews reports of VPA concentrations measured during efficacy studies of this drug in psychiatry. Most studies have been open-labeled and uncontrolled, and have not placed the determination of a target concentration range as a primary objective. Furthermore, most studies have used the therapeutic range (50-100 mg/L) for seizure disorders to guide dosage in the psychiatric disorders, although study outcomes have suggested the need to redefine a threshold concentration in the different psychiatric conditions. With the increasing popularity of VPA as a psychotropic agent, it is clear that further investigation of the plasma concentration range associated with efficacy in psychiatric conditions is warranted."}, {"Title": "Concept of disease in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The concept of disease in geriatric psychiatry has to keep up with the rapid expansion in knowledge about the putative etiology of various diseases of interest. This article reviews the new knowledge that has been acquired about dementia. The proposed classification system has two axes: one for clinical manifestations and the other for etiology. Implementing this nomenclature will allow rapid adaptation of new knowledge for causation while at the same time communicating information on the clinical state. This should improve our ability to incorporate and communicate new knowledge in a dynamic format. In turn, this strategy should improve our ability to discern particular features of a disease and refine our notion of its clinical presentation and lead toward novel and improved treatments for our patients."}, {"Title": "Resolving the paradox of common, harmful, heritable mental disorders: which evolutionary genetic models work best?", "Abstract": "Given that natural selection is so powerful at optimizing complex adaptations, why does it seem unable to eliminate genes (susceptibility alleles) that predispose to common, harmful, heritable mental disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? We assess three leading explanations for this apparent paradox from evolutionary genetic theory: (1) ancestral neutrality (susceptibility alleles were not harmful among ancestors), (2) balancing selection (susceptibility alleles sometimes increased fitness), and (3) polygenic mutation-selection balance (mental disorders reflect the inevitable mutational load on the thousands of genes underlying human behavior). The first two explanations are commonly assumed in psychiatric genetics and Darwinian psychiatry, while mutation-selection has often been discounted. All three models can explain persistent genetic variance in some traits under some conditions, but the first two have serious problems in explaining human mental disorders. Ancestral neutrality fails to explain low mental disorder frequencies and requires implausibly small selection coefficients against mental disorders given the data on the reproductive costs and impairment of mental disorders. Balancing selection (including spatio-temporal variation in selection, heterozygote advantage, antagonistic pleiotropy, and frequency-dependent selection) tends to favor environmentally contingent adaptations (which would show no heritability) or high-frequency alleles (which psychiatric genetics would have already found). Only polygenic mutation-selection balance seems consistent with the data on mental disorder prevalence rates, fitness costs, the likely rarity of susceptibility alleles, and the increased risks of mental disorders with brain trauma, inbreeding, and paternal age. This evolutionary genetic framework for mental disorders has wide-ranging implications for psychology, psychiatry, behavior genetics, molecular genetics, and evolutionary approaches to studying human behavior."}, {"Title": "A new scale to assess the therapeutic relationship in community mental health care: STAR.", "Abstract": "No instrument has been developed specifically for assessing the clinician-patient therapeutic relationship (TR) in community psychiatry. This study aimed to develop a measure of the TR with clinician and patient versions using psychometric principles for test construction.\nA four-stage prospective study was undertaken, comprising qualitative semi-structured interviews about TRs with clinicians and patients and their assessment of nine established scales for their applicability to community care, administering an amalgamated scale of more than 100 items, followed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of these ratings for preliminary scale construction, test-retest reliability of the scale and administering the scale in a new sample to confirm its factorial structure. The sample consisted of patients with severe mental illness and a designated key worker in the care of 17 community mental health teams in England and Sweden.\nNew items not covered by established scales were identified, including clinician helpfulness in accessing services, patient aggression and family interference. The new patient (STAR-P) and clinician scales (STAR-C) each have 12 items comprising three subscales: positive collaboration and positive clinician input in both versions, non-supportive clinician input in the patient version, and emotional difficulties in the clinician version. Test-retest reliability was r=0.76 for STAR-P and r=0.68 for STAR-C.

Also known by the acronym PIE (proximity to the battle, immediacy of treatment and expectancy of recovery, including return to duty), it was subsequently used by the British and Americans in both World Wars. The US Army used PIE techniques in Korea and Vietnam. Although widely accepted as an effective intervention, forward psychiatry is not amenable to random-controlled trials and only one controlled outcome study has been conducted.\nAll 3580 soldiers with shell shock admitted to 4 Stationary Hospital between January and November 1917 were recorded. Unit details, military experience, length of stay and outcomes were analysed. Soldiers were categorized into combat, combat-support and non-combatant groups. Admissions were correlated with military operations to compare the impact of defensive and offensive phases of warfare.\nRates of admission for shell shock rose significantly during offensives when physical casualties escalated. Combat troops were disproportionately represented. Over 50% of admissions had less than 9 months service in France and 21% broke down within 3 months of going overseas. Less than 20% returned directly to combat units, most going to other hospitals, convalescent depots or base duties.\nForward psychiatry was not effective in returning combat troops to fighting units but, by allocating soldiers to support roles, it prevented discharge from the armed forces.

We therefore undertook a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) study of drug-free patients with bipolar disorder (drug-free group), patients undergoing valproate treatment (valproate group), patients administered valproate+quetiapine (valprote+quetiapine group) and healthy controls, focusing on the in vivo neuroanatomy of the hippocampus.\nThirty patients from the Firat University School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and 10 healthy controls gave written informed consent to participate in the study. The patients and controls underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI), and measures of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (CHO), and creatine+phosphocreatine (CRE) in hippocampal regions were obtained.\nThe drug-free patients had significantly lower NAA/CRE and NAA/CHO ratios compared with the valproate and valproate+quetiapine groups and the healthy controls. The lower NAA/CRE and NAA/CHO ratios remained statistically significant even after covarying for age or whole brain volume compared with the valproate and valproate+quetiapine groups and healthy controls. In post hoc comparisons, a significant difference was found between the valproate+quetiapine group and the valproate group only with regard to NAA/CHO.\nOur findings suggest that valproate has a neuroprotective effect. In post hoc comparisons, a significant difference was found between the valproate+quetiapine and the valproate group with regard to NAA/CHO, indicating that the addition of quetiapine further increases the level of NAA and provides an additional neuroprotective effect."}, {"Title": "Maximum likelihood estimation of marginal pairwise associations with multiple source predictors.", "Abstract": "Researchers interested in the association of a predictor with an outcome will often collect information about that predictor from more than one source. Standard multiple regression methods allow estimation of the effect of each predictor on the outcome while controlling for the remaining predictors. The resulting regression coefficient for each predictor has an interpretation that is conditional on all other predictors. In settings in which interest is in comparison of the marginal pairwise relationships between each predictor and the outcome separately (e.g., studies in psychiatry with multiple informants or comparison of the predictive values of diagnostic tests), standard regression methods are not appropriate. Instead, the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach can be used to simultaneously estimate, and make comparisons among, the separate pairwise marginal associations. In this paper, we consider maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of these marginal relationships when the outcome is binary. ML enjoys benefits over GEE methods in that it is asymptotically efficient, can accommodate missing data that are ignorable, and allows likelihood-based inferences about the pairwise marginal relationships. We also explore the asymptotic relative efficiency of ML and GEE methods in this setting."}, {"Title": "[How successful is inpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry?

The development of this system of care was due in great part to the model program of the German Federal Government for the reform of mental health care that comprised 14 model regions, out of which the region of Marburg and its surrounding counties was the only one with a focus on the situation of psychiatrically ill children and adolescents. With the aid of this model program, a comprehensive evaluation of existing psychiatric services was carried out and at the same time, new services for this clientele were established such as a mobile child and adolescent psychiatric service and a day hospital. A particular focus was laid on the development of a complete network of psychiatric services with manifold, and over the years well proven, cooperation measures. Finally, the quality of mental health care was significantly increased by a continuous evaluation of services and the implementation of two institutes for psychotherapeutic training.

The objective of this paper is to review the current literature on combining non-clozapine atypical antipsychotics as well as discussing the theoretical benefits and risks, and summarizing the implications for clinical practice. We found in cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, where clozapine is deemed inappropriate, combination therapy with non-clozapine atypical antipsychotics is a strategy worthy of consideration. Combinations using olanzapine with either amisulpride or risperidone--or quetiapine with risperidone--in theory act on different receptor profiles and in the limited data available have shown improvement in symptoms, been used most frequently, and on balance have more data on safety. Initial case reports suggest that aripiprazole combined with non-clozapine atypicals may worsen psychosis. The current literature, however, has significant limitations. For this reason, due to the lack of data on safety, caution is recommended. There needs to be further well-designed studies with the aim to specifically investigate the effects of combination therapy to allow the clinician to better balance the risks and benefits (both clinical and economical) of treatment."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepines--a necessary evil? A survey of prescribing at a specialist UK psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Guidelines on the prescription of benzodiazepines recommend their use be limited to the short-term relief of severe anxiety or insomnia. However, clinical experience suggests that in psychiatry these drugs may be being prescribed more widely. The aim of this survey was to investigate benzodiazepine prescribing in a specialist UK psychiatric hospital using a structured interview with consultant psychiatrists. Prescribers were also asked their views on the UK CSM guidance on benzodiazepines (1988). Of 412 inpatients, 77 (18.7%) were receiving 90 benzodiazepine prescriptions for psychiatric indications. Most prescriptions were for anxiety (45/90; 50.0%), aggression (23/90; 25.6%) and agitation (13/90; 14.4%). Use was commonest for acquired brain injury, schizophrenia and personality disorders. Much usage was chronic (only 4/90 (4.4%) prescriptions had been initiated within the previous 4 weeks) and off-label (85/90; 94.4%). Prescribers were concerned about the addictive nature of benzodiazepines for these patients and to a lesser extent about their abuse potential. Most consultants believed the UK CSM guidance was too restrictive in relation to their clinical practice and needed modification to encompass new indications, for example rapid tranquillization, and specialist prescribing. In psychiatry benzodiazepines are quite frequently used in the management of a number of groups of difficult-to-treat patients. Although largely not evidence based, some psychiatrists report a favourable risk-benefit ratio for benzodiazepines in the treatment of certain patients."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based guidelines for management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adolescents in transition to adult services and in adults: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established diagnosis in children, associated with a large body of evidence on the benefits of treatment. Adolescents with ADHD are now leaving children's services often with no readily identifiable adult service to support them, which presents problems as local pharmacy regulations often preclude the prescription of stimulant drugs by general practitioners (GPs). In addition, adults with ADHD symptoms are now starting to present to primary care and psychiatry services requesting assessment and treatment. For these reasons, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) thought it timely to hold a consensus conference to review the body of evidence on childhood ADHD and the growing literature on ADHD in older age groups. Much of this initial guidance on managing ADHD in adolescents in transition and in adults is based on expert opinion derived from childhood evidence.

The synthesis of these clinical observations led to Magnan's \"intermittent madness\" (1893), a precursor of Kraepelin's \"manic-depressive psychosis\". After 1899, French authors generally adhered to their classification of autonomous depressive disorder (melancholia), as distinct from manic-depressive insanity, thereby foreshadowing (much before the work of such Germanophone authors as Leonhard [Leonhard, K., 1957 (1979 tr).

To select the expert therapists, a database search for the keywords \"borderline personality disorder\" and \"border-line case\" was carried out in the Japanese literature on psychiatry and clinical psychology. Thus, 280 expert therapists, who were authors of articles related to the psychotherapy of BPD, were selected. Qestionnaires on individual psychotherapy of BPD were sent to them, and 128 responses were obtained. About 60% of these therapists were performing structured individual psychotherapy. This was about half of the psychiatrists and almost all of the clinical psychologists. Most of the structured psychotherapy was performed once a week, with 50 minute sessions. But there also were biweekly, 30-39 minute, 40-49 minute, and 20-29 minute sessions. The basic therapeutic methodology was psychoanalytic psychotherapy, supportive psychotherapy, and eclectic therapy, with each of them constituting about one third of the total, in this order of percentage. In the case of structured individual psychotherapy, what the majority of the therapists performed is as follows. They talked about therapeutic goals. When talking about therapeutic goals, the focus was on realistic issues such as improving social adaptation, controlling impulsive behavior or reducing the symptoms. In the face of self-harm behavior, they talked about the meaning and the utility of self-harm behavior, listened to the progression of the episodes, or said it was definitely not a good thing to do. If the self-harm behaviors were repeated, they told the patients that it was necessary for them to be confined to the closed-ward, or told them that the continuation of psychotherapy might become difficult. When there was intense anger toward the therapists, they validated the rightful parts of it. Concerning the anger and depression of the therapists, they restrained their feelings and considered them later, talked about it with their colleagues and experts, or communicated to the patients their honest feelings. In the case of frequent telephone calls, they told their patients to reduce their calls as much as possible, but when the calls came, talked with them briefly. Or they allotted the times the patients could make a call. Disclosure of the private information of the therapists was not done at all, or was done sometimes according to the situation. They actively talked about the limitations of the therapists and the patient-therapist relationship. They appreciated and praised the achievements of the patients. They talked about the termination of the psychotherapy. When they happened to meet the patients outside of the therapy, they responded to the patients only when they were addressed, or they addressed the patients by themselves but just briefly.

However, our body of knowledge continues to accumulate, and our approaches continue to be refined. When we remember that 40 years ago the field was still arguing about the existence of depression in youth, it is clear that significant progress has been made. Recent controversies have provided another opportunity to step back and re-evaluate. Given the chronicity, morbidity, and mortality associated with adolescent depression, the risks of doing nothing are too great. Evidence-based research has provided us with some direction during this unsettling time. After careful reviews, the major professional organizations representing pediatric medicine and psychiatry all support the continued use of SSRI antidepressant medications but emphasize close monitoring. The debates also have heightened interest in effective psychotherapy approaches, particularly CBT and IPT. Given the risk for suicidality in depressed adolescents, assessment and management of safety concerns remain critical, regardless of medication usage. Above all, it is most important that we remain hopeful about our ability to guide adolescents and families through the struggles with depression toward recovery."}, {"Title": "Pain and psychiatry: a critical analysis and pharmacological review.", "Abstract": "Pain is one of the most difficult medical problems to diagnose and treat and can be a common symptom of several psychiatric disorders. Pain-related issues are heterogeneous and often underestimated or misinterpreted, with the result that psychiatric interventions, which might have been beneficial from the outset, are often delayed or requested only as a last measure. Several problems arise from the definition, classification and assessment of pain, when documented according to the different scales which are commonly used, since these attempt to cover a multitude of analytical requirements, without really succeeding. An area of constant debate regards the connection between pain and various psychiatric disorders, and the difficulty in the classification of pain disorders within the currently existing framework. The pharmacological treatment of pain is complex and implies a variety of different compounds, from opioids to psychotropic medications like antidepressants and anticonvulsivants. This paper explores the mutual and reciprocal influence between pain and psychiatric disorders reviewing the latest developments in the definition, assessment and treatment of pain, with special emphasis on the impact of pain on psychiatric disorders (and vice versa), and on the use of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of pain syndromes."}, {"Title": "The use of telemedicine in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper examines the potential effects of using video-conferencing within the field of mental health in the UK. In order to assess the usefulness of telepsychiatric services, an electronic search was conducted for articles published between August 1998 and July 2006 using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and Telemedicine and Information Exchange (TIE) databases. The search was carried out using the following terms: telepsychiatry, videoconferencing and telepsychology. A total of 178 articles were identified and based on review of the abstracts 72 were identified as being specific to efficacy, cost-effectiveness and satisfaction with psychiatric services delivered via videoconferencing. This paper concludes that the use of video conferencing can enhance psychiatric services within the UK especially for those patients who live in rural areas. Current advances in technology make this an increasingly more reliable and cost-effective method for assessing patients. The limitations of telemedicine are discussed and it is clear that this type of care is not suitable for all patients. Further research is required to assess the types of patients that telepsychiatry is most suitable for."}, {"Title": "Problematizing special observation in psychiatry: Foucault, archaeology, genealogy, discourse and power/knowledge.", "Abstract": "Special observation by mental health professionals is the recommended approach for those people deemed as at risk or risky. Recent research and academic writing have challenged the benefits of observing people/patients who are defined as 'at risk', and a more human engagement process is being recommended. Despite this assault, practice has not changed substantively, suggesting a need for a thorough exploration and questioning of the practices and process. The paper outlines three Foucaultian approaches to historical analysis. It applies aspects of Foucault's archaeology/genealogy, discourse and power/knowledge to explore the practices of special observation as a means of controlling risk, especially suicide risk. We identify the regulatory function of the 'gaze', professional codes and government policy in relation to restricting professional practices. We argue that observation can be related to moral therapy, wherein the person relinquishes madness for responsibility through a disciplinary process and, in governing risk, a 'professional industry' is created. The regulation of statements about people with mental health issues are exposed and related to what can be said and done by professionals. Finally, we look at productive power in relation to observation, and how it is intimately related to resistance. We conclude with 'soft' recommendations for practice discursively produced through the writing of the paper."}, {"Title": "Sexual health education for people with mental health problems: what can we learn from the literature?", "Abstract": "Research into sexual risk behaviour among people with 'severe' mental health problems suggested that they are likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviour, for a number of reasons, putting them at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. The aim of this review is to describe approaches, content and outcomes of sexual health education programmes, developed and implemented for people with mental health problems. A literature review from 1980 to 2005 was carried out using the electronic databases CINAHL, PsycINFO, British Nursing Index, Pubmed and Medline, and the Cochrane library was also searched. The literature search was confined to papers written in English. The keywords 'sexuality', 'sexual health education', 'sexual health promotion', 'HIV', 'sexually transmitted disease' were combined with 'mental illness', 'chronic mental illness''severe mental illness''persistent mental illness''psychiatry', 'mental disorder', 'education interventions' and 'evaluation'. A vast amount of literature was recovered on sexual risk behaviour in people with severe mental health problems, and sexual dysfunction as a result of prescribed medication. As the focus of the review was on sexual health education, this literature was omitted. Although the literature on sexual health education for people experiencing mental health problems was sparse, 14 studies were located that either described or evaluated sexual health education programmes. Most sex education programmes focused on topics such as HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, negotiating safe sex and skill development in condom use. Findings suggested that the people who attended benefited from sexual health education programmes, facilitated in a sensitive and supportive manner. Education tended to produce a reduction in sexual risk behaviour as opposed to complete cessation. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider integrating such education with service provision. The results of the review provide guidance to service providers and mental health nurses wishing to develop and evaluate sexual health education programmes for service users. Areas for future research are also identified."}, {"Title": "[A detection of very mild Alzheimer's disease and MCI by memory complaints and deterioration of IADL in a questionnaire for a memory clinic].", "Abstract": "There have been very few studies trying to explain about daily life features of patients with very mild Alzheimer disease (AD) and of those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The purpose of this study was 1) to clarify characteristics of very mild AD and MCI in their daily life, and 2) to examine items in a questionnaire that can be useful for detecting subjects of suspected AD.\nSubjects were 111 patients of the memory clinic in National Center Hospital for Mental, Nervous, and Muscular Disorders, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan; 39 normal range, 28 MCI, and 44 very mild AD. On their first visits, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire consisted of 103 items. Thirty five items in a questionnaire were selected, 15 memory-complaint items and 20 items of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and examined retrospectively. At first we compared each set of groups using the chi-square test. Then a logistic regression analysis was used to observe which items contributed to judge a person to be suspected of AD. And further, sensitivity and specificity for discriminating between an AD suspected and a normal range were examined.\nNone of the items showed statistical significance between MCI group and very mild AD group. Then, we combined these two groups into one group (n = 72), and made comparison between this new group and normal range group (n = 39). There were 18 items that showed statistical significance between the two groups. And five of them, 'dysfunction of memory: noticed by others', 'dysfunction of memory: getting worse', 'unable to utilize the memorandum', 'forget incidents occurred a few days ago' and 'unable to locate unfamiliar places' showed significantly high odds ratio in judgment on a person to be suspected of AD. In addition to preceding 5 items we adopted two items, 'dysfunction of memory: unnoticeable by her/himself' and 'unable to manage household expenses', which were not included in the logistic regression analysis, but were essential for the discrimination between the two groups. The sum of score of these 7 items showed high specificity and sensitivity for dividing between the two groups.\nThese findings indicated that an exploration of memory complaints and deteriorations of IADL was useful for the detection of MCI and very mild AD, especially 7 items described above could be used as a simple questionnaire for the elderly."}, {"Title": "Suicide attempts by burning.", "Abstract": "Setting oneself ablaze is an uncommon method of attempting suicide. Ten patients with deliberate thermal injuries had been evaluated by a consultation psychiatry service over a 15-year period. Schizophrenia and major depression were the more common diagnoses, and most patients had prior psychiatric histories. When compared to 1,864 people who attempted suicide by other means, the burn subjects were older, comprised a larger percentage of African Americans, and resembled those who had jumped from high places. Stresses encountered by recovering burn patients involved dependency, body image concerns, exacerbation of pre-existing depression, pain, flashbacks of the incident, and guilt intensified by their proximity to accidentally burned victims. Problems for burn unit staff included feelings of discomfort with difficult, potentially suicidal individuals, and responsibilities to perform painful procedures. Recommendations for psychiatric care include pharmacotherapy for depression or psychosis, visitation by previously self-burned individuals who serve as role models, patients' visualization of their injuries, and behavioral techniques to diminish reliance on analgesic drugs and to increase a personal sense of control. Suggestions for assisting staff include liaison support, personnel debriefing sessions, and inservice presentations on emotional aspects of burn management."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with frequent admissions to an acute geriatric psychiatric inpatient unit.", "Abstract": "As a first step toward developing strategies to reduce the frequency of psychiatric hospitalizations, the authors retrospectively collected and analyzed demographic and clinical variables from 424 consecutive admissions to a university-based geriatric psychiatry inpatient unit over a 20-month period. The study sample was dichotomized into patients who were admitted more than one time (35.6%) versus those with a single admission. Factors associated with rehospitalization were examined with multivariate logistic regression analysis. The great majority of readmissions (81%) occurred in the first 3 months after discharge. The logistic regression model indicated that significant predictors of rehospitalization were single relationship status, male gender, and bipolar disorder diagnosis. Our findings overlap with findings from previous similar studies and suggest that information readily obtainable on admission to an acute geriatric psychiatry inpatient unit may provide a useful indication of risk for frequent psychiatric hospitalizations and may contribute to readmission prevention strategies."}, {"Title": "Is it appropriate to use core clerkship grades in the selection of residents?", "Abstract": "This study challenges the appropriateness of using core clerkship grades for resident selection. The authors hypothesize that substantial variability occurred in the system of grading.\nIn this retrospective cross-sectional study, variability in the grading systems for third-year core clinical clerkships were examined. From the Medical Student Performance Evaluation of applicants from U.S. medical schools for residency training in the authors' department in 2004 and 2005, the authors gathered the following variables: medical school, third-year core clerkship grading systems, and percentage of students in each grade category. Descriptive analyses were conducted and within institution variability across clerkship scores was analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test.\nUniversity teaching hospital.\nThe survey covered 121 of 122 U.S. medical schools accredited by the AAMC/LCME.\nGrading systems used included: variations of Honors/Pass/Fail (H,P,F) system in 76 schools, letter grade systems in 22 schools, and other variants (eg, Outstanding, Advanced, and Proficient in 6 schools and Pass/Fail in 4 schools). Thirteen schools (10%) provided either no grading system or no interpretable system. Grading systems included were further defined into 2 scores in 6 schools, 3 in 34 schools, 4 in 38 schools, 5 in 23 schools, and more than 6 in 6 schools. For schools using a grading system containing 3 or more scores, the percentage of students given the highest grade was significantly less in Surgery (28%) compared with Family Medicine (34%) and Psychiatry (35%) (p = 0.001).\nCore clerkship grading systems and the percentage to which institutions grade students as having achieved the highest performance level vary greatly among U.S. medical schools. Within institutions, significant variability exists among clerkships in the percentage of the highest grade given, which makes interpersonal comparison based on core clerkship grades difficult and suggests that this method may not be a reliable indicator of performance."}, {"Title": "A case of factitious subcutaneous emphysema.", "Abstract": "A 13-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of recurrent soft tissue swelling of her right upper extremity.

The suicide risk in this group has been estimated to be almost five times higher than expected. This article addresses two questions: Do Swedish CAP patients continue to risk premature death and what kind of information related to psychiatric symptoms and/or behavior problems can predict later suicide?\nHospital files, Sweden's census databases (including immigration and emigration) and administrative databases (including the Swedish Hospital Discharge register and the Persons Convicted of Offences register), and the Cause of Death register were examined to determine the mortality rate in a group of 1,400 former CAP inpatients and outpatients over a period of 12-33 years. Observed and expected numbers of deceased were calculated with the prospective method and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) method. The relative risk or the risk ratio (RR) is presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Significance level tests were made using two-by-two tables and chi-square tests. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used for survival analysis.\nTwenty-four males and 14 females died. Compared with the general population, the standardized mortality ratio in this group of CAP patients was significantly higher in both sexes. Behavioral problems, school problems, and co-morbid alcohol or drug abuse and criminality (including alcohol-related crimes) were found to be important predictors. Thirty-two deaths were attributed to suicide, intoxication, drug overdose, or accident; one patient died of an alcohol abuse-related disorder, and five patients died of natural causes. Suicide was the most common cause of death, but only 2 of these 19 cases were initially admitted for attempted suicide.\nWe suggest that suicide and death prevention among CAP patients may not be a psychiatric issue per se but a future function of society's juvenile social-welfare investments and juvenile-delinquency prevention programs."}, {"Title": "The management of ADHD and associated problems in a young person with cleidocranial dysostosis (CCD) and mild intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that comorbidity is common in all fields of psychiatry, and furthermore, it is acknowledged that a large number of individuals with genetically determined conditions have associated behavioural phenotypes, and are more susceptible to particular psychiatric and psychological comorbidities than others. It is also recognized that the identification of such phenotypes enables clinicians to be more aware of the potential difficulties an individual may experience, and hence, facilitate early diagnosis, effective management and prevention, appropriate allocation of resources and psychoeducation for the individual and their family. We describe the case report of a girl with cleidocranial dysostosis (CCD), and comorbid intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and suggest the possible existence of a behavioural phenotype.

Re-designs of G-DRG system were undertaken in 2005 and 2006. Parallel to implementation requirement- and resource-based self-adjustment of this new reimbursement system has been established by law. Adjustments performed in 2005 and 2006 are examined with respect to their effect on reimbursements in treatments of children with oncological, hematological, and immunological diseases.\nAn unchanged population of 349 patients associated with 1,731 inpatient stays of a Clinic of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Immunology in 2004 was analyzed by methods and means of G-DRG systems 2004, 2005, and 2006. DRGs and additional payments for drugs and procedures eligible for all and/or individual hospitals were calculated.\nG-DRG system 2005 resulted in overall reimbursement loss of 3.77 % compared to G-DRG 2004. G-DRG 2006 leads to slightly improved overall reimbursements compared to G-DRG 2005 by increasing DRG-based revenues. G-DRG 2006 effects 2.40 % reduction in overall reimbursement compared to G-DRG 2004. This loss includes ameliorating effects of additional payments for drugs and blood products already. Despite introduction of additional payments especially designed for children and teenagers in 2006, additional payment volume is decreased by 21.71 % from 2005 to 2006. G-DRG 2006 yields over-all reimbursement losses of 1.45 % in comparison to G-DRG 2004. Overall reimbursements include introduced additional payments for drugs and blood products. (Reimbursements resulting out of DRG payment alone drop by 14.73 % from 2004 to 2005, and increase by 3.26 % from 2005 to 2006 (2004 vs. 2006 11.95 %). Introduction of additional payments for drugs and blood products on a Germany-wide basis introduced in 2005 dampens DRG-based reimbursement losses. Despite introduction of dosage intervals specifically designed for children and adolescents in 2006, reimbursement of additional payments for drugs and blood products decrease by 21.71 % from 2005 to 2006. An important revenue-balancing function is attributed to additional charges individual for each hospital according to Par. 6 Section 2 (New diagnostic and therapeutic methods) and Section 2 a KHEntgG (German Hospital Reimbursement Law) with respect to financing tertiary care focusses. If possible to attain, those charges may partially equalize losses. Including these additional charges per individual hospital balance of summarized additional charges is -3.89 % from 2005 to 2006. However, fraction of additional payments on total reimbursements increases from 0.64 % in 2004 to 11.98 % in 2005, and 11.24 % in 2006, respectively.\nThe G-DRG system in its versions 2005 and 2006 results in lowering overall reimbursements of a pediatric hematology, oncology, and immunology department compared to initial status in 2004. The growing chargeability of additional payments ameliorate this effect."}, {"Title": "Which family factors predict children's externalizing behaviors following discharge from psychiatric inpatient treatment?", "Abstract": "Parents' behavior management practices, parental stress, and family environment are highly pertinent to children's conduct problems. Preadolescents' psychiatric hospitalization usually arises because of severe conduct problems, so the relationships of family-related variables to postdischarge functioning warrant investigation. This study examined postdischarge clinical course and select family factors to model outcomes via a) predictors measured at admission, b) predictors measured concurrently with outcome, and c) changes in predictor values from admission through follow-up.\nIn a prospective follow-up of 107 child psychiatry inpatients, caregivers completed rating scales pertaining to their child's behavior, parenting practices, parenting stress, caregiver strain, and their own psychological distress at admission and three, six, and 12 months after discharge.\nThe magnitude of reductions in parenting stress between admission and follow-up bore the strongest relationship to improvements in externalizing behavior. The largest and most sustained decreases in externalizing behavior arose among youngsters whose parents reported high parenting stress at admission and low parenting stress after discharge. By contrast, children whose parents reported low parenting stress at admission and follow-up showed significantly less postdischarge improvement. Parenting stress changes were not attributable to changes in behavioral symptoms. Parenting stress eclipsed relationships between behavior management practices and child outcomes, suggesting that parenting stress might have a mediational role.\nHigh initial parenting stress disposed to better outcomes over the year of follow-up. Consistently low stress predicted less improvement. Higher stress at admission may imply more advantageous parent-child relationships or motivation for subsequent persistence with treatment. Interventions that ameliorate high stress may warrant further study. Low parenting stress might signify disengagement, or, alternatively, that parents of some chronically impaired children become rather inured to fluctuations in behavioral problems. If confirmed, further examination of these and other accounts for a relationship between low parenting stress and suboptimal child outcome seems warranted."}, {"Title": "The augmentation of clozapine treatment with electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "The assessment, in terms of safety and efficacy, of augmenting clozapine monotherapy, as well as combined psychopharmacotherapy involving clozapine, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nReviewed were the charts of patients who received clozapine-ECT treatment in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Semmelweis University between November 1999 and December 2003.\nDuring the studied period there were altogether 43 patients treated with the combination of clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy.

For the present study, we used the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) to evaluate the personality traits and psychological status of patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Fifty-nine outpatients with CIU and 59 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Patients were included if no specific cause for their urticaria could be identified by detailed history and appropriate investigations. Psychiatric evaluation for all patients and controls was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry by using MMPI. Analysis of the MMPI profile showed that the scores for hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance, paranoia, psychasthenia, schizophrenia, and social introversion were higher in patients with CIU compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The mean score of hysteria was significantly higher in women. There were no significant correlations between the scores of MMPI and duration of the disease. These data indicate that our patients with CIU seem to have more depressive, hysteric, touchy and suspicious personality traits with hypochondriac tendencies and in more conflict with their social environment. Attitudes such as perfectionism, need for approval, external control and need to be loved were also characteristics of the patient group.

Atropine coma was used in the period between 1950 and 1975 mainly in the treatment of various psychoses and obsessive compulsive disorder. In a previous communication the method, indications and adverse effects of atropine coma were outlined and the professional and broader social reasons for its eventual disappearance were discussed. In this paper the therapeutic effectiveness and research into the biological mode of action of atropine coma are summarized. Although thousands of patients received atropine coma therapy in the United States and in several Central-Eastern European countries including Hungary, this therapeutic modality is hardly ever features even in papers on the history of psychiatry. This is all the more surprising because initial therapeutic results with atropine coma were favourable and it seemed to be a more safe and efficient treatment than the more widely used insulin coma."}, {"Title": "[Interaction between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy--neurophysiologic basis].", "Abstract": "Linking of pharmacotherapy and physiotherapy is considered the most effective approach in psychiatry of our days.

The requirements for community treatment of severely ill and chronic psychiatric patients are complex and, together with financing by the different social insurance providers, may lead to a rather problematic fragmentation of health service supply. Schizophrenia is considered the most expensive mental illness in Germany. It is estimated that indirect costs (expressed in financial terms) are five times higher than the direct costs of treatment and care. Innovative concepts of psychosocial intervention show that case management and assertive community treatment reduce the hospitalisation rate and duration of inpatient treatment, enhance social integration, and find the approval of most patients. However, there is no empirical evidence supporting this \"psychiatry with no beds\". Consideration should be given to psychosocial interventions as an alternative to inpatient hospital treatment such as day hospital care, crisis houses, or acute home treatment."}, {"Title": "Trust, choice and power in mental health: a literature review.", "Abstract": "Trust, choice and empowerment of patients are emerging as important issues in mental health care. This may be due to an increasingly consumerist attitude amongst patients and as a consequence of postmodern cultural changes in society. This study aimed to find evidence for the influence of trust, patient choice and patient empowerment in mental health care. A literature review was undertaken. Six searches of PubMed were made using the key terms trust, patient choice and power combined separately with psychiatry and mental health. The literature search found substantial research evidence in the areas of trust, choice and power including validated scales measuring these concepts and evidence that they are important to patients. Trust in general health clinicians was found to be high and continuity of care increases patients' trust in their clinician. However, only qualitative research has been found on trust in mental health settings and further quantitative studies are needed. Patient choice is important to patients and improves engagement with services, although studies on outcome show varying results. Empowerment has impacted more at an organisational level than on individual care. Innovative research methodologies are needed to expand on the present significant body of research, utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques."}, {"Title": "Clinical trials of PUFAs in depression: State of the art.", "Abstract": "Omega fatty acid treatment of depression is an unusual story in psychopharmacology in that the use and study of these compounds were advanced in cardiovascular disease before becoming of interest in psychiatry.

Three groups of 8, a total group of 24, composed of students completing their third year were included in the interviews. The students in this study had completed their practical training in the departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry and public health. Among the problems mostly encountered by students, as established by the study, were inadequate assessment by the clinical educator, judgment, negative feedback, communication problems, inadequate guidance and overload. At the end of the research, recommendations were that educators should offer information in the direction of student expectations, increase their positive feedback and lighten the academic workload of these students."}, {"Title": "[A nine-year controlled follow-up study of delirium patients discharged after treatment in a psychogeriatric university department].", "Abstract": "Although delirium is a reversible cerebral syndrome, the effect of treatment of the elderly is unsatisfactory, involving prolonged hospitalizations and increased risk of relapse and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether hospitalization for delirium (severe delirium) diagnosed by ICD-10 criteria predicts increased morbidity, utilization of health services and mortality.\nDelirious inpatients (n = 26) discharged after treatment in an old-age psychiatric university clinic were studied for nine years. In a register-based design, the above-mentioned parameters of the delirium cohort were compared with a group of controls (n = 116).\nThere was a trend to increased mortality in the delirium cohort. Compared with the controls, the delirium cohort had a significantly increased incidence of disorders of vital organs, serious psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, increased use of hospital psychiatry and general practitioner's out-of-hours service, but less use of office-hour services. The incidence of delirium in the cohorts was low. In the delirium cohort, there was no significantly increased use of services or the number of diagnoses in somatic hospitals.\nIncreased somatic and psychiatric morbidity and a trend to increased mortality indicate a serious prognosis after severe delirium in the elderly. It is noteworthy that the delirium cohort had increased use of GPs' out-of-hours services but less use of office-hour services."}, {"Title": "An investigation of interpretive bias in insomnia: an analog study comparing normal and poor sleepers.", "Abstract": "Cognitive theories state that psychological disorders are associated with, and are possibly maintained by, interpretive biases, which are tendencies to make threatening interpretations of ambiguous stimuli. Recent models of insomnia have highlighted the importance of cognitive processes. The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate whether an interpretive bias is present in poor sleepers.\nA mixed-design analysis of covariance was employed with group (normal sleepers vs poor sleepers) as a between-subjects variable and sentence type (insomnia-related vs anxiety related) as a within-subjects variable. The dependent variables were the extent to which participants interpreted insomnia-related and anxiety-related sentences as having a threatening meaning. Sleepiness was used as a covariate.\nTreatment and research clinic at a university department of psychiatry.\nForty-one normal and 34 poor sleepers.\nA set of ambiguous scenarios were administered to participants who gave open-ended and forced-choice interpretations of the scenarios. Each scenario could be interpreted in a threat (insomnia or anxiety)-related or neutral manner. Even after controlling for sleepiness, poor sleepers were found to make significantly more threat-related interpretations of ambiguous scenarios than did normal sleepers.\nThese findings suggest that there is a bias toward threat-related interpretations among poor sleepers and that the exploration of biased interpretations may be an important avenue for future research among individuals who meet full diagnostic criteria for insomnia."}, {"Title": "[Smooth pursuit and saccadic tests outcome in healthy persons in different age].", "Abstract": "The study of eye movement presents a unique opportunity to investigate the integrity of central ocular-motor pathways and structures, involved in the generation and control of ocularmotor reflexes, which is important in the diagnosis of rate balance system in otoneurology. In psychiatry, oculography is useful for the evaluation of schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive and affective disorders as well as the effectiveness of psychoactive drugs.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the results of smooth pursuit and saccadic tests in healthy persons in respect to age and stimulus paradigm.\nSixty seven subjects in different age: 16--young (mean 29.8 years), 38--middle-aged (mean 53.2 years) and 13--elderly (mean 73.6 years) were enrolled in the study. Oculographic tests were performed on the computerized ENG system. The pursuit target was driven by a predictable sinusoidal task at various frequencies 30 Hz, 40 Hz, 50 Hz and amplitudes of 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees. In the saccades test the target moved abruptly 15 degrees left and right of the centre. In all tests, several parameters and the 95% prediction interval (95 PI) were calculated.\nIn the smooth pursuit test gain decreased with ageing. The differences between age groups (younger-middle-age and younger-elderly) were statistically significant for each target velocity. In this study we found no significant evidence that age has an impact on the parameters of saccadic tests.\nThese findings suggest that the results of oculomotor tests should be quantified by the age of the patient and the target task."}, {"Title": "[The circumstances of using physical restraint in psychiatric services].", "Abstract": "Adequate law regulations specify conditions under which mentally disordered persons may be submitted to physical restraint. Medical staff who decide on the application of physical restraint play the role of police. They limit the liberty of mentally disordered persons to protect society against their dangerous behaviour. Protection of patients' health gives the possibility of using physical restraint on the basis of medical circumstances. A literature review shows the different range of physical restraint use in comparable medical units. It suggests that medical staff decisions about the use of physical restraint can be dependent not only on dangerous behaviour but on different specific and non-specific factors. The aim of this article is to analyse factors which can have influence on applying of physical restraint in mentally disordered persons. Description of specific circumstances in which physical restraint is used can help in the optimization of psychiatric treatment and requires further research in both psychiatry and law."}, {"Title": "Quality of life of relatives of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects the lives of both patients and their relatives. Clinical observations suggest that family members of patients with OCD are involved in the patients' rituals, often impairing their own everyday life.\nThe objective of this study was to compare the quality of life (QoL) of relatives of patients with OCD with that of the general German population.\nSeventy-four relatives (29 parents, 33 spouses, 8 children, and 4 siblings) of patients with OCD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision F42.0-F42.2) were recruited from the outpatient clinic for anxiety disorders of the University of Leipzig Department of Psychiatry. The WHOQOL-BREF, a self-administered questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, assessed QoL. These findings were compared with the QoL of a representative sample of the general German population.\nCompared with that of the general population, the QoL of relatives of patients with OCD was significantly lower in the domains physical well-being, psychologic well-being, and social relationship.\nObsessive-compulsive disorder has an adverse effect on the subjective QoL of relatives of patients with OCD. Therefore, these findings suggest that professionals working with relatives must focus not only on the care given to persons with an illness but also on their relatives' situation and personal QoL."}, {"Title": "Physicians' interpretation of the prognostic term \"terminal\": a survey among Norwegian physicians.", "Abstract": "Optimal clinical practice depends upon a precise language with common understanding of core terms. The aim of the present study was to examine how Norwegian physicians understand the commonly used but poorly defined term \"terminal\".\nA questionnaire was mailed to 1605 Norwegian physicians, representative of the Norwegian medical community. Nine hundred and sixty-eight responded and defined \"terminal\" in expected weeks left to live. The effects of gender, age, specialty, and experience with prognostication toward end of life on the estimation of \"terminal\" were investigated.\nNorwegian physicians on average expect a \"terminal\" patient to have 3.6 (+/- 3.5 SD) weeks to live with expectation ranging from 0 to 26 weeks. The majority (83.5%) defined \"terminal\" as less than 5 weeks' survival; 15.0% as 5 to 12 weeks' survival and 1.5% as more than 12 weeks' survival. No difference between genders was observed, whereas the youngest physicians (27-39 years) held shorter definitions than the other age groups. Physicians in internal medicine, surgery, and anaesthesiology held significantly shorter estimations of \"terminal\" than did physicians in general practice, public health, and psychiatry.\nOur study shows that the majority of Norwegian physicians restrict \"terminal\" to the last 2-4 weeks of patients' lives. A life expectancy of a few days compared to several weeks should lead to different clinical actions. Efforts should therefore be made to come to a common definition of the term. In our opinion the use of \"terminal\" should be limited to when death is expected within a few days."}, {"Title": "Effects of nutrients (in food) on the structure and function of the nervous system: update on dietary requirements for brain. Part 1: micronutrients.", "Abstract": "The objective of this update is to give an overview of the effects of dietary nutrients on the structure and certain functions of the brain. As any other organ, the brain is elaborated from substances present in the diet (sometimes exclusively, for vitamins, minerals, essential amino-acids and essential fatty acids, including omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids). However, for long it was not fully accepted that food can have an influence on brain structure, and thus on its function, including cognitive and intellectuals. In fact, most micronutrients (vitamins and trace-elements) have been directly evaluated in the setting of cerebral functioning. For instance, to produce energy, the use of glucose by nervous tissue implies the presence of vitamin B1; this vitamin modulates cognitive performance, especially in the elderly. Vitamin B9 preserves brain during its development and memory during ageing. Vitamin B6 is likely to benefit in treating premenstrual depression. Vitamins B6 and B12, among others, are directly involved in the synthesis of some neurotransmitters. Vitamin B12 delays the onset of signs of dementia (and blood abnormalities), provided it is administered in a precise clinical timing window, before the onset of the first symptoms. Supplementation with cobalamin improves cerebral and cognitive functions in the elderly; it frequently improves the functioning of factors related to the frontal lobe, as well as the language function of those with cognitive disorders. Adolescents who have a borderline level of vitamin B12 develop signs of cognitive changes. In the brain, the nerve endings contain the highest concentrations of vitamin C in the human body (after the suprarenal glands). Vitamin D (or certain of its analogues) could be of interest in the prevention of various aspects of neurodegenerative or neuroimmune diseases. Among the various vitamin E components (tocopherols and tocotrienols), only alpha-tocopherol is actively uptaken by the brain and is directly involved in nervous membranes protection. Even vitamin K has been involved in nervous tissue biochemistry. Iron is necessary to ensure oxygenation and to produce energy in the cerebral parenchyma (via cytochrome oxidase), and for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and myelin; iron deficiency is found in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Iron concentrations in the umbilical artery are critical during the development of the foetus, and in relation with the IQ in the child; infantile anaemia with its associated iron deficiency is linked to perturbation of the development of cognitive functions. Iron deficiency anaemia is common, particularly in women, and is associated, for instance, with apathy, depression and rapid fatigue when exercising. Lithium importance, at least in psychiatry, is known for a long time. Magnesium plays important roles in all the major metabolisms: in oxidation-reduction and in ionic regulation, among others. Zinc participates among others in the perception of taste. An unbalanced copper metabolism homeostasis (due to dietary deficiency) could be linked to Alzheimer disease. The iodine provided by the thyroid hormone ensures the energy metabolism of the cerebral cells; the dietary reduction of iodine during pregnancy induces severe cerebral dysfunction, actually leading to cretinism. Among many mechanisms, manganese, copper, and zinc participate in enzymatic mechanisms that protect against free radicals, toxic derivatives of oxygen. More specifically, the full genetic potential of the child for physical growth ad mental development may be compromised due to deficiency (even subclinical) of micronutrients. Children and adolescents with poor nutritional status are exposed to alterations of mental and behavioural functions that can be corrected by dietary measures, but only to certain extend. Indeed, nutrient composition and meal pattern can exert either immediate or long-term effects, beneficial or adverse. Brain diseases during aging can also be due to failure for protective mechanism, due to dietary deficiencies, for instance in anti-oxidants and nutrients (trace elements, vitamins, non essential micronutrients such as polyphenols) related with protection against free radicals. Macronutrients are presented in the accompanying paper."}, {"Title": "The health-care environment on a locked psychiatric ward: an ethnographic study.", "Abstract": "Recent changes in psychiatric hospital care involving a reduction in the number of beds and time spent in hospital motivated the study of conditions of inpatient care on such wards. An ethnographic study of a locked, acute psychiatric ward in a department of psychiatry was performed with the aim of describing the health-care environment in such a ward. The ward admitted patients on both a voluntarily and involuntarily basis. Data were collected by means of 3.5 months of participant observations. The results showed a health-care environment that was overshadowed by control. Staff were in control but they also lacked control; they attempted to master the situation in line with organizational demands and they sometimes failed. At the same time, the staff tried to share the responsibility of caring for patients and next of kin. Patients were controlled by staff; they were the underdogs and dependent on staff for their care and the freedom to leave the ward. Patients tried to make themselves heard and reacted to the control by developing counter-strategies. What this study adds to earlier research is patients' pressure on staff and sometimes quite an open struggle for more control, which may be an expression for an unacceptable imbalance in power between patients and staff."}, {"Title": "Serious untoward incidents and their aftermath in acute inpatient psychiatry: the Tompkins Acute Ward study.", "Abstract": "Serious untoward incidents, or sentinel events (suicide, homicide, suicide attempt, serious assault, and absconding of high-risk patients) occur from time to time in association with acute psychiatric inpatient wards. The aim of this study was to discover the impact of serious untoward incidents on inpatient wards. Doctors, nurses, and occupational therapists at three hospitals were interviewed about these events and their impact on their wards. Staff reported feelings of shock, depression, demoralization, upset, loss, and grief, followed by ruminations, guilt, and anxiety. Levels of containment increased, as did the focus on risk assessment. Processing of the emotional impact was hindered by the pace of ward life, a lack of external support, and management investigations. Patient responses were largely ignored. A few staff responded negatively, hindering service improvements. Much more attention needs to be given to the needs of the patient group following incidents. Substantial planning, organization, and investment are required to properly prepare for such events and manage their outcome. Without this planning and action, acute inpatient work has the capacity to be damaging to staff."}, {"Title": "Sex influences on cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in elderly individuals with Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "The second generation of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) is approved in the United Kingdom for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). The UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence has raised questions, however, about whether ChEIs are cost-effective for the treatment of dementia. To address these concerns, it is important to identify factors that predict which patients may have the best response to ChEl treatment.\nWe reviewed animal studies and human clinical studies to address whether sex can predict and influence the response to ChEI treatment based on differences in neuroanatomy, pharmacokinetics, and prevalence of dementia.\nRelevant articles examining the use of ChEIs in humans with dementia (especially in AD) and in animals were identified through searches of several databases, including MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE for general medical topics, the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register and CINAHL DIRECT for nursing and allied health issues, and PsycLIT for reviews of psychology and psychiatry topics (1980 June 2006). Articles reviewed were limited to those that discussed the use of ChEIs in relation to sex.\nAnimal studies have produced a substantial amount of evidence to support the hypothesis that sex may influence the response to ChEIs and, in particular, that testosterone may play a significant role in producing this difference by its influence on the entry of ChEIs into the brain. The results of clinical studies in humans, on the other hand, have been mixed. Two double-label and open-label clinical studies suggested that there may be a 3-way interaction between apolipoprotein E genotype, sex, and tacrine (range, P = 0.03 to P = 0.05). Seven double-blind, open-label clinical trials and 13 case studies of donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine produced little evidence of an association between treatment outcomes (as measured with clinical rating scales) and sex, although in an open-label 2-year study in women with AD treated with donepezil, women had lower mortality rates than men (10% and 20%, respectively; P = 0.003). One study produced weak evidence that women treated with ChEIs may experience more adverse effects than men, but this may have been attributable to low body weight rather than to sex differences.\nA substantial relation has not been established between sex and the second-generation ChEIs currently used in clinical settings for the treatment of AD. If an interaction between sex and ChEI treatment does exist, as suggested in 10 of the studies we analyzed, it is likely to be small and subtle, with much individual variation, as is the case with most neurologic sex differences. Nevertheless, sexual dimorphism in response to ChEI therapy warrants further investigation, especially in regard to its role in the development of novel AD therapies."}, {"Title": "Escitalopram for comorbid depression and anxiety in elderly patients: A 12-week, open-label, flexible-dose, pilot trial.", "Abstract": "Comorbid depression and anxiety may result in greater symptom severity and poorer treatment response than either condition alone.

There is type 1a evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease; and for the use of bright light therapy and aromatherapy. There is type 1a evidence of no effect of anti inflammatory drugs or statins. There is conflicting evidence regarding oestrogens, with type 2a evidence of a protective effect of oestrogens but 1b evidence of a harmful effect. Type 1a evidence for any effect of B12 and folate will be forthcoming when current trials report. There is type 1b evidence for gingko biloba in producing a modest benefit of cognitive function; cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of people with Lewy body disease (particularly neuropsychiatric symptoms); cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in treatment cognitive impairment associated with vascular dementia; and the effect of metal collating agents (although these should not be prescribed until more data on safety and efficacy are available). There is type 1b evidence to show that neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor vitamin E reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in people with mild cognitive impairment; and there is no evidence that there is any intervention that can prevent the onset of dementia. There is type 1b evidence for the beneficial effects of adding memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors, and type 2b evidence of positive switching outcomes from one cholinesterase inhibitor to another.

Given the lack of guidelines to assist health professionals with this issue, we have prepared multidisciplinary recommendations for responding to a DTDS, underpinned by key principles of therapeutic communication and a systematic review of empirical literature. Where the relevant literature was lacking, the recommendations were drafted by the authors (clinicians and/ or academics from the following disciplines: nursing, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, sociology, aged care and theology), based on their expert opinion.

The children were placed in one of three behavior problem groups (low behavior problems, risk for externalizing problems, risk for mixed externalizing/internalizing problems) based on their scores on the Child Behavior Checklist for 4-18-year-olds [Achenbach, T.M., 1991.

In addition, heart period (HP) and heart period change (HR acceleration) was examined. Results indicated that the behavior problem groups did not differ in terms of resting measures of either RSA or HP. Analyses of the challenge tasks indicated that the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater cardiac vagal withdrawal across the five tasks than did the other two groups of children. There was a trend for the children at risk for externalizing problems to display less vagal withdrawal than the control group. In addition, the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater heart rate acceleration to the tasks than did the other two groups of children. Follow-up analyses indicated that the greater cardiac acceleration observed in the mixed group was largely a function of greater vagal withdrawal. These findings are discussed in terms of the emotion regulatory function of cardiac vagal regulation, and its implications for patterns of risk for behavior problems in young children."}, {"Title": "Comparison of two diagnostic systems for Complicated Grief.", "Abstract": "To date, there are mainly two diagnostic systems that have been proposed for the diagnosis of Complicated Grief [Horowitz, M.J., Siegel, B., Holen, A., Bonanno, G.A., Milbrath, C., Stinson, C.H., 1997.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of gender, personality traits, career motivation and life goal aspirations on the choice of medical specialty.\nAs part of a prospective cohort study of Swiss medical school graduates on career development, 522 fourth-year residents were asked in what specialty they wanted to qualify. They also assessed their career motivation and life goal aspirations. Data concerning personality traits such as sense of coherence, self-esteem, and gender role orientation were collected at the first assessment, four years earlier, in their final year of medical school. Data analyses were conducted by univariate and multivariate analyses of variance and covariance.\nIn their fourth year of residency 439 (84.1%) participants had made their specialty choice. Of these, 45 (8.6%) subjects aspired to primary care, 126 (24.1%) to internal medicine, 68 (13.0%) to surgical specialties, 31 (5.9%) to gynaecology & obstetrics (G&O), 40 (7.7%) to anaesthesiology/intensive care, 44 (8.4%) to paediatrics, 25 (4.8%) to psychiatry and 60 (11.5%) to other specialties.

Gender had the strongest significant influence on specialty choice, followed by career motivation, personality traits, and life goals. Multivariate analyses of covariance indicated that career motivation and life goals mediated the influence of personality on career choice. Personality traits were no longer significant after controlling for career motivation and life goals as covariates. The effect of gender remained significant after controlling for personality traits, career motivation and life goals.\nGender had the greatest impact on specialty and career choice, but there were also two other relevant influencing factors, namely career motivation and life goals.

Early intervention and vocational rehabilitation in first-episode psychosis: employing cautious optimism.", "Abstract": "While there are now effective interventions for the symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia, treatment for the functional domains of these illnesses has received less attention. A key area affected by psychotic illness is vocational functioning. This area is currently of interest to clinicians, policy-makers, politicians and patients. This paper reviews several forms of vocational intervention practised over the years and highlights the issues around adopting an early intervention approach towards vocational rehabilitation. The paper has four aims: first, to consider some of the consequences of unemployment for those with psychotic illnesses; second, to review methods that have been used to address unemployment among the mentally ill; third, to highlight the importance of vocational development at a developmentally appropriate life stage; and finally, to consider the application of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation to those with first-episode psychosis.\nAn initial broad literature search was conducted using PsychInfo and Medline databases. Further narrower searches were conducted electronically where indicated. Finally, some articles were sourced through manual searches of relevant journals.\nPeople with psychotic illness have a high rate of unemployment at the outset of their illness which tends to worsen over time. This is complicated by systemic factors such as the structure of the welfare system. Approaches for assisting people with mental illness return to work have evolved over the history of psychiatry. There now exists an evidence-based method of intervention. To date this has not been trialled in a systematic way with people in the early stages of psychotic illness.\nThere is cause for cautious optimism in the vocational recovery of people with psychotic illnesses. Limited evidence exists that the individual placement and support approach developed with chronic populations is very effective in early episode patients. There are a number of challenges to implementing vocational intervention in first-episode psychosis. Overcoming these obstacles will require the cooperation of clinicians, those with illness, policy-makers and politicians.

These symptoms resolved within 1 week of discontinuing baclofen. Rechallenge with baclofen resulted in reemergence of psychotic symptoms, which disappeared after discontinuing baclofen.\nReemergence of psychotic symptoms after rechallenge with baclofen suggests baclofen-induced psychosis. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable association of baclofen with this patient's psychosis. The absence of underlying mood disorder makes this case different from previously reported ones.\nBaclofen may be associated with the occurrence of psychosis.

The aim of this article was to assess the application of these consensus criteria and to discuss the barriers for achieving remission. An electronic literature search of studies published between January 1990 and December 2005 examining the concepts of remission, compliance and patient satisfaction in schizophrenia was performed using Medline and EMBASE. The primary research parameters were 'schizophrenia', 'remission', 'antipsychotics', 'atypicals' and 'conventional'. Abstracts and posters presented at key psychiatry congresses during this period were also reviewed, where available in the public domain. To date, the remission criteria have been applied retrospectively to a number of clinical studies, and these have demonstrated that the proposed definition of remission correlates significantly with established measures of symptom severity, functioning and quality of life, and appears achievable and sustainable for a significant proportion of patients receiving pharmacotherapy. The atypical antipsychotic agents have been shown to impact favourably upon certain factors that play an integral part in the achievement of remission, such as negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, social functioning and quality of life. However, non-compliance with medication remains widespread due to illness-, treatment- and clinician-related factors. The use of long-acting antipsychotic agents, with their assured medication delivery, may facilitate compliance and improve long-term treatment outcomes, possibly assisting patients in achieving remission. Remission may, therefore, be considered as a current goal of treatment today, not a distant future aim."}, {"Title": "Symptom domains of schizophrenia: the role of atypical antipsychotic agents.", "Abstract": "Given their more obvious presentation, the reduction of positive symptoms and their associated behavioural problems have been considered the most important treatment outcome parameter in patients with schizophrenia. However, the development of the atypical antipsychotic agents in the early 1990s resulted in the adoption of more wide-reaching measures of therapeutic outcome. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of currently available atypical agents across multiple symptom domains of schizophrenia with a specific focus on negative symptoms, neurocognition, social functioning, quality of life and insight. As such, studies published between January 1990 and December 2005 that evaluated the clinical efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in different symptom domains of schizophrenia were reviewed as identified from literature researches using MEDLINE and Embase. Abstracts and posters presented at key psychiatry and schizophrenia congresses during this period were also reviewed where available in the public domain. Results from the studies identified have consistently demonstrated that atypical antipsychotics have substantial advantages over conventional antipsychotics with a broader spectrum of efficacy across symptomatic domains of schizophrenia as proven by greater improvements in negative symptoms and cognitive function and a beneficial effect on affective symptoms and quality of life. However, their clinical advantages have often been limited by patients' partial compliance with therapy. As such, the development of a long-acting atypical antipsychotic agent may provide a new and valuable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic and neurophysiologic aspects of transcranial magnetic stimulation in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in psychiatry provides the therapeutic field with a new tool. Since its introduction in the mid 1980s, the vast majority of studies have focussed on depression. A growing body of evidence suggests that rTMS is effective in the treatment of depression if dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is stimulated. Less is known about its efficacy in schizophrenia. Neuroimaging investigations in schizophrenia suggest abnormalities in the prefrontal and temporoparietal cortex (TPC), which are correlated with psychopathological dimensions. Based on its modulatory effect, rTMS seems to be a promising tool in exploring cortical excitability and reducing auditory hallucinations (AH) and negative symptoms. Neurophysiologic studies of patients suffering from schizophrenia using rTMS indicate high cortical excitability and a lack of transcallosal inhibition. In the therapeutic field, researches provide encouraging results, even though some studies indicate limited benefits. The most promising therapeutic effect seems to be the capability of rTMS to reduce AH if TPC is targeted using slow-frequency. The current paper aims to provide a review of the literature of the use of rTMS in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Allopurinol as an adjunct to lithium and haloperidol for treatment of patients with acute mania: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Allopurinol, a hypouricemic agent, has been shown to present therapeutic effects in mania associated with hyperuricemia. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an adjunctive agent to lithium and haloperidol for the treatment of acute mania in hospitalized bipolar patients.\nEighty-two patients aged between 18 and 49 were eligible to participate, as they met the DSM-IV criteria for a current manic episode, on the basis of a clinical interview by two academician psychiatrists. In addition, a score of at least 20 points on the Young Mania Rating Scale was required representing at least a moderate-to-severe mania. Forty-one patients were randomly allocated to lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + allopurinol (300 mg/day) (group A) or lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + haloperidol (10 mg/day) + placebo (group B) for an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were assessed by a third-year resident of psychiatry at baseline and at 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days after the medication started. The mean decrease in the Young Mania Rating Scale score from baseline was used as the main outcome measure of response of mania to treatment. The extrapyramidal symptoms were assessed using the Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS). Side effects were systematically recorded throughout the study and were assessed using a checklist.\nYoung Mania Rating Scale scores improved with allopurinol. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of the group, the between-subjects factor (F = 5.22, df = 1, p = 0.008). The mean ESRS scores for the placebo group were higher than the allopurinol group. However, the differences were not significant over the trial. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant except for agitation that was more often in the placebo group.\nThe efficacy of allopurinol to obtain a greater improvement in patients with mania seems to support the purinergic dysfunction in mania."}, {"Title": "Approximate entropy as a measure of irregularity for psychiatric serial metrics.", "Abstract": "The quantification of subtle patterns in sequential data, and their changes, has considerable potential utility throughout psychiatry, including the analyses of mood ratings, heart rate, respiratory, and electroencephalographic recordings.\nApproximate entropy (ApEn), a relatively recently developed statistic quantifying serial irregularity, has been applied in numerous studies throughout mathematics and other fields of study, especially biology.\nWe discussed applications of ApEn, both extant and potential, of most relevance to psychiatrists. We provided a mechanistic interpretation of lowered ApEn values, and discusses the relationship between ApEn and other (both classical and complexity) measures of serial dynamics. We also briefly discussed cross-ApEn, a thematically similar quantification of two-variable asynchrony that can aid in uncovering subtle disruptions in complicated network dynamics.\nApEn and cross-ApEn have significant potential to consequentially enhance present statistical methodologies of analysis of psychiatric data, in both clinical and in research settings."}, {"Title": "Occupational therapists' reflection on practice within psychiatric care: a Delphi study.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the reflections on practice in a group of Swedish occupational therapists in psychiatric care in order to illuminate the present practice and ideas about the future using a Delphi survey of three rounds.\nThe sample consisted of 14 occupational therapists in psychiatric care. The answers from the first and second rounds illustrate the wide variation in their practice. The third round points out consensus and disagreements in the domains: professional role, theories in practice, domain of concern, occupational therapy assessment, goal setting/treatment, outcome/evaluation and thoughts about the future. A consensus was reached in all domains, but not regarding competence to treat functional reduction and symptoms, or on the importance of theories for documentation, the choice of a theoretical foundation, and the importance of an evidence-based treatment model, although the theories were seen as supporting practice. Disagreements were found as to the effectiveness of repeated assessments as a means of evaluation.

Out of 283 women, 104 received psychiatric treatment at the Department for Psychiatry of the University Clinical Center Tuzla, 50 women were refugees; and 129 were domicile inhabitants of the Tuzla Canton. Domestic Violence Inventory, Cornell Index, Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, PTSD Checklist Version for Civilians, and Beck Depression Inventory were used for data collection. Basic sociodemographic data and information from the medical documentation of the Department for Psychiatry of the University Clinical Center Tuzla was also collected.\nOut of 283 women, 215 (75.9%) were physically, psychologically, and sexually abused by their husbands. Among the abused, 107 (50.7%) experienced a combination of various forms of domestic violence. The frequency of domestic violence was high among psychiatric patients (78.3%). Victims of domestic violence had a significantly higher rate of general neuroticism, depression, somatization, sensitivity, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and paranoid tendency than women who were not abused. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms according to the type of trauma was higher in women with the history of childhood abuse (8/11) and domestic violence (53/67) than in women who experienced war trauma (26/57) and the loss of loved ones (24/83).

Because MHP patients believe that their complaint is dermatological, not psychiatric, they often admit to several other medical disciplines before coming to a psychiatry clinic. This leads to a series of time-consuming examinations and treatment interventions. In this case report, we emphasize the importance of diagnosing the illness correctly and referring the patient to a psychiatrist. The patient presented in this report has been treated with a new generation neuroleptic, olanzapine. This treatment has led to complete resolution of delusional symptoms. Therefore, we conclude that knowing that MHP is a psychiatric illness allows early establishment of diagnosis and successful treatment."}, {"Title": "[Working memory: neuropsychological and neurobiological issues].", "Abstract": "Working memory denotes an ability to remember information for a short-time and to manipulate it. The memory allows including correct information depending on the situation, to keep the information on present activities for a while and enables changing the reaction according to new criteria. The relation between working memory and efficiency of complex cognitive processes and also with the control of emotional processes, plasticity of behaviour and consciousness was demonstrated. Working memory is connected with the activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the brain. Recently, it has been shown, that working memory disturbances play an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of psychiatric disturbances such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Working memory disturbances are also shown in a proportion of healthy first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. Working memory disturbances are presently regarded as a cognitive endophenotypic marker of vulnerability to these illnesses. In recent years, an association between working memory abilities and activity of different neurotransmitters, especially with the dopaminergic system in the brain, has been shown. Molecular genetic studies show an association between working memory abilities and polymorphism of the dopaminergic system genes in schizophrenia and polymorphism of BDNF gene in bipolar affective disorders. So far not much data about the genetics of working memory in healthy subjects has been gathered.

We examined the results along with the referral rates to try to identify factors that may affect a consultation-liaison psychiatry service. Generally, knowledge was poor and attitudes towards psychiatry negative in both groups. This negatively influenced the referral rates and reflected the lack of integration of psychiatry and medicine at the training level.

It is connected with the processing of information brought about by significant social stimuli. Recently, social cognition is a topic of intensive research in psychology, neurosciences and psychiatry. Processes involved in social cognition include: perception of emotion, input of eye contact, reaction to voice prosody or decision-making in social situations. A particular role is played by the mentalizing capabilities (mind-reading) i.e. ability to interpret behaviour of others by attributing them certain mental states. Such an ability is often conceptualized as the Theory of Mind (ToM). This paper is a review of issues connected with disturbances of social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. Deficits in perceptions of face emotion and disturbances of Theory of Mind function in schizophrenia were discussed with special regard to their potential role as endophenotypes of vulnerability to schizophrenia. Also, relations between social cognition and basic neurocognitive processes were presented, as well as the effect on social cognition of different methods of schizophrenia treatment."}, {"Title": "Ethical issues in exercise psychology.", "Abstract": "Exercise psychology encompasses the disciplines of psychiatry, clinical and counseling psychology, health promotion, and the movement sciences.

Exercise psychology offers many opportunities for growth while positively influencing the mental and physical health of individuals, communities, and society. However, the exercise psychology literature has not addressed ethical issues or dilemmas faced by mental health professionals providing exercise psychology services. This initial discussion of ethical issues in exercise psychology is an important step in continuing to move the field forward.

This study aimed at obtaining information about: type of health professionals contacted by patients at putative risk for psychosis on their help-seeking pathways; number of contacts; type of symptoms leading to contacts with health professionals; interval between initial contact and referral to a specialised outpatient service.\nThe help-seeking pathways were assessed as part of a prospective study in 104 patients with suspected at-risk states for psychosis.\nThe mean number of contacts prior to referral was 2.38. Patients with psychotic symptoms more often contacted mental health professionals, whereas patients with insidious and more unspecific features more frequently contacted general practitioners (GPs).\nGPs have been found to under-identify the insidious features of emerging psychosis (Simon et al. (2005) Br J Psychiatry 187:274-281). The fact that they were most often contacted by patients with exactly these features calls for focussed and specialised help for primary care physicians.

Although phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs have been reported to directly interact with the peripheral plasma membrane, it is not known whether these drugs actually affect plasma membrane integrity in the central nervous system. To clarify these issues, we investigated the effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ), a typical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug, on plasma membrane permeability in fresh rat brain slices using a dynamic positron autoradiography technique and [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG) as a tracer. Treatment with CPZ (> or =100 microM) resulted in the leakage of [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate, but not [(18)F]FDG, suggesting that the [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate efflux was not mediated by glucose transporters, but rather by plasma membrane permeabilization. The leakage of [(18)F]FDG-6-phosphate was followed by slower leakage of cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that CPZ could initially induce small membrane holes that enlarged with time. Furthermore, the addition of CPZ (> or =100 microM) caused a decrease in 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy, which implies an increase in membrane fluidity. CPZ loading dose-dependently increased both membrane permeability and membrane fluidity, which suggested the involvement of a perturbation of membrane order in the mechanisms of membrane destabilization induced by antipsychotic drugs."}, {"Title": "Ruminative worrying during pregnancy: a case series.", "Abstract": "Most women worry to some extent during pregnancy about exposure to agents that might harm their babies.\nWe describe three women who worried excessively throughout pregnancy about harming their babies because of exposure to agents including, but not limited to, psychotropic drugs.

They place special emphasis on the professional development of the academic psychiatrist.\nThe authors review and use literature on adult psychological development as a formative template upon which a prototypical psychiatrist proceeds through a telescoping series of adult developmental stages. At each stage of clinical development, specific tasks are identified and outlined, and articles from the academic psychiatry literature are cited to provide content-specific examples of the development of academic and clinical habits of importance to those psychiatrists who then develop an academic career.\nThe clinical development of the psychiatrist follows either a continuous or episodic process that parallels the broader themes of adult development, allowing for optimal integration of the interests and skills of the individual in a niche within the increasingly diverse field of psychiatry. For the academic psychiatrist, a continuation of this model applies to development as a clinical instructor and researcher.\nOptimum developmental attention to clinical habits and skills begins in medical school and proceeds sequentially throughout subsequent career stages, correlating with subsequent stages of adult development. The authors describe in functional terms strategies for successful navigation of these challenges in clinical habits development. At all stages, mentorship and supervision are highly encouraged, as is attention to macrolevel changes in the clinical and administrative milieu."}, {"Title": "[Characteristics of patient aggression in a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland].", "Abstract": "Characteristics of patient aggression in a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland Patient aggression in psychiatry is a prominent problem for all concerned. In this prospective survey we registered and analysed all violent incidents of patients in a cantonal psychiatric hospital in Switzerland in order to determine the characteristics of aggression. The Staff Observation Aggression Scale Revised (SOAS-R) was utilised. During the study period 815 patients were admitted to the hospital. 71 (63.4%) of the 110 violent incidents were perpetrated by male patients. The majority of aggressive incidents were perpetrated in the vicinity of the rooms of the patients and were triggered mainly by the refusal to adhere to the demands of the patient or by patients' use of toxic substances. The most frequent type of aggression was of a verbally aggressive nature and the principal target was nursing personnel who felt threatened in most of the cases. In order to terminate the aggression the most predominant measure was communication with the patient and coercive measures. This study demonstrates clearly that aggression concerns psychiatric nursing personnel and points to the recommendation to reinforce measures of security and to predictive measures to ameliorate the management of aggression."}, {"Title": "Model-based clustering using S-PLUS.", "Abstract": "Cluster analysis can be used to identify homogenous subgroups in many fields, including psychology and psychiatry. However, most clustering methods implemented in general-purpose statistical packages are heuristic and can be criticized in principle for their lack of an underlying statistical model. Furthermore correlations between variables are generally ignored by standard methods. The question addressed here is whether currently available commercial software (S-PLUS), which provides model-based methods for clustering correlated continuous data, should be used for clustering data derived from questionnaires. Such data may be either continuous or ordinal in nature and typically exhibit correlations. Performance is assessed in this study on simulated data sets containing distinct multivariate normal subpopulations, both before and after mapping the simulated data onto an ordinal scale. A practical example showing how correlated data can be cluster-analysed using these methods is given. The conclusion is that model-based methods are certainly worthwhile for continuous data. However, their benefit, in particular their ability to deal with correlated data, is not marked for ordinal data. Simpler methods such as Ward's method may be almost as effective in this situation."}, {"Title": "[The frequency of some factors in pregnancy and delivery for Icelandic children with ADHD].", "Abstract": "ADHD is a well known psychiatric disorder that begins in childhood and frequently persists into adulthood. In the last decade numerous studies have shown the importance of genetic factors in the etiology of ADHD. However other etiological factors seem to be involved. The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of some possible etiological factors for ADHD in Icelandic children diagnosed with ADHD. The study is descriptive.\nThe participants were 196 children referred for suspected ADHD to the outpatient unit of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Landspitali University Hospital during a 2 year period 1998-1999. The participants had either ICD-10 or DSM-IV hyperkinetic disorder and/or ADHD and the information was obtained from patient case notes. Information provided by parents in a questionnaire concerning health in pregnancy and the perinatal period was retrospectively analysed.\nThe main results show statistically significant increased risk for ADHD associated with several factors such as low birthweight, young age of the mother at the time of the child's birth and Caesarean section, compared with reference groups such as mean values in all of the community. Other factors such as birthweight, alcohol or tobacco use in pregnancy, use of medication in pregnancy or vacuum extraction did not show statistically significant association with ADHD.\nThe results indicate as some studies from other countries have suggested that an association exists between a number of factors in pregnancy, delivery and perinatal period and ADHD, even though there is still not enough evidence to confirm definite etiological factors."}, {"Title": "Monoamine transporter gene polymorphisms and antidepressant response in koreans with late-life depression.", "Abstract": "Polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) may influence antidepressant response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Its systematic therapeutic application in psychiatry has historically been associated with classical psychoanalysis. As psychoanalysis has lost its cachet, and as drug treatment has replaced psychotherapy as psychiatry's major treatment modality, the therapeutic potential of transference risks being neglected. This is to the great detriment of psychiatric patients. Knowledge of the power of transference and expertise in its clinical use in psychotherapy should be the most powerful tool in the psychiatric therapeutic armamentarium.

Despite being broad and fostering an 'anything goes' mentality, it fails to provide much guidance as a model. In recent years, the biological school has gained prominence and now is under attack from many quarters. Critics tend toward dogmatism themselves, usually of postmodernist or libertarian varieties. Three alternate approaches include pragmatism, integrationism, and pluralism. Pluralism, as technically defined here based on the work of Karl Jaspers, rejects or accepts different methods but holds that some methods are better than others for specific circumstances or conditions.\nThe compromise paradigm of biopsychosocial eclecticism has failed to sufficiently guide contemporary psychiatry.

The study was conducted by the Addiction Clinic, Department of Psychiatry, Medical University Vienna and other nine European cities.\nData were collected by structured face-to-face interviews. The sample was composed of 211 cocaine abusers out of three target groups: (1) treatment group undergoing opioid maintenance therapy, (2) marginalized scene group and (3) integrated party group. Sociodemographic data such as age, education, employment, monthly expenses on cocaine/crack, data on consumption patterns, physical and mental health and personal needs regarding cocaine consumption were evaluated. Urine toxicology results for cocaine in the treatment group completed the analysis.\nThe marginalized scene group was the oldest with a mean age of 29.35 years, with the highest unemployment rate (mean 25.11 days) and the longest duration of cocaine consumption (mean 5.80 years). They had the highest cocaine consumption pattern with a mean of 22.32 days within the last month. On average 1969 Euros/months was spent for their addiction. The treatment group had the lowest school education with a mean of 10.36 years, but showed a sufficient insight in their cocaine problem. However, the party group (with the lowest mean age, 25.64 years) highly underestimated their drug problem, the mean amount of money they spent for their addiction was 588.99 Euro/months. Structured urine toxicology between 1996 and 2002 in patients undergoing opioid maintenance therapy (\"treatment group\") revealed a significant increase of concomitant cocaine consumption (1996: 33.1%; 2002: 40.2%; p = 0.044).\nThe European trend of increased cocaine use could also be observed in Vienna. One of the greatest barriers for establishing adequate treatment settings for this target group is the difficulty to reach this population. In addition, multiple substance abuse seems to be one of the predominating patterns of cocaine consumption and this aspect should be integrated within treatment (in the treatment and scene groups additional heroin and benzodiapzepines abuse is observed, in the party group intensive alcohol consumption). The Viennese results are in line with those of the other European cities; however, it could not be confirmed that consumption of crack cocaine and binge play a similarly significant role as in cities such as Hamburg or London."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacologic treatment of aggressive preschoolers: a chart review.", "Abstract": "Very young children with severe aggression are a growing focus of care in child psychiatry.

Thus, the integration of various types of treatment is essential and the process of integration will be efficiently managed if a psychiatric clinic works as a center of the therapeutic network. Formerly, long-term in-patient treatment was regarded as the best choice for treating the patient thoroughly. Nowadays such treatment is not recommended due to the large cost involved in such treatment. Also, removing the patient from a community environment and confining them to an institution over a long period is now regarded as discouraging independence. Thus, the focus of treatment has shifted from in-patient to out-patient treatment. A new model for multi-disciplinary work is now needed because sharing patient information between professionals is more difficult at the outpatient clinic than on an in-patient ward with shared case notes. In order to make the treatment network functional, patients themselves are expected to possess a clear understanding of the illness and its treatment. The application of motivational enhancement theory is useful in this respect. It is the responsibility of psychiatric clinics to encourage the continuous improvement of patient motivation for treatment and to make patients tolerant towards changes in treatment settings."}, {"Title": "[Pharmacogenetics and tailored drug treatment in schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Medical treatment of psychiatric disorders is often characterised by trial and error. Psychotropic drugs show a large variation in response and side effects. Molecular genetic techniques seem to have a potential for identifying biological predictors of drug response and side effects, and help to establish tailored drug treatment.\nBased on relevant literature and own research, this article gives a short overview of some pharmacogenetic aspects related to pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.\nAntipsychotic and antidepressive drugs are metabolized by many different enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system. The rate of the drug-metabolism depends to some extent on genetic variants, and several gene-variants affect the serum level of the drugs, which may cause side effects or non-response. Several pharmacogenetic studies have indicated that both the therapeutic response and the level of motor and metabolic side effects of antipsychotic drug treatment of schizophrenia are related to polymorphisms in the serotonine and dopamine receptor genes, but there are conflicting findings.\nHowever, most of these data remain preliminary, and so far pharmacogenetics has been of little practical help for clinical psychiatry. Due to the progress in molecular genetics and improved quality of clinical studies, there is a hope that a new generation of psychiatric pharmacogenetic studies will provide us with more useful information for drug treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive deficits in major depression and a new theory of ADHD: a model of impaired antagonism of cholinergic-mediated prepotent behaviours in monoamine depleted individuals.", "Abstract": "The study builds on the propositions introduced in a companion paper on the neuropharmacology of cognition and its relation to key findings in psychiatry. Cognitive inhibition is often invoked to explain performance in psychiatric illness. Yet it remains only a general conceptual model of executive dysfunction. Premotor theory proposes both neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological equivalents of conscious and unconscious processes. The interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission is stated to have an inverse effect on these two fundamental psychological processes. If one conceives of cognitive inhibition as a failure to voluntarily suppress unconscious prepotent responses, then a deficit in monoaminergic antagonism of cholinergic facilitated prepotent responses accounts for the observed behavioural phenotypes. The plasticity of behaviour is further hypothesized to have an equivalent in intracellular signalling leading to plastic changes in neural networks. Apart from inhibition of prepotent responses it permits the formulation of new behavioural phenotypes. At the receptor level Gi-Gq/11 transduction coupling is proposed to mediate this effect. A hypofunctioning monoaminergic system is thought to underlie the clinical pictures of major depression and ADHD. The neurocognitive deficits of depression include memory loss, poor concentration and rumination. ADHD is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Both these syndromes effectively respond to raising serotonin and dopamine levels, respectively. The core symptoms can usefully be attributed to an imbalance between the neuromodulatory effects of monoamines and ACh. Taking the model of monoaminergic-muscarinic receptor interactions presented previously and extended here, a new hypothesis is proposed for the core symptoms of ADHD. Accordingly, impulsivity and hyperactivity result from impaired dopaminergic inhibition and remodelling of muscarinic mediated prepotent responses. The model also predicts memory impairment in major depression by proposing that low serotonin levels in the neocortex is linked to focal hippocampal dysfunction. Hippocampal theta is proposed to trigger phasic monoaminergic activation involved in encoding of cortical traces and plasticity of propotent networks. It proposes a hypothesis for the enhancement of mood and behaviour induced by antidepressants is partly a response to plasticity of neural networks, that is, remodelling of cholinergic-mediated negative habitual behaviours."}, {"Title": "Predictive factors for polypharmacy among child and adolescent psychiatry inpatients.", "Abstract": "Aim was to determine the predictive factors for polypharmacy among inpatient children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders.\nBlinded, case-note review of children and adolescents with ICD 10 diagnosis of psychiatric disorders on psychotropic medication was conducted.

Although insurers and other payers are covering some services in the USA, the rationale for these coverage decisions is not always evidence-based. We reviewed the literature for telemedicine services that substitute for face-to-face medical diagnosis and treatment. We focused on three types of telemedicine services: store-and-forward, home-based and office/hospital-based services. Studies were included if they were relevant to at least one of the three study areas, addressed at least one key question and contained reported results. We excluded articles that did not study a service requiring face-to-face encounters (i.e. teleradiology was excluded). Our search initially identified 4083 citations. After review, 597 were judged to be potentially relevant at the title/abstract level. Following a full-text review, 106 studies were included. Store-and-forward services have been studied in many specialties, the most common being dermatology, wound care and ophthalmology. The evidence for their efficacy is mixed. Several limited studies showed the benefits of home-based telemedicine interventions in chronic diseases. Studies of office/hospital-based telemedicine suggest that telemedicine is most effective for verbal interactions, e.g. videoconferencing for diagnosis and treatment in specialties like neurology and psychiatry.

Recently, it has become increasingly clear that altered promoter DNA methylation could play a critical role in mediating differential regulation of genes and in facilitating short-term adaptation in response to the environment. Here, we report the investigation of the differential activity of membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT) due to altered promoter methylation and the nature of the contribution of COMT Val158Met polymorphism as risk factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by analyzing 115 post-mortem brain samples from the frontal lobe. These studies are the first to reveal that the MB-COMT promoter DNA is frequently hypomethylated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, compared with the controls (methylation rate: 26 and 29 versus 60%; P=0.004 and 0.008, respectively), particularly in the left frontal lobes (methylation rate: 29 and 30 versus 81%; P=0.003 and 0.002, respectively). Quantitative gene-expression analyses showed a corresponding increase in transcript levels of MB-COMT in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients compared with the controls (P=0.02) with an accompanying inverse correlation between MB-COMT and DRD1 expression. Furthermore, there was a tendency for the enrichment of the Val allele of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism with MB-COMT hypomethylation in the patients. These findings suggest that MB-COMT over-expression due to promoter hypomethylation and/or hyperactive allele of COMT may increase dopamine degradation in the frontal lobe providing a molecular basis for the shared symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "Effect of repeated treatment with fluoxetine on tryptophan hydroxylase-2 gene expression in the rat brainstem.", "Abstract": "Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine are widely used in the treatment of depression and anxiety; however, the mechanisms underlying their action and particularly the delay in therapeutic onset remain unclear. It is proposed that 5-HT reuptake inhibitors exert their therapeutic activity by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission; therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of repeated treatment with fluoxetine (25 mg/kg/day p.o., 14 days) on expression of genes coding for proteins that involved in the synthesis and reuptake of 5-HT. Exposure of animals to plus-maze conditions on the first day of drug administration produced an increase in baseline anxiety on subsequent trial 2 weeks later. Fluoxetine strengthened the anxiogenic effects of maze experience. Two-week fluoxetine treatment also significantly reduced expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) and 5-HT transporter mRNAs as determined by RT-PCR in the brainstem. These changes were consistent with the decreased 5-HT levels and 5-HT turnover in the brain, and might contribute to the anxiogenic effects of the drug. The results also suggest that recently found association between treatment responses to fluoxetine and polymorphic variants of human TPH2 gene [Peters EJ, Slager SL, McGrath PJ, Knowles JA, Hamilton SP.

To assess self-face recognition (SFR), participants were presented images of faces of themselves and others and asked to make rapid 'unfamiliar', 'familiar' and 'self' judgments. As a measure of ToM, subjects were administered the Revised Mind in the Eyes Test (MET [Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Hill, J., Raste, Y., and Plumb, I., 2001.

Specific ToM deficits in schizophrenia were replicated. There was a relationship between accuracy rates on the MET and SFR tasks. High levels of schizotypal traits such as social anxiety, constricted affect and no close friends were important for both tasks.\nFace recognition deficits and ToM deficits in schizophrenia are apparent. The critical influence of high levels of select schizotypal traits is also highlighted. A deficit in relatives of schizophrenia patients raises the possibility that ToM and face recognition deficits may be candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia.

Sleep is also important for optimal cognitive functioning, and sleep disruption results in functional impairment. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in psychiatry. At any given time, 50% of adults are affected with 1 or more sleep problems such as difficulty in falling or staying asleep, in staying awake, or in adhering to a consistent sleep/wake schedule. Narcolepsy affects as many individuals as does multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease. Sleep problems are especially prevalent in schizophrenia, depression, and other mental illnesses, and every year, sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, and sleepiness add billions to the national health care bill in industrialized countries. Although psychiatrists often treat patients with insomnia secondary to depression, most patients discuss their insomnia with general care physicians, making it important to provide this group with clear guidelines for the diagnosis and management of insomnia. Once the specific medical, behavioral, or psychiatric causes of the sleep problem have been identified, appropriate treatment can be undertaken. Chronic insomnia has multiple causes arising from medical disorders, psychiatric disorders, primary sleep disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, social or therapeutic use of drugs, or maladaptive behaviors. The emerging concepts of sleep neurophysiology are consistent with the cholinergic-aminergic imbalance hypothesis of mood disorders, which proposes that depression is associated with an increased ratio of central cholinergic to aminergic neurotransmission. The characteristic sleep abnormalities of depression may reflect a relative predominance of cholinergic activity. Antidepressant medications presumably reduce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep either by their anticholinergic properties or by enhancing aminergic neurotransmission. Intense and prolonged dreams often accompany abrupt withdrawal from antidepressant drugs, a reflection of an REM rebound after drug-induced REM deprivation. The postulated link between sleep and psychiatric disorders has been reinforced by the findings of modern neurobiology."}, {"Title": "Efficacy of topiramate, valproate, and their combination on aggression/agitation behavior in patients with psychosis.", "Abstract": "Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug, recently also used in the treatment of psychiatric diseases. Inasmuch as topiramate and valproate, which are currently used for aggressive behavior, share several pharmacological mechanisms (positive modulatory effect on the GABA activity and negative modulatory effect on glutamatergic neurotransmission), the objective of the present study was to compare the pharmacological effects of topiramate with those of valproate and their combination in patients with psychiatric disorders showing marked aggression and agitation. A retrospective, case-controlled, mirror-image study was carried out in a sample of 45 inpatients affected by schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorder, and hospitalized in a maximum-security Canadian psychiatry hospital. Overt Aggression Scale, Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale, number and intensity of psychotic episodes, number of episodes of withdrawal from group activities per week, and number of therapeutic isolation per week and of strict surveillance intervention per week were evaluated before and after the treatments. Results indicate that patients treated with topiramate show a decrease in the average score of the Overt Aggression Scale, a decrease of episodes of agitation and of strict surveillance interventions. This effect was similar to the group treated with valproate or with the combination of valproate-topiramate. However, valproate therapy, but not topiramate therapy, decreased the intensity of agitation episodes measured by the Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale; valproate and the combination topiramate-valproate decreased the number of psychotic disorganization episodes as well. These results suggest that topiramate could be a valid medicine in the control of aggression in psychosis.

Since depression runs in families, a question arises as to whether family history information should be considered when diagnosing depression. The text of DSM-IV indicates that a family history of a mood disorder should sometimes be considered when trying to distinguish between major depressive disorder and other conditions such as catatonic schizophrenia. The questions posed herein are how well family history of depression performs as a diagnostic criterion, and how its performance compares with the DSM-IV symptom criteria. One thousand eight hundred psychiatric outpatients were evaluated with a semistructured diagnostic interview as part of a research assessment infrastructure that has been embedded in the Rhode Island Hospital Department of Psychiatry outpatient practice. Family history diagnoses were based on information provided by the patient. The interview followed the guide provided in the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria. We constructed a continuum of family history morbidity based on the number of first-degree family members with a history of depression and whether the family member was treated for their depression. Thus, we determined the presence or absence of the family history diagnostic criterion in different ways. Family history information was collected on 9763 first-degree relatives of 1776 patients. The sensitivity of the family history criterion was lower than each of the symptoms. Based on the broadest definition of the family history variable, the specificity was also lower than all other symptoms. Based on the narrowest definition (two or more family members who were treated for depression), the specificity was higher than all of the symptom criteria though sensitivity dropped to 15%. Overall, as a diagnostic criterion, a family history of depression did not perform as well as the DSM-IV symptom criteria. Consistent with the familial nature of depression, the family history variable performed better as a diagnostic criterion when considering diagnosis from a lifetime, rather than a current, perspective. This has implications for the future consideration of genetic markers as diagnostic criteria."}, {"Title": "Deletion/insertion polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene and white matter hyperintensities in dementia: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "To examine the association between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in patients with dementia.\nObservational pilot study with adjustment for potential confounders using analysis of covariance.\nSecondary care old-age psychiatry services in greater Manchester, United Kingdom.\nNinety-seven patients with dementia: 49 with Alzheimer's disease (AD, National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) and 48 with vascular dementia (VaD, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria).\nThe ACE D/I polymorphism, WMHs (deep WMHs (DWMHs) and periventricular hyperintensities (PVHs)) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and potential cardiovascular confounders.\nThe D/D polymorphism of the ACE genotype was associated with severity of DWMH (P = .005) but not PVH (P = .34), corrected for age, cardiovascular risk factors, and type of dementia.

The successful pursuit of such a claim puts these clinical occupational groups in a position to challenge psychiatrists over crucial hospital resources such as beds. These groups' claim to authority emerges from two sources. The first is their specific histories and their clinical knowledge systems that initially developed independently of cosmopolitan medicine. The second is the political economic environment of urban hospital psychiatric departments which largely treat patients with opaque symptoms of unclear origin that defy easy psychiatric classification."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatric assessment in European Union member states.", "Abstract": "To provide a structured description and cross-boundary comparison of legal frameworks and training standards relevant for forensic psychiatric assessment in European Union member states before the extension in May 2004.\nInformation on legislation and practice concerning the assessment of mentally disordered offenders was gathered by means of a detailed, structured questionnaire which was filled in by national experts.\nLegal frameworks for the assessment and reassessment of mentally disordered offenders and professional training standards in forensic psychiatry vary markedly across EU member states.\nCurrently a cross-boundary harmonization of legal concepts appears hard to achieve.

Critical realist theory is offered as an alternative approach to understanding these complex relationships. It is argued that contemporary models of involvement perpetuate and sustain the power positions of the dominant discourse within psychiatry. It is suggested that a critical realism perspective, offers a model that does not kowtow to the dominant discourse but rather recognizes that service users now possess power, especially in terms of being able to provide services that statutory services providers now require.

However, in the course of working with the wards, various constraints and blocks to change have been identified and we describe these in detail in this paper. Analysis of the fieldwork diaries of the two City Nurses identified that change was hindered by limited staffing resources, problems with the physical environment and other resources, insufficient beds and the process of bed management, hierarchical ambiguity and multidisciplinary issues, the overdemanding role of the ward manager, and pervasive anxiety about the potential for serious untoward incidents and their implications for staff.

This is to say that any perceived 'deviation' from this characteristically 'modern self' is seen as a possible 'sign' of 'mental illness', given a 'negative determination', and conceptualized in terms of a 'deficiency' or a 'lack'; accordingly, the 'ideal''therapeutic' aim of 'modern' mental health care can be understood as the 'rectification' of that 'deficiency' through a 're-instatement' of the 'modern self'. Although contemporary mental health care is increasingly becoming influenced by the so-called 'death' of the 'modern self', this paper will suggest that it is the work of the 20th century French philosopher, Gilles Deleuze, that is able to provide mental health care with a coherent determination of a 'post-modern self'. However, a Deleuzian account of subjectivity stands in stark contrast to 'modernity's' conception of subjectivity and, as such, this paper will attempt to show how this 'post-modern' subjectivity challenges many of the assumptions of 'modern' mental health care. Moreover, acknowledging the complexity and the perceived difficulty of Deleuze's work, this paper will provide an account of subjectivity that can be understood as 'Deleuzian' in its orientation, rather than 'Deleuze's theory of subjectivity', and therefore, this paper also seeks to stimulate further research and discussion of Deleuze's work on subjectivity, and how that work may be able to inform, and possibly even reform, the theoretical foundations and associated diagnostic and therapeutic practices of psychiatry, psychotherapy, and mental health nursing."}, {"Title": "The formation and development of individual and ethnic identity: insights from psychiatry and psychoanalytic theory.", "Abstract": "This paper describes the concept of identity formation, examining the historical development of identity, particularly ethnic identity. The author distinguishes the normative developmental achievement of self and group identity with pathological identity diffusion due to an earlier attachment disorder. The clinical case of a young male's experience of his Persian family's immigration to a new host country details the challenges encountered in ethnic identity formation and its interference in consolidating this ongoing process. The complicated task of self identity formation during this phase of development in the face of parental unresolved and ambivalent attitudes toward their own sense of threatened self and group identity diffusion is discussed. Parental intrapsychic conflict combined with environmental conflict such as racism, prejudice, and more recent paranoia toward Middle Eastern immigrant families interferes further with the normal identity formation process.

Because the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have also been attributed to central cholinergic deficits, we examined whether the AChEI rivastigmine can reduce motor activity as measured in a rater-independent manner by wrist actigraphy in agitated AD patients. A total of 20 consecutive AD inpatients (13 females, 7 males, 80.4+/-9.1 years, S.D.) were included from our geriatric psychiatry unit, all of whom were exhibiting agitated behavior not attributable to delirium. Patients were assigned randomly and in a single-blinded fashion to rivastigmine 3mg or placebo for 14 days. Motor activity levels were monitored using an actigraph worn continuously on the wrist of the non-dominant hand. At the beginning and end of the study, patients were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER). Patients in the rivastigmine group exhibited less agitation than placebo recipients on the NPI-agitation subscale, but not on NOSGER. Actigraphic measurements showed a tendency towards reduced motor activity in the rivastigmine group.

Neuroactive steroids (NAS) refers to steroids that, independent of their origin, are capable of modifying neural activities. NAS bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. The gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and sigma receptor complexes have been the most extensively studied. Oxidized ring A reduced pregnanes, tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) bind to the progesterone intracellular receptor (PR), and in this way can also regulate gene expression. Animal experimentation showed that salient symptoms of depression, viz., anxiety, sleep disturbances, and memory and sexual dysfunctions, are modulated by NAS. In turn, psychotropic drugs modulate NS and NAS levels. NS levels as well as NAS plasma concentrations change in patients with depression syndromes, the levels return to normal baseline with recovery, but normalization is not necessary for successful therapy. Results from current studies on the evolution of nervous systems, including evolutionary developmental biology as well as anatomical and physiological findings, almost preclude a categorical classification of the psychiatric ailments the human brain succumbs to. The persistence in maintaining such essentialist classifications may help to explain why up to now the search for biological markers in psychiatry has been an unrewarding effort. It is proposed that it would be more fruitful to focus on relationships between NAS and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, rather than with typologically defined disorders."}, {"Title": "Measuring behavioural susceptibility to obesity: validation of the child eating behaviour questionnaire.", "Abstract": "The Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ; [Wardle, J., Guthrie, C.A., Sanderson, S., & Rapoport, L.

In the present study, associations were examined between three CEBQ scales (Satiety Responsiveness, SR; Food Responsiveness, FR; Enjoyment of Food, EF) and four aspects of eating behaviour (eating without hunger, caloric compensation, eating rate and energy intake at a meal) aggregated across up to five occasions, in a sample of 4-5-year olds. In multiple regression, the aggregated behavioural measures of eating explained 56% of the variance in SR, 33% of the variance in FR and 40% of the variance in EF. These findings support the validity of the CEBQ as a parent-report instrument to assess 'obesogenic' eating behaviours in children.

Since the last third of that century, we have expanded would-be disease categories to include an ever-broader variety of emotional pain, idiosyncrasy, and culturally unsettling behaviors. Psychiatry has been the residuary legatee of these developments, developments that have always been contested at the ever-shifting boundary between disease and deviance, feeling and symptom, the random and the determined, the stigmatized and the value-free. Even in our era of reductionist hopes, psychopharmaceutical practice, and corporate strategies, the legitimacy of many putative disease categories will remain contested.

By videotaping testimonies of these patients' experiences before, during, and after World War II, we had created highly condensed texts that could be interpreted on a multiplicity of levels going far beyond the mere narrative content of clinical medical history. Joint observation, reiteration, and discussion of these testimonies with staff members and the patients themselves has been not only an interesting experience, but also one of therapeutic value yet to be fully appreciated."}, {"Title": "[Towards a familiar-sounding paradigm and an example of a model for psychiatry.

Biological factors were thought to be important in the etiology.\nIt would be wrong to regard ADHD only as a fashionable ailment originating in the age of computers and working mothers. Equally untenable is the current view that pre-DSM III child psychiatrists attributed psychiatric disorders solely to parental influences ('parent-blaming').

The practical failure of psychiatry to improve well-being is the result of an excessive focus on stigmatizing aspects of mental disorders and the neglect of methods to enhance positive emotions, character development, life satisfaction, and spirituality. In this paper, a simple and practical approach to well-being is described by integrating biological, psychological, social, and spiritual methods for enhancing mental health. Evidence is presented showing that people can be helped to develop their character and happiness by a catalytic sequence of practical clinical methods. People can learn to flourish and to be more selfdirected by becoming more calm, accepting their limitations, and letting go of their fears and conflicts. People can learn to be more cooperative by increasing in mindfulness and working in the service of others. In addition, people can learn to be more self-transcendent by growing in self-awareness of the perspectives that lead to beliefs and assumptions about life which produce negative emotions and limit the experience of positive emotions. The personality traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence are each essential for well-being. They can be reliably measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory.

Looking after the home, self-care, daytime activity, psychotic symptoms, safety to others and sexual expression needs were significantly greater in the SEMI group than in either the DSH or alcohol groups. Only safety to self-needs in the DSH group and alcohol needs in the alcohol group were significantly higher than in the SEMI group. The proportion of needs that were unmet was similar in each group.\nThe CANSAS instrument identified some needs in deliberate self-harm and alcohol problem patients that might not have been identified during the course of a standard psychosocial assessment.

In 1949, independent Indonesia inherited four very large mental hospitals, about 10 acute-care clinics in the major cities, and an agricultural colony. During the 1950s, mental hospital care remained largely custodial. In 1966, the Directorate of Mental Health adopted the three-fold principles of prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation as the foundation of a comprehensive mental health care system. During the 1970s and 1980s, the number of mental hospitals in Indonesia doubled and a variety of treatment methods were introduced.

Although often considered separate nosological entities, evidence now suggests that the two syndromes may share some genetic liability. Recent studies have used a composite phenotype (psychosis) that includes BPD, SCZ, psychosis not otherwise specified, and schizoaffective disorder, to identify shared susceptibility loci. Several chromosomal regions are reported to be shared between these syndromes (18p, 6q, 10p, 13q, 22q). As a part of our endeavor to scan these regions, we report a positive linkage and association finding at 18p11.2 for psychosis. Two-point linkage analysis performed on a series of 52 multiplex pedigrees with 23 polymorphic markers yielded a LOD score of 2.02 at D18S37. An independent set of 159 parent offspring trios was used to confirm this suggestive finding. The TDT analysis yielded support for association between the marker D18S453 and the disease allele (chi2 = 4.829, P < 0.028). This region has been implicated by several studies on BPD [Sjoholt et al.

Across questionnaires, response rates were similar (Saphora-Psy: 48.5%, Perceptions of Care: 49.9%, Picker: 43.4%; P = 0.08), average completion time was lowest for the Perceptions of Care questionnaire (minutes: Saphora-Psy: 17.7, Perceptions of Care: 13.7, Picker: 17.5; P = 0.005), the Saphora-Psy questionnaire had the largest mean proportion of missing responses (Saphora-Psy: 7.1%, Perceptions of Care: 2.8%, Picker: 4.0%; P < 0.001) and the Perceptions of Care questionnaire showed the highest ceiling effect (Saphora-Psy: 17.1%, Perceptions of Care: 41.9%, Picker: 36.3%; P < 0.001). There were no differences in the patients' evaluation of the questionnaires.\nDespite differences in the intended target population, content, lay-out and length of questionnaires, none appeared to be obviously better based on our comparison.

To explore the implications for diagnostic classification, recent research on a variety of subtyping schemes is reviewed in terms of the development of new subtypes and the validation of established theories.\nSubtypes of alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders have been proposed since the beginning of modern psychiatry. Recent subtyping research suggests that no consensus has emerged about the nature, much less the number, of subtypes that could be used to characterize the clinical heterogeneity assumed to be present in groups of people with substance use disorders. Although several relatively simple binary typologies have been developed (e.g. Cloninger's type I and type II; Babor et al.'s type A and type B), validation research has produced mixed results in terms of the construct, concurrent and predictive validity of these classifications.\nThe adoption of a subtyping scheme in the major psychiatric classification systems is not recommended until further international research is conducted."}, {"Title": "Assessing mental disability in minors.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry devotes a great deal of attention to the \"imprecise\" and \"insufficiently scientific\" nature of psychiatric disability assessment, and, for this reason, it is vitally important to establish a reliable method of assessing different levels of disability. The assessment of mental disability in minors is unique in that it involves developmental aspects, which affect the formation and outcome of the disability. The relationship between disability and development is reciprocal: disability can affect development, thereby intensifying the degree of disability, while development affects integration of the disability into the personality and self-image, thereby preventing or reducing the transformation of disability into handicap. Only an understanding of both the psychopathological structure and its interaction with developmental elements can lead to an accurate assessment of the degree of disability. Such an understanding is vital to the proper practice of forensic psychiatry. We hereby propose a new formula for disability quantification which provides an arithmetical means for the calculation of disability percentages in minors, and we recommend its use in the assessment of demands for National Insurance benefits and compensation claims. The relationship between this new formula and the existing Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) functional scale, when tested retrospectively on 50 clinical reports composed by the writers of this article, showed a good correlation in the results obtained independently by each writer.

This paper examines some of the reasons leading to the fact that Leibbrand's own generation refused to acknowledge the importance of Foucault's ideas, while, later on, younger German medical historians, although impressed with Foucault's writings, failed to acknowledge, first, the close relationship between Leibbrand's and Foucault's world views, and, second, Leibbrand's attempts at introducing Foucault to German medical historians. Leibbrand with his Jewish wife had survived the Nazi period partly in hiding. His attempts at clearing post-war German psychiatry and medical historiography of NS-sympathizers isolated him among his colleagues, many of whom had begun their career during the Third Reich. Leibbrand enjoyed the support by the Swiss medical historian and avowed Communist Erwin Ackerknecht (1906-1988), but later turned against him, possibly because Acknerknecht had called Leibbrand's writings \"unscientific\". Leibbrand was unable to overcome his antagonisms with his contemporaries. At the same time, opposition to Ackerknecht made him appear a respresentative of the past in the eyes of the younger generation. Thus, when Foucault was accepted by the latter, they were not prepared to examine the work of Leibbrand and realize how close some of the ideas developed by Leibbrand and Foucault had been."}, {"Title": "[Medical journals for authors and/or readers?

However the cause, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this disorder are rarely reported by pediatricians. This paper investigated the cause and treatment of six cases of eating disorders in adolescent patients. The medical data of six cases of eating disorders in the Shanghai Children's Medical Center from January 2003 to September 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were 5 girls and 1 boy, whose onset ages ranged from 12.4 to 15.8 years. They were initially referred to the clinic between 12.9 to 16.7 years, with a course of disease varying from three to twelve months. The patients' body mass index (BMI) varied from 9.07 to 17.0. Four out of the six patients were hospitalized because of low temperature, low blood pressure, bradycardia, dehydration and multiple systems damages. The other two were treated in the out-patient clinic. Based on the medical history and physical examination as well as laboratory findings, five of them were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and the other one were bulimia nervosa. All of the patients were under the care of a team consisting of pediatricians, dietitians, psychiatrists and nurses. When the patients whose vital signs were unstable, medical treatment focused on life sustention and they were kept on beds compulsively and given nutrition transfusion. Meanwhile cognition and behavior therapy was administered to help the patients find out the internal and environmental factors related to the development of this disorder, establish a new conception of healthy weight, and correct their abnormal eating behaviors. The patients who had a severe distortion of body image and a big resistance to the treatment were additionally administered with psychiatry drugs. After treatment, three patients set up a healthy eating behavior, their body weights gradually recovered and they had no relapse during a 1-year follow-up. The other three patients retained some abnormal eating behaviors and their body weights were always below normal. It was found that eating disorders in adolescents may be triggered by some environmental factors, such as comments on body shape from their peers, fashion influence, academic pressures, and problems in communication. Since the patients' abnormal eating behaviors were masked or neglected by parents at the early stage of the disease and the clinical presentations were related to multiple systems, it is difficult to make an early diagnosis and treatment. It is important to improve the pediatricians' knowledge of eating disorders of adolescents and perform cooperation between a multidisciplinary team for the early diagnosis and treatment of this disorder."}, {"Title": "Remote area indigenous psychiatry: not your usual day at the office.", "Abstract": "To describe the development since 2001 of visiting psychiatric services for the very remotely located indigenous communities in South Australia.\nThe South Australian experience indicates that visiting psychiatric services can be provided in a sustainable and culturally appropriate manner for the benefit of Aboriginal people who live in the remotest places in Australia.

In this study, we performed a detailed evaluation of the subjective QOL of schizophrenic inpatients and examined the relationship of QOL to various patient characteristics. This study was conducted on schizophrenic inpatients and nursing staff members in a Japanese private psychiatric hospital. As a result, only depression showed a weak, but significant, relationship with subjective QOL. Other characteristics showed no meaningful correlation to subjective QOL. Comparison between the schizophrenic group and the nursing staff group revealed that schizophrenic inpatients showed a lower QOL in the domains of physical health and social relationships. Schizophrenia itself and/or accompanying disabilities might induce lower subjective QOL. It is difficult to determine what the important factors are, except for depression, for subjective QOL of schizophrenic inpatients. However, depression should receive more attention for the QOL in the physical health and psychological health domains."}, {"Title": "On conflict, containment and the relationship between them.", "Abstract": "A programme of research into conflict (e.g. violence, absconding, medication refusal) and containment (e.g. seclusion, special observation, physical restraint) in inpatient psychiatry has been under way at City University, London, UK, for the past 10 years. Recent research findings, plus the challenges posed by ongoing projects, have made apparent the need for greater clarity about the overarching concepts of 'conflict' and 'containment'. This paper pulls together research findings pertaining to this issue, and conducts a reasoned analysis of what common characteristics might underlie 'conflict' and 'containment'. It is concluded that these are patient threats to safety, and the staff maintenance of safety. Details are presented on the inclusions and exclusions that follow from taking such a position, and potential definitions offered. On the grounds of this conceptual analysis, plus evidence for moderate degrees of statistical association between behaviours and events in each domain, it is concluded that it is legitimate to conduct analyses at the level of total conflict and containment rates, as well as at the level of individual types of behaviours and events (e.g. verbal abuse, sedation). Some of the mathematical difficulties in the analysis of total conflict and containment are addressed, and results of a weighting exercise presented. This exercise challenges our perception of the severity of some containment measures that are becoming more commonly used in acute psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Bipolar disorder detection, ascertainment, and treatment: primary care physician knowledge, attitudes, and awareness.", "Abstract": "To describe knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of bipolar disorder detection, ascertainment, and treatment among primary care physicians in a managed care setting.\nQuota sampling was used to obtain 102 completed surveys assessing knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of bipolar disorder from a pool of 350 primary care physicians in a large, vertically integrated Midwestern health system from June 2004 through August 2004. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the distribution of the study results at the physician level.\nPrimary care physicians are experiencing challenges in diagnosing and treating bipolar patients, who can be difficult and time-consuming. In answering questions about major depressive episode and manic episode symptoms, at least 15% of respondents assessed most symptoms incorrectly. In analyzing 3 case studies, 9%, 11%, and 28% of respondents, respectively, answered all of the questions correctly. When asked which drugs are U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for the maintenance treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder, no survey respondent replied correctly for all drugs listed. Importantly, our survey also indicates that these physicians are very willing to refer bipolar patients to psychiatrists for evaluation and treatment, which may help to ensure optimal care.\nOpportunities for improvement exist in diagnosing and treating patients with bipolar disorder in the primary care setting, perhaps aided by guidelines, education, and a collaborative care model with psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Medical errors in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Medical errors in the general medical sector result in significant patient deaths and injuries, as well as high costs to the health care system. Despite the growing literature on errors in medical and surgical specialties, few studies have examined the incidence, nature, predictors, and prevention of errors that may occur in mental health treatment settings. The purpose of the current review is to examine the lessons learned from patient-safety research in the general medical sector, provide examples of types of errors in psychiatry, review the errors identified in the literature, offer a discussion of error-reduction strategies for improving patient safety, and provide recommendations for future research. Increased attention to medical errors in psychiatry is necessary in order to build safer health systems and promote a culture of safety among providers, thereby producing better care for patients with mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Alexithymia and anxiety in female chronic pain patients.", "Abstract": "Alexithymia is highly prevalent among chronic pain patients. Pain is a remarkable cause for high levels of chronic anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of alexithymia and to determine anxiety levels among DSM-IV somatoform pain disorder (chronic pain) female patients and to examine the relationship between alexithymia and the self-reporting of pain.\nThirty adult females (mean age: 34.63 +/- 10.62 years), who applied to the outpatient psychiatry clinic at a public hospital with the diagnosis of chronic pain disorder (DSM-IV), were included in the study. Thirty seven healthy females (mean age: 34.46 +/- 7.43 years), who matched for sociodemographic features with the patient group, consisted the control group. A sociodemographic data form, 26-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-26), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered to each subject and information was obtained on several aspects of the patients' pain, including intensity (measured by VAS), and duration.\nChronic pain patients were found significantly more alexithymic than controls. There was a positive correlation between TAS-26 scores and the duration of pain. The alexithymic and nonalexithymic group did not differ in their perception of pain. Neither positive correlation nor significant difference was found between alexithymia and trait anxiety in pain patients.\nAlexithymia may be important in addressing the diversity of subjective factors involved in pain. The conceptualization of alexithymia as a personality trait as well as a secondary state reaction is underlined by our data."}, {"Title": "[Ethical foundations of institutional psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "The idea behind this work is to have an ethical examination of the institutional psychotherapy movement which has long influenced French public psychiatry and which has progressively, since the 80s, been subject to growing doubts. In the first part, institutional psychotherapy is presented. It is a model for theoretical development and practice in psychiatric care. It came into being just following the end of the Second World War at the same time as modern medical ethics. Its principles come on the one hand, from recognition of asylums' pathogenic effects--which led to the crushing of the patient's being--and on the other, through recognition of the uniqueness of each person and the subjectivity of mental suffering. These elements gave rise to creativity within the world of medicine and, in the sector, generated the science of psychiatry which advocated for continuity in care (both inpatient and outpatient) and preventive work directed at the population. This movement called for the use of the institution in its dynamic aspect which promotes exchanges and allows patients to situate or resituate themselves in historic and symbolic dimensions. It privileges a high level of transversality, maximum communication, favouring speaking out loud and responsibility. It requires a permanent analysis of the institutional counter transference (emotional reactions of the caregivers involved, their interrelations and the social and material organization of the institution) which determines the therapeutic action itself. THEORICAL BASIS: In a second part, its theoretical foundations and its practice shall be investigated in light of the guiding concepts of medical ethics (justice, autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance). Institutional psychotherapy responds to the need for justice by considering the patient as a whole and by conceiving each patient as being like oneself despite the differences (associated with the mode of hospitalization, the social or diagnostic category). The principle of autonomy lies always at care's horizon, made concrete in practice by notions of habitability, orientation to place and time, references, by activities and by meetings. The principle of beneficence was the basis for round-the-clock intakes, the use of an established theoretical model and clinical practice centred on the patient's words. Institutional analysis attempts not to repeat the alienation felt by the patient, alienation being associated with the treatment environment, and draws from the principle of non-malfeasance. It therefore appears that the approach of institutional psychotherapy conforms with ethical requirements, given its major interest in the subject who aspires to find meaning in life.\nThe third part discusses current orientations in care related to the explosion in neuroscience and technology, the promotion of the citizen as an individual, and legal doctrine, budgetary constraints, and new demands made on psychiatry from the social and political domains. The widespread trend towards simplification, swollen with hypotheses from neuroscientific research, is progressively reducing mental illness to target symptoms. The recovery of the notion of citizenship through technological capture and ideological strains in contemporary culture have also affected a suspension of the subject as a thinking and desiring being, and exempted caregivers from considering transferral phenomena, indicated with the appearance of new signifiers: user, stress, plague, network. The new medical-technical jargon of scales, tables, and management participates in the same process of patient objectification and care compartmentalization. In this context, under the cover of science and generally good actions, psychiatry has become biologisized, whilst being diluted from its social aspect, even as it becomes more repressive for patients.\nThis observation leads to the conclusion, in the fourth part, that there is a need for psychiatry, which within its own discipline has a hard time finding sufficient resources, to refocus itself ethically. This enlightenment could come within a multi-disciplinary ethical space, uniting practitioners and psychiatric caregivers, psychoanalysts, philosophers, sociologists, neurobiologists etc. The research should concern the legitimacy of the principles that underlie psychiatric action in its care and preventive aspects."}, {"Title": "The future of medium secure forensic psychiatry in Britain: a survey.", "Abstract": "The number of National Health Service (NHS) secure psychiatric beds is increasing.

The goal of this study was to examine the degree to which the IFc facilitated the formative feedback process from the perspectives of both students and faculty.\nThe IFc contains a checklist of the 13 clinical competencies that are also used to provide summative evaluations to students. One hundred and sixty-five medical students completing a 6-week psychiatry clerkship between January and December 2004 were given an IFc to present to their inpatient preceptor at one of their two inpatient sites. At the end of each 3-week inpatient rotation, all students were e-mailed a brief questionnaire about the formative feedback received during the preceding rotation. At the end of the 12-month study period, faculty were e-mailed a brief questionnaire about how useful the IFc was in helping to facilitate the feedback process.\nOne hundred thirty-eight students (80%) participated in the study and returned 267 questionnaires (1.9/student, 97% response rate). Two hundred five students indicated on 77% of the questionnaires returned that they received mid-rotation feedback and of those, 84% revealed that feedback was helpful. Eighty-five percent of the students received mid-rotation feedback when they used the IFc and only 69% received mid-rotation feedback without the IFc. A majority of the 14 faculty serving as inpatient preceptors during the study period found the cards useful for stimulating feedback discussions, for reducing the stress of providing feedback, and for getting students to request feedback.\nThe results of this pilot study are not definitive, but they do indicate that the Instant Feedback card (IFc) did facilitate the process and structure of providing and receiving formative feedback as indicated by a significantly greater number of students receiving formative feedback when they used the IFc."}, {"Title": "Women chairs in psychiatry: a collective reflection.", "Abstract": "This article describes the experiences of women chairs in psychiatry.\nAll women chairs in psychiatry were contacted by the author to share their personal experiences as chair.

These concerns are based on the recognition that war-zone exposures may have considerable negative emotional or behavior consequences. As the global war on terror continues, the United States military medical system will be required to address issues at the interface of psychiatry and the law. Despite clinical advances within the theater of war and at tertiary facilities in the United States, some military members will develop chronic and disabling mental illness as a result of traumatic exposure and exacerbated by the demands of the austere and dangerous operational environment. The extent to which violent and aggressive behavior in the aftermath of deployment can be attributed to combat experience remains an area of debate and ongoing investigation. However, experience suggests that a very small subgroup of the hundreds of thousands of war veterans deployed in conjunction with the current conflict in Iraq has already been involved in violent crimes. For this group, military forensic psychiatrists will be called on to make determinations of competency and criminal responsibility and to inform the courts about the potential contributions of war-related distress or disorder to criminal behavior. Though the overwhelming majority of war veterans will not be involved in criminal proceedings, a minority will develop career-ending (and in rare instances, life-ending) disabilities as a result of mental illness. For those who are no longer fit for duty, the military Physical Disability Evaluation System must make determinations of the extent to which future military performance and future civilian social and occupational function have been compromised. For a small yet highly visible minority of returning veterans, questions about the cause, precipitants, and manner of death will necessitate psychological autopsies. This article highlighted recent updates in military forensic psychiatry and the mechanisms through which answers to questions of disability and criminal culpability, and motivation underpinning self-injurious behavior, are determined within the United States military. As the global war on terror progresses, further experience and study of our country's judicial processes, disability system, and the policies and procedures governing psychological autopsies must evolve to meet these increasing demands."}, {"Title": "Substance misuse and substance-related disorders in forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is a broad range of substance-related problems that arise for the forensic psychiatrist. For many, what is most challenging about addressing these issues are the complex behavioral, biological, clinical, and social phenomena involved. Substance- related illnesses are on the cutting edge of brain research. Substance-related behavior that brings individuals to the attention of forensic psychiatrists involves a wide spectrum of substance use patterns, but even substance misuse may have profound and relevant effects, forensically. The social forces that mold our laws and attitudes toward addictive drug use are at work in almost every forensic context. Substance-related issues provide a rich medium for the application of forensic psychiatric principles and practice. As in all of forensic psychiatric work, the psychiatrist should be familiar with each forensic context in which addiction issues arise. They should become familiar with the relevant definitions, criteria, and legal requirements that apply in each specific area of their practice, rather than assume that clinical definitions and clinical reasoning will carry them.

The causes of an action and the standards by which physician conduct is measured vary widely between these two processes. Many psychiatrists do not appreciate sufficiently the gravity of the risks they may face from an administrative sanction. Understanding the legal and administrative expectations of practicing psychiatrists serves practitioners' professional risk management. Those psychiatrists who choose to participate as expert witnesses for courts or administrative agencies need to familiarize themselves with the applicable legal standards and the respective roles of experts in these two different settings. The courts and administrative agencies have different social missions and correspondingly differing expectations of the expert opinions admitted.An expert's function as educator about the application of psychiatric knowledge and treatments to legal contexts is optimized when that expert clearly understands the function of the opinion that is sought. As educators about special knowledge to the adjudicating body, experts are advocates for their objectively generated and scientifically grounded opinion.

In this article, we review the literature pertaining to the social zeitgeber theory, as well as evidence that this theory may be applied to (hypo)manic episodes. Given the limited data supporting the social zeitgeber theory to date, we also evaluate whether circadian rhythm disruptions are triggered by an internal mechanism, such as an abnormality in one's pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus; SCN).

Although the internet has great potential in psychiatric education, clinical care, and research, its impact on social issues should not be underestimated. Firstly, the internet as a means of communication may encourage suicidal behavior by depicting ways by which suicide may be committed. Secondly, some internet websites may discourage people with mental illness from seeking psychiatric help, condone suicide, and forbid entry to anyone offering to discourage users from committing suicide. However, the internet could be a resource to help a potentially suicidal person get help, and can be used to identify those at risk for suicide, communicate with them, and potentially prevent suicide.

This review paper attempts to examine the importance of this mode of communication, with its risks and threats. The inherent limitations of the message transfer method and the magnitude of its usage with benefits and hazards, both for the doctors and patients, will also be analyzed. The recommended guidelines concerning its usage are also present. It is concluded that though e-mail communication is fast gaining popularity, its impact on psychiatry is yet to be seen keeping in view the importance of direct communication with patients in the practice of psychiatry. It appears that with the development of future technologies, e-psychiatry will become relatively risk free and a source of help for the general health care system."}, {"Title": "Forty-two-years later: the outcome of childhood-onset schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "This paper describes the long-term course of 76 patients who had been consecutively admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Philipps University, between 1920 and 1961 with a suspected diagnosis of childhood-onset schizophrenia. By means of a consensus analysis of available data in accordance with ICD-10 criteria, the diagnosis of schizophrenia was confirmed in only 50% of the original sample (n = 38, childhood-onset schizophrenia group); whereas the rest of the sample were allotted other diagnoses (n = 38, non-schizophrenia group). A follow-up investigation was conducted, interviewing all available patients, if possible, or their first-degree relatives or doctors. In the childhood-onset schizophrenia group, age at onset (mean +/- S.D.) was 12.7 +/- 2.5 (range 5-14) years and age at follow-up was 55.0 +/- 4.8 (range 42-62) years. The outcome of this group was poor. According to the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), only 16% had a good (GAS score 71-100) and 24% had a moderate (GAS score 41-70) outcome. In the 16 childhood-onset schizophrenia patients who could be personally investigated at follow-up, 10 (62.5%) displayed severe or moderate depressive symptoms according to the BPRS depressive score. The death rate (including suicide) was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group (n = 15; 39.5%) than in the non-schizophrenia group (n = 7; 18.4%). A comparison of the life-time diagnoses of the total sample (n = 76) at follow-up with the ICD-10 diagnoses made retrospectively revealed a diagnostic stability in 69 (91%) and a change of diagnosis in 7 (9%) cases, among them 4 who were originally diagnosed as having childhood-onset schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Integration between general practice and mental health services in Italy: guidelines for consultation-liaison services implementation.", "Abstract": "This paper illustrates some guidelines for the implementation of Consultation-liaison services in contexts where GPs work alone. We present some activity data of our experience in the period 1999-2004 and a critical evaluation of what works and what does not work.\nIn Italy single-sited spontaneous initiatives of co-operation and integration between general practice and psychiatry have been implemented in many regions. Recently, the Italian Health Care Government has begun to encourage integration between primary and secondary care for the management of mental health. The Bologna Consultation-liaison Service opened in 1999 in one area. The service was first located in the Community Mental Health Centre and subsequently in a medical non-psychiatric outpatient service. In 2002, the services were implemented in the overall city area, and the Bologna Consultation-liaison Service had its own office in the centre of the town.\nData have been collected by reviewing clinical charts. They include clinical (mental status examination, progress notes) and socio-demographic data, assessment scales that measure psychological distress and disability, reports for GPs, and consultation outcome.\nA consultation-liaison service like the one proposed in this paper could contribute to an efficient and fully-integrated collaborative management of common psychiatric disorders, reducing the use of mental health services."}, {"Title": "Deinstitutionalisation of mental health care in The Netherlands: towards an integrative approach.", "Abstract": "The objective of this policy paper is to put recent developments in Dutch mental health reform in an international perspective and draw conclusions for future directions in policy. CONTEXT OF THE CASE: The practice of Western psychiatry in the second half and particularly in the last decade of the 20th century has fundamentally changed. Dutch psychiatry has traditionally been prominently bed-based and various policies in the last ten years have been intended to reduce the influence of the mental hospitals. Until the mid-1990s, this had not resulted in reducing the psychiatric bed rate in comparison to other countries. Since then, there have been rapid, dramatic changes.\nWe summarised two recent national studies on this subject and placed them in a national and international context, using documents on psychiatric reforms, government and advisory board reports and reviews on deinstitutionalisation in different countries.\nThe practice of psychiatry in the second half, and particularly in the last decade, of the 20th century has fundamentally changed. This has resulted in a spectacular decline in the number of beds in mental hospitals, increased admissions, decreased length of stay, closure of the large asylums and in community treatment away from asylums and in society, although this is a reform process. This article examines how the Dutch mental health care system has developed at the national level. The main topics cover the size, nature, aims and effects of the process of deinstitutionalisation and how alternative facilities have been developed to replace the old-fashioned institutes.\nThere are two contrasting aspects of deinstitutionalisation in Dutch mental health care: the tendency towards rehospitalisation in relation to the sudden, late, but rapid reduction of the old mental hospitals and their premises; and a relatively large scale for community-based psychiatry in relation to building mental health care centres. Compared to other countries the bed rate in The Netherlands is still among the highest, although it is rapidly decreasing. Lessons from psychiatric reform in other countries emphasise the counterpart of deinstitutionalisation, especially issues such as the quality of alternative community treatment and increasing compulsory admission, while the closing down of old mental hospitals has caused a decrease in the availability of beds. In The Netherlands less attention has been paid to legislation, societal attitudes towards psychiatry, the roles of other care suppliers, the balancing and financing of care, the fate of psychiatric patients from old hospitals, the way to cope with the ever-increasing demand for psychiatric help and the actual quality of psychiatric help. A more integrative policy that includes all these aspects is desirable."}, {"Title": "Deviant strategy on The Modified Six Elements Test in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Impaired executive functioning is found in a considerable proportion of schizophrenia patients. Neuropsychological tests are originally designed to measure the behavior of neurological patients and may therefore miss psychiatry-related cognitive deficits. Qualitative information on tests for executive functioning is important in psychiatric populations. The Modified Six Elements Test (MSET) is a planning test that consists of 6 tasks, for which subjects have limited time and have to obey to switching rules. This study concerns a qualitatively different approach schizophrenia patients use on the MSET, and its relationship with cognitive measures. MSET scores and strategies of schizophrenia patients were compared to those of healthy controls, closed-head-injury patients, and peripheral injury patients. Also, schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were compared on verbal memory and vigilance. Schizophrenia patients finish fewer assignments on the MSET, receive a lower profile score compared to healthy controls, and use a different strategy on the test compared to the other groups. They also perform below healthy controls on the tests for verbal memory and vigilance. Use of the different strategy in schizophrenia patients was related to impaired cognitive functioning. An interesting strategy used by schizophrenia patients on the MSET appears to be indicative of impaired cognitive functioning. This strategy may be a compensatory strategy to spare cognitive resources. It could also be the result of a concrete interpretation of the test instructions."}, {"Title": "National survey of psychotherapy training in psychiatry, psychology, and social work.", "Abstract": "Approximately 3% of the US population receives psychotherapy each year from psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers. A modest number of psychotherapies are evidence-based therapy (EBT) in that they have been defined in manuals and found efficacious in at least 2 controlled clinical trials with random assignment that include a control condition of psychotherapy, placebo, pill, or other treatment and samples of sufficient power with well-characterized patients. Few practitioners use EBT.\nTo determine the amount of EBT taught in accredited training programs in psychiatry, psychology (PhD and PsyD), and social work and to note whether the training was elective or required and presented as a didactic (coursework) or clinical supervision.\nA cross-sectional survey of a probability sample of all accredited training programs in psychiatry, psychology, and social work in the United States. Responders included training directors (or their designates) from 221 programs (73 in psychiatry, 63 in PhD clinical psychology, 21 in PsyD psychology, and 64 in master's-level social work). The overall response rate was 73.7%. Main Outcome Measure Requiring both a didactic and clinical supervision in an EBT.\nAlthough programs offered electives in EBT and non-EBT, few required both a didactic and clinical supervision in EBT, and most required training was non-EBT. Psychiatry required coursework and clinical supervision in the largest percentage of EBT (28.1%). Cognitive behavioral therapy was the EBT most frequently offered and required as a didactic in all 3 disciplines. More than 90% of the psychiatry training programs were complying with the new cognitive behavior therapy requirement. The 2 disciplines with the largest number of students and emphasis on clinical training-professional clinical psychology (PsyD) and social work-had the largest percentage of programs (67.3% and 61.7%, respectively) not requiring a didactic and clinical supervision in any EBT.\nThere is a considerable gap between research evidence for psychotherapy and clinical training. Until the training programs in the major disciplines providing psychotherapy increase training in EBT, the gap between research evidence and clinical practice will remain."}, {"Title": "Somatic and depressive symptoms in female Japanese and American students: a preliminary investigation.", "Abstract": "The present study examined the relationship between common somatic symptoms and depression in samples of Japanese and American college students.

While these elements were originally introduced in psychotherapy with ethnic minorities both to improve the patient-doctor relationship and to bring relevant material from patients' cultural background, they also became a way to empower nonwestern patients in western health care systems. When in the 1980s it became possible to readdress the issue of power in psychiatric practice, something had already changed in the social regulation that psychiatry should endorse. In this article, the author focuses on the new legitimated social and cultural values that underpin the therapeutic process. While obviously these new values should be taken into account, the aim for psychotherapy remains to find a path for a 'subversive' practice that could be something more than just following social guidelines."}, {"Title": "A pilot study of psychiatry resident psychotherapy competency: the impact of resident attitude and demographics.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry education, psychotherapy knowledge, skills, and attitudes are new competency objectives.\nTwo faculty members independently ranked psychiatry residents for psychotherapy competency. A rank of 1 indicated the most competency and a rank of 15 indicated the least competency for the resident psychotherapist. Several demographic and attitudinal variables of the residents were examined for relationships with psychotherapy competence.\nWhen the competency rankings of the two faculty members were compared, they demonstrated a high level of agreement (spearman r = 0.74, p = 0.0016). Of the variables studied, resident age (r = .61, p = .015) and personal attitude toward psychotherapy (S=29, p = .026) were significantly associated with psychotherapy competency. Both variables remained independently significant after statistical adjustment.\nOur study indicates that psychiatry resident attitude and age may influence psychotherapy competency.

A new set of statistical techniques called data mining (or machine learning) is being used by different industries to explore complex databases and can be used to explore large clinical databases.\nThe study goal was to reanalyze, using data mining techniques, a published study of which variables predicted psychiatrists' decisions to hospitalize in 509 suicide attempters over the age of 18 years who were assessed in the emergency department. Patients were recruited for the study between 1996 and 1998. Traditional multivariate statistics were compared with data mining techniques to determine variables predicting hospitalization.\nFive analyses done by psychiatric researchers using traditional statistical techniques classified 72% to 88% of patients correctly. The model developed by researchers with no psychiatric knowledge and employing data mining techniques used 5 variables (drug consumption during the attempt, relief that the attempt was not effective, lack of family support, being a housewife, and family history of suicide attempts) and classified 99% of patients correctly (99% sensitivity and 100% specificity).\nThis reanalysis of a published study fundamentally tries to make the point that these new multivariate techniques, called data mining, can be used to study large clinical databases in psychiatry. Data mining techniques may be used to explore important treatment questions and outcomes in large clinical databases and to help develop guidelines for problems where controlled data are difficult to obtain. New opportunities for good clinical research may be developed by using data mining analyses."}, {"Title": "Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of aggressive behavior in general adult psychiatry: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "To systematically review the evidence for pharmacologic management of outwardly directed aggressive behavior in general adult psychiatry.\nLiterature searches in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane libraries from 1966 through March 2005 were used to identify relevant studies. The keywords aggression, violence, anger, and hostility combined with drug therapy, psychotropic drugs, adrenergic beta-antagonists, anticonvulsants, anti-depressants, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, and lithium were searched. Furthermore, the retrieved publications were searched for additional references.\nAll randomized controlled trials addressing pharmacotherapy for aggression or aggression-related symptoms were included, except studies addressing the \"emergency situation\" and studies conducted in specialized psychiatric or non-psychiatric settings.\nEvidence synthesis was performed using the \"best-evidence principle.\" Two authors independently adjudicated methodological quality and generalizability to daily clinical practice.\nThirty-five randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. On the basis of a best-evidence synthesis model, weak evidence for antiaggressive effects of antipsychotics, anti-depressants, anticonvulsants, and beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs was found. Atypical antipsychotics appeared superior to typical antipsychotics. The use of various outcome measures and insufficient data reporting in the individual studies hampered the quantitative assessment of efficacy across studies. Further limitations of the available randomized controlled trials included small sample sizes, short study duration, and poor generalizability to daily clinical practice setting.\nWhereas pharmacotherapy is frequently applied in aggressive patients, only weak evidence of efficacy of various drug classes was found. Consensus about the use of aggression measurement scales in clinical trials is necessary for future research.

These setbacks have led to the adoption of alternative strategies such as the use of endophenotypes or intermediate traits to identify those individuals at genetic risk for developing the disorder. Gottesman and Gould [Am J Psychiatry (2003), 160:636], in a review of the endophenotypic concept, have suggested five criteria that should be characteristic of a trait in order for it to qualify as an endophenotype. These five criteria are used in order to assess the viability of using personality traits as endophenotypes for genetic analyses of bipolar disorder. A review of the literature suggests that certain personality traits or temperaments are associated with the illness in a state independent manner, that personality is at least partly heritable, and that various temperaments aggregate in the non-affected relatives of bipolar probands. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether specific personality traits co-segregate with affectively ill individuals. We conclude that personality profiling of probands and their relatives may facilitate molecular genetic work, but given the fact that personality is itself a complex trait, its use as an endophenotype has certain limitations."}, {"Title": "[The development of a dementia knowledge test for general practitioners].", "Abstract": "There is no test available to measure German GPs' knowledge of dementia.

There is increasing evidence from case studies, retrospective analyses and clinical trials to suggest that second-generation antipsychotics can increase the risk of metabolic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia, with indications that the level of risk may vary among antipsychotic medications. Comparison of weight gain data for the second-generation antipsychotics provides strong evidence to indicate differences in the weight gain liability, with clozapine and olanzapine being associated with the greatest weight gain over 1 year. Data suggest that these treatment-induced changes in weight are primarily responsible for treatment-related changes in glucose metabolism; however, there is also evidence to suggest that some impairments in glucose metabolism may be independent of adiposity. Studies investigating the effects of atypical antipsychotics on glucose metabolism have used a number of techniques of varying sensitivity and quality in an attempt to assign causality. Recent studies using gold standard methodologies, for both insulin sensitivity and adiposity, have shown that psychiatric patients receiving antipsychotics are at least as sensitive to the adverse effects of adiposity on glucose and lipid metabolism as non-psychiatric controls. This demonstrates the importance of weight gain prevention in psychiatry to help reduce long-term risk. There is also growing evidence to suggest that the differential effects of second-generation antipsychotics on metabolic parameters also result in differences in the risk of metabolic syndrome, with olanzapine having a significantly higher risk than either aripiprazole or ziprasidone. This differential risk highlights the need for adequate monitoring in patients receiving treatment with second-generation antipsychotics and careful selection of treatment in high-risk patients."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric inpatient units for children and adolescents with intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Inpatient beds for the psychiatric assessment and treatment of young people (under the age of 18 years) with intellectual disability have become scarce although there is pressure to redevelop them.

Admissions were equally divided between those from the immediate vicinity and nationally. For 43% the primary aim was to disentangle the extent of the environmental effect on the individual: the remainder were admitted for various reasons including, for example, the need to protect the individual from harming themselves or others, unusually complex or hazardous treatment or the carers inability to cope with the treatment plan. All admissions were thought appropriate but, had the community resources been better, 18% were avoidable.\nAdmission is necessary for a small number of young people who are not readily managed within mainstream units.

Clinical staging has immediate potential to improve the logic and timing of interventions in psychiatry just as it does in many complex and potentially serious medical disorders. Interventions could be evaluated in terms of their ability to prevent or delay progression from earlier to later stages of disorder, and they could be selected on clear-cut risk/benefit criteria. Biological variables and a range of candidate risk factors could be studied within and across stages, and their role, specificity and centrality in risk, onset and progression of disorder could be greatly clarified. A clinicopathological framework could be progressively constructed.

Psychiatric bed numbers are close to the irreducible minimum if they have not already reached it. The problems facing today's acute psychiatric admission wards include: poor design, maintenance and ambience; a lack of therapeutic and leisure activities for patients leading to inactivity and boredom; frequent incidents of aggression and low-level violence and problems with staffing. It is suggested that there are a number of underlying causes: First, there has been failure to plan inpatient services, or to define their role, as attention has focused on new developments in community care. Second, the reduction in bed numbers has led to a change in the casemix of inpatients with a concentration on admission wards of a more challenging group of patients.

With Fridericia's correction, there was only 1 case of borderline QTc in the whole group (the greatest QTc value is 450 ms in both sex groups).\nOur 2-year real-life experience shows that occurrence of QTc prolongation in present psychiatric patients is low. Values associated with high risk of arrhythmias (QTc>500 ms) were not observed. This might be related to the recent changes of spectrum of antipsychotic therapy used, the general trend to use lower doses, and increasing awareness about the drug-induced long QT syndrome."}, {"Title": "A curious consensus: \"brain scans prove disease\"?", "Abstract": "Presumably in recognition of the fact that there is no chemical test that can be used to diagnose any of the alleged mental illnesses, journalists and medical opinion leaders have proclaimed that brain scans--particularly, functional imaging studies--can be used to confirm the presence of psychiatric disease.

There is evidence that orbitofrontal hypoactivity may be related to this, because the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of emotional and behavioural responses to external events. The close anatomical and functional connection between the orbitofrontal cortex and olfactory processing suggests that patients with bipolar disorder and heightened emotional reactivity may exhibit altered olfactory function compared with patients with bipolar disorder who do not exhibit this sensitivity.\nIn this pilot study, olfactory function was assessed in patients with bipolar disorder and a history of event-triggered episodes (n = 7) and in patients with bipolar disorder without such a history (n = 9) at the Department of Psychiatry and the Taste and Smell Clinic of the University of Dresden, Germany. Each patient's bipolar disorder was in remission at study entry, and they were on monotherapy with mood stabilizers. Assessment included olfactory event-related potentials (ERP) and psychophysical tests for odour threshold, odour identification and olfactory quality discrimination.\nOdour thresholds were lower in patients with bipolar disorder and event-triggered episodes compared with the other patient group. In addition, patients with event-triggered episodes exhibited shorter N1 peak latencies of the olfactory ERP.\nOur findings indicate disinhibition of orbitofrontal areas involved in the processing of emotional events in a subset of patients with bipolar illness."}, {"Title": "A prospective study of depression among adult patients in an urban emergency department.", "Abstract": "To determine prevalence and predictors of depression among emergency department (ED) patients.\nFor 1 week in November 2003, consecutive adult patients presenting to an urban ED from 8:00 a.m. to midnight were screened for a DSM-IV major depressive episode using the Harvard Department of Psychiatry National Depression Screening Day Scale. Patients who were severely ill or who had altered mental status were excluded. Demographic factors, psychiatric history, and brief medical history also were assessed.\nOf 182 patients enrolled, 57 (32%, 95% CI = 25 to 39) screened positive for depression, which was much greater than general community estimates (6.6%, p < .0001). Depression was more likely (p < .001) in patients with a psychiatric history (61% vs. 22%), substance abuse history (65% vs. 30%), or a suicide attempt (67% vs. 30%). Eleven percent (95% CI = 7 to 17) of subjects endorsed suicidal ideation at least \"some of the time.\"\nThis sample underrepresented severely ill, acutely distressed, or cognitively disabled patients.

In addition, the viewpoints expressed in these articles do not necessarily represent those of the Editors or the Editorial Board.A disaster is the consequence of an extraordinary event that destroys goods, kills people, produces physical or psychological harm but, above all, which overcomes the adaptive possibilities of the social group. Disasters have strong political background and consequences. They shake the life of a community and raise questions about safety, social organization and the meaning of life. Disasters confront psychiatrists with challenges far beyond regular clinical activities or research strategies. During early interventions after a disaster, psychiatrists often have to work out of their usual clinical premises, in contact with unfamiliar professionals (i.e. rescue personnel) and with individuals who should not be considered as 'cases', and therefore without keeping regular clinical records. In the latter stages they have to confront many factors which tend to cause the clinical consequences of those affected and who developed a psychiatric condition to be chronic. Reactions to stress occur in stages, each one characterised by a specific psychological mechanism. Symptoms include flashbacks, difficulties in remembering, avoidance of stimuli, blunting of responses, high arousal level and obsessive ruminations. The strong biological and psychosocial factors which are unchained after a disaster should be recognised and chanelled. The experience of psychiatry with the bio-psycho-social model can help to understand what disasters are, how some negative aspects of them could be prevented, and how their consequences, both clinical as well as social, can be reduced."}, {"Title": "Long-acting risperidone: focus on safety.", "Abstract": "Although atypical antipsychotics are generally regarded as having more favorable tolerability profiles than conventional antipsychotics, differences between specific atypical agents can be important when individualizing treatment. Long-acting risperidone (LAR), the first long-acting injectable atypical anti-psychotic, has been found to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.\nThis review summarizes clinical evidence for the tolerability profile of LAR in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and assesses its utility in specific patient groups, including younger patients and the elderly.\nMEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies published between January 1994 and March 2006 that evaluated the tolerability of LAR. The primary search terms were long-acting risperidone, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, long term, tolerability, and safety. Abstracts and posters presented at major psychiatry and schizophrenia conferences during this period also were reviewed. Articles were included if they were reports of clinical studies and included tolerability data for LAR.\nThe literature search identified 7 open-label trials, 3 double-blind trials, 15 subanalyses, and 1 pooled analysis. When patients were switched directly or indirectly from another antipsychotic agent, LAR was generally well tolerated, with a low incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events (1%-16%). Moreover, LAR was associated with a weight-gain profile of 1 to 2 kg in the short term and did not appear to negatively affect lipids or glucose metabolism. Although LAR was associated with elevations in serum prolactin levels in 2% to 7% of patients, these elevations were not symptomatic, and levels decreased over time.\nLAR was generally well tolerated in several patient groups, including the elderly and those with schizoaffective disorder.

Symptoms are often pleomorphic, involving a range of psychotic symptoms, including hallucinations and disorders of thought. PIP is treatable and may be averted if presymptomatic risk factors are considered in susceptible patients and treatment is initiated.\nIn this report, we present an illustrative case of PIP. The patient, Mr. R, presented to our emergency room with delusions and disordered thought process following a cluster of seizures. He recovered after admission, sedation and treatment with antipsychotic medication.\nA list of presymptomatic risk factors is established based on review of current literature. Identification of such risk factors may potentially help with prophylactic treatment; however, little empirical research exists in this area and treatment guidelines are thus far largely based on expert opinion. Further, while the neurobiology of schizophrenia is advancing at a rapid pace, largely due to advances in genetics, the pathophysiology of PIP remains largely unknown. Considering the progress in schizophrenia research in the context of the clinical features of PIP and existing studies, potential neurobiological mechanisms for PIP are herein proposed, and further genetic analyses, which may help identify those susceptible, are warranted.\nWhile PIP is an important problem that may present first to general hospital psychiatrists, as in the case presented, this topic is under-represented in the medical psychiatry literature.

The original finding of DISC1 as a gene disrupted by a balanced translocation on chromosome 1q42 that segregates with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and recurrent major depression has sparked a number of confirmatory linkage and association studies. These indicate that DISC1 is a generalizable genetic risk factor for psychiatric illness that also influences cognition in healthy subjects. DISC1 has also been shown to interact with a number of proteins with neurobiological pedigrees, including Ndel1 (NUDEL), a key regulator of neuronal migration with endo-oligopeptidase activity, and PDE4B, a phosphodiesterase that is critical for cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling and that is directly linked to learning, memory, and mood.

Indeed, the patients do not recognize their disorder and prefer to go to the emergency unit in a general hospital. Thus, we meet in the emergency unit or in medical unit (liaison psychiatry activity). This is the reason why this first meeting has to be prepared. Consultation-liaison Psychiatry proposes to provide medical staff with the competences developed by psychiatry, and the denomination: Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry, indicates the bipolarity of its practice according to whether the intervention is addressed to the patient (consultation) or to the staff (liaison). However collaboration is sometimes difficult and the psychiatrist often meets with resistance. This is the reason why psychiatrists must work on their integration in the general hospital. Indeed, the psychiatrist works in an institution which is unfamiliar and he/she must adapt and create new practices if it is going to work. It is now clearly established that consultation-liaison psychiatry is not limited to consultations with patients, but is based on collaboration with medical staff. There are various ways of studying human problems: psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy. It is also possible to focus interest on the communication between individuals. The systemic therapies are interested in the interactions more than with any other aspect of reality, and this always from a pragmatic point of view. This concept is based on a series of designs. First of all, an intervention by problem solving aims at a change: the question is to know how a problem is maintained, hic et nunc. Secondly, humans are a sum of training by tests and errors. Finally, what we call reality is only our perception of reality: the human conflicts emerge when two persons assign a different direction to a reality which is perceived jointly. The human relationship can be defined as interaction circles, which we propose to use in our practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry. The question is no longer to know why the subject has a problem but to know how to resolve it. The call for a consultation of psychiatry is often the result of an interaction between patient and staff. We propose an assessment of the consultation-liaison-psychiatry's demand so as to offer a concrete response to medical teams and patients. 1. First of all, the claimant should be known. This first question is to be asked before even meeting the patient. In the majority of cases, it is the medical staff that suffers from the situation (and wants a change). To work only on the patient, discredits the psychiatric intervention. 2. The definition of the problem is a concrete question, which we want based on the facts and not on the comments. That which requires the consultation (the patient, his/her family or the medical team) awaits concrete answers from the psychiatrist. It is important that the objectives of the intervention are defined before meeting the patient. These preliminary exchanges facilitate the consultation-liaison intervention. 3. By knowing the solutions tried before the request for psychiatric help, the psychiatrist will be able to know the measures already tried (whether they were effective or not). 4. By proposing minimal changes, it defines small but obtainable objectives, which will be as much as to increase therapeutic alliance and the tolerance of patients sometimes difficult to understand. 5. Finally, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist must know the language of his/her interlocutors. Interdisciplinary alliance is a fundamental condition for the success of the intervention: like the patients, the medical staff must feel understood to be able to cooperate. To develop this alliance and to inhibit resistance, it is important to speak the language of the claimant. The demand will progressively become interventions, more adapted, especially when the psychiatrist is recognized and appreciated by the team, like a good consultant, credible and concrete. Thus, mentally distressed patients can benefit from psychiatric care (although they do not request it). However, two phases appear essential. First, we have to define the demand and the claimant (environment, medical staff and patient) and second, we have to support the integration of the psychiatrist in the functioning of the medical unit. Our systemic vision of the consultation-liaison psychiatry proposes a pragmatic collaboration, centred on the problem. This approach allows the patient to prepare to meet the psychiatrist, and does not a priori discredit the intervention. Presented by the staff, who know the problem in concrete terms and are ready to answer it in a concrete way, this mode of intervention is only the first step of subsequent psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Traumatized refugee children: the case for individualized diagnosis and treatment.", "Abstract": "The first 131 traumatized refugee children evaluated and treated in a child specialty clinic indicated a wide variety of trauma including war-related traumas (21%) for areas of recent conflict and domestic violence (28%) predominantly occurring in patients from Mexico and Latin America.

We used visual masked priming and functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the specific functional contribution of this region to reading and found that (1) unlike words, repetition of pseudowords (\"solst-solst\") did not produce a neural priming effect in this region, (2) orthographically related words such as \"corner-corn\" did produce a neural priming effect, but (3) this orthographic priming effect was reduced when prime-target pairs were semantically related (\"teacher-teach\"). These findings conflict with the notion of stored visual word forms and instead suggest that this region acts as an interface between visual form information and higher order stimulus properties such as its associated sound and meaning. More importantly, this function is not specific to reading but is also engaged when processing any meaningful visual stimulus."}, {"Title": "[Disease registries in the epidemiological researching of rare diseases in Spain].", "Abstract": "The use of tools such as disease registries poses a problem in the case of rare diseases.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the discrepancy between self and peer assessments for a group of specialist physicians from internal medicine (IM), pediatrics, and psychiatry clinical domains (i.e., patient management, clinical assessment, professional development, and communication). Data from 304 psychiatrists, pediatricians and internal medicine specialists were used. Each physician had data from an identical self and 8 peer (38 item/4 clinical domains assessment). A total of 2306 peer assessments were available. Physicians were classified into quartiles based on mean assessment peer data and compared with self-assessment data. The analyses showed that self and peer assessment profiles were consistent across specialties and domains. Physicians assessed in the lowest and highest quartiles (i.e., <25th and >75th) by colleagues tended to rate themselves 30-40 percentile ranks higher and lower than peers, respectively. This study suggests that practicing physicians are inaccurate in assessing their own performance. These data suggest that systems to provide practicing physicians with regular and routine feedback may be appropriate if we are to ensure physicians are able to accurately assess themselves in a profession in which self-regulation is predicated upon the assumption that physicians know their capabilities and limitations."}, {"Title": "A pilot study: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensation seeking, and pubertal changes.", "Abstract": "This study was designed to examine the relationship of pubertal changes and sensation seeking (SS) in adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Common reasons for initial HIV testing included routine prenatal screening (20%), clinical symptoms suggestive of HIV (20%), and recognized risk-related behaviours (20%). Findings included a history of unstable housing in the previous year (27%), running away (29%), knowing someone with HIV (36%), parental substance abuse (reported by youth, 46%), parental abandonment/neglect (30%), high substance use rates (marijuana 33%, tobacco 27%), current/prior STDs (60%), and involvement with the juvenile justice system or incarceration (41%). Sexual abuse/assault was reported by 41%. Previous depression was reported in 15% with approximately half reporting prior hospitalization. An additional 12% of the cohort had current clinical depressive symptoms. We conclude that infections with HIV via high-risk behaviours during adolescence occur in youth with multiple psychosocial stressors. Targeted prevention efforts to reduce these underlying stressors may decrease new adolescent infection. HIV-infected youth are best served in a comprehensive care environment with immediate access to medical care, social work, and psychology/psychiatry services."}, {"Title": "A randomized controlled trial of the effect of D-cycloserine on exposure therapy for spider fear.", "Abstract": "Previous research [Hofmann SG, Meuret AE, Smits JA, Simon NM, Pollack MH, Eisenmenger K, et al.

We used a well established intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of administering DCS as an adjunct to exposure therapy in a heightened, but sub-clinical, fear population. Over two studies, 100 spider-fearful participants were allocated to DCS or placebo before treatment and were assessed at pre-, immediate post-, and 3.5 weeks post-treatment. Significant treatment effects and return of fear was observed at follow-up, particularly in non-treatment contexts; however, both studies failed to demonstrate any enhancing effects of DCS (50 or 500 mg). DCS did not enhance the reduction of spider fears or the generalisation of treatment of a single session of exposure-based therapy. These results suggest that DCS may not enhance loss of non-clinical levels of fear in human populations."}, {"Title": "Divergent validity of measures of cognitive distortions, impulsivity, and time perspective in pathological gambling.", "Abstract": "The present study assessed the divergent validity of several self-report and objective behavioral measures for assessing pathological gambling using three samples divided by South Oaks Gambling Scale score [Lesieur, & Blume (1987).

Additionally, we examine those who provide services to a high volume of Medicare (HVM) patients.\nA self-administered mailed survey was sent to rural physicians who identified themselves as practicing family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, a surgical specialty, or a medical specialty. Questions examined changes in services offered by all rural physicians and among them, the HVM physicians. Impact of the professional liability insurance situation, satisfaction with current practice, and future practice plans on changes in service availability was also examined.\nOverall, 539 physicians responded for a participation rate of 42.7%. Two hundred eighty eight (54.9%) of all physicians in the study indicated a decrease or elimination of patient services in the last year. HVM physicians, compared to low volume of Medicare providers, were significantly more likely to decrease or eliminate services overall (66% vs 45%, P =.001). Mental health services (47% vs 18%, P =.001), vaccine administration (39% vs 16%, P =.008), and Pap smears (41% vs 13%, P =.008) were more likely to be eliminated among the HVM physicians. HVM physicians were also significantly more likely to be somewhat or very dissatisfied (40% vs 23%, P =.012) with their practice.\nPhysicians in rural Florida report dissatisfaction with their practice and are decreasing or eliminating services that are important to the elderly.

For evolutionary psychopathology emotions are a response system or a genetically programmed, specialized state of functioning, formed by natural selection, that allows us to adapt to the environment, increasing the ability to cope with threats and opportunities. Emotions exert their function by coordinated physiological, psychological and behavioral changes. Many functions have been suggested for low mood or depression, including communicating a need for help, signaling yielding in a hierarchy conflict, fostering disengagement for commitments to unreachable goals, regulating patterns of investment, parallelism with despair phase of separation from mother situation in monkeys, hibernation, etc. Despite other evolutionary models, our model not only tries to explain depression but mania, hypomania and other affective disorders as well. For us, most affective disorders are pathological states (and not adaptive ones), due to dysfunction of an innate precipitating mechanism (IPM). IPM function is to regulate energy and activity levels according to intensity and duration of light (namely IPM-A). This IPM-A is responsible for vegetative, endocrine and behavioral responses that are present in humans and more ancient phylogenetic animals. More recently in the phylogeny, other mechanisms (IPM-AA) have coupled to this IPM-A. In the human being, the precipitating factors of IPM-AA are predominately social. IPM-AA add new responses (such as mood) to the older responses of IPM-A."}, {"Title": "Failure to detect Borna disease virus antigen and RNA in human blood.", "Abstract": "Borna disease virus (BDV) is the etiological agent of a rare progressive meningoencephalitis that affects mostly horses and sheep.

At first glance, this would confront us again with unsolvable problems supposedly avoided by the psychiatric 'brain technicians' preferring object-oriented study (neuromaging, receptors).

The author reviews the plausibility of these claims. Four areas are addressed. First, it is argued that familial aggregation of a single putative psychiatric syndrome provides at best limited evidence for the validity of that syndrome. Second, both traditional and molecular genetic strategies can supply important insights into major diagnostic conundrums. However, evidence that one or a few individual genes impact on risk for two disorders is not likely to resolve definitively the nosologic relationship between the two syndromes. Third, while gene-based essentialist models for psychiatric disorders are conceptually appealing, they are not well supported empirically. Gene discovery in psychiatry is, on its own, unlikely to allow us to \"carve nature at its joints,\" thereby validating categorical psychiatric diagnoses. Fourth, the project to ground \"messy\" psychiatric categories on the firm foundation of genes-as an archetypal natural kind-may be fundamentally flawed because the very concept of \"the gene\" as a discrete entity is itself increasingly in doubt. Whereas psychiatric genetics has and will continue to provide important insights into the etiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders, it is not likely alone to provide deep answers to the complex and multifaceted problems facing psychiatric nosology."}, {"Title": "A survey of delirium guidelines in Europe.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the existence and content of delirium guidelines of the national psychiatric associations in Europe.\nA survey was sent by email to national coordinators of the European Association for Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry and Psychosomatics.\nResponses were obtained for 12 of the 14 countries that were approached.

Measurements of serum CK is a routine test in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and various muscle disorders. Elevation of the serum CK level in psychiatric patients is a fairly nonspecific phenomenon. Most commonly, an elevated serum CK level is due to intramuscular injections, use of restraints or other intense isometric activity.

Total cerebral tissue volumes were derived from automated segmentation procedures. Associations between metabolic stress and tissue volumes (as well as their interactions) on the one hand, and plasma HVA level on the other, were investigated using multilevel random regression techniques.\nAnalysis revealed a significant increase in plasma HVA over time in the 2DG condition. The increase in HVA in the stress condition was stronger in patients with lower grey and white matter volumes. There was no significant interaction between metabolic stress and CSF volume.\nLower grey and white matter volumes in schizophrenia are associated with a dysregulated dopaminergic/noradrenergic mediated stress response. These findings may support the hypothesis that alterations in cortico-subcortical connections affect psychosis susceptibility through an altered stress response."}, {"Title": "Decreased prefrontal activation during letter fluency task in adults with pervasive developmental disorders: a near-infrared spectroscopy study.", "Abstract": "Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is present in persons with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Recently, the development of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has enabled noninvasive bedside measurement of regional cerebral blood volume. Although NIRS enables the noninvasive clarification of brain functions in many psychiatric disorders, it has not yet been used to examine subjects with PDD. The aim of our study was to conduct an NIRS cognitive activation study to verify PFC dysfunction in PDD. The subjects were 10 adults with PDD and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Hemoglobin concentration changes were measured with a 24-channel NIRS machine during the letter fluency task. While the number of words generated during the letter fluency task did not differ significantly between groups, the analysis of covariance including IQ as a confounding covariate showed that the PDD group was associated with bilateral reduction in oxy-hemoglobin concentration change as compared with the control group. The statistical results did not change when only IQ-matched high-functioning subjects (N=7) were included. Moreover, reduced oxy-hemoglobin concentration change for the right PFC was significantly correlated with verbal communication deficits within the PDD group. The present findings are consistent with proposed prefrontal dysfunction in PDD subjects identified by other neuroimaging modalities. The present results may be also potentially useful for applying NIRS to clinical settings of child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "RETRACTED: Chronic administration of carbamazepine down-regulates AP-2 DNA-binding activity and AP-2alpha protein expression in rat frontal cortex.", "Abstract": "This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

With this the frequency of headaches gradually decreased over the next four months. He was followed up for 2 years when he was found to be symptom-free. Recent research into the mechanisms of migraine has identified that the cortical hyperexcitability and an imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitement mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid and excitatory amino acids respectively may be the underlying mechanism.

A recent study indicates that the volume of prefrontal cortical white matter may be disproportionately increased in man in comparison to other primate species, with evolutionary implications. We therefore re-analyzed the identical scans with a specific focus on the centrum semiovale (CSO) as a representative region of interest of cerebral white matter. The central hypothesis was, in accordance with our gray matter findings, that patients with GAD, in comparison to healthy controls, would exhibit either an increase in NAA in CSO, or alternatively demonstrate reductions in concentrations of choline (CHO)-containing compounds and/or creatine+phosphocreatine (CR). MRSI scans that were obtained from an earlier [Mathew, S.J., Mao, X., Coplan, J.D., Smith, E.L., Sackeim, H.A., Gorman, J.M., Shungu, D.C., 2004.

Self-reported worry was scored using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and intelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Serial multislice/multivoxel MRSI scans had been performed on a 1.5-T MRI. Using absolute quantification methods for metabolite concentrations, we examined NAA, CHO and CR. GAD patients without ET exhibited bilaterally decreased concentrations of CHO and CR in CSO in comparison to healthy volunteers, whereas GAD patients with ET were indistinguishable from controls. In patients with GAD, high IQ was paired with greater worry, whereas in healthy volunteers, high IQ was associated with less worry. In all subjects, IQ inversely predicted left and right CSO CHO concentrations, independent of age, sex, group assignment and PSWQ scores. The CSO may therefore represent a neural substrate that exhibits reductions in CHO and CR metabolite concentrations that are inversely associated with GAD symptomatology and, in the case of CHO, with intelligence. These conclusions are deemed preliminary due to small sample size, with further study of cerebral WM in anxiety disorders suggested."}, {"Title": "Women's reproductive health and depression: a community survey in the Gambia, West Africa.", "Abstract": "Depression is the commonest mental illness in developing countries and impoverished women are most at risk. Formal mental health services in these situations are rare. Depression commonly co-presents with physical symptoms or else is unspectacular, so the condition often goes unrecognised. To strengthen the prevention and management of depression, information is required on easily recognisable correlates of depression. This study explored associations between depression and reproductive health conditions in rural African women of reproductive age.\nA community-based reproductive health survey among rural women aged 15-54 years in The Gambia, West Africa, included screening with a modified Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS), a reproductive health questionnaire and a gynaecological examination. Depression was then assessed clinically and data for 565 women were used to estimate the prevalence of depression and examine associations with reproductive health conditions and demographic factors.\nThe weighted prevalence of depression was 10.3% (95% CI 8.3-12.7). Being depressed was most significantly associated with widowhood or divorce (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 8.42, 2.77-25.57), infertility (3.69, 1.42-9.65) and severe menstrual pain (3.94, 1.52-10.27). There were significant differences between ethnic groups. Being in the postpartum period was not associated with an increased likelihood of depression.\nThis study points to the importance of reproductive potential and reproductive health in maintaining women's mental well-being across different strata of a rural and resource-poor society.

Of these patients, 34 men and 42 women had calculated QTc intervals on their ECG and therefore made up the study population. Our data show that 29.4% of men and 21.4% of women had prolonged QTc intervals. However, neither diagnostic nor medicinal risk factors were found to be associated with an increased incidence of prolonged QTc interval in this patient population.\nThe preliminary findings of this study suggest that in this patient population the QTc interval may not be influenced by recognized risk factors to the same extent as observed in the adult population.

Current prevailing conceptual models in psychiatry are critically examined, with particular reference to neurobiology, clinical psychopharmacology, assessment, and the therapeutic process. Biological reductionism, neglect of individual responses to treatment, massive propaganda from the pharmaceutical industry, misleading effects of psychometric theory on clinical assessment, and lack of consideration of multiple therapeutic ingredients and of the role of psychological well-being are identified as major sources of an intellectual crisis in psychiatric research. The conceptual crisis of psychiatry is shared by other areas of clinical medicine and stems from a narrow concept of science that neglects clinical observation, the basic method of medicine. A unified concept of health and disease may yield new clinical insights in psychiatric disorders, and may result in therapeutic efforts of more enduring quality than current strategies."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenomics, informatics, and individual drug therapy in psychiatry: past, present and future.", "Abstract": "The modern era of psychopharmacology began in the 10 year period from the late 1940s to the late 1950s. During this period, the first antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers were all discovered. In the 1960s, the pharmacology of these drugs was elucidated and theories about the mechanisms of action proposed. In the 1970s and 1980s, new, more selective compounds were developed based on improved structure-activity relationships derived from in vitro receptor binding studies and animal models. These compounds entered clinical testing in the 1980s and began to be marketed in the late 1980s and 1990s. All of these agents were approved to treat psychiatric syndromes which are conditions defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms. None of these agents was developed based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of the illnesses being treated. None of these agents are curative and virtually all have limited clinical efficacy. In the earliest days of the modern era, there were few drugs available to combine and many had such broad actions that they were often marginally tolerated or unsafe when used in combination (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). With the advent of more medications, the frequency and extent of polypharmacy has exploded. In addition to simply having more drugs from which to select with different pharmacological profiles, many newer medications are also more selective in their pharmacological actions and thus are often better tolerated and safer when used in combination. In addition, there is the concern that the trade-off for more selective pharmacology may have been better tolerability at the expense of reduced efficacy, which clinicians then compensate for by using more medications in combination. For all of the above reasons, polypsychopharmacology has been present from the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacotherapy and continues to be the rule rather than the exception. In fact, the frequency and the complexity of such polypsychopharmacology are both enormous and increasing. The percentage of patients being discharged from the Biological Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health on more than three psychiatric medications increased more than ten times between 1974-79, and 1990-95. The majority of patients seen in the Veterans Administration Medical System in the United States are on unique combinations of medications and the frequency and complexity of such polypharmacotherapy is increased in patients on psychiatric medications. Throughout the modern era, there have been attempts to determine whether there are populations of patients selectively responsible to specific agents (e.g. serotonin versus norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, no compelling data have so far emerged. Instead, clinicians generally resort to combining drugs on the basis of symptoms such as psychosis and depression or anxiety and depression. Science has primarily informed the clinician about safety concerns rather than efficacy concerns when using such combinations. That will change in the future with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses which in turn will lead to improved therapies and the potential for more rationally derived combination treatments."}, {"Title": "Depression and anxiety status of patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator and precipitating factors.", "Abstract": "Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are life-saving devices in treatment of life-threatening arrhythmia.

Moreover, these drugs can be used to treat episodic impulsive aggressiveness. With regard to their use in the treatment of children and adolescents, however, there are limitations to several preparations on the market in Germany. The evidence level for the treatment of acute mania in adolescents is II, while it is only III-IV for treatment of the same disorder in children. There is only anecdotal evidence of relapse prevention in bipolar disorder in childhood (level of evidence: V), whereas the level of evidence for adolescence is higher (IV). With respect to episodic impulsive aggressiveness, there is a good evidence base (II) for treatment of the disorder in both children and adolescents. An evidence level of II indicates that at least one well designed, randomized, controlled study has been carried out; an evidence level of III is based upon non-randomized studies, an evidence level of IV upon non-experimental studies, and an evidence level of V indicates that evidence is limited to reports or opinions stated by expert circles and consensus conferences, and to clinical experience. Due to the narrow therapeutic window, the dosage should be based on serum concentrations of lithium between 0.6 and 1.2 mmol/l and should be adapted according to the clinical picture. Usually, lithium preparations are administered twice a day: in the morning and in the evening. Side effects have to be monitored very carefully.

This review resulted from extensive international and national searches using the following databases: Current Contents Connect, Social and Behavioral Sciences; EBSCO; EMBASE(R) Psychiatry; Evidence Based Medicine (through OVID); Medline, Neurosciences, PsychINFO, Pubmed, BIREME/PAHO/WHO--Virtual Health Library, and SciELO. Papers selected for further review included those published in Spanish, English, and Portuguese in peer-reviewed journals. From the evidence reviewed, it was found that the published research literature is heavily concentrated on descriptive epidemiologic surveys, providing primarily prevalence rates and general information on associated factors. Evidence on patterns of service delivery and HIV prevention and treatment is limited. The cumulative scope of this research clearly indicates variability in quantity and quality of research across Latin American nations and the need for greater uniformity in data collection elements, methodologies, and the creation of international collaborative research networks."}, {"Title": "[Dementia--diagnosis and treatment in a geriatric memory clinic].", "Abstract": "Today it is certain that dementia is caused by a disease and not by ageing. The field is within the neurological, psychiatric and geriatric subject areas. In the city of Copenhagen, discovery and treatment of dementia occur on three levels: (1) in general practice, (2) in local memory clinics headed by specialists in geriatrics, neurology and/or psychiatry, and (3) in the memory clinic at H:S Rigshospitalet. In 2000, the geriatric clinic at H:S Bispebjerg Hospital established a local memory clinic. The fact that the clinic was created within a basic speciality other than neurology, as at Rigshospitalet, made it necessary to carry out developmental work.\nA descriptive evaluation of 450 consecutive patient courses was performed. The patients were evaluated and treated in the memory unit in the period from 14 March 2001 to 31 December 2004.\n330 (73%) of the 450 patients were women, and 120 (27%) were men. The median age was 84 years (range 64-97 years), and the median MMSE score was 24 (range 1-30) at first consultation in the memory unit. A cerebral CT was done on 339 patients (75%), and a SPECT scan was done on 6 patients (1%). 90 patients (20%) were evaluated by a gerontopsychiatrist during the treatment course, and 151 patients (34%) were evaluated by a neuropsychologist. A diagnosis of irreversible dementia was made for 322 patients (72%).\nMost of the patients referred had a MMSE score greater than 20, and even patients with very high MMSE scores may suffer from irreversible dementia. Compared with examinations in Danish memory clinics in the context of neurology, there was a higher number of patients with irreversible dementia. The difference may probably be explained by the average age difference between the patients referred. The threshold of referring for evaluation of cognitive dysfunction may be lower for younger patients than for older patients. The geriatric concept is an appropriate platform for evaluation and treatment of older patients with cognitive dysfunction before such patients are hospitalized on an emergency basis or break down socially. To carry out complete and qualified evaluation and treatment, it is essential to establish local and close cooperation with a gerontopsychiatrist, a neurologist and a neuropsychologist."}, {"Title": "Folk concepts of mental disorders among Chinese-Australian patients and their caregivers.", "Abstract": "This paper reports a study of (a) popular conceptions of mental illness throughout history, (b) how current social and cultural knowledge about mental illness influences Chinese-Australian patients' and caregivers' understanding of mental illness and the consequences of this for explaining and labelling patients' problems.\nAccording to traditional Chinese cultural knowledge about health and illness, Chinese people believe that psychotic illness is the only type of mental illness, and that non-psychotic illness is a physical illness. Regarding patients' problems as not being due to mental illness may result in delaying use of Western mental health services.\nData collection took place in 2001. Twenty-eight Chinese-Australian patients with mental illness and their caregivers were interviewed at home, drawing on Kleinman's explanatory model and studies of cultural transmission. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed, and analysed for plots and themes.\nChinese-Australians combined traditional knowledge with Western medical knowledge to develop their own labels for various kinds of mental disorders, including 'mental illness', 'physical illness', 'normal problems of living' and 'psychological problems'. As they learnt more about Western conceptions of psychology and psychiatry, their understanding of some disorders changed. What was previously ascribed to non-mental disorders was often re-labelled as 'mental illness' or 'psychological problems'.\nEducational programmes aimed at introducing Chinese immigrants to counselling and other psychiatric services could be made more effective if designers gave greater consideration to Chinese understanding of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Clinical drug monitoring in child and adolescent psychiatry: side effects of atypical neuroleptics.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to improve and evaluate the practibility of a method for the assessment of drug-associated side effects, and we implemented a clinical drug monitoring for atypical neuroleptics.\nSide effects of initially hospitalized patients treated with clozapine (n = 16), olanzapine (n = 16), and risperidone (n = 19) were prospectively monitored on a weekly basis for the first 3 weeks. In the case of stable medication, measurements of all variables were made every 4 weeks or upon discharge. We used the Dosage Record Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (DOTES) in a supplemented version to measure the presence and severity of side effects.\nDrowsiness and decreased motor activity were common, especially in the first 2 weeks. Orthostatic hypotension, increased salivation, constipation, and nasal congestion were seen in more than 30% to 60% of patients treated with clozapine and were less common in adolescents treated with olanzapine and risperidone. Rigidity, tremor, and dystonia were seen in 5% to 15% of patients treated with risperidone and olanzapine. The average weight gain after 6 weeks of treatment with the atypical neuroleptics was significantly higher for the olanzapine group (4.6 +/- 1.9 kg) than for the risperidone (2.8 +/- 1.3 kg) and clozapine (2.5 +/- 2.9 kg) groups.\nThe authors' supplemented DOTES version is generally applicable to clinical use in mental health centers.

Most respondents thought that the postgraduate training programs already existing in many teaching hospitals are insufficient, but nevertheless useful. More staff may be needed for postgraduate education in neurology. The respondents considered that neurological education has generally functioned well, except in certain areas such as brain death judgment. On the other hand, the rotation of training in neurosurgery, psychiatry and child neurology is still inadequate. The problem of devising a suitable training rotation system in postgraduate education for neurologists has not yet been solved."}, {"Title": "Translating research findings into practice: example of treatment services for adolescents in managed care.", "Abstract": "An important question in the alcoholism treatment field is how research findings can be translated into real-world clinical practice. Researchers have developed a new research-practice integration (RPI) model that can both drive the formulation of studies and new research questions and promote improvements in treatment quality. The hallmark of this model is a collaborative relationship between the key stakeholders in both alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment and research, including health plan administrators and clinicians, treatment program administrators, psychiatry and primary care departments, patients and their families, purchasers, and researchers. The issue of technology transfer is especially relevant in the realm of adolescent AOD treatment. The implementation and feasibility of the RPI model are illustrated by a case study of a managed health care plan's treatment services for adolescents with AOD dependence. In this setting, key research findings are being used to shape the plan's adolescent health services."}, {"Title": "What's the problem?

The renaming was triggered by the request of a patients' families group. The main reasons for the renaming were the ambiguity of the old term, the recent advances in schizophrenia research, and the deep-rooted negative image of schizophrenia, in part related to the long-term inhumane treatment of most people with the disorder in the past. The renaming was associated with the shift from the Kraepelinian disease concept to the vulnerability-stress model. A survey carried out seven months after renaming in all prefectures of Japan found that the old term had been replaced by the new one in about 78% of cases. The renaming increased the percentage of cases in which patients were informed of the diagnosis from 36.7% to 69.7% in three years. Eighty-six percent of psychiatrists in the Miyagi prefecture found the new term more suitable to inform patients of the diagnosis as well as to explain the modern concept of the disorder.

Forensic evidence for the relevance of this bimodal theory is investigated. An appropriate methodology for data gathering, and two observational measures along with one self-report measure are explicated. Integration of this bimodal theory into forensic practice is suggested.

The lacking of clear criteria between the competencies of psychiatrists and psychologists is a certain standard in dealing with the disturbed or mentally ill persons. This is a result of the application of a multidisciplinary approach towards the patient in the area of diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation. The advancing psychiatric and psychological knowledge has a difficulty in findings its way to forensic psychiatry and psychology. However, owing to the fact that current legal regulations require complex psychiatric-psychological opinions to be formulated, it is worthy to take a closer look at the issue. The fore-mentioned model has its benefits and its flaws. The compiling of the complex opinion may bring about the risk of \"mixing up\" of the contents as used by the various experts and cause certain methodological problems. From another perspective it would appear that it is impossible to refrain from applying the newly developing interdisciplinary links. Positive experiences with the DSM classification give a strong argument to the sensibility of this approach. The author analyses the bases for cooperation between the psychiatric-psychological expertise which arises from the rules and regulations of the penal law and the code of penal conduct. They pertain to the rules of being able in body and mind and the application of the so called security measures. The model of psychiatric-psychological cooperation taken up by the law-giver does not pertain fully to the essential competencies of psychiatry and psychology and is not a compact consequential solution."}, {"Title": "Evolution of the antipsychiatry movement into mental health consumerism.", "Abstract": "This essay reviews the history and evolution of the antipsychiatry movement. Radical antipsychiatry over several decades has changed from an antiestablishment campus-based movement to a patient-based consumerist movement. The antecedents of the movement are traced to a crisis in self-conception between biological and psychoanalytic psychiatry occurring during a decade characterized by other radical movements. It was promoted through the efforts of its four seminal thinkers: Michel Foucault in France, R. D. Laing in Great Britain, Thomas Szasz in the United States, and Franco Basaglia in Italy. They championed the concept that personal reality and freedom were independent of any definition of normalcy that organized psychiatry tried to impose. The original antipsychiatry movement made major contributions but also had significant weaknesses that ultimately undermined it. Today, antipsychiatry adherents have a broader base and no longer focus on dismantling organized psychiatry but look to promote radical consumerist reform."}, {"Title": "Sex differences in outcome and recovery for schizophrenia and other psychotic and nonpsychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "It is generally believed by the field of psychiatry that women with schizophrenia have better outcomes and higher rates of recovery than their male counterparts, because many studies on the topic support this finding. Fewer data are available to assess potential sex differences among individuals with other psychotic disorders. This study used longitudinal data on sex differences previously unavailable to the field to examine long-term global outcome, potential recovery, course of illness, and rehospitalization for schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and nonpsychotic disorders.\nA total of 239 young psychiatric patients (mean age of 23.4 years) were assessed prospectively at the index hospitalization and then followed over 15 years at five follow-up points (at a mean of two, 4.5, 7.5, ten, and 15 years). The sample consisted of 69 patients with schizophrenia, 56 with other psychotic diagnoses, and 114 with nonpsychotic psychiatric disorders.\nSex differences in outcome were found for both patients with schizophrenia and those with other psychotic disorders, with women consistently showing better functioning over time, more frequent periods of good functioning and periods of recovery, less likelihood of uniformly poor outcome, and fewer and shorter rehospitalizations. Unlike both groups of patients who were psychotic, the patients with nonpsychotic disorders showed no significant sex differences in outcome.\nBoth longitudinally and at each individual follow-up point, the data suggest that women with schizophrenia and with other types of psychotic disorders generally show better outcome than men with similar diagnoses. The sex differences in outcome for patients with schizophrenia were consistent over time. However, these sex differences were only moderate in size compared with the much larger difference in outcome between the diagnostic groups. The longitudinal data add a new dimension to previous research and suggest that sex differences in outcome are not specific to patients with schizophrenia but rather occur among patients with psychotic disorders in general."}, {"Title": "A 30 year perspective of the quality of evidence published in 25 clinical journals: signs of change?", "Abstract": "The quality of clinical studies published in five different specialties, over three decades was evaluated.

Modern community mental health care considers social integration as vital for improving mental health. However, reports suggest that efforts to socially integrate people who suffer from mental health problems have not been as successful as anticipated. The aim of this study was to explore how people with mental health problems experience their ability to integrate socially into a community in central Norway. Three multistage focus groups, consisting of 17 people with mental health problems, were set up in two counties of different sizes. In this explorative study, data were analysed using a qualitative content analysis method. The participants experienced shame and fear of exclusion in their struggle to become integrated in the community. They had a sense of loneliness, had to struggle for equality and experienced being neglected. The days passed very slowly and they reported a lack of financial resources.

This paper aims to focus on portrayals of psychiatry and psychiatrists in four contemporary Irish feature films in order to make wider points on this theme.\nContemporary Irish feature-films that made substantial reference to psychiatry, psychiatrists or mental health in Ireland were identified though electronic searches and consultation with the Film Institute of Ireland. Selected films were viewed. Electronic searches were performed in the medical and film literatures, with broad search terms related to film, psychiatry, psychiatrists or mental health in Ireland. Additional books and papers were identified by tracking back through references and consulting with colleagues.\nThe portrayal of psychiatrists in film is closely related to the development of both twentieth century psychiatry and twentieth century cinema. In common with recent European films, certain recent Irish films have tended to show psychiatrists as sympathetic, humane individuals (with some notable exceptions). While there have been a number of portrayals of dissocial personally disorder and various states of chronic alienation in recent Irish film, there have been fewer portrayals of psychosis or learning disability. Recent Irish films emphasise the role of alcohol in causing and perpetuating psychological distress. They generally provide unflinching portrayals of the effects of psychological distress and alienation, suicide and substance abuse at individual, family and community levels; nonetheless, there is still a regrettable tendency for films to associate mental illness with dissocial behaviour.\nThe portrayal of mental health issues in film presents both challenges and opportunities to film-makers, mental health service-users and general audiences alike. It is to be hoped that the recent trend towards realistic explorations of mental health issues in many European films continues into the future. Increased research in this area would help clarify the role of cinema in shaping public understandings of mental illness, and may also help identify additional ways of addressing stigma in the future."}, {"Title": "Length of stay: managed care agenda or a measure of clinical efficiency?", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to provide clinicians a review of the literature on length of stay (LOS) in an effort to differentiate between superficial pressure from managed care and efficient inpatient care.

The results and discussion are presented in a qualitative fashion, citing findings of individual studies. Effort was made to give weight to studies with large samples, good study design with explanation of any limitations or shortcomings of the individual studies, and powerful findings. What we found was that despite daily pressure upon clinicians to continually reduce LOS, the body of literature examining methods to achieve this goal without sacrificing quality, as well as the outcomes of reduced LOS, is quite sparse. As this measure affects clinical management and the doctor/patient relationship, further in depth studies are needed.

In order to do this, we review its past in terms of its knowledge base in psychosomatic medicine and in terms of its practice at the bedside in the general hospital setting. We also offer a contemporary account of the field and finish with a subjective view of the opportunities and pitfalls faced during the next phase of consultation-liaison psychiatry in the 21st century."}, {"Title": "The use of propensity score methods in psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "The use of propensity score methods has become increasing widespread in public health, in medicine and in many other settings involving research with observational studies. The methods provide a useful and straightforward way of simultaneously controlling for many variables that potentially confound the relationship between a specific outcome and the treatment or exposure under study. The methods assist the researcher in avoiding certain dangers in more traditional regression modelling and, in the case of binary outcomes, allow for the control of a greater number of potential confounders. The use of propensity score techniques has been fairly limited in psychiatry, largely to studies of health care delivery and use. An introduction to propensity score methods is given and a series of examples illustrating their use in psychiatric research is presented."}, {"Title": "[Effectiveness of venlafaxine extended release and conventional antidepressants in elderly patients with depressive disorder].", "Abstract": "To determine and compare effectiveness, tolerability and safety of venlafaxine extended release (VXR) and other conventional antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for the treatment of elderly patients diagnosed of depressive disorder in an out-patient psychiatry setting.\nMulticenter, naturalistic, randomized, openlabel study performed in elderly patients with depressive disorder (according to DSM-IV). Patients were randomized to 6 months of treatment with VXR or another conventional antidepressant (CA). Effectiveness was assessed using the Montgomery- AAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). Response was considered as a > or = 50 % decrease and remission as a < 9 score in the MADRS.\nSample of 120 patients older than 60 years; 68 received VXR and 52 CA (SSRI: 94.1 %). Most frequently used SSRI were citalopram (40.8 %), paroxetine (24.5 %) and sertraline (20.4 %). After 6 months of treatment, VXR achieved a higher response (75 %, VXR; 50 %, CA; p = 0.048) and remission (50 %, VXR; 28.9 %, CA; p = 0.048) and a higher decrease in the HAM-A score (-14.77, VXR; -10.84, CA). There were no significant differences in compliance rates (67.6, VXR; 71.1 %, CA) and adverse reactions (14.7 %, VXR; 13.46 %, CA) between both treatment groups. Blood pressure and heart rate remained within normal limits in both treatment groups.\nIn this study, venlafaxine extended release shows higher effectiveness than other conventional antidepressants, mainly SSRIs, in the treatment of depressive elderly patients in the out-patient psychiatry setting."}, {"Title": "Structural interventions: concepts, challenges and opportunities for research.", "Abstract": "Structural interventions refer to public health interventions that promote health by altering the structural context within which health is produced and reproduced. They draw on concepts from multiple disciplines, including public health, psychiatry, and psychology, in which attention to interventions is common, and sociology and political economy, where structure is a familiar, if contested, concept. This has meant that even as discussions of structural interventions bring together researchers from various fields, they can get stalled in debates over definitions. In this paper, we seek to move these discussions forward by highlighting a number of critical issues raised by structural interventions, and the subsequent implications of these for research."}, {"Title": "Methylphenidate exerts no neurotoxic, but neuroprotective effects in vitro.", "Abstract": "Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most common used drug in child and adolescent psychiatry. Despite of this fact, however, little is known about its exact pharmacological mechanisms. Here we investigated the toxic effects of MPH in vitro in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells stably expressing the human dopamine transporter (HEK-hDAT cells) and in cultured rat embryonic (E14.5) mesencephalic cultures. MPH alone (up to 1 mM) affected neither the growth of HEK-hDAT cells nor the survival of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in primary cultures after treatment up to 72 h. No differences in neuronal arborisation or in the density of synapses were detected. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) showed no toxic effect in HEK-293 cells, but had significant toxic effects in HEK-hDAT cells and DA neurons. MPH (1 microM - 1 mM) dose-dependently reduced this cytotoxicity in HEK-hDAT cells and primary mesencephalic DA neurons. The presented results show that application of MPH alone does not have any toxic effect on DA cells in vitro. The neurotoxic effects of MPP(+) could be significantly reduced by co-application of MPH, an effect that is most likely explained by MPH blocking the DAT."}, {"Title": "Psychological distress experienced by families of cancer patients: preliminary findings from psychiatric consultation of a Cancer Center Hospital.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to obtain preliminary findings regarding psychiatric disorders and background characteristics among Japanese family members of cancer patients.\nWe investigated the psychiatric diagnosis and background factors of family members of cancer patients by analyzing the consultation data of patients referred to the Psychiatry Division, National Cancer Centre Hospital East, Japan.\nOf a total of 1469 psychiatric consultation, 47 (3.2%) family members were referred, and 85% of them were spouses. The most common patient cancer site was the lung. Approximately one-half of the referred family encountered patients' end-of-life issues.

Trainees' responses to the course, and the implications of these for teaching, learning and clinical practice, are considered.\nTrainees were interviewed, and their responses subjected to content analysis.\nTo some extent, the course appears to have met its objectives. However, some trainees found parts of the course content threatening, and reported negative perceptions of teaching staff and the process of critical appraisal.\nChallenging taken for granted beliefs in psychiatry is a fundamental skill, which should be fostered in trainee psychiatrists if the profession is to move forwards as an intellectual and clinical discipline.

In the present paper two attempts to transfer pharmaco-EEG methods to psychiatric clinical routine will be described: 1) monitoring of psychotropic drug toxicity at the central nervous system level, and 2) prediction of clinical response to treatment with psychotropic drugs. Both applications have been the object of several investigations providing promising and sometimes consistent findings which, however, had no impact on clinical practice. For the first topic, the review is limited to antipsychotics, lithium and recreational drugs, as for other psychotropic drugs mostly case studies are available, while for the response prediction it will include antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, psychostimulants and nootropics. In spite of several methodological limitations, pharmaco-EEG studies dealing with monitoring of antipsychotic- and lithium-induced EEG abnormalities went close to, but never became, a clinical routine. EEG studies of recreational drugs are flawed by several limitations, and failed, so far, to identify reliable indices of CNS toxicity to be used in clinical settings. Several QEEG studies on early predictors of treatment response to first generation antipsychotics have produced consistent findings, but had no clinical impact. For other psychotropic drug classes few and inconsistent reports have appeared. Pharmaco-EEG had the potential for important clinical applications, but so far none of them entered clinical routine. The ability to upgrade theories and methods and promote large scale studies represent the future challenge."}, {"Title": "EEG topography and tomography (LORETA) in the classification and evaluation of the pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "By multi-lead computer-assisted quantitative analyses of human scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (QEEG) in combination with certain statistical procedures (quantitative pharmaco-EEG) and mapping techniques (pharmaco-EEG mapping or topography), it is possible to classify psychotropic substances and objectively evaluate their bioavailability at the target organ, the human brain. Specifically, one may determine at an early stage of drug development whether a drug is effective on the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo, what its clinical efficacy will be like, at which dosage it acts, when it acts and the equipotent dosages of different galenic formulations. Pharmaco-EEG maps of neuroleptics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, hypnotics, psychostimulants and nootropics/cognition-enhancing drugs will be described. Methodological problems, as well as the relationships between acute and chronic drug effects, alterations in normal subjects and patients, CNS effects and therapeutic efficacy will be discussed. Imaging of drug effects on the regional brain electrical activity of healthy subjects by means of EEG tomography such as low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been used for identifying brain areas predominantly involved in psychopharmacological action. This will be shown for the representative drugs of the four main psychopharmacological classes, such as 3 mg haloperidol for neuroleptics, 20 mg citalopram for antidepressants, 2 mg lorazepam for tranquilizers and 20 mg methylphenidate for psychostimulants. LORETA demonstrates that these psychopharmacological classes affect brain structures differently. By considering these differences between psychotropic drugs and placebo in normal subjects, as well as between mental disorder patients and normal controls, it may be possible to choose the optimum drug for a specific patient according to a key-lock principle, since the drug should normalize the deviant brain function. Thus, pharmaco-EEG topography and tomography are valuable methods in human neuropsychopharmacology, clinical psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Perspectives: an international review of the national cost estimates of mental illness, 1990-2003.", "Abstract": "Mental illness is a major group of disorder that can lead to both physical and emotional disability. Policymakers need to learn not only the epidemiological indicators of mental illness, such as prevalence rate and incidence rate, but also the size of its negative impact on the economy.\nThis study is to review international publications on cost of major mental illness literature, from 1990 to 2003, focusing on the concepts, methods, and future perspective of cost illness studies. Reviewing the status quo on costs of mental illness can provide further information about gaps, limitations, and future needs on this topic.\nThis review searched all major international journals in psychiatry, clinical psychology, health economics, and mental health policy published since 1990. All national or aggregate cost of mental illness studies were included in the review. All were individually reviewed using a conceptual framework of cost of illness methodology.\nA large majority of published cost of mental illness studies were conducted in the US and UK. Cost of illness studies were lacking from Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Empirical results from the reviewed studies indicate that the negative economic consequences of mental illness far exceed the direct costs of treatment, thus making it important to treat mental illness. Direct treatment costs for each mental disorder (i.e. depression, schizophrenia, dementia, etc.) is between 1% and 2% of total national health care costs.\nThe studies reviewed indicate great variation in cost estimates even for the same mental disorder during the same time period within a country. These wide variations may be due to differences in disorder classification, definition of cost categories, sample populations, data sources, and discounting rate. Given the limitations of the cost of illness studies reviewed, one should be careful in interpreting and using these estimated results. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH SERVICES: These cost studies can be useful for understanding the magnitude of treating an illness of economic consequences or economic consequences of an illness for purposes of planning or budgeting. Such studies are one way to inform policymakers about economic consequences of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Factors disturbing treatment for cancer in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia who develop cancer often have a variety of complicated medical and psychiatric problems. Problems associated with receiving a diagnosis of cancer and with understanding or cooperating with medical treatment may develop. Research in managing and treating schizophrenia patients with cancer is scarce. Presented herein is the experience of the authors' consultation-liaison psychiatry service in treating patients with schizophrenia who have cancer, and discussion of the medical management of such cases. Fourteen patients were treated between April 1999 and March 2003 and included patients receiving consultation psychiatric services at Shimane University Hospital as well as patients referred from other psychiatric hospitals. These patients were divided into two groups based on whether they were amenable to cancer treatment or not. The treated group consisted of patients who accepted cancer treatment, and the untreated group consisted of patients who refused or interrupted the cancer treatment. The clinical course, clinical psychiatric symptoms, problems in understanding cancer, cancer treatment course and convalescence were retrospectively assessed. Psychiatric symptoms and state were measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The mean of the duration of schizophrenia in these two groups was not significantly different. The mean scores on measures of psychiatric symptoms in each group (treated and untreated) were as follows: BPRS, 45.3+/-15.4 and 64.9+/-9.2 (P<0.05); positive symptoms scores on PANSS, 14.4+/-8.8 and 20.6+/-6.0 (NS); negative symptoms scores on PANSS, 20.6+/-4.7 and 33.6+/-4.4 (P<0.01); and total scores on PANSS, 31.7+/-7.0 and 48.6+/-7.4 (P<0.01). Patients with severe negative symptoms had greater difficulty understanding and cooperating with the cancer treatment. Regarding cancer stage, when cancer was discovered, the disease had already advanced and was no longer amenable to first-line treatment. Regarding notification of the diagnosis, it was rarely possible to give sufficiently early notice to patients in the untreated group. The important role of consultation-liaison psychiatrist in treating cancer patients is suggested. Some steps are proposed for managing schizophrenia patients with cancer who are not able to give informed consent."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of telephone calls in a psychiatric outpatient practice.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to document the volume and characteristics of telephone calls from patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic.\nTelephone calls from a psychiatric resident's patients were logged over a 6-month period. Information collected included sex of the caller, reason for the call, deemed importance of the call, primary psychiatric diagnosis, and insurance type.\nA total of 291 calls occurred during the 6-month period, with an average of 2.4 calls per work day. The physician deemed 1.5% of calls to be an emergency and 15% to be urgent. Of the resident's total case load of 115 patients over the 6 month period, 29% (n = 33) of patients never made physician-patient telephone contact. Female patients were significantly more likely to call than males. Requests for medication refills were the most frequent type of call (38%). The mean number of calls per patient in the caseload was significantly different across diagnostic groups, with patients with personality disorders and anxiety spectrum disorders making more calls than other groups. There was no significant difference in the volume of telephone calls between patients with private health insurance and those without.\nThis study may be of particular interest to physicians and managed care systems who are interested in reimbursement for telephone psychiatry. This study confirms and extends the previously reported association between certain psychiatric disorders (personality disorders, anxiety spectrum disorders) and relative frequency of telephone calls to the physician. In addition, the high volume of calls for prescription refills is an important issue in telephone management."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic characteristics of the neighborhood and depressive symptoms in older adults: using multilevel modeling in geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics may be important to the mental health of older adults who have decreased mobility and fewer resources. Our objective was to examine the association between neighborhood context and level of depressive symptomatology in older adults in a diverse geographic region of central North Carolina.\nThe sample included 2,998 adults 65 or older residing in 91 census tracts. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Neighborhoods were characterized by five census-based characteristics: socioeconomic disadvantage, socioeconomic advantage, racial/ethnic heterogeneity, residential stability, and age structure.\nIn ecologic level analyses, level of census tract socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with increased depressive symptoms. To determine whether neighborhood context was associated with depressive symptoms independently of individual characteristics, the authors used multilevel modeling. The authors examined the ability of each of five neighborhood (level 2) characteristics to predict a level 1 outcome (CES-D symptoms) controlling for the effects of individual (level 1) characteristics. Younger age, being widowed, lower income, and having some functional limitations were associated with increased depression symptoms conditional on census tract random effects. However, none of the neighborhood characteristics was significantly associated with depression symptoms, conditional on census tract random effects, either unadjusted or adjusted for individual characteristics.\nAny observed association between neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics and individual depressive symptoms in our sample may reflect the characteristics of the individuals who reside in the neighborhood rather than the neighborhood characteristics themselves. The use of multilevel modeling is important to separate these effects."}, {"Title": "A cognitive blueprint of collaboration in context: distributed cognition in the psychiatric emergency department.", "Abstract": "The complex cognitive processes that underlie human performance in 'messy' contexts such as critical care medicine suggest a need for a cognitive model with broad scope to support the understanding of error in such domains. The objective of this research is to characterize the cognition that underlies patient care in the domain of emergency psychiatry in order to enhance the understanding of error in this context.\nThe theoretical framework of distributed cognition has been used to study collaborative decision-making in a number of similarly complex environments such as airline cockpits and air traffic control towers. These environments share certain characteristics with the critical care domain: the work is collaborative in nature, it is supported by artifacts that can be studied directly, and the consequences of error are dire. However, the nature of the work in this domain and the artifacts used to support it are unique. The application of the theoretical constructs of distributed cognition to this context is necessary in order to characterize the collective thinking that underlies critical care. Our research uses a combination of ethnographic and interview data to derive a distributed cognitive model of the psychiatric emergency department (PED), a high volume clinical unit dealing exclusively with the acute phases of psychiatric crises. The dynamics of workflow within the department are complex: several types of clinician collaborate by forming temporary multidisciplinary teams that attach to and manage particular patients. The component members of these teams change over time.\nUsing the theoretical framework of distributed cognition, we interpreted the collected data to derive a cognitive model of the distribution of work and information flow in the PED. This modeling process has revealed several latent flaws in the system related to the underlying distribution of cognition across teams, time, space and artifacts.\nThe characterization of this distribution has enhanced our understanding of the cognitive dynamics underlying error in this environment, and will serve to guide future research on error management in the ED and inform the development of context-appropriate error-management systems."}, {"Title": "The problem of the psychopharmacologist.", "Abstract": "The psychopharmacologist designation currently pervades and heavily influences the practice, perception, and teaching of clinical psychiatry. The authors hope to make a case and provide the raw material for informed discussion of this role during psychiatric residency training.\nA definition for the psychopharmacologist is sought. Historical trends in psychiatry which contributed most to its evolution are explored. Problems of the psychopharmacologist role are delineated. Extant solutions to psychiatry's problematic adaptation to an increasingly biological clinical role are critiqued, and a more effective one is pursued.\nThe term psychopharmacologist seems linked to presumed scientific and medical approaches, a goal of symptom relief through medication, and often other providers who are considered patients' \"primary\" treaters. The role derives largely from economic and remedicalization trends. Aspects of disengagement are determined to form the core problem of the psychopharmacologist. The authors propose that psychiatry is defined by its practice of the medical model and call attention to three areas where the psychopharmacologist role and the medical model collide.\nEngaging psychiatric residents in a new dialogue about their role as physician will challenge the previously unquestioned psychopharmacologist categorization, begin to address its problems, and bring a vital element to trainees' professional identity development."}, {"Title": "To commit or not to commit: the psychiatry resident as a variable in involuntary commitment decisions.", "Abstract": "To study whether psychiatry residents' personal variables (such as age, gender, level of training, previous experience with patient suicide, or lawsuits) and their temperamental predispositions have an impact on their decisions to seek involuntary commitment.\nIn a prospective pilot study, all psychiatry residents in Massachusetts were surveyed using a questionnaire that assessed their risk-taking behavior and clinical vignettes of patients with risk of harm to self or others.

Compared to students who did not take the exam, students who took the PCX were significantly more likely (p<0.05) to receive positive ratings on the CCX items for professionalism, addressing patients' stressors at work and home and inquiring about thoughts of harm to self or others.\nThe implementation of the PCX during the psychiatry clerkship significantly improved student performance on several important components of the CCX, which is used to prepare students for the Step 2 CSA. This suggests that the use of standardized patients during the clerkship may help students improve their interviewing and interpersonal skills."}, {"Title": "Why are doctors still prescribing neuroleptics?", "Abstract": "There are two main pharmacological methods of suppressing undesired behaviour: sedation or neuroleptics. Traditionally, the invention of neuroleptics has been hailed as one of the major clinical breakthroughs of the twentieth century, since they calmed agitation without (necessarily) causing sedation. The specifically neuroleptic form of behavioural control is achieved by making patients psychologically Parkinsonian, which entails emotional blunting and consequent demotivation. Furthermore, chronic neuroleptic usage creates dependence, so that in the long term, neuroleptics are doing most patients more harm than good. The introduction of 'atypical' neuroleptics (neuroleptically-weak but strongly sedative neuroleptics) has made only a difference in degree, and at the cost of a wide range of potentially fatal metabolic and other side-effects. For half a century, the creation of millions of Parkinsonian patients may have been misinterpreted as a 'cure' for schizophrenia. Such a wholesale re-interpretation of neuroleptic therapy represents an unprecedented disaster for the self-image and public reputation of both psychiatry and the whole medical profession. Nonetheless, except as a last resort, neuroleptics should swiftly be replaced by gentler and safer sedatives."}, {"Title": "A family showing resistance to thyroid hormone associated with chronic thyroiditis and its clinical features: A case report.", "Abstract": "Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is characterized by decreased tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone, due mainly to mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta gene. It has been reported that serum of patients with RTH lacks autoantibodies against thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO), except in rare cases where there is co-occurrence of coincidental autoimmune thyroiditis. Here we describe the five-year medical history of a Japanese woman and her father with RTH and coincidental chronic thyroiditis. The woman, aged 28 years, was referred to our hospital because of suspected hyperthyroidism. She showed a normal level of TSH and elevated levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4). Anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies were slightly positive. Since RTH was suspected, her parents were investigated with informed consent. Her father showed elevated levels of TSH, FT3 and FT4, and was positive for both anti-Tg antibody and anti-TPO antibody. Her mother had hypothyroidism caused by chronic thyroiditis. Sequencing of the TR beta gene showed that the patient and her father had a codon 453 mutation resulting in a CCT (proline) to ACT (threonine) substitution. The patient gradually developed emotional disturbance, and was admitted to a psychiatry ward for two months, where she was treated with lorazepam and her condition improved. Her father, on the other hand, has been doing well for five years. The patient and the father showed different clinical courses, even though they carried the same mutation of the TR beta gene. The fact that the father showed an elevated TSH level, whereas the patient did not, was thought to be due to decreased thyroid function caused by chronic thyroiditis."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based psychiatry: understanding the limitations of a method.", "Abstract": "Evidence-based psychiatry (EBP) is an important and useful method. However, it covers only a limited range of clinical problems psychiatrists and psychotherapists encounter in daily work.

EBP is entirely depending on diagnoses, so one of its core assumptions is of doubtful applicability in the field of psychiatry and psychotherapy. (ii) Effects of complexity are more obvious in psychiatric and psychotherapeutic cases. Owing to its conceptual bases, EBP cannot sufficiently consider such effects and is therefore of limited usefulness addressing particular problems in fluctuating or symptomatically shifting diseases. (iii) EBP's strong focusing on decision making does not reflect appropriately the clinical reality of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are in fact more iterative, and decisions are constantly re-evaluated.

Their use has, however, mostly been confined to forensic psychiatry for assessing the risk among perpetrators to repeat violent acts. In general psychiatry, very few studies of violence risk among discharged persons from acute inpatient units have been conducted. The available instruments are extensive and time consuming. This study aimed at the construction of a brief checklist. A 33-item scale, the PS (Preliminary Scheme), strongly influenced by the established HCR-20 (Historical, Clinical and Risk Management Assessment Scheme) was developed to undergo logistic regression analysis and possible item reduction. One hundred and ten patients from an acute inpatient unit, scored with PS at discharge, were monitored for violent episodes throughout the following year. Risk assessments and violence registrations were then compared. Of the 110 patients, 29 (26%) had acted violently during the follow-up, with the PS showing a definite association with post-discharge violence. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the instrument yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (P<0.01). Regression analysis indicated that the number of PS items could be strongly reduced without losing predictive validity. Even a four-item checklist showed a higher AUC (0.77) than the PS did with all 33 items. The four items were: 1) Previous violence, 2) Substance use problems, 3) Lack of empathy and 4) Stress. The development of a brief risk assessment instrument with good predictive properties seems possible. Further clinical trials are planned.

Using atypical antipsychotics, the EPS incidence is lower, but a low-dosage strategy using typical antipsychotics is also known to cause fewer EPS. What conclusions can be drawn for the daily clinical practice? A naturalistic study including all schizophrenic inpatients in a psychiatric ward (n=123) analysed the effects of treatment concerning positive/negative symptoms, EPS, number of days to re-hospitalization and inpatient-days in the year after baseline admittance, using atypical and typical antipsychotics as recommended by the Danish Society of Psychiatry. The incidence of EPS was significantly higher in patients who were treated with typical antipsychotics in relation to atypical antipsychotics (46% vs. 12%, P<0.001). Patients with EPS had significantly more negative symptoms and a poorer level of function at discharge. Nevertheless, no difference regarding re-hospitalization and inpatient-days was found, whether the patient was treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics. However, it is important to underline that patients treated with atypical oral antipsychotic do as well as patients on typical depot antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "[Dysfunctional parenting: prevention and care].", "Abstract": "This article exposes the work realised by a child psychiatry organization of prevention cares in pre- or post-partum, based on an intricately articulated network of professionals.

Given a variety of evidence implicating the prefrontal cortex and its dopaminergic circuits in cognition, most of the research conducted to date has focused on genes regulating dopaminergic function. Here we review the genetic association studies carried out on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and the dopamine receptor genes, D1, D2 and D4. In addition, the evidence implicating another promising candidate gene, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neuropsychological function, is assessed. Both the COMT val158met polymorphism and the BDNF val66met variant appear to influence cognitive function, but the specific neurocognitive processes involved continue to be a matter of debate. Part of the difficulty is distinguishing between false positives, pleiotropy and the influence of a general intelligence factor, g. Also at issue is the complexity of the relevant neuromolecular pathways, which make the inference of simple causal relationships difficult. The implications of molecular genetic cognitive research for psychiatry are discussed in light of these data."}, {"Title": "Toward an integrative model of the spectrum of mood, behavioral and personality disorders based on fear and anger traits: II. Implications for neurobiology, genetics and psychopharmacological treatment.", "Abstract": "Current psychiatry relies on a purely categorical paradigm for diagnosis of mental disorders that profoundly impacts research and clinical practice. However, high comorbidity rates and relative non-specificity of family history for psychiatric disorders suggests that this categorical approach fails to identify the underlying diathesis. As an attempt to overcome such limitations, we developed a bidimensional model based on fear and anger traits or temperaments which does not preclude the use of a categorical approach. As a result, it is hypothesized that mood, behavioral and personality disorders share a neurobiological substrate according to combinations of fear and anger traits. Both fear and anger, when excessive or deficient, lead to increased risk for mental disorders and should be considered in genetic, neurobiological and neuroimaging studies. Fear traits are much influenced by the amygdala and the serotonergic, noradrenergic and GABAergic systems, whereas anger seems to be mostly regulated by the nucleus accumbens and the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. Pharmacological treatments with antidepressants and anxiolytics can be considered as essentially restraint on fear, whereas lithium and alpha2 noradrenergic agonists would attenuate fear deficiency. Dopaminergic antidepressants and psychostimulants are anger enhancers and antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, such as divalproate and carbamazepine, may share antianger effects. Drugs effective for manic and depressive phases probably have both antianger and antifear effects. This framework may lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological basis of mental health and disease, providing an integrative approach for future research."}, {"Title": "Attitudes and beliefs among patients treated with mood stabilizers.", "Abstract": "There is increasing evidence that attitudes and beliefs are important in predicting adherence in depressive and bipolar disorders. However, such attitudes and beliefs on mood stabilizers have not been analysed by socio-demographic and clinical variables.\nThe Mood Stabilizer Compliance Questionnaire (MSQC) was mailed to a large population of patients with depressive or bipolar disorder representative of patients treated at their first contacts to hospital settings in Denmark.\nOf the 1005 recipients, 49.9 % responded to the letter and among these 256 indicated that they previously had been or currently were in treatment with a mood stabilizer. A large proportion of the patients (40 to 80 %) had non-correct views on the effect of mood stabilizers. Older patients consistently had a more negative view on the doctor-patient relationship, more non-correct views on the effect of mood stabilizers and a more negative view on mood stabilizers. There was no difference in the attitudes and beliefs according to the type of disorder (depressive or bipolar), the number of psychiatric hospitalisations or according to the type of the current doctor (general practitioner, private psychiatrist, community psychiatry doctor, hospital doctor, other doctor).\nThere is a need of improving knowledge and attitudes toward diagnosis and treatment especially among elder patients as this may add to improve the prognosis of depressive and bipolar disorders."}, {"Title": "[Depression and legal capacity to stand trial].", "Abstract": "The criteria for assessment of legal capacity to stand trial have long been a significant issue in the Polish criminal law. The main problem in opinionating practice is the fact that the code of penal procedure and the executive penal code do not provide any univocal criteria of a mental disease that should be met according to the legal regulations in force. Because of their nature and lack of uniformity, depression and affective disorders pose a particularly great problem for experts who should opinionate on the legal capacity of the suspected and the accused to stand trial. On the one hand, it cannot be accepted that a mental illness renders a person unable to substantially understand legal proceedings and to make a rational defense. On the other hand, however, emotional reactions and mild-degree depression disorders that are only natural when an individual violates law should not be allowed to be regarded as a grave disease and to paralyze legal proceedings. In the present study, the authors have attempted to describe the guidelines that should be followed by court-appointed experts in psychiatry that are commissioned by the court to assess the mental state of an individual.

Over the last 40 years, however, it has virtually disappeared from the professional landscape. This decline occurred at the very time that a proliferation of complaint organizations and agencies of accountability were drawing more and more people into asserting their individual rights through the pursuit of claims and grievances. Querulous behaviour, as a result, far from declining, is on the increase, bringing with it suffering for the querulous and disruption to the organizations through which they seek their vision of justice. This article examines querulous behaviour in the vexatious litigant and in abnormally persistent complainants and petitioners. The phenomenological and nosological issues are outlined and the risks of the emergence of threatening and violent behaviour is emphasized. Threats should not be ignored, for a variety of reasons. Approaches to managing querulous behaviour in the courts and the complaint organizations are discussed, together with the utility of individual therapy. Querulous behaviour should once more take its place among the legitimate concerns of mental health professionals. Those caught up in a querulous pursuit of their notion of justice are amenable to management that can ameliorate their suffering and reduce the disruption they create."}, {"Title": "[Survey on awareness of violence against children and the use of the guide \"violence against children and young people\" by paediatricians in Brandenburg].", "Abstract": "Following the lead of other German Federal States, Brandenburg has developed a guide entitled \"Violence Against Children and Young People\" for use by paediatricians. This guide has two objectives: to help doctors detect violence against children at an early stage, and to improve interdisciplinary case management. In order to assess whether the guide has proved its worth in practice, the Public Health Institute of Brandenburg conducted a survey among users. In addition, paediatricians treating the victims were interviewed to obtain estimates of the incidence rate of such acts of violence against children.\nIn 2002/03, the guide was provided free of charge to all paediatricians engaged in the treatment of in- and outpatients, and a structured questionnaire was used to interview a total of 285 such doctors and child and youth psychiatrists on the following topics: estimated incidence rate of acts of violence (proven and suspected cases), case management in practice (cooperation with other agencies, provision of care, support needs) as well as assessment of the guide's content and design in terms of the practical utility of the information provided. After the questionnaires had been sent out a second time, the response rate was 33.3 % (92 out of a total of 285).\n82 (89.1 %) of the paediatricians questioned had dealt with at least one case of violence against children in 2003; only three doctors had seen no case at all. A total of 904 proven and 945 suspected cases were registered. One striking result of the survey was the great variation in the number of cases registered by individual doctors: between 0 and 179 proven cases, and between 0 and 120 suspected cases. 12 doctors (13 %) stated that they had treated proven or suspected cases in all four categories (physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, sexual abuse). Other doctors registered no proven, only suspected cases. 80 doctors (87 %) questioned said that they worked together with other agencies, but 19 (20.6 %) were dissatisfied with this cooperation. 59 (64.1 %) reported a need for case-related support, particularly from the following institutions: 1. Youth Welfare Office, 2. Child and Youth Psychiatry, 3. Public Health Office. 19 (30.4 %) doctors regarded the local provision of care as insufficient. Results of the guide's evaluation: 44 out of a total of 49 doctors (88.8 %) considered the guide's design and contents \"good\" or \"very good\". 19 doctors (38.8 %) stated that the guide had led to changes in the way they work and that they were now able to deal with the problem of violence against children more confidently.\nPaediatricians in Brandenburg testify to cases of violence against children. The guide \"Violence Against Children and Young People\" offers useful information on the practical handling of such cases. The alliance \"Growing up Healthy in Brandenburg\" tackless the need for support by developing a catalogue of measures to be implemented. These include conducting specialised further training for paediatricians as well as cross-disciplinary furthertraining measures, and setting up regional working groups to improve basic networking in practice."}, {"Title": "A 40-basepair VNTR polymorphism in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene and the rapid response to antidepressant treatment.", "Abstract": "Finding predictors of the response to antidepressant therapy is a major goal of molecular psychiatry. The genes encoding the serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT1) transporters are among the possible candidate genes modulating an individual's antidepressant response. In a naturalistic prospective cohort study with a total of 190 fully assessed patients, improvement of depression symptoms during the 3 weeks following initiation of antidepressant therapy was recorded using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The SLC6A3 3' UTR 40-bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and the SLC6A4 5' 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. There was a significantly smaller number of rapid responders among homozygous carriers of the DAT1 9-repeat allele (9/9) than among heterozygous (9/10) and homozygous (10/10) carriers of the 10-repeat allele (19 versus 37 versus 52%, respectively, P=0.0037). Median decline in HDRS score was 35, 40, and 52% in patients with the 9/9, 9/10, and 10/10 genotypes, respectively (P=0.013). The effect was found in all classes of medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics, mirtazapine, venlafaxine) and statistically significant also within the subgroup of patients having received SSRIs. The serotonin promoter insertion/deletion genotype had no effect in the entire study group, but there was an insignificant trend of better response in the l/l and l/s carriers who received SSRIs or mirtazapine. In conclusion, the dopamine transporter VNTR polymorphism influenced rapid response to antidepressant therapy. Compared with homozygous carriers of the 10-repeat allele, carriers of the 9/10 genotype had an odds ratio (OR) calculated by logistic regression analysis of 1.6 (95% CI 0.8-3.2) and carriers of the 9/9 genotype had an OR of 6.0 (1.5-24.4) for no or poor response.

In the process, brutal deinstitutionalization of very ill patients took place, at least in the United States. These events were not inevitable. In 1949, the Menningers of Topeka, Kansas, began administering Topeka State Hospital, which was in deplorable condition. By concentrating expenditures on clinical personnel, the Menningers humanely deinstitutionalized many patients before chlorpromazine, before the entitlement programs of the U.S. federal government such as Medicaid (1965), and before the community psychiatry movement got under way. Topeka State Hospital furnished a model of mental health care that centered a whole system on a last-resort, large, specialized state mental hospital.

Studies carried out in the USA have repeatedly shown areas of weakness in residency training, but there are no studies looking at the overall adequacy of training across Canada.\nTo assess practising paediatricians' perceptions of the adequacy of their residency training as preparation for clinical practice and to assess practising paediatricians' opinions about the required mandatory length of training.\nA questionnaire based on previous studies was sent to 434 paediatricians certified between 1999 and 2003, asking for their opinions of their preparedness for practice in the broad areas of paediatrics and in the professional roles of the doctor-specialist.\nOverall, 239 (55%) paediatricians replied, 96% of whom indicated they were 'adequately' or 'very well' trained. Areas in which opinions on training were positive included emergency medicine, neonatology, endocrinology, haematology/oncology, neurology, infectious diseases and respirology. Areas where preparation was considered to have been less adequate included gynaecology, child psychiatry, behavioural psychology, surgical specialties, orthopaedics and adolescents. With respect to the roles of the doctor-specialist, strengths of training included the areas of medical expert, collaborator, ethics and professionalism, and communicator. Respondents felt they were less adequately prepared for the role of a medical expert dealing with palliative care, for dealing with bereaved parents and as manager of an office practice. Despite these weaknesses, 80% felt that 4 years of training was sufficient.\nThe results of the study are comparable with those of previous studies carried out in the USA and reinforce the need for regular programme assessment. This study will hopefully lead to the improvement of current paediatric residency programmes and enhanced education and training of future paediatricians. Although overall satisfaction with training was high, paediatric programmes need to make some changes by providing more appropriate training with less tertiary care, hospital-based training and more community and ambulatory-based experiences."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and psychiatrists in the U.S.A. cinema].", "Abstract": "United States cinema motion pictures from the beginning of 20th century to the present are characterized by massive use of sterotypes to represent psychiatrist's image, as well as psychiatric treatment and inpatients psychiatric facilities.

The major reason for the shortcomings of the current psychiatric diagnosis is the lack of a scientific brain-related etiological knowledge about mental disorders. The advancement toward such knowledge is further hampered by the lack of a theoretical framework or \"language\" that translates clinical findings of mental disorders to brain disturbances and insufficiencies. Here such a theoretical construct is proposed based on insights from neuroscience and neural-computation models. Correlates between clinical manifestations and presumed neuronal network disturbances are proposed in the form of a practical diagnostic system titled \"Brain Profiling\". Three dimensions make-up brain profiling, \"neural complexity disorders\", \"neuronal resilience insufficiency\", and \"context-sensitive processing decline\". The first dimension relates to disturbances occurring to fast neuronal activations in the millisecond range, it incorporates connectivity and hierarchical imbalances appertaining typically to psychotic and schizophrenic clinical manifestations. The second dimension relates to disturbances that alter slower changes namely long-term synaptic modulations, and incorporates disturbances to optimization and constraint satisfactions within relevant neuronal circuitry. Finally, the level of internal representations related to personality disorders is presented by a \"context-sensitive process decline\" as the third dimension. For practical use of brain profiling diagnosis a consensual list of psychiatric clinical manifestations provides a \"diagnostic input vector\", clinical findings are coded 1 for \"detection\" and 0 for \"non-detection\", 0.5 is coded for \"questionable\". The entries are clustered according to their presumed neuronal dynamic relationships and coefficients determine their relevance to the specific related brain disturbance. Relevant equations calculate and normalize the different values attributed to relevant brain disturbances culminating in a three-digit estimation representing the three diagnostic dimensions. brain profiling has the promise for a future brain-related diagnosis. It offers testable predictions about the etiology of mental disorders because being brain-related it lends readily to brain imaging investigations. Being presented also as a one-point representation in a three-dimensional space, multiple follow-up diagnoses trace a trajectory representing an easy-to-see clinical history of the patient. Additional, more immediate, advantages involve reduced stigma because it relaters the disorder to the brain not the person, in addition the three-digit diagnostic code is clinically informative unlike the DSM codes that have no clinical relevance. To conclude, brain profiling diagnosis of mental disorders could be a bold new step toward a \"clinical-neuroscience\" substituting \"psychiatry\"."}, {"Title": "ECT and the youth: catatonia in context.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been in psychiatric practice for well over half a century, but it continues to incite controversy. However, it is regarded amongst psychiatrists as a safe and effective treatment and at times even a lifesaver. It offers a fairly swift but a time-limited response, opening up opportunities for initiation of more longer lasting treatments. The use of ECT in the youth is limited, and as such good studies are few and far between. The recent Practice Parameters by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, specifically addressing ECT in adolescents, is indeed a welcome addition. Electrocovulsive therapy is as effective in the youth as it is in the adults, and the indications and contraindication are the same. The administration of ECT follows the same general principles in all age groups. One particular indication is of the use in catatonia, a motor syndrome that could occur with affective disorders, schizophrenia or medical conditions, in which it is considered to be extremely effective. The association between catatonia and autism and spectrum disorders has been noted, and in this situation, ECT is considered by some to be effective. Ethical considerations and that of capacity and informed consent are of paramount importance as are the human rights. Working in partnership with the parents/carers all the way is a must. The lack of information leaflets on ECT especially designed for young patients and their parents has to be rectified soon.

Other findings in child and adolescent catatonia suggest that sex ratio and associated disorders may differ, and the proposed classification of Taylor and Fink (2003) needs modification. Adopting a broader diagnostic schedule may accommodate both child, adolescent, and adult catatonia.

In order to interpret the plasma levels accurately, age, gender, ethnicity, compliance, drug dosage, renal and hepatic function and comedication incl. smoking habits and diet (esp. caffeine intake and consumption of grapefruit juice) have to be taken into account. If in doubt, aberrant plasma levels should be confirmed by a second control under optimized conditions. Pharmacogenetic testing enables the identification of abnormal metabolizers. TDM and pharmacogenetic tests are useful tools to improve pharmacotherapy by preventing dose-dependent adverse drug events, optimizing dosage during long-term treatment and identifying ultrarapid metabolizers and malcompliance."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and the consumer movement.", "Abstract": "We agree that consumers' perspectives have had a limited impact on major policy shifts but note that they have resulted in important changes in the role of patients and families in all aspects of mental health treatment.

A sizeable number of elderly subjects are referred to regional forensic units. These units are able to provide advice but are reluctant to admit frail, physically ill and vulnerable elderly into their unit because the ward environment is considered inappropriate for them. A sizeable number of inpatients in medium and high secure units are elderly. This paper is an exploratory audit of referrals from a medium and high secure forensic psychiatry unit to a specialist consultation-only liaison old age psychiatry service, which was specifically developed to service the forensic unit. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients seen by this specialist service were similar to elderly inpatients in medium and high secure units. All referrals were judged to be appropriate and new management advice was provided in all cases. Main reasons for referral included diagnostic advice, placement advice and treatment advice. Establishing a diagnosis of dementia was considered important because Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. Placement advice was the most difficult to provide because of paucity of residential and nursing homes able and willing to accept patients with a forensic history. There is a need for a comprehensive model of specialist forensic old age psychiatry service at a regional or supraregional level. A consensus needs to be reached on the exact configuration of such a service."}, {"Title": "[Thanatophobia in the patients on dialysis].", "Abstract": "Thanatophobia is an exaggerated, specific, structured fear of death. It appears in childhood and continues to grow over the years, and in the old age it is accompanied with nosophobia and other mental disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze thanatophobia in dialysed patients which was in the direct connection with a basic disorder, and the influence of this disorder on functioning and the quality of life of the patients on dialysis.\nIn the study we examined 753 patients from the chronic program of haemodialysis in a period from 1999 to 2004. The patiens were classified in two groups: 348 randomized patients with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), and the control group (N18) of patients with terminal renal insufficiency, and other diagnoses (n = 405). Since the study was a comparative, cross-sectional one, the patients were tested by the appropriate questionnaires for anxiety, depression and general mental functioning. Statistical analysis was done by the standard descriptive and analytic statistic methods.\nBased on socio-demographics data we revealed a highly significant difference regarding the place of living between the groups BEN and N18 (chi2 = 23.970; p < 0.01), the frequency of occurrence of renal comorbidity (chi2 = 23.970; p < 0.01), the frequency of familly renal comorbidity in siblings (chi2 = 23.970; p < 0.01), and the frequency of migrationes (chi2 = 4.874; p < 0.01). According to psychiatry scales, the patiens from the BEN group were significantly more anxious and depressive than those from the control group.\nThe signs of thanatophobia were revealed in both examined groups, but significantly more in the patients with BEN than in those with other nephrologic diseases. Thanatophobia starts before dialysis, and dialysis structures it into fear of death which is in a direct connection with the basic disorder. This intensive fear may be connected with dementia and depression, but also with other mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Coronary artery disease is associated with Alzheimer disease neuropathology in APOE4 carriers.", "Abstract": "To examine the associations between postmortem Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology and autopsy-verified cardiovascular disease.\nThe authors examined 99 subjects (mean age at death = 87.6; SD = 8.7) from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry Brain Bank who were devoid of cerebrovascular disease-associated lesions or of non-AD-related neuropathology. Density of neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) as well as coronary artery and aortic atherosclerosis, left ventricular wall thickness, and heart weight were measured. Partial correlations were used to assess the associations of the four cardiovascular variables with NPs and NFTs in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and multiple regions of the cerebral cortex after controlling for age at death, sex, dementia severity, body mass index, and ApoE genotype. These analyses were also repeated separately for ApoE4 carriers and noncarriers.\nThe extent of coronary artery disease and to a lesser extent atherosclerosis were significantly associated with the density of cardinal neuropathologic lesions of AD in this autopsy sample (significant correlations between 0.22 and 0.29). These associations were more pronounced for the ApoE4 allele carriers (n = 42; significant correlations between 0.34 and 0.47).\nThe degree of coronary artery disease is independently associated with the cardinal neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer disease.

The present study aims to examine the possible role of perceptual priming in this phenomenon. It further investigates whether the degree of perceptual priming is associated with dissociation and whether both perceptual priming and intrusive memories can be reduced through elaboration. Two experiments measured perceptual priming for neutral stimuli that immediately preceded a \"traumatic\" event. Volunteers (N=46, 92) watched a series of \"traumatic\" and neutral picture stories, and completed a blurred object identification (perceptual priming) memory task, and a recognition memory task. Participants in Experiment 1 were selected to score either high or low on the Trait Dissociation Questionnaire [Murray, Ehlers, & Mayou (2002). Dissociation and posttraumatic stress disorder: Two prospective studies of motor vehicle accident survivors. British Journal of Psychiatry, 180, 363-368]. They also completed a state dissociation measure in the session. Experiment 2 randomly allocated participants to an experimental condition designed to increase elaboration or to a control condition. This experiment also included a measure of intrusive memories. Both experiments found enhanced perceptual priming for the stimuli that immediately preceded the \"traumatic\" stories compared to those preceding neutral stories. Participants with high trait dissociation showed relatively stronger perceptual perceptual priming. The degree of perceptual priming for stimuli from the \"traumatic\" stories also correlated with state dissociation (Experiment 1). Experimental manipulation of the elaboration of the stories showed that elaboration reduced the enhanced perceptual priming effect and the relative probability of reexperiencing symptoms (Experiment 2). The results support the role of perceptual priming in intrusions after traumatic events."}, {"Title": "The case against evidence-based principles in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is an organized movement by governmental, academic and commercial interests to make evidence-based practice the standard of care in the United States. There is little proof that this model can be adapted to psychiatry. We examine the diagnostic system, the validity of the data from clinical trials and how these are applied to clinical practice. The discipline of psychiatry relies on imprecise and unstable diagnostic criteria. It divides psychiatric disorders into discrete categories based on discussion and consultations among designated experts in the field. The diagnostic system is based on consensus and not experimental evidence. In fact, psychiatric disorders are not discrete. High co-morbidities between disorders and the propensity of one condition to change into another makes the present diagnostic system extremely questionable. Outcomes of clinical trials are defined by fractional reductions in the number and severity of symptoms measured by rating scales and not remission of illness. The data obtained from clinical trials are flawed in design, execution and the selective reporting of outcomes. There is substantial evidence to indicate that both investigators and patients can distinguish between active treatment and placebo in double blind studies. In addition, negative outcomes are frequently not reported. Such evidence impacts not only on the specific study, used as evidence, but invalidates the value of meta analyses. Financial considerations lead to the inclusion of inappropriate subjects into studies and favor newer, patented treatments. When the conclusions derived from evidence-based psychiatry are applied to clinical practice they have little to offer and often produce poor treatment outcomes. In fact, when the data used to support the principles of evidence-based psychiatry are examined, they are unsound. The system itself is best considered an untested hypothesis. The diagnostic system, the manner in which data are gathered, and financial factors combine to produce a system that is misleading and indeed, dangerous."}, {"Title": "Factorial validation of a French short-form of the Working Alliance Inventory.", "Abstract": "Evaluation of the therapeutic alliance is crucial for understanding the therapeutic process and its results.

Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on a sample of 150 client-case manager dyads in order to determine the validity of this short-form instrument. The results of these confirmatory factor analyses allowed us to answer different authors' questions (Horvath and Greenberg, 1989; Tracey and Kokotovic, 1989) regarding the factorial structure of the WAI. The results also indicated a unidimensional solution as being the most valid for the two samples. We suggest that, in future studies, only one score be considered for the evaluation of the WAI.

However, the mathematical complexity and model specificity of these solutions make them generally inaccessible to most applied researchers who actually design and undertake treatment evaluation research in psychiatry. In contrast, this article relies on a simple two-stage analysis in which dropout-weighted slope coefficients fitted to the available repeated measurements for each subject separately serve as the dependent variable for a familiar ANCOVA test of significance for differences in mean rates of change. This article is about how a sample of size that is estimated or calculated to provide desired power for testing that hypothesis without considering dropouts can be adjusted appropriately to take dropouts into account. Empirical results support the conclusion that, whatever reasonable level of power would be provided by a given sample size in the absence of dropouts, essentially the same power can be realized in the presence of dropouts simply by adding to the original dropout-free sample size the number of subjects who would be expected to drop from a sample of that original size under conditions of the proposed study."}, {"Title": "Innovations: geriatric psychiatry: diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "The authors review research on the treatment of behavioral disturbances and psychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia, including pharmacological treatment with antipsychotics, antidepressants, cholinesterase inhibitors, and other psychotropic drugs.

Responses to the questionnaire to items concerning the skills and diagnostic categories taught, assessment of adequacy of teaching and desires for curriculum enhancement for specific skills and diagnostic categories were analyzed. The factors affecting training directors' satisfaction were explored.\nInterviewing skills were taught by a majority of all training programs and were considered adequate by 81% of FP and 54% of IM programs, in contrast to less than a majority of Ob/Gyn and Peds programs (P<.001). A majority provided diagnostic interviewing and counseling training, but only FP considered it adequate. A majority taught psychopharmacology and various psychiatric diagnoses, but only in FP did a majority consider them adequate. Both Peds and FP programs teach child psychiatry; significantly, more Peds compared to FP consider their training to be adequate. A vast majority of IM, Ob/Gyn and Peds programs, and 50% of FP programs desired more training in interviewing techniques and diagnostic interview. A majority of all programs desired more counseling and psychopharmacology training and more training in disorders of childhood and adolescence. The overall satisfaction rate for psychiatric training across specialties was 46% (n=657). Sixty-four percent of FP programs were satisfied compared to 31% of non-FP programs. Satisfaction was associated with increased amount of psychiatric training, diversity of training formats, venues, faculty and settings, the amount of contribution to teaching by psychiatry departments and the presence of current teaching in interviewing skills. There were specialty-specific differences in factors associated with satisfaction. In general, a smaller size of residency program was associated with satisfaction except in IM, where larger size was associated with satisfaction. Satisfaction was associated with the opinion that primary care physician should be ready and willing to treat more psychiatric conditions.\nMost primary care training programs currently offer training in most psychiatric skills and disorders, but a majority of training directors are dissatisfied with their psychiatry training. There is a difference in the estimation of adequacy concerning training between FP, which consistently rates their teaching to be adequate, and all other primary care programs, which consider their teaching inadequate. This difference may be partly due to actual differences in amount and diversity of training as well as differences in the threshold for satisfaction. A vast majority of primary care training programs desire more training in almost all aspects of psychiatry, and there may be specialty-specific needs and areas of curriculum enhancement. To enhance satisfaction, we should improve the quality as well as the quantity of training, as well as the diversity in training formats, venues and faculty."}, {"Title": "Mental health and psychiatry training in primary care residency programs.

Interviewer: A senior clinical and mood disorder research psychiatrist.\nA consecutive sample of 138 BP-II and 71 MDD remitted outpatients. Assessment instruments: The structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version (SCID-CV), the SCID-II Personality Questionnaire for self-assessing borderline personality traits (BPT) by patients, the TEMPS-A for self-assessing CT by patients. Interview methods: Patients were interviewed with the SCID-CV to diagnose BP-II and MDD, and then patients self-assessed the questions of the Personality Questionnaire relative to borderline personality, and the questions of the TEMPS-A relative to CT. As clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning is not assessed by the SCID-II Personality Questionnaire, a diagnosis of BPD could not be made, but BPT could be assessed (i.e. all BPD items but not the impairment criterion). The distribution of the number of CT and BPT items was studied by Kernel density estimate.\nCT and BPT items were significantly more common in BP-II versus MDD. The Kernel density estimate distributions of the number of CT and BPT items in the entire sample had a normal-like shape (i.e. no bi-modality).\nThe expected finding, on the basis of previous studies and of the present sample features, was a clustering of CT and BPT items on the BP-II side of the curves. Instead, no bi-modality was present in the distributions of the number of CT and BPT items in the entire sample, showing a normal-like shape.

DSH patients, especially those with lacerations to wrist and forearm, are a regular source of admission to plastic surgery units. In Northern Ireland, the regional plastic surgery service is provided at the Ulster Hospital, which does not have an on-site psychiatric department. Consequently, it was often difficult to arrange a psychiatrist assessment for these patients on the ward even when the assessment was required urgently. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a protocol that would ensure that these patients were assessed and followed up for their mental health as recommended by the DoH. In the absence of clear guidelines from the DoH and utilising the existing arrangement between Accident and Emergency (A&E) and the psychiatric services, all referring A&E departments were instructed at the time of referring patients with DSH to wrist and forearm to arrange a psychiatric examination before transferring the patient to the plastic surgery unit.

In the ensuing years, the view of culture within anthropology has continued to change, along with our understanding of the relationship of biological processes to cultural diversity, and the global political economic contexts in which mental health care is delivered. This article considers the implications of these new notions of culture, biology and the context of practice for theory in cultural psychiatry. The future of cultural psychiatry lies in advancing a broad perspective that: (a) is inherently multidisciplinary (involving psychiatric epidemiology, medical anthropology and sociology, cognitive science and social psychology), breaking down the nature/culture dichotomy with an integrative view of culture as a core feature of human biology, while remaining alert to cultural constructions of biological theory; (b) attends to psychological processes but understands these as not exclusively located within the individual but as including discursive processes that are fundamentally social; and (c) critically examines the interaction of both local and global systems of knowledge and power. Globalization has brought with it many ironies for cultural psychiatry: Transnational migrations have resulted in cultural hybridization at the same time as ethnicity has become more salient; the call for evidence-based medicine has been used to limit the impact of cultural research; and cultural psychiatry itself has been co-opted by pharmaceutical companies to inform marketing campaigns to promote conventional treatments for new populations.

The authors sought to determine how this dilemma is currently being played out in residency training programs, in which training directors must decide how best to integrate neuroscience teaching in a rapidly changing clinical landscape.\nThe authors surveyed U.S. and Canadian psychiatry residency training directors to characterize current and future trends in neuroscience education and to examine training directors' views on the relevance of neuroscience to clinical practice.\nThe amount of neuroscience in residency curricula has increased significantly over the past 5 years, and further increases are expected in each specific neuroscience content area examined. While most training directors agreed that training in neuroscience was important for all residents, even those becoming primarily psychotherapists, relevance to future (but not current) practice was consistently cited as a motivating factor.\nWhile psychiatric residency programs continue to increase the neuroscience content of their curricula, it remains unclear how this added training will influence clinical work. Reframing current practices, including psychotherapy, into a neuroscientific context may ultimately prove more useful to trainees."}, {"Title": "The persistence of mind-brain dualism in psychiatric reasoning about clinical scenarios.", "Abstract": "Despite attempts in psychiatry to adopt an integrative biopsychosocial model, social scientists have observed that psychiatrists continue to operate according to a mind-brain dichotomy in ways that are often covert and unacknowledged and suggest that the same intuitive cognitive schemas that people use to make judgments of responsibility lead to dualistic reasoning among clinicians. The goal of this study was to confirm these observations.\nSelf-report questionnaires were sent to the 270 psychiatrists and psychologists in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University. In response to clinical vignettes, the participants rated the level of intentionality, controllability, responsibility, and blame attributable to the patients, as well as the importance of neurobiological, psychological, and social factors in explaining the patients' symptoms.\nA total of 136 faculty members (50.4%) responded, and 127 were included in the analysis. Factor analysis revealed a single dimension of responsibility regarding the patients' illnesses that correlated positively with ratings of psychological etiology and negatively with ratings of neurobiological etiology. Psychological and neurobiological ratings were inversely correlated. Multivariate analyses of variance supported these results.\nMental health professionals continue to employ a mind-brain dichotomy when reasoning about clinical cases. The more a behavioral problem is seen as originating in \"psychological\" processes, the more a patient tends to be viewed as responsible and blameworthy for his or her symptoms; conversely, the more behaviors are attributed to neurobiological causes, the less likely patients are to be viewed as responsible and blameworthy."}, {"Title": "Ethical philanthropy in academic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "From an ethical perspective, psychiatrists cannot accept gifts of significant monetary value from their patients.

The second aim is to outline a series of steps that may be undertaken to assure ethical philanthropic practices within an institution, including the establishment of a committed advisory workgroup and the creation of ground rules and safeguards for gift-giving. Each situation should be evaluated for \"ethical risk,\" and specific measures to safeguard donors should be considered.\nThe author outlines methods to manage, minimize, or eliminate conflict of interest issues, including identification and disclosure of conflicting interests, role separation, goal clarification, confidentiality protections, proper timing, and ongoing oversight. Three case illustrations are provided and discussed.\nThe process of institutional engagement, dialogue, and shared problem-solving is especially important. A shared, constructive ethic will be attained only if leaders and diverse stakeholders communicate the value of the new approach through their words, expectations, and actions.\nThrough these efforts, greater attention will be given to the concerns of people with mental illness, and academic institutions may be better able to fulfill their responsibilities to this important but neglected population now and in the future."}, {"Title": "Cerebral emboli as a potential cause of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: case-control study.", "Abstract": "To compare the occurrence of spontaneous cerebral emboli and venous to arterial circulation shunts in patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia and controls without dementia.\nCross sectional case-control study.\nSecondary care old age psychiatry services, Manchester.\n170 patients with dementia (85 with Alzheimer's disease, 85 with vascular dementia) and 150 age and sex matched controls.

Predictors need to be evaluated under clinically realistic circumstances. This study aimed to validate dynamic and static variables as predictors of reconviction in a naturalistic outcome study. Data on static and dynamic risk factors were collected for 151 patients discharged from Dutch forensic psychiatric hospitals. Community follow-up was prospective, with a 5.5 year minimum. A prediction model was developed using Cox regression analysis. The magnitude of the predictive power of this model was estimated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The final prediction model contained four static and no dynamic predictors. The model's ROC area under the curve was .79 (95% CI .69-.89). Clinical risk ratings were non-predictive.

We will identify two of these sources--the plea for individual autonomy and the idea of Managed Care--and explain how they have promoted a strict biomedical conception of disease. The demand for objectivity, however, does not take into account the complexity of mental illness. It ignores that the psychiatrist's profession is essentially characterized by fragility: fluctuating between scientific reduction and the irreducible complexity of reality. Therefore, the psychiatrist is not in need of hard and fast rules, but of judgment. At the end, we suggest that philosophy could inject some healthy uncertainty within psychiatry in order to restore its fragile identity.

The present work makes reference to the moment in history since when Psychoanalysis departs from traditional psychiatry and progressively conquers an autonomy that dwells upon such procedure. The transmission in words, be it oral o written, of what went on during the sessions shares many common grounds with Literature.

An anonymous descriptive survey was distributed to the 11 nurses who were currently responsible clinicians as well as five senior nurses selected from each of the 21 District Health Boards and the Auckland Regional Forensic Psychiatry Services (n = 121). The response rate was 88.4% (n = 107). The survey questioned respondents on statutory roles currently undertaken. Respondents were asked whether the responsible clinician role was a legitimate one for nurses and whether they were motivated to attain it. They were also asked which competencies of the role they believed they met, their perceptions of credentialing processes and the educational requirements needed to achieve the role. A descriptive statistical analysis was undertaken and open-ended questions were analysed using content analysis. Of the approximately 395 responsible clinicians nationally, 11 (2.8%) are nurses. Most nurses viewed the role as legitimate. However, many were unaware of competencies for the role and credentialing processes, and were somewhat ambivalent about achieving the role due to current workload, role conflict and lack of remuneration. Competency deficits were highlighted. There are grounds to encourage nurses as responsible clinicians given the intent of the legislation.

This paper critiques the language nurses use in acute inpatient psychiatry services, highlighting the diverse discourses implicated in nurses' writing and speaking about patients. Based on a review of the literature, this paper examines ethnographic studies and discourse analyses of psychiatric nurses' oral and written language. A prominent debate in the literature surrounds nurses' use of standardized language, which is the use of set terms for symptoms and nursing activities. This review of spoken descriptions of patients highlights nurses' use of informal and local descriptions, incorporating elements of moral judgement, common sense language and empathy. Research into written accounts in patient files and records show nurses' use of objectifying language, the dominance of medicine and the emergence of the language of bureaucracy in health services. Challenges to the language of psychiatry and psychiatric nursing arise from fields as diverse as bioscience, humanism and social theory. Authors who focus on the relationship between language, power and the discipline of nursing disagree in regard to their analysis of particular language as a constructive exercise of power by nurses. Thus, particular language is in some instances endorsed and in other instances censured, by nurses in research and practice. In this paper, a Foucauldian analysis provides further critique of taken-for-granted practices of speech and writing. Rather than censoring language, we recommend that nurses, researchers and educators attend to nurses' everyday language and explore what it produces for nurses, patients and society."}, {"Title": "History of experimental psychology from an Estonian perspective.", "Abstract": "A short review of the development of experimental psychology from an Estonian perspective is presented. The first rector after the reopening of the University of Dorpat (Tartu) in 1802, Georg Friedrich Parrot (1767-1852) was interested in optical phenomena which he attempted to explain by introducing the concept of unconscious inferences, anticipating a similar theory proposed by Herman von Helmholtz 20 years later. One of the next rectors, Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann (1800-1878) was regarded by Edwin Boring as one of the founding fathers of the experimental psychology. Georg Wilhelm Struve (1793-1864) played an essential part in solving the problem of personal equations. Arthur Joachim von Oettingen (1836-1920) developed a theory of music harmony, which stimulated his student Wilhelm Friedrich Ostwald (1853-1932) to study colour harmony. Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), the founder of modern psychiatry, is by far the most important experimental psychologist who has worked in Estonia. His successor Wladimir von Tchisch (1855-1922), another student of Wilhelm Wundt, continued Kraepelin's work in experimental psychology. The lives of Wolfgang K\u00f6hler (1887-1967), who was born in Reval (Tallinn), and Oswald K\u00fclpe (1862-1915), who graduated from the University of Dorpat, extended the link between the history of experimental psychology and Estonia.

The electrical stimulation of the former induces the augmenting response in the cerebral cortex and the same of the latter induces the recruiting response in the cortex. The non-specific projection system is also known as the diffuse thalamo- cortical projection system and it is concerned with the maintenance mechanism of consciousness such as sleep and wakefulness. The thalamus is concerned in the higher nervous functions such as language, cognition, memory and intelligence. Severe nerve cell loss with proliferation of hypertrophic astroglia was found in the association nuclei and sensory relay nuclei in the thalami of patients suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In the brain imaging study, volume reduction of the thalamus, especially of dorsomedial nuclei, degradation of glucose metabolism were observed in the thalami of patients with schizophrenia.

Apart from sedative administration, total movement reduction, bad life style and daily routine and increased body weight, there is negative impact of dehydration, prolonged hospitalization and sometimes immobilisation in consequence of mechanical restraints. A large amount of patients are treated with antipsychotics that have a series of adverse effects. Depending of the drug used, the most frequent of them are somnolence, fatigue, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypotension, hepatotoxicity, increased body weight, prolongation of the QT interval of the ECG with a risk of ventricular arrhythmias, hematopoietic disorders, lipid or glycide metabolism disorders or hyperprolactinemia. Another potential adverse effect of these drugs is the heightened risk of venous thromboembolism development (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism). There is the risk of a pathological blood clotting event in psychiatric patients, especially those treated with antipsychotics. Although it is not high, it can have fatal consequences when combined with a relatively frequent pulmonary embolism and difficult diagnostics of thromboembolism. An algorithm for thromboembolism prevention has been developed. It involves important general risk factors of venous thrombosis (VTE history, immobilisation, malignancy, age over 75 years etc.) and also markers (physical restraints, dehydration, obesity, antipsychotics use) that can participate in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis in the hospitalized psychiatric patients with limited motility. The authors believe that this prophylaxis is indicated, safe, effective and that it improves the quality of life at relatively low costs."}, {"Title": "Communication skills in psychiatry residents-- how do they handle patient concerns?

Lag1 sequential analysis and a multinomial logit regression analysis were performed to investigate the relationship between patients' expressions of concern and psychiatrists' subsequent interventions in terms of patient-centered skills.\nCompared to doctor-centered interventions, all patients' expressions of concern increased the probability of passive listening (odds ratios between 2.4 and 4.2). They also increased the occurrence of emotion focusing interventions (odds ratios between 3.3 and 1.7), which however remained rare (4% of residents' total responses). A small although significant increase in the likelihood of active listening expressions was observed as a response to two types of patient expressions of concern: statements of feelings (odds ratio 1.4) and expression of opinions regarding problematic psychosocial issues (odds ratio of 1.7).\nYoung psychiatrists are good passive listeners but need to improve active listening skills which, together with emotion focusing skills, should be a major learning target in psychiatry.

It is however a frequent disorder, with often severe alteration of social adaptation and quality of life, and for which effective treatments exist. Thus, it seems really important to further explore how these patients are nowadays identified and treated in psychiatry. It was the objective of the Phoenix study. In this observational multi-center study, 952 psychiatric in- or out-patients, with a primary diagnosis of social phobia according to DSM IV criteria, were included. Numerous diagnostic and psychometric evaluations were carried out, in order to evaluate the comorbidity (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), the intensity of social anxiety (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale), and various aspects of the functional and emotional impact (Various Impact of Social Anxiety scale, Sheehan Disability Scale, SF-36, Positive and Negative Emotionality scale). The patients were in majority females (57.6%), with a mean age 37.5 years, and with a mean duration of social anxiety disorder 12.5 years. The mean scores of social anxiety on Liebowitz scale was 40.3 +/- 12.6 for the fear factor, and 38.3 +/- 13.6 for the avoidance factor. The generalized social anxiety subtype (anxiety in most social situations) was present in 67.8% of the patients. A major depressive disorder was found in 47.7% of the sample, and the prevalence of agoraphobia was even higher (49.2%). As known in clinical practice and in other studies, the prevalence rates of current alcohol dependence and substances abuse were also important in this population (respectively 10.6% and 12.7%). Mean scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) sub-scales were 13.9 +/-3.8 for anxiety and 9.1 +/-4.5 for depression. About 15% of the patients had a history of suicide attempt, and a suicidal risk was present in nearly 40% of the sample. The psychosocial impact and the alteration of quality of life (with especially a poor physical health perception) were very significant, in the family, educational or occupational and social domains. Mean scores of the Sheehan Disability Scale were 6.1 +/- 2.6 for professional impairment, 5.0 +/- 2.7 for familial impairment, and 6.6 +/- 2.3 for social life impairment. In addition to the disability due to social phobia intensity, an important part of the burden was due to depressive symptoms. Approximately 60% of the patients had already a psychiatric treatment at the time of the survey (since 1,7 years in average), but only 17% had a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and 48% had an antidepressant treatment. These proportions increased in a significant way after the consultation during which the investigation was carried out: an antidepressant was prescribed to 72% of the patients, and a CBT is proposed to 48%. On the whole, this study confirmed the severity and the morbidity of social phobia in a very large sample of French psychiatric patients. The depressive disorders, suicidal risk, and social impairment associated with this condition should incite to more detect and treat it.

Minimal differences were apparent when comparing these results with those obtained from an analysis including only African American participants (n = 99). Restricting the analysis to only 12 items resulted in two factors (with poor discriminant validity and internal consistency), which showed few similarities with previously reported exploratory factor analysis results.\nThis study shows that results of empirically-derived factors of the NES vary substantially across study samples and research groups, though there appear to be at least two consistent latent variables, one related to the repetition of motor tasks and another tapping the processing of sensory stimuli. The factors demonstrated in the present study are more consistent with the original conceptually-derived subscales than prior factor analyses. Thus, until further research replicates consistent subscales of subtle neurological impairment in a variety of settings and samples, the total NES score may be more useful when comparing results across studies.

We have to insist upon changes to our training such that trainees are encouraged to get to know their patients and understand them from a biopsychosocial perspective.

It was hypothesized that HIV-positive individuals with MHD would have poorer treatment outcomes, reduced responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and increased mortality compared with those without MHD.\nThis is a retrospective cohort of 2981 individuals (73% of the Victorian population diagnosed with HIV infection) captured on an HIV database which was electronically matched with the public Victorian Psychiatric Case Register (VPCR) (accounting for 95% of public system psychiatry service provision). The prevalence, dates and recorded specifics of mental health disorders at the time of the electronic match on 1 June 2000 are described. The association with recorded MHD, gender, age, AIDS illness, HIV exposure category, duration and type of antiviral therapy, treatment era (prior to 1986, post-1987 and pre-HAART, and post-HAART) on hospitalization and mortality at 1 September 2001 was assessed.\nFive hundred and twenty-five individuals (17.6% of the Victorian HIV-positive population) were recorded with MHD, most frequently coded as attributable to substance dependence/abuse or affective disorder. MHD was diagnosed prior to HIV in 33% and, of those diagnosed after HIV, 93.8% were recorded more than 1 year after the HIV diagnosis. Schizophrenia was recorded in 6% of the population with MHD. Hospitalizations for both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric illness were more frequent in those with MHD (relative risk 5.4; 95% confidence interval 3.7, 8.2). The total number of antiretrovirals used (median 6.4 agents vs 5.5 agents) was greater in those with MHD.

The survey assessed factors that influenced practice location and outreach consultation, such as demographics, links to practice communities, and outreach experiences, including rural or northern electives as a resident.\nProfessional variables were rated as the most important factors in choosing a practice location. Variables such as age or sex were not significantly associated with location. Nine percent reported working in communities of less than 100,000, and only 1% practised in Northern Ontario. Eighteen percent practised in the same location where they were born or raised. Forty-four percent had rural or northern experience as a resident but almost exclusively in the form of short, fly-in consultation electives. Twenty-four percent indicated that they provide outreach consultation. Psychiatry residents who participated in outreach electives were 10 times as likely as those who did not participate to continue outreach as a consultant.\nAlthough early exposure to rural or northern medicine leads to significantly greater continued involvement in outreach activities after graduation, our findings suggest the need for more long-term, on-site residency training opportunities in rural and remote areas."}, {"Title": "[Conduct disorder in childhood].", "Abstract": "Conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or societal rules are violated.

Existing time budget measures of activity are demanding to complete, and thus unsuited to routine clinical use as measures of change. Less burdensome 'check-box' measures are prone to bias and omission in the activities selected. We recently devised a simplified time budget measure of activity in psychosis which was piloted on a small sample [Jolly, S., Garety, P., Dunn, G., White, J., Aitken, M., Challocombe, F., Griggs, M., Wallace, M., Craig, T. 2005. A pilot validation study of a new measure of activity in psychosis. Soc. Psychiatry Psychiatr. Epidemiol. 40, 905-911]. This study is a larger scale validation. 276 participants with a recent relapse of non-affective psychosis completed the new time budget, together with an established measure of global social functioning, measures of positive and negative psychotic symptoms, positive symptom distress and affect. The time budget measure showed a correlation of 0.5 with both the SOFAS and the SANS avolition/apathy subscale. Activity levels were related to psychotic symptomatology, both positive and negative. Positive symptom distress was more strongly associated with activity levels than symptom severity and affective disturbance. We conclude that the time budget measure can be used as an indicator of social functioning, with potential as a measure of therapeutic change. We are currently investigating its sensitivity in this context."}, {"Title": "March 27, 1827 and what happened later--the impact of psychiatry on evolutionary theory.", "Abstract": "In the interaction between Psychiatry and evolutionary theory the force of the impact has not always been in one direction. The Brownes, father and son, had an influence on the development of Darwin's theory at different points in the nineteenth century. The crystallization by Miskolczy in 1933 of the concept that schizophrenia is a disorder that is specific to Homo sapiens is another example. In 1964 the formulation of the central paradox of psychosis by Huxley, Mayr and co-authors and the subsequent critique by Kuttner et al. of the solution Huxley et al. had offered opened up evolutionary approaches to aetiology. Here it is argued that a resolution of this paradox requires identification of the speciation event for modern H. sapiens and elucidation of its neuroanatomical and physiological consequences. It necessitates a saltational account of species transitions and the recognition of species-specific genetic variation. Pursuit of these objectives leads to the hypothesis that speciation events occur selectively on the heterogametic chromosome (the Y in mammals) and are followed by a phase of sexual selection to establish a new specific mate recognition system. In H. sapiens the core component of this system is the capacity for language; the nuclear symptoms of schizophrenia are necessary clues to its neural structure."}, {"Title": "Three dimensions of clinical symptoms in elderly patients with schizophrenia: prediction of six-year cognitive and functional status.", "Abstract": "A three-syndrome categorization of schizophrenia has been recently proposed [Arndt, S., Alliger R.J., Andreasen, N.C., 1991.

The limitations in our understanding of the molecular causes of these two illnesses and our lack of a clear mechanism of action for many of the medicines used to treat them continue to confound the field and impede progress towards finding novel treatments.

Functional neuroimaging methods may be sensitive to these early physiologic changes and may be useful in early detection, therapeutic monitoring, and prediction of treatment response and other clinical outcomes. This review will focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging and its use in measuring the effects of cholinergic modulation in mild cognitive impairment.\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging has begun to be applied to measure changes in regional brain activation during cognitive task performance after pharmacologic manipulation. In mild cognitive impairment, recent reports have appeared demonstrating alterations in neocortical activation after acute and prolonged administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These functional changes may relate to both behavioral performance and measures of brain structure (e.g., hippocampal volume).\nPharmacologic functional magnetic resonance imaging is a rapidly emerging field, with applications in both basic human neuroscience and clinical psychiatry and neurology.

This review summarizes recent work from sociology, health psychology and psychiatry that contributes to an understanding of the processes that may underlie abnormal illness behaviour.\nDisturbances in the regulation of physiological systems may account for many 'unexplained' symptoms and sickness behaviour. Increased attention to bodily sensations, sensitivity to pain and catastrophizing play important roles in illness behaviour in medical illness. Developmental adversities and parental modelling of illness behaviour in childhood may increase bodily preoccupation and health care utilization. Apparent cross-national differences in illness behaviour may reflect differences in health care systems, but cultural models of illness and social stigma remain important determinants of illness denial and avoidance of mental health services.\nResearch into illness behaviour is relevant to efforts to rethink the psychiatric nosology of somatoform disorders. The discrete somatoform disorders might well be replaced by a dimensional framework that identifies specific pathological processes in cognition, perception and social behaviour that contribute to bodily distress, impaired coping, inappropriate use of health services, chronicity and disability."}, {"Title": "[The effects of the 12th and 14th amendments to the AMG (Medical Preparations Act) on paediatric pharmaceutical research--a survey of the new regulations].", "Abstract": "The 12th amendment to the German Medical Preparations Act (Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG) implements EU-Directive 2001/20EC in national law and introduces changes with regard to academic research in child and adolescent psychiatry.

Concurrently, changes in medical student education are elevating demands for teaching. Academic psychiatry is challenged by these pressures to find innovative ways to recruit, retain, and reward faculty for teaching efforts. To address this challenge, the authors recommend a multifactorial approach to meeting the medical student educational mission of psychiatry departments.\nThis approach includes a variety of efforts including having Chairs serve as role models, enforcing the service requirements of volunteer faculty, expanding teaching venues, providing faculty development, elevating the status of teaching through academies, attending to promotion of faculty educators, establishing and nominating faculty for teaching awards, and using medical center resources to provide rewards for teachers.\nAcademic leaders must acknowledge the inherent value of teaching to the academic enterprise and delegate sufficient resources to recruit, retain, and reward educators for the essential work that they perform."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Medicine: five years of experience with an innovative required fourth-year medical school course.", "Abstract": "The author reports on a required fourth-year course, Psychiatry in Medicine, which was started in 1999 at Stony Brook Medical School.

The authors attempt to identify which clerkships, if any, offer an advantage when taken before psychiatry.\nMean aggregate exam scores over 4 years were calculated according to clerkship sequence. An analysis of variance was conducted to assess the effect of sequence on test scores. Pairwise comparisons (t tests) were performed to determine whether students who completed one particular clerkship before psychiatry scored higher on the subject examination than students who completed the clerkship after psychiatry.\nStudents who take psychiatry near the end of the clerkship sequence score higher than students who take psychiatry as a first clerkship. The differences are small but significant. The mean score for students taking psychiatry first was 72.81, compared to a score of 78.51 for students taking the clerkship last. No single clerkship is more likely than another to increase test scores when taken before psychiatry.\nClerkship directors must be aware of the timing bias in subject exam scores.

The authors' faculty was troubled by the inability to provide meaningful evaluations, as more than 60% of students received the highest grade. Although a psychiatry clerkship mandate of a faculty-observed student clinical interview existed for several years, the majority of students reported not completing the interview under direct observation by a faculty member, and no meaningful feedback or evaluation for this activity existed. In order to create diversity in grading criteria and to examine clinical skills more thoroughly than previously, written and oral examinations were developed and supervised interviews of patients and written comprehensive psychiatric evaluations were added. A core group of department faculty was instructed in the use of materials and instruments designed to standardize the experiences and the student evaluations.\nAdding a wider diversity of experiences and evaluations to the clerkship, particularly assessment of interviewing skills, oral exams, and evaluation of comprehensive histories, has resulted in a more divergent spread of grades.\nClerkship grades can be effectively computed using various methods to examine knowledge and clinical skills. The addition of new methods of evaluation has added specificity to the performance feedback provided to the students completing the psychiatric clerkship. These changes have been viewed positively by department faculty and medical students. While requiring further refinement, they may eventually provide data to identify students requiring special attention in specific cognitive, relational, and clinical skill areas."}, {"Title": "Clinical grading in psychiatric clerkships.", "Abstract": "The clinical grade assessment is the most frequently used and heavily weighted component in the overall assessment of U.S. psychiatry clerkship students, yet the topic is understudied.

The design of the document, its strengths, its weaknesses, grading outcomes, and utilization were assessed.\nTrends regarding clinical grading in psychiatry clerkships were detected. The clerkship grade form similarities, differences, desirable features, and utilization were ascertained, as were areas for improvement.\nThe search for an optimal clinical grading process for the thousands of third-year medical students rotating annually is formidable.

Only few studies, however, have focused on the non-motor effects of DBS.\nA consecutive series of 15 patients was assessed three months before (M-3), then three months (M3) and six months (M6) after surgery. Mean (+/- SD) age at surgery was 59.7 (7.6). Mean disease duration at surgery was 12.2 (2.8) years. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory was used to assess psychiatric disorders three months before surgery. Depression was evaluated using Montgomery and Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS). Anxiety was evaluated using the AMDP system (Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry). Apathy was particularly evaluated using the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and the Starkstein Scale. All these scales were performed at every evaluation.\nApathy worsened at M3 and M6 after STN-DBS in comparison with the preoperative evaluation: the AES mean score was significantly impaired between the preoperative (38.4+/-7.1) and both the postoperative M3 (44.6+/-9.5, p = 0.003) and M6 scores (46.0+/-10.9, p = 0.013).

Researchers and clinicians have now demonstrated that a wide assortment of genetic variants influence how individuals respond to medications. Many of these variants are relevant for psychiatry, affecting how patients respond to most antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers. Enthusiasts hope that pharmacogenetics will soon usher in a new era of individualized medicine. However, determining the practical relevance of pharmacogenetic variants remains difficult, in part because of problems with study design and replication, and in part because a host of nongenetic factors (including age, diet, environmental exposures, and comorbid diseases) also influence how individuals respond to medications. Since individualized pharmacogenetic assessment remains difficult, some researchers have argued that race provides a convenient proxy for individual genetic variation, and that clinicians should choose medications and doses differently for different races. This approach remains extremely controversial because of the complexity of the genetic structure of the human population, the complexity of gene-environment interactions, and the complexity of the meanings of race in the United States."}, {"Title": "The extent and impact of mental health problems after disaster.", "Abstract": "Disasters are events that challenge the individual's ability to adapt, which carries the risk of adverse mental health outcomes including serious posttraumatic psychopathologies. While risk is related to degree of exposure to psychological toxins, the unique vulnerabilities of special populations within the affected community as well as secondary stressors play an important role in determining the nature and amount of morbidity. Disasters in developing countries and those associated with substantial community destruction are associated with worse outcome. Although acute responses are ubiquitous, few disasters lead to posttraumatic psychopathology in the majority of people exposed. However, the shortage of human resources in psychiatry, particularly in developing countries, places a considerable burden on psychiatric services even without the additional constraints imposed by disaster. Hence, disasters are events that invite a public health approach to mental health that better serves the needs of the individual and the affected community. Such an approach considers all available human resources and is intended to mitigate the effects of disaster before serious psychopathologic sequelae arise. This community mental health strategy allows peripheral mental health workers to mediate between survivors and specialized mental health professionals while assisting in removing barriers to treatment. To be effective when disaster occurs, this approach requires careful planning in conjunction with community consultation before implementation of formal disaster mitigation policies."}, {"Title": "[Brain, mind and symptoms].", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatry, which is the point where neurology and psychiatry meet, together with other neighbouring disciplines (psychology, anthropology, neurochemistry, neurophysiology, and so forth), are committed to unravelling both the psychopathological definition and the anatomical-physiological foundations of mental symptoms (signs).\nThis work attempts to review several moments in the history of the localisation of neurology and the difficulties involved in accomplishing a systematisation of mental symptoms.\nFurther knowledge of this delicate matter--the mind, or more specifically, the sick brain-mind complex--can only be gained by cooperation in a number of different areas (clinical, psychological, philosophical, biochemical, imaging, and so forth)."}, {"Title": "[The Leipzig Magistrates Court's death sentences in the Woyzeck case].", "Abstract": "The trial of Johann Christian Woyzeck for murder is among the most significant for forensic psychiatry in the 19 (th) century. The case gained worldwide fame, not only because of Georg B\u00fcchner's eponymous drama. A thorough analysis and reconstruction of the proceedings would allow more light to be shed on one of the major events in the evolution of modern psychiatric positions regarding criminal responsibility. To support this effort, this paper presents two original sources that have just been rediscovered in the archives, and which are of major importance in respect of both the Woyzeck case and the history of forensic psychiatry. Until now only transcripts had been available. The two documents in question relate to the death sentences issued by the Leipzig magistrates court (Sch\u00f6ppenstuhl). They clearly show the ruling feudal and municipal authorities' efforts to exploit both the general rules of procedure as well as the forensic testimony given by Leipzig's medical officer and professor, Johann Christian August Clarus, for their own restorative political interests. This is revealed by the fact, among others, that the legal procedures are interpreted in the narrowest possible way and the crux of the problem, namely the culprit's criminal responsibility, is not really the focus of attention. The defence does not really have a chance, the more so since it makes pleas that are both contradictory and amateurist from a psychiatric point of view.

At that time, some more or less discriminating expressions with origins in the medieval or early modern German, some words derived from the Latin language of scientists, and some new terms used in contemporary theories on the explanation of psychic disorder, constituted \"eine verwirrende Vielfalt der Gattungsnamen f\u00fcr psychische Krankheit\" (a confusing multiplicity of names for mental illness) - (F. Nasse 1818). To make an end to this multiplicity, in the last decade of the 18th century some experts proposed to use terms derived from the word \"irre\" as standard expressions for illness, symptoms and patients in psychiatry as well as for the new elements of the emerging psychiatric health sector. The word \"irre\" with the meaning \"geistig gest\u00f6rt\" (mentally disordered) was part of the German vocabulary since the end of the Middle Ages. According to its advocates, it seemed to be suitable as new standard term, because it was not linked to discriminating prejudices with respect to its origin and to the understanding of that time. Therefore it met the contemporary demand for a more humanitarian behaviour towards ill people. But it took 20 years of discussion and clarification until this nomenclature was accepted in the new subject psychiatry and rested well established for nearly the next 100 years."}, {"Title": "A case control study: White-collar defendants compared with defendants charged with other nonviolent theft.", "Abstract": "We examined the clinical, criminal, and sociodemographic characteristics of all white-collar crime defendants referred to the evaluation unit of a state center for forensic psychiatry.

Other researchers have emphasized the impact of statistical regression and other technical considerations in the studies, which have led to these conclusions. Our study used a relative-ranking design to measure the accuracy of self-assessments of both strengths and weaknesses in psychiatry residents. We analyzed the relationships between indices of self-assessment accuracy and other resident characteristics, particularly current academic strength as measured by a standard test of psychiatric knowledge. A total of 56 residents in two general psychiatry programs evaluated their performance on the Psychiatry Resident in Training Examination by estimating the rank order of their scores in the 11 psychiatry subject areas. For each resident, actual examination results were then used to generate measures of the accuracy of the identification of strengths and weaknesses. Residents' identifications of their strengths and weaknesses were significantly more accurate than chance levels. Strengths and weaknesses were identified with roughly equal proficiency, and accuracy in these assessments was not correlated to any of the following variables: academic competence as measured by examination raw scores, postgraduate year, gender, international vs. American medical education, program membership, or age. Our results do not support the hypothesis that trainees who show the least academic mastery also make the most inaccurate self-assessments.

Our meta-analysis of published association studies shows highly significant evidence of association between nucleotide variations in the G72/G30 region and schizophrenia, along with compelling evidence of association with bipolar disorder. But the associated alleles and haplotypes are not identical across studies, and some strongly associated variants are located approximately 50 kb telomeric of G72.

Because drug addicts and psycopaths often make risky decisions (e.g., drug misuse and aggression), investigation into types of impulsivity in intertemporal and probabilistic choices (delay and probability discounting) are important for psychiatric treatments. Studies in behavioral ecology proposed that delay and probability discounting are mediated by the same psychological process, because a decrease in probability of winning corresponds to an increase in delay until winning. According to this view, odds-against winning (=1/p-1) in probabilistic choice corresponds to delay in intertemporal choice. This hypothesis predicts that preference of gambling (low degree of probability discounting) may be associated with patience, rather than impulsivity or impatience, in intertemporal choice (low degree of delay discounting). However, recent empirical evidence in psychiatric research employing pathological gamblers indicates that pathological gamblers are impulsive in intertemporal choice (high degrees of delay discounting). However, a hyperbolic discounting function (usually adopted to explain intertemporal choice) with odds-against (instead of delay) explain experimental data in probabilistic choice dramatically well. Therefore, an alternative explanation is required for the hypothetical equivalence of odds-against to delay. We propose that queuing theory (often adopted for analyzing computer network traffic) under a competitive social foraging condition may explain the equivalence. Our hypothesis may help understand impulsivity of psychiatrics in social behavior (e.g., aggression and antisocial behavior) in addition to non-social impulsivity in reward-seeking (e.g., substance misuse)."}, {"Title": "Distinct neuropsychological processes may mediate decision-making under uncertainty with known and unknown probability in gain and loss frames.", "Abstract": "Decision-making under uncertainty has been studied in psychiatry, economic psychology, and neuroeconomics. Psychiatric patients (e.g., drug addicts) often show low degrees of aversion to potential danger. Investigation into neuropsychological processing underlying decision under uncertainty is important for medical treatments of neuropsychiatric disorders. In economic decision theory, choices under uncertainty with and without known probabilities of outcomes have been discriminated. Regarding decision-making under uncertainty with known probabilities (risk), Kahnemann-Tversky's prospect theory revealed that people tend to avoid uncertainty in potential gains (i.e., risk-aversion in a gain-frame); on the contrary, prefer uncertainty in potential losses (i.e., risk-seeking in a loss-frame). Regarding choices between possible gains with known and unknown probabilities, Ellsberg demonstrated that, in a gain-frame, people tend to avoid uncertainty with unknown probabilities, more dramatically than uncertainty with known probabilities. This can be explained by risk/uncertainty aversion in the gain-frame, suggesting that uncertainty with known and unknown probabilities (i.e., risk and Knightian uncertainty, respectively) may possibly be processed by similar neuropsychological processing in the gain-frame. However, in spite of accumulating evidence in neuroimaging and neuroeconomic studies, it is still unknown whether probability and Knightian uncertainty in the loss-frame are mediated by similar neuropsychological processes as well. We propose that distinct neuropsychological processes may mediate potential losses with known and unknown probabilities, based on recent findings in neuroeconomics and our experiment.

Collectively, our studies suggest that SZ is characterized by a gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic neuron pathology presumably mediated by promoter hypermethylation facilitated by the over-expression of the methylating enzyme DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1. Using transient expression assays, promoter deletions and co-transfection assays with various transcription factors, we have shown a clear synergistic action that is a critical component of the mechanism of the trans-activation process. Equally important is the observation that the reelin promoter is more heavily methylated in brain regions in patients diagnosed with SZ as compared to non-psychiatric control subjects [Grayson, D. R., Jia, X., Chen, Y., Sharma, R. P., Mitchell, C. P., & Guidotti, A., et al. (2005). Reelin promoter hypermethylation in schizophrenia. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102, 9341-9346]. The combination of studies in cell lines and in animal models of SZ, coupled with data obtained from post-mortem human material provides compelling evidence that aberrant methylation may be part of a core dysfunction in this psychiatric disease. More interestingly, the hypermethylation concept provides a coherent mechanism that establishes a plausible link between the epigenetic misregulation of multiple genes that are affected in SZ and that collectively contribute to the associated symptomatology."}, {"Title": "Polypharmacy in a 75-year-old patient with schizoaffective disorder.", "Abstract": "A 75-year-old white female with schizoaffective disorder was admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit for uncooperativeness in refusing to take scheduled medications. She complained of anticholinergic adverse effects and had abnormal involuntary movements in the oral/buccal region. The patient had been prescribed six psychotropic medications (i.e., thiothixene, lithium, divalproex sodium, amitriptyline, benztropine, and trazodone effects. The treatment team determined that the patient was noncompliant and experienced the effects of polypharmacy. She had been prescribed two mood stabilizers and suffered from anticholinergic adverse effects and the movement disorder tardive dyskinesia (TD). Four medications were discontinued: thiothixene, amitriptyline, lithium, and benztropine. Quetiapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, was recommended, with a daily titration schedule to reach a target dose of 600 mg per day in divided doses. This agent has less propensity to cause movement disorders compared with first-generation antipsychotics. All medications with additive anticholinergic properties also were discontinued. Lithium was stopped secondary to subtherapeutic levels and potential drug interactions. The pharmacist educated the inpatient team on the additive anticholinergic effects of each medication, reduced the total number of medications prescribed, and assisted in appropriate conversion to quetiapine to reduce TD symptoms."}, {"Title": "National patterns of dementia treatment among elderly ambulatory patients.", "Abstract": "To assess patterns of dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) management and to investigate predictive factors of cholinesterase inhibitor prescriptions.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted using a national survey among the elderly aged >60 from 2000 to 2002. Visit characteristics and cholinesterase inhibitor prescriptions associated with dementia/AD status were evaluated.\nA total of 25,561 visit records were identified. Of the total visits, only 0.6% had dementia/AD records. Most of the dementia/AD visits were made by women (60.6%) and white patients (93.5%). Of the dementia/AD visits, about half (46.5%) were prescribed with one or more cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil was the most prevalent agent (68.0%) followed by rivastigmine (26.0%). Logistic regression analyses indicated that the physician's specialty was a strong predictor for cholinesterase inhibitor prescription; psychiatrists [odds ratio (OR)=5.5; p<0.01] and neurologists (OR=2.6; p<0.03) were more likely to prescribe cholinesterase inhibitor than other physicians.

Although lithium is also known to decrease the concentration of inositol, an important brain osmolyte, little is known of the effects of lithium on brain water homeostasis.\nTo determine whether lithium alters brain water homeostasis, and, if so, whether the mechanism involves changes in inositol concentration.\nRats were fed regular food or regular food plus lithium chloride for either 11 days or 5 weeks. Brains were dissected and assayed for tissue water by the wet-dry method and for inositol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\nWe found a statistically significant (p=0.05, corrected) 3.1% mean elevation in frontal cortex tissue water in 5-week lithium-fed rats (86.7+/-3.9%), compared to control rats (83.6+/-2.6%). Inositol concentration correlated inversely with percent tissue water (r=-0.50, p=0.003, corrected) in pooled samples of 5-week lithium-fed rats, and was significantly lower in frontal cortex and hippocampus of 5-week lithium-fed rats, compared to controls. Rats fed lithium for 11 days did not differ significantly from controls on either variable.\nThis is the first report of a lithium-induced increase in brain tissue water. Although the mechanism is unclear, it does not appear to result from changes in brain inositol concentration or blood sodium concentration. This finding may have implications for the therapeutic or toxic effects of lithium on brain, because increased tissue water can augment cell excitability."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic profiles in outpatient child psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Outpatient child psychiatrists appear to be treating a broadening array of complex, highly comorbid, and difficult-to-treat youths.

Regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is of particular interest in schizophrenia since it is associated with the dopamine (DA) receptor, its expression is altered in affected CNS tissue, and polymorphisms in the RGS4 gene are being examined as risk factors for the disease (Morris et al.2004, Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet 125:50-53; Prasad et al.2005, Mol Psychiatry 10:213-219; Williams et al.2004, Biol Psychiatry 55:192-195). To further test for the involvement of RGS4 expression in schizophrenia, we examined a selection of different cortical and subcortical regions in human brain for alterations in RGS4 mRNA and protein expression. To evaluate the effect of antipsychotic medication on RGS4 expression levels, we compared a subset of treated and untreated cases that were off antipsychotic medication for at least 3 months prior to death. We report a significant decrease in RGS4 mRNA levels in the cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and the insular cortex of all schizophrenia cases when compared with controls. A decrease in RGS4 mRNA was also observed in the caudate, but only in the medicated schizophrenia cases. Measurement of protein levels using Western blot demonstrated that RGS4 protein is decreased in the frontal cortex of schizophrenia cases."}, {"Title": "[Infantile anorexia: from birth to childhood].", "Abstract": "Young child's anorexia (0-4 years) may have organic or psychological origin, when parents-child relationships are concerned. The most complex and earliest forms often have unspecified aetiology. Psychopathological classifications, which emphasize the mother-child relationships, are essential reference marks. But there is now a consensus in the definitions: the diagnosis of infantile anorexia requires criteria of acute or chronic malnutrition. We mainly distinguish anorexia by early disorder of homeostasis, anorexia resulting from serious disorder of attachment, anorexia by disorder of mother-child interactions, and finally early and complex anorexia, mixing an organic vulnerability and a bonding trouble, which can be secondary. Treatments differ according to the selected aetiology. Even if the origin is not mainly the fact of a relational mother-child dysfunction, parents-child's relations require a support to avoid aggravation by interactive vicious circles (force feeding). More than other diseases of early childhood, feeding disorders require a good knowledge of the working hypotheses both in the field of the paediatrics and the child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Human brain evolution and the \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:\" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "The DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 have judiciously minimized discussion of etiologies to distance clinical psychiatry from Freudian psychoanalysis. With this goal mostly achieved, discussion of etiological factors should be reintroduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). A research agenda for the DSM-V advocated the \"development of a pathophysiologically based classification system\". The author critically reviews the neuroevolutionary literature on stress-induced and fear circuitry disorders and related amygdala-driven, species-atypical fear behaviors of clinical severity in adult humans. Over 30 empirically testable/falsifiable predictions are presented. It is noted that in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10, the classification of stress and fear circuitry disorders is neither mode-of-acquisition-based nor brain-evolution-based. For example, snake phobia (innate) and dog phobia (overconsolidational) are clustered together. Similarly, research on blood-injection-injury-type-specific phobia clusters two fears different in their innateness: 1) an arguably ontogenetic memory-trace-overconsolidation-based fear (hospital phobia) and 2) a hardwired (innate) fear of the sight of one's blood or a sharp object penetrating one's skin. Genetic architecture-charting of fear-circuitry-related traits has been challenging. Various, non-phenotype-based architectures can serve as targets for research. In this article, the author will propose one such alternative genetic architecture. This article was inspired by the following: A) Nesse's \"Smoke-Detector Principle\", B) the increasing suspicion that the \"smooth\" rather than \"lumpy\" distribution of complex psychiatric phenotypes (including fear-circuitry disorders) may in some cases be accounted for by oligogenic (and not necessarily polygenic) transmission, and C) insights from the initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium published in late 2005. Neuroevolutionary insights relevant to fear circuitry symptoms that primarily emerge overconsolidationally (especially Combat related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) are presented. Also introduced is a human-evolution-based principle for clustering innate fear traits. The \"Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle\" of innate fears proposed in this article may be useful in the development of a neuroevolution-based taxonomic re-clustering of stress-triggered and fear-circuitry disorders in DSM-V. Four broad clusters of evolved fear circuits are proposed based on their time-depths: 1) Mesozoic (mammalian-wide) circuits hardwired by wild-type alleles driven to fixation by Mesozoic selective sweeps; 2) Cenozoic (simian-wide) circuits relevant to many specific phobias; 3) mid Paleolithic and upper Paleolithic (Homo sapiens-specific) circuits (arguably resulting mostly from mate-choice-driven stabilizing selection); 4) Neolithic circuits (arguably mostly related to stabilizing selection driven by gene-culture co-evolution). More importantly, the author presents evolutionary perspectives on warzone-related PTSD, Combat-Stress Reaction, Combat-related Stress, Operational-Stress, and other deployment-stress-induced symptoms. The Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle presented in this article may help explain the dissimilar stress-resilience levels following different types of acute threat to survival of oneself or one's progency (aka DSM-III and DSM-V PTSD Criterion-A events). PTSD rates following exposure to lethal inter-group violence (combat, warzone exposure or intentionally caused disasters such as terrorism) are usually 5-10 times higher than rates following large-scale natural disasters such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The author predicts that both intentionally-caused large-scale bioevent-disasters, as well as natural bioevents such as SARS and avian flu pandemics will be an exception and are likely to be followed by PTSD rates approaching those that follow warzone exposure. During bioevents, Amygdala-driven and locus-coeruleus-driven epidemic pseudosomatic symptoms may be an order of magnitude more common than infection-caused cytokine-driven symptoms. Implications for the red cross and FEMA are discussed. It is also argued that hospital phobia as well as dog phobia, bird phobia and bat phobia require re-taxonomization in DSM-V in a new \"overconsolidational disorders\" category anchored around PTSD. The overconsolidational spectrum category may be conceptualized as straddling the fear circuitry spectrum disorders and the affective spectrum disorders categories, and may be a category for which Pitman's secondary prevention propranolol regimen may be specifically indicated as a \"morning after pill\" intervention. Predictions are presented regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (e.g., female-pattern hoarding vs. male-pattern hoarding) and \"culture-bound\" acute anxiety symptoms (taijin-kyofusho, koro, shuk yang, shook yong, suo yang, rok-joo, jinjinia-bemar, karoshi, gwarosa, Voodoo death). Also discussed are insights relevant to pseudoneurological symptoms and to the forthcoming Dissociative-Conversive disorders category in DSM-V, including what the author terms fright-triggered acute pseudo-localized symptoms (i.e., pseudoparalysis, pseudocerebellar imbalance, psychogenic blindness, pseudoseizures, and epidemic sociogenic illness). Speculations based on studies of the human abnormal-spindle-like, microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene, the microcephaly primary autosomal recessive (MCPH) gene, and the forkhead box p2 (FOXP2) gene are made and incorporated into what is termed \"The pre-FOXP2 Hypothesis of Blood-Injection-Injury Phobia.\" Finally, the author argues for a non-reductionistic fusion of \"distal (evolutionary) neurobiology\" with clinical \"proximal neurobiology,\" utilizing neurological heuristics. It is noted that the value of re-clustering fear traits based on behavioral ethology, human-phylogenomics-derived endophenotypes and on ontogenomics (gene-environment interactions) can be confirmed or disconfirmed using epidemiological or twin studies and psychiatric genomics."}, {"Title": "Integrated specialist assessment of older people and predictors of care-home admission.", "Abstract": "Effective community-based care for older people requires the integration of assessment approaches by old age psychiatry, geriatric medicine and social services care management. This study examines the value of such collaboration in the assessment of older people at risk of entering care homes.\nA randomized controlled trial of integrated assessment (care management with additional clinical assessment by old age psychiatrist or geriatrician) versus care management assessment only, for older people at risk of care-home admission. Older people's characteristics, physical and cognitive functioning, depression, behaviour and quality of care measures were recorded at assessment and 6 months. Differences in clinicians' and care managers' recommendations and placement rates between experimental and control groups were analysed. Logistic regression, examining associations between different needs-related characteristics and the likelihood of care-home admission, was used to characterize placement decisions.\nClinicians recommended fewer older people for placement than did care managers in their usual assessments (a reduction of 85%). This did not, however, translate into a reduction in actual numbers of placements, although placements were delayed in those receiving the integrated assessment. Placements of those receiving the integrated assessment were influenced more by clinical factors, most notably cognitive impairment, which clinicians detected more readily than care managers.\nIn this at-risk group, integrated assessment offers a means of potentially both delaying care-home admissions and taking account of a wider range of factors in placement decisions.

It will need to avoid the many mistakes that biology-free Evolutionary Psychology has been prey to. It should not ignore the wealth of information that exists between the phenotypic expression of symptoms and the genotypic sources of core brain/mind processes that are disrupted in psychiatric disorders. Syndromal-conceptual thinking has become a barrier to illuminating the biological sources of psychiatric disorders. Endophenoytpic-biomarker approaches now offer robust alternatives for generating linkages between psychiatrically relevant psychological changes and the neurobiological infrastructure of disordered mentation. Here I summarize recent advances in endophenotypic thinking in biological psychiatry, and suggest that various core emotional-affective processes may be among the most important endophenotypes that need to be clarified at both neurobiological and genetic levels of analysis. To this end, I discuss strategies to link basic emotional processes that are commonly imbalanced in psychiatric disorders to neuroanatomical, neurochemical, neurophysiology, and molecular genetic levels of analysis. Conjoint animal behavioral-genetic and gene expression, microarray analyses can clarify a variety of key emotional endophenotypes and thereby provide a coherent infrastructure for psychiatric systematics. To further clarify the neurobiological dimensions of psychiatric disorders, we must also focus on psychosocial and environmental stress vectors that converge to create imbalanced emotional and motivational brain activities of psychiatric significance."}, {"Title": "Helping to prioritise interventions for depression and schizophrenia: use of Population Impact Measures.", "Abstract": "To demonstrate the potential of Population Impact Measures in helping to prioritise alternative interventions for psychiatry, this paper estimates the number of relapses and hospital readmissions prevented for depression and schizophrenia by adopting best practice recommendations.

Whilst the number of patients has steadily increased, many clinics considerably reduced the number of therapeutic staff due to an increasing lack of financial support. The German psychiatry personnel regulations act defines the number of therapeutic staff required for an adequate psychiatric treatment, but the requirements of this regulations act nowadays are widely missed in most of the German psychiatric hospitals. This severely affects the therapeutic work on psychiatric wards. This study analyses tasks and activities of medical doctors on psychiatric wards and compares the hours spent with various types of activities with the amount of time that should be spent according to the personnel regulations act. Results show that doctors spend much more time with documentation and administrative work than originally intended by the personnel regulations act. They compensate this mainly by a reduction of time spent in direct contact with the patients. In this context, the number of psychotherapy sessions as well as sessions with the patients' relatives has been considerably reduced, whereas the time spent for emergency intervention and basic treatment still corresponds to the calculations according to the personnel regulations act. All in all, the results show that a reduction of therapeutic staff in psychiatric hospitals directly leads to a change in treatment settings with a focus on less individual treatment options."}, {"Title": "The Columbia Cooperative Aging Program: an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental approach to geriatric education for medical interns.", "Abstract": "Although there is a critical need to prepare physicians to care for the growing population of older adults, many academic medical centers lack the geriatric-trained faculty and dedicated resources needed to support comprehensive residency training programs in geriatrics. Because of this challenge at Columbia University, the Columbia Cooperative Aging Program was developed to foster geriatric training for medical interns. For approximately 60 interns each year completing their month-long geriatric rotations, an integral part of this training now involves conducting comprehensive assessments with \"well\" older people, supervised by an interdisciplinary team of preceptors from various disciplines, including cardiology, internal medicine, occupational therapy, geriatric nursing, psychiatry, education, public health, social work, and medical anthropology. Interns explore individual behaviors and social supports that promote health in older people; older people's strengths, vulnerabilities, and risk for functional decline; and strategies for maintaining quality of life and independence. In addition, a structured \"narrative medicine\" writing assignment is used to promote the interns' reflections on the assessment process, the data gathered, and their clinical reasoning throughout. Preliminary measures of the program's effect have shown significant improvements in attitudes toward, and knowledge of, older adults as patients, as well as in interns' self-assessed clinical skills.

They were used by doctors for similar indications, such as mania, delirium tremens, and what we would now call drug dependence. The two show similar career paths consisting of three phases: initial enthusiasm and therapeutic optimism; subsequent negative appraisal; and finally, limited use. These cycles, which we term \"Seige cycles,\" are generally typical of the careers of psychotropic drugs in modern medicine. However, differences in the careers of both drugs are also established. The phases of chloral show relatively higher peaks and lower valleys than those of cannabis. Chloral is the first typically \"modern\" psychotropic drug; a synthetic, it was introduced in 1869 at a time of growing asylum populations, pharmaceutical interests, and high cultural expectations of scientific medicine. Cannabis indica, introduced in the 1840s, is typically a \"premodern\" drug steeped in the climate of cultural Romanticism. We conclude that the analytical concept of the Seige cycle is a useful tool for future research into drug careers in medicine."}, {"Title": "Is shared learning the way to bring UK neurology and psychiatry closer: what teachers, trainers and trainees think.", "Abstract": "Rapid advances in brain sciences are challenging the validity of the traditional divide between neurology and psychiatry.

Several key issues are identified, including (1) the increasing biological reductionism of psychiatry; (2) the gradual de-emphasis of subjective experience along with the biopsychosocial explanation of human behavior and psychopathology; and (3) the increasing attention paid to neuroscience, psychopharmacology, and brief therapies during residency training. In order to address these issues, it is suggested that education in psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychiatry be integrated into residency training. This would take the form of subspecialty training in either psychodynamic psychiatry or psycho analysis. Such training would promote an understanding of the connections between neurobiology and psychodynamics, versatility with a variety of dynamic psychotherapeutic techniques, and familiarity with research methodology.

The explosion in neurobiological sciences has left residents with an overwhelming amount of neurobiology to master at the same time that managed care has led to a de-emphasis on psychiatrists providing psychotherapy. Consequently, many residents are left questioning the relevance of psychodynamics for psychiatry, given that the majority will function primarily as prescribers. However, the illusion, increasingly common in our culture, that medications are a simple fix leaves residents unprepared to make sense of the complex and irrational processes that happen in the acts of prescribing and taking medications (or not taking medications). Consequently, residents may feel confused, angry, hopeless, and/or abandoned in their role. These residents are often hungry for a context to explain why they feel hopeless, confused, or defeated in carrying out the \"simple\" task of prescribing. A psychodynamic understanding can provide such a holding context, just as it can give residents tools for backing out of futile and/or destructive enactments and turning conflicts around medications to some therapeutic good. Many psychodynamic concepts that initially may have seemed to residents part of some arcane and outmoded pseudoscience suddenly become relevant when they provide both a context for understanding the resident's distress and useful clinical tools. Those psychodynamic psychiatrists wishing to promulgate a psychodynamic understanding may need to meet psychiatric trainees at their developmental level and take seriously the current emphasis on providing effective somatic treatments. By engaging trainees at the junction of psychodynamics and psychopharmacology, psychodynamic psychiatrists may find a more receptive audience and open the door for greater interest in developing psychodynamic understanding and technical skills."}, {"Title": "Finding psychodynamic psychiatry's lost generation.", "Abstract": "This paper describes forces that have adversely affected the place of the psychodynamic perspective within psychiatric practice and training over the last generation.

However, despite remarkable advances in the neurosciences, there is still no pharmaceutical magic bullet. The author argues for the continued relevancy of psychotherapy and outlines a practical psychodynamic approach that utilizes fundamental analytic concepts. These concepts--transference, the dual theory of drives, the repetition compulsion, and mechanisms of defense--are described and their clinical application is illustrated. This core conceptual model has significant heuristic value in treating patients and in teaching psychotherapy to psychiatric residents. With its emphasis on the power of the doctor-patient relationship, it teaches residents an effective body of knowledge that helps them define their professional identity-as psychiatrists whose most effective therapeutic tool is themselves, not the drugs they dispense."}, {"Title": "The place of psychodynamic psychiatry in consultation-liaison psychiatry with special emphasis on countertransference.", "Abstract": "Psychodynamic theory can be applied to all aspects of consultation-liaison work. There are various psychodynamic treatment approaches that can have a powerful meaning to the patient. This can include understanding the patient's life trajectory through the elicitation of a life narrative, understanding defense mechanisms, and utilizing the patient's fantasies about illness. Patients who are physically ill regress and want to be understood. When this is achieved through a psychodynamic approach, the patient will be more likely to accept a referral for psychiatric follow-up when it is indicated. The consultation-liaison psychiatrist will also encounter transference and countertransference manifestations. Of particular usefulness can be derivatives of classical countertransference, which can be seen as reactions and identifications by the treating psychiatrist or the medical team to the patient that may interfere with effective care. \"Countertransference Rounds\" is a technique for examining such manifestations during the C-L team's discussion of patients."}, {"Title": "The psychoanalyst at the medical bedside.", "Abstract": "Consultation-liaison psychiatry is now a subspecialty recognized by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. The presence of the psychiatrist as a member of the medical team is the result of contributions by psychoanalysts in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s who studied the psyche acting on the soma. Psychoanalysis, from its theoretical inception, was holistic, and brought together biological, psychic, and social-ecological perspectives to unravel the mysteries of somatic illness. The early psychoanalysts were retracing a biopsychosocial model whose origins could be found in ancient Greece. A patient who is medically ill is more than an illness. Subjective experience, experiences before the onset of illness, losses, and the triad of helplessness, hopelessness, and giving up all became areas for psychoanalytic study. Some medically ill patients present degrees of complexity that puzzle physicians. These patients require a psychiatric consultation and treatment. The alliance with the psychiatrist unravels the problems complicating their cases and results in a collaborative treatment with the treating physician. The psychoanalyst training residents in psychiatry during their period in a consultation-liaison service is able to teach transference and countertransference issues that arise with patients and nonpsychiatric physicians. The creation of such an alliance can be a difficult task for the authoritarian resident who may be culturally conditioned to a rigid doctor-patient relationship. With the guidance of the psychoanalyst-teacher, residents change, and patients benefit."}, {"Title": "Reminiscences of a training director and the future of training programs.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric education in the United States has undergone vast changes during the past 40 years, from a classical psychoanalytic model to an evidence-based neurobiological paradigm. Training standards, set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medial Education, have brought more scientific rigor to the training of young psychiatrists, but the danger of losing the psychotherapeutic skills provided in the past by long-term psychodynamic supervision is of concern to many psychiatric educators.

Thanks for this momentous accomplishment goes to its founding fathers and mothers, who were clear in their purpose and whose wisdom is manifest in the Academy's constitution. In the 1930s, the orthodoxy of the American Psychoanalytic Association created a ferment of rebellion in most of its institutes, which led to secessions, sister institutes, and a greater open-mindedness in institutes residing in Chicago, Washington, New Orleans, and Detroit. The quest for a new national forum that would be open to an exchange of new ideas began in 1951 and culminated in the formation of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis in 1956. The spirit of the Academy is highlighted by relating the successful struggle of communication among its members in a dream workshop that existed for six years."}, {"Title": "Vulnerability to mild predator stress in serotonin transporter knockout mice.", "Abstract": "Effect of predator stress on rat and mouse anxiety-like behavior may model aspects of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A single cat exposure of wild type (C57, CFW) mice can produce lasting anxiety-like effects in the elevated plus maze, light/dark box tests and startle. In addition, female but not male C57 mice are made more anxious in the plus maze by exposure to predator odors alone, suggesting differential vulnerability to predator stressors of differing intensity. There is a link between genetic variation in the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) and anxiety in humans. This prompted the generation of SERT knockout mice [see Holmes A, Murphy DL, Crawley, JN. Biol Psychiatry 2003;54(10):953-9]. Present work used these mice to determine if there was a link between vulnerability to the anxiogenic effects of predator odors and abnormalities of 5-HT transmission induced by a life long reduction in 5-HT reuptake. Wild type (WT, C57 background), heterozygous (SERT +/-, HET) mice and homozygous knockout (SERT -/-, KO) were assigned to handled control groups or groups exposed for 10 min to a large testing room rich in cat odor. One week after handling or room exposure, anxiety testing took place in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, in red light. Predator odor exposure was selectively anxiogenic in the plus maze and light/dark box tests in SERT -/- mice. Exposure to predator odor did not potentiate startle. Findings suggest a role for abnormalities in 5-HT transmission in vulnerability to some of the lasting anxiogenic effects of species relevant stressors and possibly in vulnerability to PTSD."}, {"Title": "Cognitive change process during group cognitive behaviour therapy for depression.", "Abstract": "This study extended that of Kwon and Oei [Kwon, S.M., Oei, T.P.S., 2003.

The objective of this study is to examine the situation of addictions in Spain and the responses generated by health policies. In recent years, both the type and pattern of drug consumption in Spain, has undergone a noticeable change. Studies of the evolution of tobacco consumption suggest that the peak has passed, even though prevalence is still high. Alcohol consumption per capita has fallen by 25% in the last 25 years. During the same period, pattern of consumption has been modified. Sporadic drinking, in episodes of binging and drinking away from meals, is one of the patterns on the rise. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in Spain, 27.8% of the population between 15- 64 years old has consumed an illegal drug at least once in their lives, with the prevalence rising to 38% among the 15- 34 year olds. Cannabis is the most consumed (29% among 1564 age group), followed by cocaine (5.9%), and ecstasy (4.6%). Spain, comparing with other countries of European Union, is the third in cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamine and the first in cocaine consumption. With respect to the so-called behavioral addictions, no consensus in the field of psychiatry has been reached. The only psychological addiction with clear diagnostic criteria is gambling. The rest (Internet, sex, etc.), perhaps for their novelty, continue to be the object of controversy. New addictions, as much to addictive substances as to addictive behaviors, run parallel to the development of industrialized societies, leisure, free time, and a new way of life.

The programme was of excellent quality and represented a further step towards the achievement of a standardized EANM congress structure. A large industrial exhibition demonstrated the latest technological innovations and developments within the field. The congress was a great success: there were more than 4,000 participants, and 1,670 abstracts were received. Of these, 1,399 were accepted for oral or poster presentations, with a rejection rate of 16.2%. The original investigations presented were related to different areas of nuclear medicine, and addressed particularly advances in instrumentation and data processing, progress in radiochemistry and pharmacy, novel diagnostics and therapeutics, and new insights in well-established areas of clinical application, such as oncology, cardiology, neurology, psychiatry, endocrinology, paediatrics, nephrology, and infection and inflammation. It is noteworthy that a number of studies presented at this congress focussed on the quantitative interpretation of the imaging data and on pragmatic endpoints, such as adverse outcomes, and identified when nuclear medicine procedures achieved clinical effectiveness for patient care and management.

While there are numerous studies on depression in the areas of epidemiology, biopsychosocial correlates, genetics, course, and treatment, remarkably little research has focused on the criteria used to diagnose major depressive disorder. Nearly 10 years ago, we began the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, an integration of a comprehensive assessment protocol into a community-based psychiatry outpatient practice. As part of this clinical-research program, patients have been administered semistructured diagnostic interviews to assess the DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II disorders by well-trained interviewers. One of the goals of the MIDAS project has been to examine issues of nosology. While changes in the successive editions of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM have been increasingly grounded on empirical research, many of the sets of diagnostic criteria have not been subject to empirical scrutiny. During the next 12 months, we will be publishing a series of papers examining varying aspects of the diagnostic criteria for major depression. This series represents the type of methodical psychometric and conceptual analysis that should be conducted when developing or revising diagnostic criteria. We will examine whether the assumptions underlying the DSM's diagnostic rules have empirical support, and examine the impact of these rules on clinical practice. Our goal is not to develop a new definition of depression that would classify some individuals differently than how they are currently classified. That is, we are not seeking to develop a more valid definition of depression. However, our findings sometimes suggest changes that would simplify the criteria, improve their psychometric properties, and enhance their applicability in medical settings. Thus, the focus in the series is on clinical utility rather than validity."}, {"Title": "[Has the informed consent for people with schizophrenia prevailed among Japanese psychiatrists by changing the name?

His main objective was to differentiate them by their underlying cause. Between 1890 and 1893 he sampled his views for both subjects. Expanding Evariste Marandon de Montyel's ideas of 1889 M\u00f6bius not only agreed that illnesses can emerge from causes that lie mainly within the body as well as mainly outside it, he even went as far as to say that there were illnesses that are solely based on causes outside the body. Moreover, it was M\u00f6bius who first introduced the terms \"endogenous\" and \"exogenous\" diseases. In accordance with the degeneration theory of his time he referred to transmission as the only etiological factor for endogenous illnesses, proposing that the extent of the illness is determined by the degree of degeneration. In the case of exogenous illnesses, however, the various stimuli affecting the nervous system would lead to qualitatively different illnesses. It is mainly due to Emil Kraepelin, who took over M\u00f6bius's dichotomy in the fifth edition of his most influential textbook of psychiatry of 1896, that his views had a lasting influence. And as it shown in the present study it was both through personal arguments with his old friend from Leipzig as well as through M\u00f6bius's equally critical and reprimanding reviews of the individual editions of Kraepelin's textbook that the latter acknowledged the importance of the etiological factor in his multi-factorial clinical and empirical nosology.

In Germany, basic principles for these decisions are laid down in the Personalverordnung Psychiatrie (Psych PV) and the Practice Guidelines of the German Psychiatric Association.

We tested for association between the AVPR1a microsatellites and autism in 116 families (128 probands diagnosed with the ADI-R and ADOS-G using a family-based association test (UNPHASED)). Testing each individual microsatellite showed significant transmission disequilibrium in these families with the AVR intronic microsatellite (UNPHASED: LRS=11.46, global P-value=0.009, df=3). Haplotype analysis of three microsatellites also showed significant association (LRS=144.94, df=103, global P=0.004). Additionally, significant association is observed between these three microsatellite haplotypes and the VABS scores (P=0.009), with the ADI-R (P=0.009) and the ADOS-G (P=0.0000765) diagnoses of autistic disorder versus pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) that were available for 47 of these probands. This is the third consecutive report of an association between the AVPR1a gene and autism spectrum disorders and in the current study a third microsatellite is shown to be associated with autism spectrum disorders as well as haplotypes consisting of all three markers. Importantly, the association appears to be mainly mediated by the role of the AVPR1a gene in shaping socialization skills, similar to its role in lower vertebrates.Molecular Psychiatry (2006) 11, 488-494. doi:10.1038/sj.mp.4001812; published online 7 March 2006."}, {"Title": "Opportunities for cost-effective prevention of late-life depression: an epidemiological approach.", "Abstract": "Clinically relevant late-life depression has a prevalence of 16% and is associated with substantial societal costs through its disease burden and unfavorable prognosis.

Of these, 1925 were not depressed at baseline.\nThe onset of clinically relevant depression was measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. For each of the risk factors (and their combinations), we calculated indices of potential health gain and the effort (costs) required to generate those health gains.\nOne in every 5 cases of clinically relevant late-life depression is a new case. Consequently, depression prevention has to play a key role in reducing the influx of new cases. This is best done by directing prevention efforts toward elderly people who have depressive symptoms, experience functional impairment, and have a small social network, in particular women, as well as people who have attained only a low educational level or who suffer from chronic diseases.\nDirecting prevention efforts toward selected high-risk groups could help reduce the incidence of depression and is likely to be more cost-effective than alternative approaches.

An evolutionary framework is appropriate in view of the paradoxical epidemiology of the disorders. Evolutionary models that rely on balanced polymorphism or group selection models are not supported by the evidence. Rather, a hypothesis is presented arguing that the spectrum of psychoses should be regarded as a costly by-product of social brain evolution in Homo sapiens. Under social selective pressures, hominid ancestors evolved a sophisticated neural network supporting social cognition and adaptive interpersonal behaviour--this is termed the 'social brain'. The functional psychoses (and schizophrenia in particular) are characterised by functional and structural deficits in these fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal circuits; hence the epithet 'social brain disorders' is fitting. I argue that accumulating evidence for an evolved social brain calls for a new philosophy of mind; a philosophy focussed on the social and interpersonal nature of human experience and derived from the philosophies of Fromm, Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. Such a paradigm shift would aid modern neuroscience in finally abandoning Cartesian dualism and would guide psychiatry towards an integrated and 'socio-neurologically' embedded understanding of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Methodological aspects of telephone scatologia: a case study.", "Abstract": "The present paper focuses on the sexual paraphilia of telephone scatologia.

Altered noradrenergic signaling is linked to certain types of depression and anxiety disorders, and treatment often includes specific transporter blockade. The norepinephrine transporter is crucial in limiting catecholaminergic signaling. Norepinephrine transporter-deficient mice have increased circulating catecholamines and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. We hypothesized, therefore, that reduced norepinephrine clearance would heighten the autonomic cardiovascular response to anxiety and fear. In separate experiments, norepinephrine transporter-deficient (norepinephrine transporter-/-) mice underwent tactile startle and trace fear conditioning to measure hemodynamic responses. A dramatic tachycardia was observed in norepinephrine transporter-/- mice compared with controls following both airpuff or footshock stimuli, and pressure changes were also greater. Interestingly, in contrast to normally elevated home cage levels in norepinephrine transporter-deficient mice, prestimulus heart rate and blood pressure were actually higher in norepinephrine transporter+/+ animals throughout behavioral testing. Upon placement in the behavioral chamber, norepinephrine transporter-deficient mice demonstrated a notable bradycardia and depressor effect that was more pronounced in females. Power spectral analysis indicated an increase in low frequency oscillations of heart rate variability; in mice, suggesting increased parasympathetic tone. Finally, norepinephrine transporter-/- mice exhibited sexual dimorphism in freeze behavior, which was greatest in females. Therefore, while reduced catecholamine clearance amplifies immediate cardiovascular responses to anxiety- or fear-inducing stimuli in norepinephrine transporter-/- mice, norepinephrine transporter deficiency apparently prevents protracted hemodynamic escalation in a fearful environment. Conceivably, chronic norepinephrine transporter blockade with transporter-specific drugs might attenuate recognition of autonomic and somatic distress signals in individuals with anxiety disorders, possibly lessening their behavioral reactivity, and reducing the cardiovascular risk factors associated with persistent emotional arousal."}, {"Title": "The role of theory in the psychophysiology of personality: from Ivan Pavlov to Jeffrey Gray.", "Abstract": "Psychophysiological approaches to personality have made significant progress in recent years, partly as a spin-off of technological innovation (e.g., functional neuroimaging) and partly as a result of an emerging theoretical consensus regarding the structure and biology of basic processes. In this field, Jeffrey Gray's influential psychophysiological theory of personality - now widely known as Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) - owes much to Pavlov, who devoted a large proportion of his later life to personality differences and their implications for psychiatry. In this article, we trace the influence of Pavlov on Hans Eysenck's and Jeffrey Gray's work, and then provide a brief description of RST in order to highlight some of the central problems - as well as some tentative solutions - in the psychophysiology of personality. Specifically, the importance of theory in personality research is stressed by the contrast of Gray's theoretically driven model with less fertile atheoretical (i.e., exploratory-inductive) approaches. The fecundity of RST, which has been in continual development over a period of thirty years, is discussed in the light of Karl Popper's views on the nature of science, especially the formulation of the 'problem situation', which sets up the theoretical and operational conditions under which hypotheses may be challenged and tested to destruction. In this respect, we see the truth of Lewin's [Lewin, K., 1951. Field theory in social science: selected theoretical papers. In: Cartwright, D., (Ed.).

Partial hospital (PH) programs have been presented with the challenge of using limited resources to treat complex patients in very short time frames; yet predominant psychosocial models and evidence-based treatment approaches have not adjusted sufficiently to the combined demands of patient care and the new health care environment. An updated PH model can advance existing psychosocial theory and practice. The basic assumption of the model is that both clinical and organizational aspects of a PH program must be inherently adaptable to maintain consistent effectiveness. The set of fixed values described here are instrumental in establishing priorities, guiding decision making, and creating a proactive, flexible organization. These values are drawn from the history of psychosocial and milieu treatments from the 1930s to the present and from assumptions and practices of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and are augmented by insights from psychodynamic psychiatry, business management, and leadership. The PH treatment approach aims to translate evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatments into pragmatic interventions with emphases on psychoeducation and skills training. The context is brief treatment (i.e., one to two weeks) for mood, anxiety, and personality disordered patients in a private sector, managed care environment. Elements of this model may be generalized to inpatient, residential, and intensive outpatient programs, as well as to those that are starting up or being reorganized."}, {"Title": "Xerophthalmia secondary to alcohol-induced malnutrition.", "Abstract": "Xerophthalmia refers to the ocular manifestations associated with vitamin A deficiency.

Lower perfusion of rCBF could be seen in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of patients with depression, AD, schizophrenia, and VD. It seems that abnormality of the frontal lobe is more common in depression and schizophrenia, but temporal lobe abnormalities are more common in AD and VD. The perfusion of rCBF in the parietal lobe seems to be related to aging. Abnormalities in the occipital lobe and basal ganglia seem to be more associated with vascular problems. Thalamic dysfunction was mainly correlated with VD, and that of the cingulate largely with depression and schizophrenia. Hippocampal abnormalities were associated with AD.

Of these 268 people, 50% had been in contact with psychiatric services during the six-month period preceding the crime leading to forensic psychiatric assessment. Contacts with psychiatric services during the six-month period preceding the crime were significantly more common in three categories of individuals than others. These were: women, individuals who were diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder during the forensic psychiatric investigation, and individuals found to suffer from a serious mental disorder as defined in the legislation. Subjects who were found not to suffer from a serious mental disorder and were thus not eligible for special sanctions on medicolegal grounds had significantly less psychiatric contacts before the crime, as did subjects under 20 years of age. However, these two groups still had considerably more psychiatric contacts than the general population. The present results suggest that the patient category studied requires special monitoring and case management in general psychiatry in Sweden.

The care team developed the care pathway and the process of development and implementation was observed through action research. Cross-sectional indexing was used to analyse the data, and themes were developed using interview and observational data collection methods. Clinicians argued strongly for clear role boundaries but also defended their perceived control over health care from other professions. The findings indicate that designing a care pathway for people with schizophrenia may produce conflicting perceptions from the team. Conflict may arise through professions being unwilling to accept plurality over roles, which may hinder progress in meeting the needs of patients.

Original targets frequently fail, and when successful, may only be the opening volley in a series of ever more important therapeutic applications. Drug development may begin by hypothesis-driven targeting of therapeutic indications with an agent of known and novel mechanism of action. Although this may generate a highly feasible therapeutic indication and can proceed by a well-worn regulatory pathway with known approvable endpoints, it may not only be the least innovative but also the least commercially successful strategy. Because surrogate markers of efficacy are only theoretically attractive but still largely elusive for psychiatric disorders, drug development strategies may need to proceed instead by opportunistic capturing of signals from clinical use of new agents once they enter clinical practice. Outcomes and dosing for clinical trial populations may not match those in clinical practice, so observations from clinical practice must feed back into new clinical trials. In many ways, once efficacy is proven for the originally targeted indication, drug development begins afresh. To get to secondary stages of novel indications for psychiatric drugs and thus to maximize each drug's therapeutic potential, evidence-based prescribing is followed by prescribing-based evidence, namely feedback from clinical practice into clinical proof-of-concept studies followed by large-scale studies and new indications. In many cases, the new indications are the more important therapeutic contributions and the most successful commercial application of a drug. Here we describe this strategy of psychiatric drug development and provide numerous examples."}, {"Title": "Relation of emotional reactivity and regulation to childhood stuttering.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to examine relations between children's emotional reactivity, emotion regulation and stuttering.

Findings indicated that when compared to their normally fluent peers, CWS were significantly more reactive, significantly less able to regulate their emotions, and had significantly poorer attention regulation, even after controlling for gender, age, and language abilities. Findings suggest that the relatively greater emotional reactivity experienced by preschool children who stutter, together with their relative inability to flexibly control their attention and regulate the emotions they experience, may contribute to the difficulties these children have establishing reasonably fluent speech and language.\nThe reader should be able to (1) define emotional reactivity and emotion regulation, (2) explain how emotional reactivity and emotion regulation relate to preschool stuttering, and (3) understand recent empirical evidence linking reactivity and regulation to preschool stuttering."}, {"Title": "[Therapeutic drug monitoring in child and adolescent psychiatry--practical recommendations].", "Abstract": "The therapy of children and adolescents with psychotropic drugs differs from that of adults. Due to the differences in the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drugs used that are dependent on a child's, respectively an adolescent's stage of development, the same dosages as recommended for adults cannot be used. Moreover, many of the drugs used have not been approved for use in children and adolescents. Thus the criteria which guarantee their efficacy and safety for use in adults do not apply for their use in children and adolescents. Therefore therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a general indication for the administration of psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents. TDM enables the clinician to adjust the dosage of a drug according to the characteristics of the individual patient. It is also a valid tool to increase the safety of therapy and optimise therapy with psychotropic drugs. However, standardized studies are also needed to find therapeutic ranges of plasma concentrations for children and adolescents. Such studies will deliver new insights into the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviour of drugs used in child and adolescent psychiatry. The present contribution begins with a brief description of the strategy of TDM in psychiatry, followed by a discussion of the characteristics of pharmacotherapy in child and adolescent psychiatry and the reasons for the general indication of TDM in children and adolescents.

Aripiprazole was initiated at 15 mg/d with the option to adjust between 10-30 mg/d. The SC medication was specifically selected for each patient by the clinician and dosed according to prescribing guidelines for that medication. The primary effectiveness measure was the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of the aripiprazole group at study end point. Secondary measures included response rates and preference of medicine (POM) ratings by patients and caregivers.\nSixty-five percent of aripiprazole patients completed the study. The mean aripiprazole dose at end point was 19.9 mg/d, with approximately 39% of patients starting and remaining at 15 mg/d. At end point, the mean CGI-I score of 2.77 demonstrated that aripiprazole was minimally to moderately effective; the mean CGI-I score for the SC group was 3.59 indicating minimally effective to no change. Fifty-three percent of aripiprazole patients responded to treatment (CGI-I score of 1 or 2; last-observation-carried-forward [LOCF]), and approximately 71% of patients and caregivers rated aripiprazole as better than the prestudy medication on the POM (LOCF). Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) were similar to those reported in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled aripiprazole clinical trials. The most frequent AE in the aripiprazole group was insomnia (24%).\nAripiprazole was effective for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in a general psychiatry outpatient practice setting. Overall, aripiprazole was found to be effective by the treating clinician and well accepted by patients and caregivers over the 8-week treatment course."}, {"Title": "The adult psychiatrist's dilemma: psychostimulant use in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Children who have taken psychostimulants long term for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are now presenting at adult psychiatry clinics at an age at which bipolar disorder and schizophrenia may first appear and at which pregnancy is a possibility. Doctors who may have little experience in the management of ADHD or use of psychostimulants are faced with decisions on whether to continue or withdraw medication. A literature search conducted to clarify these issues revealed that, although psychostimulants are generally efficacious in ADHD, the risks of withdrawal reactions and of possible long-term effects such as drug addiction, psychosis and depression, or effects in pregnancy, have not been adequately investigated. In particular, there is little information on the effects of withdrawal and no firm guidelines on methods of psychostimulant discontinuation.

The most recent attempt at such a model, Engel's 'biopsychosocial model', has been shown to be devoid of any scientific content, meaning that psychiatry, alone among the medical disciplines, has no recognised scientific basis. It is no coincidence that psychiatry is constantly under attack from all quarters. In order to develop, the discipline requires an integrative and interactive model which can take account of both the mental and the physical dimensions of human life, yet still remain within the materialist scientific ethos. This paper proposes an entirely new model of mind based in Chalmers' 'interactive dualism' which satisfies those needs. It attributes the causation of all behaviour to mental life, but proposes a split in the nature of mentality such that mind becomes a composite function with two, profoundly different aspects. Causation is assigned to a fast, inaccessible cognitive realm operating within the brain machinery while conscious experience is seen as the outcome of a higher order level of brain processing. The particular value of this model is that it immediately offers a practical solution to the mind-brain problem in that, while all information-processing takes place in the mental realm, it is not in the same order of abstraction as perception. This leads to a model of rational interaction which acknowledges both psyche and soma. It can fill the gap left by the demise of Engel's empty 'biopsychosocial model'."}, {"Title": "A short history of neurosciences in Austria.", "Abstract": "Based on internal medicine and psychiatry and in close connection with pathology, the neurosciences in Austria began to develop in the 18(th) century, e.g. with the description of inflammation of the central nervous system by J.

Factor analysis divided 14 of the tasks into three categories characterized by the extent to which their performance requires integration of services: within the mental health system (for example, lead a multidisciplinary team), across social service systems (for example, interact with staff of supportive housing programs), and across institutions with different missions (for example, distinguish behavioral problems from underlying psychiatric disorders among prisoners). Preparation for tasks that involved integration of services across institutions was rated as least important, was least likely to be required, and was covered by less intensive teaching modalities. Tasks entailing integration within the mental health system were rated as most important, preparation was most likely to be required, and they were covered most intensively. Midway between these two categories, but significantly different from each, were tasks relying on integration across social service systems.\nTasks that involved integrating services across institutions with different missions were consistently downplayed in training. Yet the importance of such tasks is underscored by the assessments of the psychiatric leaders who were interviewed, the high valuation placed on this type of integration by a substantial subset of training directors, and the extent of mental illness among populations who are institutionalized in nonpsychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "Somatoform disorders: the role of consultation liaison psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The somatoform disorders are encountered commonly in both primary and secondary care. Despite their high incidence, few hospitals have teams with the expertise to manage this group of conditions. The lack of appropriate carers leads to inappropriate care, including increased numbers of admissions and investigations, to the detriment of the patients. The absence of appropriate care also increases the cost to the health services. Multidisciplinary Consultation Liaison (C-L) Psychiatry teams operate within non-psychiatric settings and are dedicated to the mental health care of patients presenting in these areas. Their unique skills and approaches offer support and education to these non-psychiatric teams and care to this group of patients. They are thus ideally placed to assess, diagnose and manage individuals presenting with somatoform disorders. Unfortunately, these teams are not widely available, largely because the current climate within psychiatry leads services to concentrate on what is defined as serious mental illness, a term usually used synonymously with psychotic disorders, despite the large number of people suffering from somatoform disorders and the cost of their care. The dislike that some colleagues have for this group of conditions may further hamper the creation of these services. In order to provide efficient assessment of and treatment for individuals with somatoform disorders, C-L Psychiatry teams must be created to lead clinical development, research and training in this discipline. These teams will also lead on the further research required."}, {"Title": "Somatoform disorders: perspectives from Pakistan.", "Abstract": "Somatoform disorders represent widespread and largely unsolved problems at the border between psychiatry and medicine. Patients with somatoform disorders often present difficult diagnostic and management problems. A series of three community-based epidemiological surveys of rural and urban populations in Pakistan found high prevalence of common mental disorders where the core presentations were somatic complaints. All the three epidemiological surveys used the Bradford Somatic Inventory (BSI), which was developed from symptom reports by psychiatric patients in Pakistan; these enquired about somatic symptoms in the local language, taking into account local cultural idioms of distress. At a conservative estimate, 66% of women and 25% men suffered from anxiety and depressive disorders whereby the complaints predominantly were somatic in nature. People in rural non-Western cultures are not psychologically minded and do not have abstract language or concepts of emotional distress and therefore communicate their emotions somatically. In Pakistan somatoform disorders possess a prominent diagnostic dilemma. The cornerstone of the management is a comprehensive medical, psychiatric and psychosocial evaluation of the patient. Patients with multiple somatic complaints not only present formidable management problems but also often have severe functional impairments that may outweigh those of patients with other so-called severe mental illnesses. Since somatoform disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders to present in non-psychiatric settings, it is important that training about them begin at undergraduate level. It should also be incorporated in the training of a wide variety of non-psychiatric specialists, both medical and non-medical."}, {"Title": "Complementary medicines in psychiatry: review of effectiveness and safety.", "Abstract": "The use of complementary medicines in those with mental health problems is well documented.

The introduction of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care settings provides an opportunity for providers to integrate treatment for opiate dependence into their practices. Buprenorphine maintenance therapy has been associated with reductions in opiate use, increased social stability, improved adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and lowered rates of injection drug use. We describe the following 4 models for the integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy into HIV care: (1) a primary care model, in which the highly active antiretroviral therapy-administering clinician also prescribes buprenorphine; (2) a model that relies on an on-site specialist in addiction medicine or psychiatry to prescribe the buprenorphine; (3) a hybrid model, in which an on-site specialist provides the induction (with or without stabilization phases) and the HIV care provider provides the maintenance phase; and (4) a drug treatment model that provides buprenorphine maintenance therapy services with HIV services in the substance abuse clinic setting. The key barriers against effective integration of buprenorphine maintenance therapy and primary HIV services are discussed, and we suggest several mechanisms to overcome such obstacles."}, {"Title": "When psychiatry and bioethics disagree about patient decision making capacity (DMC).", "Abstract": "The terms \"competency\" and \"decision making capacity\" (DMC) are often used interchangeably in the medical setting. Although competency is a legal determination made by judges, \"competency\" assessments are frequently requested of psychiatrists who are called to consult on hospitalised patients who refuse medical treatment. In these situations, the bioethicist is called to consult frequently as well, sometimes as a second opinion or \"tie breaker\". The psychiatric determination of competence, while a clinical phenomenon, is based primarily in legalism and can be quite different from the bioethics approach. This discrepancy highlights the difficulties that arise when a patient is found to be \"competent\" by psychiatry but lacking in DMC by bioethics. Using a case, this dilemma is explored and guidance for reconciling the opinions of two distinct clinical specialties is offered."}, {"Title": "Social psychiatry and public mental health: present situation and future objectives.

Causal treatment of cerebral pellagra by nicotinic acid and cerebral syphilis by penicillin in the first half of the 20th century led to major changes in the diagnostic distribution of psychiatric patients. In the second half of the 20th century with the introduction of a rapidly growing number of psychotropic drugs, pharmacotherapy became the primary form of treatment in mental illness. Psychiatrists today perceive neuropharmacology as one of the basic sciences of psychiatry and psychopharmacology as the bridge between the mode of action and the clinical indications of psychotropic drugs. Pharmacotherapy with psychotropic drugs focused attention on the differential responsiveness to the same drug within the same diagnostic category. Yet, instead of re-evaluating psychiatric nosology and conducting research in psychopathology, a statistical methodology was adopted for the demonstration of therapeutic effectiveness in pharmacologically heterogeneous populations. Employment of consensus-based classifications and psychiatric rating scales in the clinical development of psychotropic drugs led to semi-finished products, which are prescribed indiscriminately. Replacement of single-center clinical trials by multi-center centrally coordinated clinical investigations led to the control of education in pharmacotherapy by the pharmaceutical industry. To separate education from marketing, the identification of the treatment-responsive forms of illness and the delineation of the therapeutic profile of psychotropic drugs are proposed with the employment of a new methodology, the \"Composite Diagnostic Evaluation System.\" It is postulated that development of a pharmacologically valid psychiatric nosology with the employment of a \"nosologic matrix\" would provide the pharmaceutical industry with the necessary feedback to develop clinically selective drugs in mental illness and to break the impasse of progress in \"translational research\" in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "DCD and ADHD: a genetic study of their shared aetiology.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have found that rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are very similar, both being approximately 7% in sample populations [Kadesj\u00f6, B., & Gillberg, C.

The aim of the present investigation was to examine the extent to which the shared aetiology is due to common genetic factors to both disorders. We also investigated whether particular subtypes of each disorder were more linked than others. Mailed questionnaires were completed by parents (predominantly mothers) of 1285 twin pairs aged 5 and 16 years from the volunteer Australian Twin Registry (ATR). Included were a DSM-IV-based ADHD form, the alternative SWAN (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviour scale) and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ). Statistical analyses including structural equation modelling were carried out to explore the genetic factors of both disorders. The modelling showed a strong shared additive genetic component between most subtypes of ADHD and DCD to the subtypes of the other disorder. Analyses comparing the two ADHD measures showed an overlap of the symptoms captured by each measure but also significant differences. The DCD-fine motor and ADHD-Inattentive were most strongly linked using the DSM-IV based scale. On the SWAN scale the results were similar but the general coordination scale was also very strongly linked.

The exploration was motivated by the observation during visual peak detection that the AEP waveform was different in the patient group, although this was not reflected by the peak measures. The sample included un-medicated schizophrenia spectrum patients (n = 17) and healthy controls (n = 24). The patients had an attenuated difference P50. This attenuation was primarily seen in the sub-sample of patients with severe negative symptoms. The difference attenuation was due to low amplitude at the first stimulus.

The 'Patients' Perspective on Information Questionnaire' (PPIQ) scale was created and given to a volunteer sample of 86 psychiatric outpatients. The Client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ-8), assessing global satisfaction, was also completed to assess the convergent validity of the PPIQ-Satisfaction subscale. Internal consistency for the two PPIQ subscales (Information and Satisfaction) is excellent (alpha = 0.90 and 0.91). Convergent validity between the Satisfaction subscale and the CSQ is adequate (r = 0.5). The PPIQ reveals high importance ratings given to items such as 'side effects of medication' and 'confidentiality and access to chart'. Elevated satisfaction ratings are given to items from the conceptual category 'treatment information'. Dissatisfaction on the PPIQ is highest for components of 'information on service modality and organization'. The PPIQ appears to distinguish between information that is important to clients and their level of satisfaction with that information. Satisfaction on multiple components of information, such as treatment, service modality and organization, and clinical difficulties should be assessed to generate feedback to improve services."}, {"Title": "Further thoughts on the process of restraint.", "Abstract": "The physical restraint of a disturbed person is a subject constant of psychiatry and is a challenge that particularly faces nurses working in acute inpatient settings. While other approaches to psychiatric treatment have been discarded (e.g. punishment, blood letting, trepanation, deep insulin therapy and so on) or evolved into new treatments (the use of medication), the act of physical restraint has remained largely unmodified. Given the ubiquity of physical restraint in psychiatry, particularly as a nursing procedure, the absence of a sustained body of research is notable.

The material was analysed in a phenomenological perspective. The aim was to develop new and documented descriptions seen from the participants' point of view, interpreted within the framework of available knowledge about care for children and adolescents with psychiatric problems.\nThe general practitioner is in a good position to provide psychiatric care for these patients because of his or her unique knowledge about the families and the local communities. They have their patients' confidence and acquired skills from their unselected practice to recognise serious and abnormal conditions. The majority of the informants did not feel sufficiently skilled in order to treat more specific child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Some informants were actively involved in multidisciplinary networks concerning their young patients, while others were neither involved nor informed about it. In addition, local health and welfare services to a lesser extent involved these doctors. Because of this, children and adolescents who might have been assessed and treated in primary health care could be referred directly to specialists. A need for guidance and updating on relevant knowledge from the specialist health care was expressed. From the results we might assume that specialists might give some general practitioners the professional security needed in order to take on the role of medical co-coordinator of the multidisciplinary services to young patients with mental health problems."}, {"Title": "Pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is prevalent (2% in the general population, 20% among psychiatry in-patients) and has a major impact on health facilities as those affected often present in crisis but then make poor use of further attempts to help them.\nTo evaluate the effects of pharmacological interventions for people with borderline personality disorder.\nWe conducted a systematic search of 26 specialist and general bibliographic databases (October 2002) and searched relevant reference lists for further trials.\nWe included all randomised clinical trials comparing any psychoactive drugs with any other treatment for people with borderline personality disorder.\nWe independently selected, quality assessed and data extracted studies. For binary outcomes we calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR), its 95% confidence interval (CI), and where possible the number need to help/harm (NNT/H). For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. Non-skewed data from valid scales were synthesised using a weighted mean difference (WMD).\nWe found ten small (total n=554), short, randomised studies involving eight comparisons from which we could extract usable data. Studies comparing antidepressants with placebo were small (total n=79, 2 RCTs) but for ratings of anger fluoxetine may offer some improvement for those on antidepressant therapy over placebo (n=22, 1 RCT, RR anger not improved 0.30 CI 0.10 to 0.85, NNT 2 CI 2 to 9). The one small study investigating the important outcome of attempted suicide found no difference between mianserin and placebo (n=38, 1 RCT, RR 0.82 CI 0.44 to 1.54). Haloperidol may be better than antidepressants for symptoms of hostility and psychotism. There were few differences between MAOIs and placebo except that people given MAOIs were less hostile (n=62, 1 RCT, MD -9.19 CI -16.12 to -2.26). Although some ratings were statistically significant the comparison of MAOIs with antipsychotics did not show convincing differences. Antipsychotics may effect some mental state symptoms more effectively than placebo but results are difficult to interpret clinically and there is little evidence of advantage of one antipsychotic over another. Finally mood stabilisers such as divalporex may help mental state (n=16, 1 RCT, RR no improvement in mental state 0.58 CI 0.36 to 0.94, NNT 3 CI 2 to 17) but data are far from conclusive.\nPharmacological treatment of people with BPD is not based on good evidence from trials and it is arguable that future use of medication should be from within randomised trials.

Within a few years, the new drug had its breakthrough, which simply was based on worldwide therapeutical success and good empirical results. That already had happened about 10 years before Carlsson came up with the first plausible theory of neuroleptic function by formulating the dopamine hypothesis in 1963.

The present flourishing of circadian biology has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g. sleep-wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine)."}, {"Title": "Outcomes after supratherapeutic escitalopram ingestions.", "Abstract": "Escitalopram (ESC) is a new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used in the treatment of depression.

The information about 156 suicidents in Tallinn and 163 suicidents in Frankfurt was compiled using the psychological autopsy technique [Shneidman, E. S. (1981). The psychological autopsy. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 11, 325-340; Jacobs, D., & Klein-Benheim, M. (1995). The psychological autopsy: A useful tool for determining proximate causation in suicide cases. Bulletin of American Academy of Psychiatry Law, 23(2), 165-182]. General population controls were matched by age and sex. The occurrence of recent life events was similar among suicidents in Tallinn (81%) and Frankfurt (77%).

This may indicate that males are more sensitive to the rapid changes in a society undergoing transition. It seems that it is not the number of life events, but rather their meaning and disposition that creates the risk of suicide. Family discord (weighted OR=4.5; 95% CI=2.5-8.1), loss of job (weighted OR=2.6; 95% CI=1.0-6.4) and financial deterioration (weighted OR=2.2; 95% CI=1.3-3.8) were more prevalent among suicides in Tallinn in comparison with those in Frankfurt. The most significant differences between suicides and controls were family discord, separation and loss of job in Tallinn and somatic illness in Frankfurt. These differences between the two societies, post-Soviet Estonia and Germany, could be explained by the different positions of Estonia and Germany on the survival/self-expression dimensions recorded by the World Value Survey. People in Estonia tend to emphasize economic and physical security above all other goals, and feel threatened by the changes taking place in society. In Germany, good health is considered a necessity for a consumer and self-expressive style of life, and poor health is perceived as a serious threat to the quality of life in a post-materialistic value system."}, {"Title": "Emotional task-dependent low-frequency fluctuations and methylphenidate: Wavelet scaling analysis of 1/f-type fluctuations in fMRI of the cerebellar vermis.", "Abstract": "Ion channel currents, neural firing patterns, and brain BOLD signals display 1/f-type fluctuations or fractal properties in time.

Negative reactions to the notification letter or to the invitation to the IDANT were uncommon, still only half of the subjects in the PHRG participated in the study. However, as a consequence of the IDANT in 64% of the cases the GPs started new treatment, revised ongoing treatment, or referred the respondents.\nThough attitude towards psychiatry among GPs and participants was generally positive, response to the IDANT study was inadequate. Relatively few new cases were detected, yet the results indicate that the GPs altered their psychiatric care and practice markedly within the PHRG. Whether the educational programme had an impact on psychiatric services in the county in general cannot be answered in this study."}, {"Title": "Prognostic value of parent-adolescent disagreement in a referred sample.", "Abstract": "To investigate whether parent-adolescent disagreement regarding reports on adolescents' psychopathology indicates a poor prognosis.\nA total of 151 11- to 18-year-olds who had been assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) at referral to an outpatient psychiatry clinic were followed up. At follow-up, 4.3 years later, signs of poor outcome were assessed.\nDiscrepancies between CBCL and YSR scores predicted future disciplinary problems at school, police/judicial contacts, and drug use.\nTo determine the prognosis of psychopathology in adolescents who are referred to mental health services, discrepancies between parents and adolescents may be useful. Given the relatively large number of statistical comparisons (n = 16) that was needed to obtain these results, future studies are needed to test if the results are robust across different settings."}, {"Title": "Standardized remission criteria in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Recent work has focussed on schizophrenia as a 'deficit' state but little attention has been paid to defining illness plasticity in terms of symptomatic remission.\nA qualitative review of a recently proposed concept of remission [N.C. Andreasen, W.T. Carpenter Jr, J.M. Kane, R.A. Lasser, S.R. Marder, D.R. Weinberger (2005) Am J Psychiatry 162: 441] is presented.\nThe proposed definition of remission is conceptually viable, and can be easily implemented in clinical trials and clinical practice. Its increasing acceptance may reset expectations of treatment to a higher level, improve documentation of clinical status and facilitate dialogue on treatment expectations. The availability of validated outcome measures based on remission will enhance the conduct and reporting of clinical investigations, and could facilitate the design and interpretation of new studies on cognition and functional outcomes. While useful as a concept, it is important to consider that remission is distinct from recovery.\nThe introduction of standardized remission criteria may offer significant opportunities for clinical practice, health services research and clinical trials."}, {"Title": "Geriatric psychiatry consultations in a Turkish university hospital.", "Abstract": "The size of the elderly population is growing rapidly in Turkey.

Most referrals came from the Department of Internal Medicine (42.2%), with sleep problems (42.1%), depression (29.5%) and anxiety (28.3%) being the most common reasons for referral. Hypertension was the most frequent medical diagnosis (53.6%). The mean number +/- S.D.) of medications used by each patient was 4.4 +/- 2.0. The leading psychiatric diagnosis at the end of the assessment was adjustment disorder (31.3%).\nTurkish geriatric psychiatry consultation patients display similar characteristics to elderly patients from other western countries. The main difference comes from diagnosis of adjustment disorder, which may be related to hospital conditions and strong family ties in developing countries."}, {"Title": "Practical application of family and systems theory in old age psychiatry: three case reports.", "Abstract": "The role of the family or carer in old age psychiatry is well acknowledged. However, carer interventions are often focused on addressing carer burden alone and are usually individually rather than family based. Interpersonal conflict and family dynamics are rarely addressed. This is not surprising as there is a paucity of literature in family and systems theory applied to the older person, and clinicians are often skeptical about the efficacy of this treatment mode or daunted by the complexity of family and systems theory. Three cases are presented to illustrate the potential benefits of family-based interventions in the setting of commonly encountered clinical situations: (i) the treatment of chronically depressed older people in the community; (ii) the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in residential care; and (iii) home-based support and care of the older patient with dementia."}, {"Title": "Physical anhedonia in the acute phase of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The aim of the current study is to investigate the relationship between physical anhedonia and psychopathological parameters, pharmacological parameters or motor side-effects in a sample of inpatients with schizophrenia in an acute episode of their illness.\nEighty one patients with schizophrenia, consecutively admitted, with an acute episode of their illness, at the Eginition Hospital, Department of Psychiatry, University of Athens, during a one-year period were investigated regarding possible relationships between physical anhedonia, social-demographic data and clinical parameters as well as motor side-effects, induced by antipsychotic agents. All patients were assessed using the Chapman Revised Physical Anhedonia Scale (RPAS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Side-Effects (EPSE), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Simple cross tabulations were initially employed. Subsequently, multiple regression analysis was performed.\nBoth positive and negative symptoms were associated with physical anhedonia. A positive association between physical anhedonia and the non-paranoid sub-category of schizophrenia was also proved.\nAccording to these results, it seems that in the acute phase of schizophrenia, physical anhedonia may be a contributing factor to patient's psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Chronic dizziness: the interface between psychiatry and neuro-otology.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews the often-enigmatic relationships between dizziness and psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric causes of dizziness, neuro-otologic causes of anxiety, underrecognized co-morbid conditions, and medical illnesses that masquerade as 'psychogenic' dizziness are examined. Key clinical features and data from recent treatment trials are presented with potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.\nInvestigations at the interface between psychiatry and neuro-otology have identified the distinguishing features of several clinical conditions that present with non-vertiginous dizziness, subjective imbalance, and psychiatric symptoms. The most common condition is chronic subjective dizziness; a refinement of earlier concepts of psychogenic dizziness, phobic postural vertigo, and space-motion phobia. Chronic subjective dizziness is consistent with advancing research on anxiety and somatoform disorders and offers greater insights into the relationships between neuro-otologic illnesses and anxiety. Migraine, post-concussional syndrome, and dysautonomias also cause persistent dizziness and may be misdiagnosed or malingering or psychogenic dizziness because they often present with comorbid psychiatric symptoms in the absence of identifiable vestibular deficits.\nRecent research has defined the key features of several medical-psychiatric conditions that cause chronic dizziness, permitting greater diagnostic precision and insight into underlying pathophysiologic processes. Treatment studies have identified potentially effective interventions, which must be evaluated in controlled clinical trials."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive impairment in euthymic young adults with bipolar spectrum disorder and recurrent major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Patients with remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder have persistent impairments in executive function and verbal memory that may represent endophenotypic abnormalities.

Using information on 315 inpatients with schizophrenia, this study tested the hypothesis that some services promote more satisfaction than others. Relative to less satisfied counterparts, inpatients were more likely to approve of care if staff invested high levels of effort into education about: (1) control of symptoms with psychiatric medication, (2) adverse effects of stress on symptoms, and (3) social skills. Other services were appreciated less.

This neurotransmitter is involved in the control of movement and Parkinson's disease, the neurobiology and symptoms of schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is also considered an essential element in the brain reward system and in the action of many drugs of abuse. This evolution reflects the ability of several famous names in neuropharmacology, neurology and psychiatry to apply new techniques to ask and answer the right questions. There is now excellent knowledge about the metabolism of dopamine, dopamine receptor systems and the structural organisation of dopamine pathways in the brain. Less is known about the function of the different receptors and how the various dopamine pathways are organised to produce normal behaviour, which exhibits disruption in the disease states mentioned. In particular, we have very limited information as to why and how the dopamine system dies or becomes abnormal in Parkinson's disease or a neurodevelopmental disorder such as schizophrenia. Dopamine neurones account for less than 1% of the total neuronal population of the brain, but have a profound effect on function. The future challenge is to understand how dopamine is involved in the integration of information to produce a relevant response rather than to study dopamine in isolation from other transmission systems. This integrated approach should lead to greater understanding and improved treatment of diseases involving dopamine."}, {"Title": "Prescription errors in psychiatry - a multi-centre study.", "Abstract": "Medication errors are an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality, of which there have been few reports in psychiatry, especially in the UK. Our aim was to examine the nature, frequency and potential severity of prescribing errors in UK mental health units in a prospective, 1 week survey of errors detected by pharmacy staff in nine NHS trusts. Pharmacists checked 22036 prescription items. In total, 523 errors meeting the study definition were detected (2.4% of prescription items checked). Prescription writing errors (77.4%) were most common, while decision-making errors accounted for 22.6% of errors. In 280 (53.5%) cases the prescribed drug had been administered before the error was detected. Most errors were of doubtful or minor importance but 22 (4.3%) were deemed likely to result in serious adverse effects or death. The error detection rate varied fourfold between trusts. Prescribing errors are fairly common in psychiatry. A small proportion of errors have the potential for serious harm.

Blood alcohol concentrations are commonly approximated by measuring breath alcohol at triage. However, the blood-breath ratio is highly variable, and breath tests have produced lower readings than blood tests. The authors assessed the accuracy of breath alcohol readings at triage in a medical emergency department compared with subsequent serum alcohol levels taken in the psychiatric emergency service. The mean breath ethanol concentration was significantly lower than the mean corrected serum ethanol concentration (.15+/-.05 grams per 210 liters and .23+/-.05 grams per 100 milliliters, respectively). The relative accuracy of breath alcohol tests decreased with increasing serum alcohol. Although its low false-positive rate makes the breath test acceptable for legal purposes, the blood alcohol level is more appropriate for clinical use in emergency settings, because breath tests can underestimate the degree of toxicity."}, {"Title": "Best practices: An initiative to curtail the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy in a state psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "A performance improvement initiative was undertaken at a state psychiatric hospital to reduce antipsychotic polypharmacy. Data from physicians' order forms were used to document the prescribing practices of 14 psychiatrists in November 2001 and in August 2002. After baseline data were collected, the chief of psychiatry met with each psychiatrist to compare his or her prescribing data with data of anonymous peers. The chief also asked all psychiatrists to decrease antipsychotic polypharmacy by at least 10 percent. Antipsychotic polypharmacy fell significantly--from 42 percent of patients treated with antipsychotics in November 2001 to 31 percent in August 2002. Higher utilizers of polypharmacy at baseline continued to be high utilizers at follow-up. Less antipsychotic polypharmacy was not associated with more use of other psychotropic medications.

This paper documents the origins, functions, support, and contributions of private psychiatric hospitals from their beginnings in the eighteenth century through 2003. An interesting feature of nineteenth century psychiatry was the interplay between private and public institutions which reveals a pattern of the public purchase of private beds that is conceptually much like what we have today. From the early twentieth century through 1970, advancements in somatic treatments, new ways of using the hospital milieu, the introduction of antipsychotic medications, the shift from institution-based to noninstitution-based loci of acute and long-term treatment and care, the beginnings of day hospitals and a shortage of psychiatrists and nurses, all impacted upon the private psychiatric hospital. While the private psychiatric hospitals expanded in number and in responsibilities during these decades, at the end of the 1960's their future was a matter of serious debate. A comprehension of the history of the private psychiatric hospital since 1970 is based on an understanding of the impact of for-profit hospital chains, managed care, the privatization of traditionally public services, the requirement for \"treatment in the least restrictive alternative,\" further erosion of the use of any form of inpatient treatment, and an overall decrease in expenditures for mental health services. The future of the private psychiatric hospital may well be based on its ability both to maintain its traditional, patient-centered approach and to create innovative, effective, efficient, novel systems of care and treatment."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and race during World War II.", "Abstract": "Although the American literature on \"war neuroses\" expanded during World War II, psychiatrists remained more interested in dramatic instances of \"combat fatigue\" than in the problems of soldiers who broke down far from the field of battle. This bias in the medical literature shaped both diagnosis and treatment. It had an especially powerful effect on African American soldiers who, in the \"Jim Crow\" army of World War II, were assigned in disproportionate numbers to service units. When military neuropsychiatrists did write about troubled young African Americans, many revealed a racial conservatism that was surprising given the liberal environmentalist paradigm of the day. (Here, a particularly useful source is the two-volume history of Neuropsychiatry in World War II, produced by the Medical Department of the U.S. Army.) The major challenge to such views came from the National Medical Association (NMA). Despite its many criticisms of military medicine, the NMA argued that African American soldiers and veterans needed more, not fewer, psychiatric services. NMA members also joined their white counterparts in the campaign to diminish the stigma of mental illness, especially among the families of soldiers returning home.

The study was conducted from February to July 2004 in the outpatient drug user treatment center at University Department of Psychiatry at Innsbruck, providing maintenance treatment programs and detoxification in Tyrol, Austria. One hundred twenty opioid users seeking treatment were compared with 120 opioid-dependent patients retained for 6 months on a slow-release oral morphine, methadone, or sublingual buprenorphine maintenance program. The German version (\"Berlin Quality of Life Profile\") of the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile was used, and illicit opioid use was determined by urinalysis. Physical symptoms were measured by using the Opioid Withdrawal Scale. Urinalyses revealed a significantly lower consumption of cocaine and opioids in all three substitution groups than in patients at admission (p < 0.001 and p < or = 0.004, respectively). Both the buprenorphine and the methadone maintenance group showed significantly more favorable values than opioid clients at admission for stomach cramps (p < or = 0.002), muscular tension (p < or = 0.027), general pain (p < or = 0.001), feelings of coldness (p < or = 0.000), heart pounding (p < or = 0.008), runny eyes (p < or = 0.047), and aggressions (p < or = 0.009). Patients who received slow-release oral morphine treatment generally showed the least favorable QOL scores compared with patients at admission or sublingual buprenorphine and methadone clients. Patients in the sublingual buprenorphine or methadone program showed nearly the same QOL scores. The buprenorphine and the methadone maintenance group showed significantly more favorable values than opioid clients at admission regarding leisure time (p < or = 0.019), finances (p < or = 0.014), mental health (p < or = 0.010), and overall satisfaction (p < or = 0.010). Slow-release oral morphine is a well-established treatment for pain, but more research is required to evaluate it as a treatment for heroin dependence. The present data indicate that slow-release oral morphine could have some disadvantages compared with sublingual buprenorphine and methadone in QOL, physical symptoms, and additional consumption. The results further suggest that buprenorphine treatment is as effective as methadone in effects on quality of life and physical symptoms."}, {"Title": "An ethical framework for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry has not reached a consensus hitherto concerning an optimal theoretical framework for ethical decision-making and corresponding action. Various theories have been considered, but found wanting. Moreover, classic theories may contradict one another, contribute to confusion and immobilise the clinician. We have examined major theories commonly applied in bioethics, conferred with moral philosophers and psychiatrists and striven to apply more recent insights drawn from moral philosophy. We report that instead of pursuing a single theoretical framework, we should garner the strengths of compatible approaches in a synergistic way. We propose a particular complementarity of principlism--with its pragmatic focus on respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice--and care ethics, a variant of virtue theory, which highlights character traits pertinent to caring for vulnerable psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "The spectrum of informed consent in emergency psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "I evaluate the variation in requirements for informed consent in studies evaluating chemical tranquilization of agitated patients.\nA computer-assisted literature search of the National Library of Medicine was performed.

In India, few studies have attempted to directly determine the relationship between coping mechanisms and burden; in the West, studies have found that improved coping in family members can decrease the perceived burden.\nTo evaluate the burden and coping of caregivers in relation to the level of functioning in patients with chronic schizophrenia.\nThe sample was 100 patients with their primary caregivers attending a Psychiatry OPD. Patients were assessed on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale while caregivers were administered the Burden Assessment Schedule (BAS) and Mechanisms of Coping (MOC) scale.\nFatalism and problem-solving were the two most preferred ways of coping. Problem-focused coping, i.e. problem-solving and expressive-action decreased the burden of caregivers, while emotion-focused coping, i.e. fatalism and passivity, increased it. As the level of functioning of the patient decreased, the significance with which the coping mechanisms influenced the burden, increased. The use of problem-solving coping by caregivers showed a significant correlation with higher level of functioning in patients.\nCoping mechanisms such as problem-solving can decrease the burden of illness on caregivers and may even improve the level of functioning of patients."}, {"Title": "Between phr\u00e9n and psych\u00e9: Gabriele Buccola and his contribution to the birth of experimental psychology in Italy.", "Abstract": "The institution in 1880 of a laboratory of experimental psychology in the San Lazzaro Mental Hospital of Reggio Emilia, directed by Augusto Tamburini, marks a fundamental stage for the birth of scientific psychology in Italy. It was in this laboratory that the Sicilian psychiatrist Gabriele Buccola worked, carrying out reaction-time experiments in a broad and systematic way on \"sane\" and mentally ill individuals. In so doing, he was following Claude Bernard's lesson--which was advocated also by Comte, Taine, and Ribot, as in Italy by Livi and Tamburini-- according to which mental functions are to be studied in both normal and pathological conditions. With these experiments, Buccola highlighted the way in which reaction time is tied to \"attention,\" how it is altered by mental illness, and how there are various \"modifiers\" that influence the results. He also shows how the measurement of this \"time\" represents an important instrument for the differential diagnosis of several mental pathologies. Buccola's work, which is implemented in the first volume of experimental psychology written in Italy, demonstrates how psychology, which in the second half of the nineteenth century aspired to become an autonomous science, developed in Italy from the root of psychiatry, on the common ground of evolutionary positivism."}, {"Title": "When did \"scientific psychology\" begin in Russia?", "Abstract": "The pattern of the institutionalisation of psychology in Russia was as complex as in other countries. The institutionalisation was more than a single event or even a series of events: it was a manifold process that involved various actors, groups, and political parties, and took at least several decades. Psychology was taught within the subject of philosophy, but as a separate course, at high schools, from the early nineteenth century. When, in mid-century, philosophy was banned from universities for political reasons, logic and psychology still remained in the curriculum. Psychology became a contested area in the 1860s, with the rise of the radical movement that accompanied the abolition of serfdom and other reforms. The young radicals, or nihilists, favoured positive science and gave clear preference to physiology; at medical schools, psychology gradually became part of physiology and psychiatry teaching. Psychiatric clinics provided a venue for the first psychological experiments; the first courses in experimental psychology were also taught to psychiatry students. At the turn of the century, humanities departments joined in by opening laboratories and adding courses in experimental psychology to the philosophical psychology traditionally taught. Yet by 1917, the year when the monarchy ended in Russia, only two universities, in Moscow and Odessa, had succeeded in founding laboratories. The institutionalisation of psychology on a mass scale followed the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. The new communist regime facilitated the country's modernisation, and psychology became one of its instruments."}, {"Title": "The emergence of \"scientific\" psychology in Italy between positivist philosophy and psychiatric tradition.", "Abstract": "In Italy, the emergence of a psychology that can be considered \"scientific\" is not an event that can be easily ascribed to a precise date. It involves instead a general shift of ideas, gradual initiatives of a cultural and institutional nature, and new approaches to research, all of which together, in the course of the last thirty years of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century, form a \"critical mass\" that identifies psychology as an autonomous science, distinct from both philosophy and from neurophysiology and psychiatry. This event is embedded in--and favoured by--a matrix of positivist and evolutionist thought, which gives rise to the necessity and to the problem of confronting the study of mental phenomena with a \"positive method,\" and therefore of detaching such phenomena from their philosophical grounds in order to lead them within the sphere of science. Among the numerous elaborations upon this theme, the works that occupy a particularly prominent place are those of the positivist philosopher Roberto Ardig\u00f2 and of the anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi, who in view of their theoretical proposal of a \"new\" science of the mind are considered the precursors or pioneers of \"scientific\" psychology in Italy. The same positivist philosophical-cultural background simultaneously induced some psychiatrists to open their mental health centres to the first researches of a strictly psychological nature to be conducted with the experimental method. In this regard, a particularly important figure is that of Gabriele Buccola, who was especially dedicated to these investigations and was the first Italian scholar to approach in a systematic way experimental research on mental phenomena. Little by little, in the years bridging the two centuries, a second generation of scholars, for the most part psychiatrists by formation (among whom Ferrari, De Sanctis, Kiesow, and De Sarlo), began to hold lessons of experimental psychology in the universities, to open laboratories specifically dedicated to psychological research, to develop experimental investigations inspired by different models, and to draft the first applications of the discipline in the clinical, educational, labour, and judiciary fields. Considered as a whole, the numerous initiatives undertaken indicate clearly how in those years--and especially in 1905 when several very significant events took place simultaneously--a new psychological science was definitively born also in Italy."}, {"Title": "Practice patterns in pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry: a national survey.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this survey was to describe the current status of pediatric consultation-liaison (C-L) services in the United States.

At the beginning of his scientific career, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) joined Wilhelm Wundt's laboratory of experimental psychology at the University of Leipzig. Although Kraepelin was fired from his clinical position at the university's psychiatric hospital, he completed his habilitation, the German equivalent of Ph.D., and started a series of pharmacological investigations in healthy volunteers using common recreational drugs (alcohol, coffee, tea) or medicinal products (amyl nitrite, chloral hydrate, chloroform, ethyl ether, morphine, paraldehyde) together with innovative psychological tasks. This paper reviews Kraepelin's pharmacopsychological research and his methodological innovations, providing translations, for the first time, from original papers, his monograph On the Modulation of Simple Psychological Processes by Some Medicines and from other sources. Kraepelin's contributions to psychopharmacology and clinical neuropsychology were far ahead of his time and his conceptual achievements have been largely neglected by modern psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience."}, {"Title": "Combined linkage and association analyses of the 124-bp allele of marker D2S2944 with anxiety, depression, neuroticism and major depression.", "Abstract": "A central issue in psychiatric genetics is whether positive findings replicate.

Anorectic patients have a high sensitivity, over-evaluate the intensities of the odors but under-evaluate their pleasantness. Alcoholic/drug addicted patients showed impairments in identification.\nThis study does not identify inter-individual differences in olfactory perception.\nThe psychiatric diseases, here at hand although every one of them may be characterized by depressive components, show diverging impairments in olfactory perception. When variations in sensitivity are usually attributed to peripheral cues, impairments in emotional and cognitive aspects of olfaction are typically related to specific brain structures and processes which could be particularly involved in these diseases."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behaviour in national and international adult adoptees: a Swedish cohort study.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for suicidal behaviour in adolescent and young adult international adoptees.

Their high prevalence and preservation make it likely they have considerable evolutionary significance and in some way improve the chances of an individual's survival. The following article proposes that much of the anxiety and depression we experience is primarily acting as a negative reinforcer, encouraging socialisation. These feelings are experienced most intensely when we are isolated and have evolved to discourage this highly maladaptive behaviour, there being major advantages for being with other people. Particular problems are considered, including aspects of autism and alcohol and tranquilliser abuse.

In order to enrich the system that performs hospitable medical treatment and nursing cares standardized at the psychiatry acute term and to prevent chronic, critical path method was introduced into the acute term ward, then the investigation for nursing job satisfaction that was important to establish critical path method was conducted. By introducing critical path method, it became possible to assess the patients in standard, and the subject of business or a system became clear towards early discharge. It became possible to tie up this subject to a future improvement. Consequently, as for comparison of the patient who applied the schedule table of critical path method at the first and second term, the latter decreased the average length of hospitalization period significantly. The satisfaction of the task requirement, which was important to maintain systems, was decreased by the introduction of critical path method but the score of autonomy in satisfaction increased significantly by the improvement of usage of critical path method. From these, it was suggested that the introduction of critical path method in the acute-care unit psychiatry had possibility to aim at standardization of treatment and nursing and patients' early discharge from hospitals."}, {"Title": "A study of psychiatric nurses' beliefs and attitudes about work safety and assaults in Turkey.", "Abstract": "In Turkey, the cultural structure effects the gender roles in the society, and women are subject to violence in an intense manner both inside the family and in their workplaces. In nursing, which is still defined as a woman's job in our country, it is possible to encounter many aggressive and threatening behaviours. Knowing no geographical borders, aggression leads to dissatisfaction and alienation with the profession for the nurses working at the psychiatric institutions in Turkey, thus aggression is a significant health risk in physical, psychological and social dimensions. The research was carried out with 162 randomly selected nurses working in the psychiatric institutions in Istanbul using the Attitudes Toward Patient Physical Assault Questionnaire. It has been determined that nurses' rate of exposure to verbal/physical assault by the patients and their relatives is high and that they experience an intense uncertainty and conflict, especially in legal issues, and that the duration of working in the psychiatry clinics effects attitudes toward the assaults. It is concluded that the nurses working at the psychiatry clinics in Turkey are under risk in regards to safety and they need protection and support, both in emotional and in legal terms."}, {"Title": "Lee-Associator-a chaotic auto-associative network for progressive memory recalling.", "Abstract": "In the past few decades, neural networks have been extensively adopted in various applications ranging from simple synaptic memory coding to sophisticated pattern recognition problems such as scene analysis and robot vision. Moreover, current studies on neuroscience and physiology have reported that in a typical scene segmentation problem our major senses of perception (e.g. vision, olfaction, etc.) are highly chaotic and involved non-linear neural dynamics and oscillations. In this paper, the author proposes an innovative chaotic neural oscillator-namely the Lee-oscillator (Lee's Chaotic Neural Oscillator) to provide a chaotic neural coding and information processing scheme. To illustrate the capability of Lee-oscillators upon pattern association, a chaotic auto-associative network, namely Lee-Associator (Lee's Chaotic Auto-associator) is constructed. Different from classical auto-associators such as the celebrated Hopfield network, which provides time-independent and static pattern association scheme, the Lee-Associator provides a remarkable progressive memory association scheme (what the author called 'Progressive Memory Recalling Scheme, PMRS') during the chaotic memory association. This is exactly consistent with the latest research in psychiatry and perception psychology on dynamic memory recalling schemes, as well as the implications and analogues to human perception as illustrated by the remarkable Rubin-vase experiment on visual psychology."}, {"Title": "Rater bias in a blinded randomized placebo-controlled psychiatry trial.", "Abstract": "Rater bias occurs when rater knowledge of treatment assignment modifies the outcome assessment. Raters may be unconsciously influenced by inclinations for or against a particular treatment and consequently may give a more or less generous assessment depending upon these biases. Blinding of raters by keeping raters unaware of treatment assignment is one way to limit bias influencing assessment due to knowledge of treatment assignment. Unblinding may be particularly problematic in efficacy studies comparing placebo to drugs and/or non-drug psychotherapy treatments where subjects may reveal drug side-effects or mention their therapist by name, thus unblinding their treatment assignment. We present a new instrumental variable statistical approach for assessing the association between success in blinding and its impact on efficacy estimates of active drug and/or cognitive behavioural psychotherapy versus placebo in the multicentre comparative treatment study of panic disorder. Despite the uncertainty involved in assessing bias that may be unobserved and unconscious, we will show how to derive a bound for the impact of rater bias."}, {"Title": "Medicalizing melancholia: exploring profiles of psychiatric professionalization.", "Abstract": "The nineteenth century was the site of radical changes in understanding mental illness. The professionalization of psychiatry consisted primarily of the discipline's aspiration to the status of an expert medical subspecialty. While all forms of insanity were eventually reframed in medical terms, melancholia--for moral and nosological reasons--assumed a special role that made it an ideal diagnosis for conceptual reframing. Our analysis of the journal literature of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in North America and Germany traces several ways in which melancholia was medicalized. As the care for the insane shifted into the professional realm of physicians and medical terminology came to replace prior descriptors of mental illness, melancholia was replaced by depression. In addition, the process of delineating affective pathology assumed a distinctly medical flavor. Finally, melancholia was firmly medicalized when its boundaries blurred with neurasthenia. Differences in how ordinary affective terms became medicalized in German and North American psychiatry illustrate the importance of local historical approaches."}, {"Title": "Sharing decisions in consultations involving anti-psychotic medication: a qualitative study of psychiatrists' experiences.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, and in treating people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in particular, there are obstacles to achieving concordant, shared decision making and in building a co-operative therapeutic alliance where mutual honesty is the norm. Studies of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia have revealed critical views of medical authority, particularly over the issue of enforced compliance with antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists are known to place particular value on such medication. This qualitative study reports the views of 21 general adult psychiatrists working in UK about their experiences of consultations involving discussion of antipsychotic medication. Interviewees reported a general commitment to achieving concordant relationships with patients and described a number of strategies they used to promote this. In this respect, their self-perception differs from the picture of authoritarian practice painted by critics of psychiatry, and by some studies reporting patients' views. Interviewees also described obstacles to achieving concordance, including adverse judgements of patients' competence and honesty about their medication use. Explaining the adverse effects of medication was perceived to discourage some patients from accepting this treatment. Moments of strategic dishonesty were reported. Psychiatrists perceived that trust could be damaged by episodes of coercion, or by patients' perception of coercive powers. We conclude that a self-perception of patient-centredness may not preclude psychiatrists from fulfilling a social control function."}, {"Title": "What does the WHOQOL-Bref measure? Measurement overlap between quality of life and depressive symptomatology in chronic somatoform pain disorder.", "Abstract": "Quality of life has become an important outcome criterion for psychiatric interventions. Especially in chronic disorders with no complete recovery, the improvement of quality of life is an important treatment goal. Nevertheless, there are methodological problems in assessing quality of life. There is a possible measurement overlap between quality of life and psychopathology, especially depression, which may invalidate research results. This study addresses the quality of life of patients with chronic somatoform pain and its relation to depressive symptoms.\nOne hundred out-patients with somatoform pain disorder at the Behavioural Medicine Pain Clinic in the Department of Psychiatry of the Medical University of Vienna were diagnosed using the SCID for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV). The patients filled out the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment-Bref (WHOQOL-Bref) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Pain intensity (average pain, maximum pain, minimal pain) and disability (work, leisure and family life) were assessed using visual analogue scales.\nQuality of life in somatoform pain disorder was reduced compared to the norm population, especially in the physical and psychological domains. There were highly significant negative correlations between, on the one hand, depressive symptomatology (BDI) and, on the other hand, the physical quality of life domain (r=-0.655, p<0.01), the psychological domain (r=-0.735, p<0.01), the social domain (r=-0.511, p<0.01) and the environmental domain (r=-0.561, p<0.01). In all domains of the WHOQOL-Bref and in the global score, significant differences between the group of patients with severe or very severe depressive symptoms and the group with no or only mild depressive symptoms were found.\nWhile the WHOQOL-Bref showed a poor quality of life of patients with chronic somatoform pain disorder in general and especially in the physical and in the psychological domains, the high correlation of physical and psychological quality of life scores with depressive symptomatology points to a measurement overlap. It is suggested that assessment of subjective quality of life should always be checked for the influence of depressive symptomatology on the quality of life score."}, {"Title": "The factor structure of The Fear Survey Schedule for Children--II in Trinidadian children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Part of understanding normal and abnormal fear in children and adolescents is having knowledge of how they acquire fears and of how fears change across development.

We review findings concerning (a) the involvement of G proteins, in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders; (b) the importance of regulation of receptor-G protein coupling, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), beta-arrestins, to the pathophysiology of mood disorders and the mechanism of action of antidepressants. We relate to the special complexity of mental disorders with regards to etiology and pathophysiological diagnosis as well as to the strength and limitations of the 'pharmacological bridge' approach governing studies to unravel the etiology of mental disorders. There are presently no established and reliable, sensitive and specific objective biological diagnostic markers in psychiatry that can serve as 'gold standards'. The future achievement of an objective biochemical differential diagnostic system for major mental disorders that will also enable an objective biological treatment monitoring is expected to be revolutionary for psychiatry with a magnitude similar to the impact of the discovery of psychopharmacological treatments for mental disorders more than 50 years ago."}, {"Title": "Executive dysfunction, self, and ego pathology in schizophrenia: an exploratory study of neuropsychology and personality.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenic patients show a variety of symptoms, including positive and negative symptoms and ego pathology. Their exact underlying neuropsychological mechanisms as well as related changes in personality, however, remain unclear. We therefore conducted an exploratory study to investigate the relationship among neuropsychological functions, various dimensions in personality, and the different kinds of psychopathological symptoms. We investigated 22 paranoid schizophrenic patients and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls using a battery of neuropsychological, personality, and psychopathological tests and scales. Neuropsychological tests included executive function, working memory, and episodic memory, whereas personality assessment relied on the Temperament and Character Inventory by Cloninger (Arch Gen Psychiatry. 1987;44:573-88). Psychopathological rating included the scales for the assessment of positive and negative symptoms and the Ego Pathology Inventory by Scharfetter (Psychol Med. 1981;11(2):273-80). Schizophrenic patients showed significant deficits in executive function, working memory, and episodic memory. In contrast to healthy subjects, no significant correlation between working memory and executive function was observed in schizophrenic patients. Instead, both working memory and executive dysfunction were rather related to deficits in retrieval of episodic memory. Positive and negative symptoms correlated with episodic memory deficits but not with any dimension of the personality, whereas ego pathology, in contrast, correlated with executive dysfunction and working memory deficits. Moreover, schizophrenic patients showed specific changes in the self-dimensions of their personality, which correlated significantly with both executive dysfunction and ego pathology. Schizophrenic patients show deficits in working memory and executive function as well as functional dissociation between both. In contrast to positive and negative symptoms, ego pathology in these patients is specifically related to executive dysfunction and alterations in the self-dimension of their personality. It can therefore be concluded that ego pathology must be distinguished from positive and negative symptoms in both underlying neuropsychological dysfunction and predisposing changes in personality."}, {"Title": "Teamwork: the therapeutic alliance in pediatric pharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "All child psychiatrists' interactions with patients and families have important potential meanings, and the act of prescribing medication is no exception.

Implications for psychiatric nosology.", "Abstract": "It has been conventional for psychiatric research, including the search for predisposing genes, to proceed under the assumption that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are separate disease entities with different underlying etiologies. These represent Emil Kraepelin's traditional dichotomous classification of the so-called \"functional\" psychoses and form the basis of modern diagnostic practice. However, findings emerging from many fields of psychiatric research do not fit well with this model. In particular, the pattern of findings emerging from genetic studies shows increasing evidence for an overlap in genetic susceptibility across the traditional classification categories-including association findings at DAOA(G72), DTNBP1 (dysbindin), COMT, BDNF, DISC1, and NRG1. The emerging evidence suggests the possibility of relatively specific relationships between genotype and psychopathology. For example, DISC1 and NRG1 may confer susceptibility to a form of illness with mixed features of schizophrenia and mania. The elucidation of genotype-phenotype relationships is at an early stage, but current findings highlight the need to consider alternative approaches to classification and conceptualization for psychiatric research rather than continuing to rely heavily on the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy. As psychosis susceptibility genes are identified and characterized over the next few years, this will have a major impact on our understanding of disease pathophysiology and will lead to changes in classification and the clinical practice of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The role of philosophy in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Philosophy as a basic study for psychiatry is again attracting interest.

Previously, we demonstrated that approximately 60% loss of TH-IR axons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) decreases local basal and stress-evoked extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations, suggesting that moderate loss of DA axons in the mPFC is sufficient to alter the neurochemical activity of the remaining DA neurons (Neuroscience 93:497-505, 1999).\nTo further assess the functional consequences of partial mPFC DA depletion, we examined the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the rat mPFC on behavior in a T-maze delayed-response task. We also assessed whether chronic administration of the norepinephrine (NE) uptake inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), attenuates lesion-induced deficits in T-maze performance. Previous research indicates that inhibition of NE transport in the mPFC results in a concomitant increase in extracellular DA and NE.\nModerate loss of mPFC DA and NE (approximately 50 and 10% loss, respectively) was sufficient to impair delayed-response behavior, in part due to an increase in perseverative responding. Chronic DMI treatment (3 mg/kg delivered via osmotic pumps) impaired performance of control rats but attenuated the deficits in delayed-response behavior in rats previously sustaining loss of mPFC DA and NE (approximately 75 and 35% loss, respectively).\nThese data suggest that moderate loss of DA and NE in the prefrontal cortex is sufficient to impair cognitive function, and these behavioral effects are attenuated by inhibition of the NE transporter."}, {"Title": "Effects of clozapine plus lamotrigine on phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity.", "Abstract": "There is growing evidence from both uncontrolled and controlled clinical studies that lamotrigine (LTG) significantly augments clozapine (CLZ) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia (RS) [Dursun, S.M., McIntosh, D., Milliken, H., 1999.

Placebo-controlled trial of lamotrigine added to conventional and atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Biol. Psychiatry. 56, 441-446]. However, the precise mechanism of action of this synergistic augmentation between clozapine and lamotrigine remains unclear. Therefore, the goal of this research is to explore the mechanism of action of this synergistic interaction between CLZ and LTG, utilizing a pharmacological animal model of schizophrenia by using phencyclidine (PCP). The effects of CLZ plus LTG were assessed by measuring PCP-induced hyper-locomotion and stereotyped behaviours in rats. Adult male rats (250-300 g) were pre-treated via intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection with vehicle or drug 30 min before a PCP (5 mg/kg) or saline challenge. The behaviours were recorded and analysed for a 90-min period using the Etho Vision-computer based system. PCP produced hyper-locomotion, which was maximal at 30 min. LTG (10 mg/kg) significantly increased hyperlocomotion induced with PCP. However, a combination treatment of CLZ (5 mg/kg) plus LTG (10 mg/kg) significantly blocked the potentiation of PCP-induced hyper-locomotion observed with LTG (10 mg/kg) alone. Furthermore, the PCP-induced locomotion in the combination CLZ plus LTG-treated rats was significantly decreased when compared to vehicle. Therefore, LTG at doses that do not induce ataxia enhanced PCP-induced hyper-locomotion in rats, whereas the combination of LTG and CLZ significantly decreased PCP-induced hyper-locomotion consistent with clinical data."}, {"Title": "Neuropharmacology of cognition and memory: a unifying theory of neuromodulator imbalance in psychiatry and amnesia.", "Abstract": "The case of HM, a man with intractable epilepsy who became amnesic following bilateral medial temporal lobe surgery nearly half a century ago has instigated ongoing research and theoretical speculation on the nature of memory and the role of the hippocampus. Neuropsychological testing showed that although HM had extensive anterograde memory loss he could still acquire motor and cognitive skills implicitly, but could not remember the context of this learning. This has lead to declarative and procedural descriptions of the memory process. Cholinergic and monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems have also been implicated in the memory process and anticholinergic drugs traditionally have been associated with impairment of declarative memory. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is a classic example of an application of these neuropharmacological findings. In schizophrenia, preattentive deficits have been amply demonstrated by unconscious priming studies. Memory processes are also impaired in these patients. Dopamine, glutamate and even cholinergic dysfunction has been implicated in the clinical picture of schizophrenia. The present paper will attempt to bring together both the anatomical and pharmacological data from these disparate fields of research under a cohesive theory of cognition and memory. A hypothesis is presented for an inverse relationship between monoaminergic and cholinergic systems in the modulation of implicit (unconscious) and explicit (conscious) cognitive processes. It is postulated that muscarinic cholinergic receptors and monoaminergic systems facilitate unconscious and conscious processes, respectively, and they disfacilitate conscious and unconscious processes, respectively (the purported inverse relationship). In fact, the muscarinic and monoaminergic modulations of a neural network are proposed to be finely balanced such that, if, the activity of one receptor system is modified then this by necessity has effects on the other system. It takes into account receptor subtypes and their effects mediated through excitatory and inhibitory G-protein complexes. For example, m1/D2 and D1/m4 paired receptor subtypes, colocalized on separate neurons would have opposing functional effects. A theory is then presented that the critical underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia involves a hypofunctional muscarinic cholinergic system, which induces abnormal facilitation of monoaminergic subsystems such as dopamine (e.g., a decrease in m1R function would potentiate D2R function). This extends the idea of an inverted U function for optimal monoaminergic concentrations. Not only would this impair unconscious preattentive processes, but according to the hypothesis, explicit cognition as well including memory deficits and would underlie the mechanism of psychosis. Contrary to current thinking a different view is also presented for the role of the hippocampus in the memory process. It is postulated that long-term explicit memory traces in the neocortex are laid down by phasic coactivation of forebrain projecting monoaminergic systems above some basal firing rate, such as the rostral serotonergic raphe, which projects diffusely to the cortex and according to a modified Hebbian principle. This is the proposed principal function of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The phasic activation of the cholinergic basal forebrain is mediated by projections from a separate cortical structure, possibly the lateral prefrontal cortex. Phasic muscarinic receptor activation is proposed to strengthen implicit memory traces (at a synaptic level) in the neocortex. Thus, the latter are spared by medial temporal surgery explaining the dissociation of explicit from implicit memory."}, {"Title": "Defining subjects at risk for psychosis: a comparison of two approaches.", "Abstract": "The ability to detect individuals at high risk for developing schizophrenia before they express the disease will lead to targeted early intervention. It has been proposed that subjects at risk share a core deficit with people who already have schizophrenia. This includes cognitive impairment, affective symptoms, social isolation and decline in social functioning. In a sample of 104 help-seeking patients from a specialised outpatient clinic we investigated how well two different sets of criteria define the at-risk group and capture this core deficit. One set of criteria is the well-established ultra high-risk model of McGlashan et al. [McGlashan 2001 (SIPS) McGlashan, T. H., Miller, T. J., Woods, S. W., et al.

This social dominance and subordination model has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers. Microarrays were fabricated containing 45mer oligonucleotides spotted in quadruplicate and representing 1178 brain-associated genes. Dynamic range, discrimination power, accuracy and reproducibility were determined with standard mRNA \"spiking\" studies. Gene expression profiles in dominant and subordinate animals were compared using a \"universal\" reference design [Churchill GA (2002) Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays. Nat Genet 32 (Suppl):490-495]. Data were analyzed by significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores [Tusher VG, Tibshirani R, Chu G (2001) Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:5116-5121; van de Wiel MA (2004) Significance analysis of microarrays using rank scores. Kwantitatieve Methoden 71:25-37]. Ontological analyses were then performed using the GOMiner algorithm [Zeeberg BR, Feng W, Wang G, Wang MD, Fojo AT, Sunshine M, Narasimhan S, Kane DW, Reinhold WC, Lababidi S, Bussey KJ, Riss J, Barrett JC, Weinstein JN (2003) GoMiner: a resource for biological interpretation of genomic and proteomic data. Genome Biol 4(4):R28]. And finally, genes of special interest were further studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-two transcripts were statistically significantly differentially expressed in the neocortex between dominant and subordinate animals. Ontological analyses revealed that significant gene changes were clustered primarily into functional neurochemical pathways associated with protein biosynthesis and cytoskeletal dynamics. The most robust of these were the increased expression of interleukin-18, heat shock protein 27, beta3-tubulin, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 in subordinate animals. Interleukin-18 has been found to be over-expressed in human depression and panic disorder as well as other physiological stress paradigms [Takeuchi M, Okura T, Mori T, Akita K, Ohta T, Ikeda M, Ikegami H, Kurimoto M (1999) Intracellular production of interleukin-18 in human epithelial-like cell lines is enhanced by hyperosmotic stress in vitro. Cell Tissue Res 297(3):467-473] and heat shock proteins have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders [Iwamoto K, Kakiuchi C, Bundo M, Ikeda K, Kato T (2004) Molecular characterization of bipolar disorder by comparing gene expression profiles of postmortem brains of major mental disorders.

Our objective was to develop a standardized measure of spirituality for use in clinical research.\nWe characterized the core components of spirituality using narrative data from a purposive sample of people, some of whom were near the end of their lives. These data were developed into statements in a scale to measure strength of spiritual beliefs and its reliability, validity and factor structure were evaluated in order to reach a final version.\nThirty-nine people took part in the qualitative study to define the nature of spirituality in their lives. These data were used to construct a 47-item instrument that was evaluated in 372 people recruited in medical and non-medical settings. Analysis of these statements led to a 24-item version that was evaluated in a further sample of 284 people recruited in similar settings. The final 20-item questionnaire performed with high test-retest and internal reliability and measures spirituality across a broad religious and non-religious perspective.\nA measure of spiritual belief that is not limited to religious thought, may contribute to research in psychiatry and medicine."}, {"Title": "Delusions or obsessions: the same only different?

We computed 14 measures of the CoP: 5 measures of CoP trajectory over the support surface, 3 measures that estimated the area covered by the CoP, 1 measure that estimated the principal CoP sway direction, 1 measure that quantified the CoP total power, 1 measure that estimated the variability of CoP frequency content and 3 measures of characteristic CoP frequencies [L.

The five selected features were found to provide insight into the postural control mechanisms and to describe changes in postural strategies in the two groups of PD subjects, off and on levodopa. Thus, the five selected features may be recommended for use in clinical practice and in research, in the direction toward the definition of a standard protocol in quantitative posturography."}, {"Title": "The grant is what I eat: the politics of social security and disability in the post-apartheid South African state.", "Abstract": "In South Africa, disability grant allocation has been under review and tensions are evident in government rhetoric stressing welfare provision on the one hand, and encouraging 'rationalization' on the other.

The discovery of neurosteroids followed the revelation that the brain exhibited the capacity to synthesize its own steroids in situ and thus be a potential site of steroidogenesis. In contrast to some steroids that exhibit traditional genomic steroid actions, most neurosteroids appear to regulate neuronal function by means of \"non-genomic\" mechanisms influencing neuronal excitability. Neurosteroids are synthesized either from CNS cholesterol or from peripheral steroid precursors and exhibit a wide range of modulatory effects on neurotransmitter receptor activity, most notably at the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor. Neurosteroids play an important role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotective effects, many aspects of which may have particular applicability to psychiatric disorders including various gender differences. Neurosteroids appear to be relevant to the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of many psychiatric disorders including the most notable mood and anxiety disorders, but also psychotic, childhood, eating, dementia, stress and postpartum disorders. It has been suggested that neurosteroids may become potential targets for pharmacological intervention in the future with further neurosteroid investigation contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and psychopathology."}, {"Title": "[How does recruit successfully recruit staff?

In this metaphorical rendering, psychiatry has swung back and forth between extremes of emphasis on psyche (life events and inner conflict ruling etiological thinking, talk therapy dominating treatment) and soma (biochemical sources dominating etiological thinking, somatic treatments dominating treatment). This article argues that, while this metaphor is suited to capturing certain aspects of American psychiatric history, it distorts others by, for example, exaggerating the extent of dogmatism on either side and obscuring continuities in psychiatry's history. The article looks specifically at the reception by psychoanalysts to the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy. It shows that psychoanalytic views of ECT were diverse and more receptive to ECT than the pendulum metaphor might lead us to believe."}, {"Title": "The challenge of psychiatric comorbidity to the public services for drug dependence in Italy: A national survey.", "Abstract": "We evaluated the availability of resources and specific expertise for treating comorbidity at the Italian public Services for Drug Dependence (SerTs).

Maggots were selectively associated with the disgusting juice, pit bull terriers with the harm-related shock, and rabbits with nothing. Spiders were associated with both aversive UCSs, but significantly stronger in the high fear group.

These authors proposed their methodology based on the simplest cross-sectional case in which both the surrogate and the true endpoint are continuous and normally distributed. Different variations to this theme have been implemented for binary responses, times to event, combinations of binary and continuous endpoints, etc. However, a drawback of this methodology is that different settings have led to different definitions to quantify the association at the individual-level. In the longitudinal setting; Alonso et al. defined a class of canonical correlation functions that can be used to study surrogacy at the trial and individual-level. In the present work, we propose a new approach to evaluate surrogacy in the repeated measurements framework, we also show the connection between this proposal and the previous ones reported in the literature.

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of typical neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics as add-on therapy to mood stabilizers. A total of 119 episodes of consecutively admitted patients with ICD-10-defined acute mania (n=106) or hypomania (n=13) were included in a retrospective analysis. Two subgroups were separated out of the whole patient sample according to the medication used: (a) mood stabilizer+typical neuroleptic (n=27) and (b) mood stabilizer+atypical antipsychotic (n=39). The treatment patterns of both subgroups during the first 14 d of in-patient treatment were evaluated. The therapeutic effect was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). Both patient groups showed no differences on CGI at admission. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics showed a significantly greater clinical improvement after 14 d (p<0.005) and on discharge (p<0.05) than patients treated with typical neuroleptics. Furthermore, patients treated with atypical antipsychotics developed significantly less extrapyramidal side-effects (p<0.01) and were significantly treated less often with benzodiazepines (p<0.05) during the first 14 d compared to the group receiving typical neuroleptics.

It is asserted that this milieu is the most important factor in shaping scientific theorizing. Some examples are cited: the rejection of the evidence that the world orbits around the sun (suspected by Pythagoras) in favor of centuries-long firm adherence to the Ptolemaic geocentric system; the early acceptance of Natural Selection in spite of its tautological essence and only conjectural supporting evidence, because it justified contemporaneous social-political ideologies as typified by, e.g., Spencer and Malthus. Economic, social, and cultural factors are cited as providing the ground, i.e., ideational substrate, for what is cited as the Discreetness-Chance Paradigm (DCP), that has increasingly dominated physics, biology, and medicine for over a century and which invokes small, discrete packets of energy/matter (quanta, genes, microorganisms, aberrant cells) functioning within an environment of statistical, not determined, causality. There is speculation on a possible paradigmatic shift from the DCP, which has fostered the proliferation, parallel with (\"splitting\") taxonomy, of alleged individual disease entities, their diagnoses, and, when available, their specific remedies, something particularly prominent in, e.g., psychiatry's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, a codified compendium of alleged mental and behavioral disorders, but evident in any textbook of diagnosis and treatment of physical ailments. This presumed paradigm shift may be reflected in Western medicine, presently increasingly empirical and atomized, towards a growing acceptance of a more generalized, subject-oriented, approach to health and disease, a non-material-based system of energy flow dependent only on vitality, not anatomy; and a more cohesive, integrative patient-centered approach to therapy."}, {"Title": "WAIS-III General Ability Index in neuropsychiatry and forensic psychiatry inpatient samples.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the WAIS-III General Ability Index (GAI) in a sample of 33 neuropsychiatry inpatients and 47 forensic psychiatry inpatients.

Gender-related issues are particularly relevant in the debate about mixed versus segregated sex wards, yet while the appropriateness of mixed-sex wards is questioned in Great Britain this is not the case in Germany. To investigate attitudes of psychiatric staff towards both patient gender and mixed versus segregated sex wards, we conducted a case study using focus groups with members of professional teams. We evaluated the transition process from two single-sex wards to two mixed-sex wards in a 330-bed psychiatric hospital in a rural area in south Germany. Staff described female patients as more externally oriented, motivating of others, demanding, and even sexually aggressive. Male patients, on the other hand, were described as more quiet, modest, or lazy. Furthermore, participants described the mixing process as a positive development whereas they did not see a need for gender-separated wards in order to protect vulnerable female patients. Some gender descriptions by professionals are \"reversed\" in comparison with gender stereotypes supposed to be present in wider society.

It will be shown that satisfying scientific reasons cannot be given for a general and practicable definition either of health or of disease. This is possible only for a specific concept of disease that can be assessed by a diagnosis. However, even such a specific term may be ambiguous, particularly in psychiatry, for which it is of central importance how and what the patient communicates of his experiences. The reason lies in different ways of assessing: the physician describes phenomena of the patient that are controllable by standardisation, the patient ascribes his own experience uncontrollably individually. Moreover, the moment of appeal in the ascriptive mode indicates a call from the specific need for the help of others, of the community.

To further investigate the mechanisms of response inhibition, this paradigm was applied to 11 healthy young adults. To better distinguish response-inhibition-related activity from early attentional effects, a \"Stop-Signal-Irrelevant\" condition was added, in which subjects performed the task while ignoring the Stop Signals. In the Stop-Signal-Relevant condition, the right frontal N200 to the Stop Signals was larger for Successful inhibition (SI) than for Failed inhibition (FI) trials. The timing and distribution of this effect was strikingly similar to that of the right-frontal ADHD deficit reported in Pliszka et al. (2000), supporting this activity being related to successful normal inhibitory control processes. In contrast, a posterior N200 was larger for Stop-Relevant than for Stop-Irrelevant trials, likely reflecting enhanced early sensory attention to the Stop Signals when relevant. Two longer-latency failure-specific ERP effects were also observed: a greater frontopolar negative wave (370-450 ms) to Failed than Successful inhibitions, and a greater parietal positive slow wave (450-650 ms) for Failed inhibitions than ignore-stop trials, likely reflecting differential recruitment of error detection and correction mechanisms following Failed attempts to inhibit a response."}, {"Title": "[Differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and depression. A case report of Addison's disease in a female patient].", "Abstract": "Similar symptoms make the differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and Addison's disease difficult at times: vomiting, weight loss, hypotension, depressed mood, reduced drive, and increased irritability can occur in both disorders. Psychological factors are then frequently presumed to be causative, so that the diagnosis of Addison's disease is made only years after the onset of the disease. Against this background, our case report presents important differential features, particularly with regard to consultative psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Borderline personality-bipolar spectrum relationship.", "Abstract": "The relationship between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorders, especially bipolar-II disorder (BP-II), is unclear. Several reviews on the topic have come to opposite conclusions, i.e., that BPD is a bipolar spectrum disorder or instead that it is unrelated to bipolar disorders. Study aim was to find which items of BPD were related to BP-II, and which instead had no relationship with BP-II.\nAn outpatient psychiatry private practice, more representative of mood disorders usually seen in clinical practice in Italy. INTERVIEWER: A senior clinical and mood disorder research psychiatrist.\nA consecutive sample of 138 BP-II and 71 major depressive disorder (MDD) remitted outpatients. ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS: The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Clinician Version (SCID-CV) was used for diagnosing, the SCID-II Personality Questionnaire was used by patients to self-assess borderline personality traits. Interview methods: Patients were interviewed with the SCID-CV to diagnose BP-II and MDD. The questions of the Personality Questionnaire relative to borderline personality were self-assessed by patients. As clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning was not assessed by the questionnaire, a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder could not be made, but borderline personality traits (BPT) could be assessed (i.e., all DSM-IV BPD items but not the impairment criterion).\nBPT items were significantly more common in BP-II versus MDD. The best combination of sensitivity and specificity for predicting BP-II was found by using a cutoff number of BPT items > or =5: specificity was 71.4%, sensitivity was 45.9%. BPT (defined by > or =5 items) was present in 29.5% of MDD and in 46.3% of BP-II (p=0.019). Logistic regression of BP-II versus BPT items number found a significant association. Principal component factor analysis of BPT items found two orthogonal factors: \"affective instability\" including unstable mood, unstable interpersonal relationships, unstable self-image, chronic emptiness, and anger, and \"impulsivity\" including impulsivity, suicidal behavior, avoidance of abandonment, and paranoid ideation. \"Affective instability\" was associated with BP-II (p=0.010), but \"impulsivity\" was not associated with BP-II (p=0.193). Interitem correlation was low. There was no significant correlation between the two factors.\nStudy findings suggest that DSM-IV BPD may mix two sets of unrelated items: an affective instability dimension related to BP-II, and an impulsivity dimension not related to BP-II, which may explain the opposite conclusions of several reviews. A subtyping of BPD according to these dimensions is supported by the study findings."}, {"Title": "Social determinants of diagnostic labels in depression.", "Abstract": "The role of diagnostic labels in medicine is usually that of labelling an illness as a means of communication. Control over labelling processes in medicine is ordinarily imposed via medical schools, textbooks, education or by diagnostic manuals. Diagnostic labels often change following new discoveries in underlying pathology such as 'consumption' being relabelled as 'TB' or 'cancer'. Sub-types of broad diagnostic labels also often emerge from such discoveries e.g. 'lung cancer' or 'throat cancer'. In mental health, underlying pathology is the subject of ongoing debate spanning ideas including the brain as a faulty organ, faulty genetics and environmental problems. With controversy over pathology comes controversy over labels and the idea that labels may be used not just for communication, but as devices of social and professional control, arising out of a social process. This study explores the codification of the diagnostic label 'depression' which emerged in the twentieth-century and has proliferated with numerous sub-types over the last 40 years. The aim is to examine its social determinants and context. Medline is used as a data source for professional label usage. A range of depression sub-type labels in professional use was identified. This exercise revealed many official and 'unofficial' terms in professional use. Citation rate plots by year were then generated for these depression sub-type labels. The rise and fall of different labels are examined in relation to social determinants and context, including publication of diagnostic manuals DSM and ICD, power shifts in psychiatry, the discovery of psychiatric drugs and the shift from inpatient to community care. Exploring the changing use of official and unofficial labels over time in this way provides a novel historical perspective on the concept of depression in the late twentieth-century."}, {"Title": "[Effects of a shared decision making model in psychiatric and neurologic practice].", "Abstract": "Involving patients in medical decisions is increasingly being advocated in medical fields other than psychiatry and neurology. A model of shared decision making might prove to be an ideal way of bridging the gap between patient-centred and evidence-based medicine. This report provides a survey of this shared decision making model and a discussion of its implications in the fields of mental health and neurology."}, {"Title": "[Patients in forensic and general psychiatry. Do risk assessment measures detect differing risks of future violence?].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the potential for future violent behaviour comparing patients recruited from forensic and general psychiatric wards in Germany.\nFifty patients were recruited from a forensic hospital and 29 from a general psychiatric hospital. In the weeks preceding discharge, structured assessments of the future risk of violent behaviour were completed using the HCR-20.\nThere was little difference in the risk presented by the two groups. Forensic patients presented an elevated risk of violence because of historical factors, while the risk among patients from general psychiatry was due to clinical symptoms.\nSome criminal offences could be prevented if more time and effort were spent in general psychiatric practice in identifying patients at high risk for violence and in reducing symptoms of psychoses before discharge."}, {"Title": "[Clinical pathways in psychiatry and psychotherapy].", "Abstract": "Implementing evidence-based clinical guidelines by means of clinical pathways is one of the key elements of continuous quality management at the University Hospital of Marburg. This paper explains how clinical pathways for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were developed.\nBased upon a review of existing guidelines and literature, optimal standards of care were defined. Step-by-step analysis of the process of care and results of a questionnaire were used to describe the actual processes. A problem-orientated comparison of the actual and the optimal process of care was the basis for developing these pathways. A consensus was achieved with all persons involved in the respective process of care taking into consideration local resources as well as barriers. The most important decisions and interventions were defined and presented as a patient-oriented process.\nThe lack of explicit \"how to do it\"-recommendations of the guidelines for the entire care processes required specific, locally tailored adaptations. Potentials for improvement were identified in the following areas: transfer of patients, consultation, information and coordination within the team, and diagnosis of suicide risk. The pathways include care-oriented algorithms, checklists and assignments of responsibility.\nThe development of clinical pathways as part of quality management and transsectoral integrated care in psychiatry and psychotherapy is feasible. The concept presented incorporates the potential of increasing transparency, efficiency and efficacy of care, and of improving satisfaction of those involved. It offers psychiatric hospitals the chance to guarantee optimal quality of care in face of increasing workload and costs."}, {"Title": "The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire: changes during psychological treatment of social phobia.", "Abstract": "Thirty-nine individuals completed 12 weekly group sessions of psychological therapy for social phobia (social anxiety disorder). Before and after treatment, participants filled out the Tridimensional Personality Questionnnaire (TPQ, [Cloninger C.R., 1987a. A systematic method for clinical description and classification of personality variants. Archives of General Psychiatry, 44, 573-58]) and measures of social anxiety and depression. Treatment led to a significant reduction in social anxiety, depression, harm avoidance, and reward dependence. However, only pre-post changes in harm avoidance and depression were significantly correlated with pre-post changes in social anxiety. These results suggest that harm avoidance shows state-dependent changes during the course of treatment for social phobia. The implications of these findings for the trait/state distinction of the TPQ scales are discussed."}, {"Title": "[Migrant patients in forensic psychiatry. An epidemiological survey from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg].", "Abstract": "The treatment of mentally ill migrants is being increasingly discussed in general psychiatry and psychotherapy. Most studies show that this group under-utilizes the mental health system. This first epidemiological survey of the German forensic system shows a higher percentage of migrant patients than in the general population. Reasons for this development are discussed. In clinical practice, the migrant patients require special therapeutic and pedagogic options including specific legal advice."}]
