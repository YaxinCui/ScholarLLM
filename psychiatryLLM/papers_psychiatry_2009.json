[{"Title": "Transplant psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Transplant units increasingly recognise a need for assistance from psychiatrists and psychologists in the assessment and management of potential transplant recipients and live donors. This arises from the various known associations between mental disorder and the need for transplantation; the intensifying requirement to select carefully among the potential recipients and donors of scarce human organs; and the drive to maximise transplant outcomes by optimising all aspects of treatment after surgery. There is good evidence that careful, protocol-guided selection among potential candidates for transplantation with alcoholic liver disease helps ensure outcomes at least as good as for other forms of liver disease. The evidence base in other areas is less robust, but the principles guiding the psychiatric assessment are broadly the same. There is an increasing need for psychiatric assessment of potential live organ donors, in order to minimise the risks they run, and in the case of altruistic donation this is now mandatory in UK law."}, {"Title": "Cardiac risk assessment before the use of stimulant medications in children and youth.", "Abstract": "Regulatory decisions and scientific statements regarding the management of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) raise questions about the safety of medications and the appropriate pretreatment evaluation to determine suitability for treatment with medication. This is particularly true in the setting of known structural or functional heart disease. The present paper reviews the available data, including peer-reviewed literature, data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Web site on reported adverse reactions in children using stimulant medication, and Health Canada data on the same problem. A consensus-based guideline on appropriate assessment is provided, based on input from members of the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, with specific expertise and knowledge in the areas of both ADHD and paediatric cardiology. The present statement advocates a thorough history and physical examination before starting stimulant medications, with an emphasis on the identification of risk factors for sudden death, but does not routinely recommend electrocardiographic screening or cardiac sub-specialist consultation unless indicated by history or physical examination findings. A checklist for identifying children who are potentially at risk of sudden death (independent of ADHD or medications used to treat it) is provided. Although recommendations are based on the best evidence currently available, the committee further agrees that more research on this subject is necessary to optimize the approach to this common clinical scenario."}, {"Title": "[Common paths of psychiatry and forensic medicine--history and evolution of insanity defense concept from antiquity to modern times].", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry and psychology were in their beginnings inseparably associated with the forensic medicine, constituting one of its related branches of knowledge. Progress and development of these disciplines, education and the practical application for the purposes of the law were a contribution of a several generations of forensic pathologists in the 19th and 20th centuries. One of the major issues of common interest was opinionating on the sanity of offenders. However, the problem of criminal responsibility of the mentally ill perpetrators dates back to much earlier times and has its roots in the distant beginnings of human civilization. In this paper, the history and evolution of the insanity concept (as a circumstance excluding the guilt of the offender) were presented, from the oldest theories to ideas underlying modern codifications."}, {"Title": "Treating the whole child: An interview with Scott Shannon, MD.

Time-out has been little described and almost completely unstudied.\nTo assess the relationship of seclusion and time-out to conflict behaviors, the use of containment methods, service environment, physical environment, patient routines, staff characteristics, and staff group variables. Data from a multivariate cross-sectional study of 136 acute psychiatric wards in England were used to conduct this analysis.\nSeclusion is used infrequently on English acute psychiatric wards (0.05 incidents per day), whereas time-out use was more frequent (0.31 incidents per day). Usage of seclusion was strongly associated with the availability of a seclusion room. Seclusion was associated with aggression, alcohol use, absconding, and medication refusal, whereas time-out was associated with these and other more minor conflict behaviors. Both were associated with the giving of \"as required\" medication, coerced intramuscular medication, and manual restraint. Relationships with exit security for the ward were also found.\nGiven its low usage rate, the scope for seclusion reduction in English acute psychiatry may be small. Seclusion reduction initiatives need to take a wider range of factors into account. Some substitution of seclusion with time-out may be possible, but a rigorous trial is required to establish this. The safety of intoxicated patients in seclusion requires more attention."}, {"Title": "Detached concern of forensic mental health nurses in therapeutic relationships with patients the application of the early recognition method related to detached concern.", "Abstract": "Improvement of the interaction between forensic mental health nurses and patients may lead to a reduction of inpatient violence. The concept under study is detached concern, which refers to nurses' skills to neutralize the emotional appeal of patients by a balanced attitude between objectivity and emotional involvement. The Patient Contact Questionnaire (PCQ) aims at measuring the degree of concern of nurses for their patients.\nThe PCQ was applied in a pretest-posttest design, evaluating the effects of the Early Recognition Method (ERM). This method aims at the prevention of inpatient violence in forensic psychiatry. Subjects were 116 forensic mental heath nurses working on 16 wards of a large Dutch forensic hospital. First, the baseline scores were compared to scores reported in an earlier study conducted in general psychiatry. Second, pretest-posttest comparisons were carried out for all nurses, and for subgroups of nurses with regard to gender, educational level, years of working experience, and patient population. Third, pretest-posttest comparisons were made on the PCQ item level.\nThe baseline scores of male nurses indicated significantly higher levels of concern than those of female nurses. In addition, more experienced nurses scored significantly higher with regard to concern than less experienced nurses. When comparing the scores before and after applying ERM, no significant differences were found. However, the sores of female nurses showed a tendency toward more concern after implementation of ERM.\nDetached concern may be a meaningful concept in forensic mental health nursing in measuring nurses' concern for their patients. Levels of detached concern did not change significantly after application of ERM. However, the application of the PCQ could contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between nurses and their patients."}, {"Title": "Consultation liaison psychiatry at Nepal Medical College and Teaching Hospital.", "Abstract": "The authors reviewed the all referral cases from different inpatient and outpatient department, in Nepal Medical College and Teaching Hospital.

However, despite increasing use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents, their endocrine and metabolic side-effects (weight gain, obesity, and related metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycaemia and dyslipidemia) are of particular concern, especially within this paediatric population that appears to be at greater risk as compared with adults for antipsychotic-induced metabolic adverse effects. In addition to medication, many factors contribute to weigh gain in psychiatric patients, including sedentary lifestyle and poor diet. Excessive weigh gain has several deleterious effects in psychiatric patients, including stigmatization and further social withdrawal, and non compliance with medication. Furthermore, excessive corpulence may evolve to a metabolic syndrome with a high-risk state for future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult age. Because youths are still developing at the time of psychotropic drug exposure, in a context of physiological changes in hormonal and endocrines levels and body composition, most reference values need to be adjusted for gender, age and growth charts. Hence, sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores are crucial to assess weight gain in children and adolescents.\nObesity thresholds have been proposed to define \"at risk\" categories of patients. In recently issued guidelines, thresholds for antipsychotic-induced weight gain in adults have been set at a 5% increase or one point increase in BMI unit. To date, no definition has reached a consensus in childhood and adolescence. However, some at risk states requiring action are proposed in literature: more than 5% increase in weight within a three-month period; more than half a point increase in BMI Z score; between 85th and 95th BMI percentile plus one adverse health consequence (i.e. hyperglycaemia, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, or orthopaedic, gallbladder, or sleep disorder); or more than 95th BMI percentile or abdominal obesity (i.e. abdominal circumference above 90th percentile). As a matter of fact, numerous studies that have assessed weight gain during antipsychotic treatment are clearly limited, either because of their short duration (a few weeks), or because of their methodology: indeed, only weight gain is generally reported as an assessment tool. Merely noting an increase in body weight over time does not in itself signify a problem, and may underscore the importance of excessive corpulence growth as compared with controls. Adjusted BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores were calculated in only a few studies.\nThis pilot study focuses on the metabolic effects of risperidone in children and adolescents up to 16 years of age. This study is part of a larger, regional study on metabolic side effects of antipsychotic medication in adults, promoted by the university hospital centre in Lille, France.\nPatients included in the study were referred to our department of child and adolescent psychiatry for EOS (K-SADS). They had received no antipsychotic treatment prior to their inclusion. Weight, height, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and BMI Z scores, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting triglyceride levels, fasting total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose level were measured at M0, M3, and M6. BMI, sex- and age-related BMI percentiles and adjusted BMI Z scores were obtained from tables and calculator (www.kidsnutrition.org).\nTwenty-six children and adolescents (21 males, five females) aged 7 to 15.5 years (mean=12.9 years, sd=2.3) were included. They all received a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-aged children (K-SADS). They all received risperidone from 1mg/day to a maximum of 6 mg/day. Statistical analysis principally shows a significant link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and six-months increases of BMI (increase of 4.7 kg/m(2), p<0.0001), sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentile (increase of 29.3 points, p<0.0025), and BMI Z scores (increase of 1.1 point, p<0.0001). No patient showed metabolic syndrome, but one girl presented with a 1g/l increase of fasting total cholesterol at two-months.\nDespite the limited number of children included, our results confirm a strong link between prescription of risperidone in EOS and risk of obesity. Clinicians and caregivers need to be aware of the potential endocrine and metabolic adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics, and systematically ask for family history of metabolic disorder, life style, diet and habits. With adolescents, the sole monitoring of weight gain, and even of BMI, underestimates the gain of corpulence. One methodological implication of our study is that adjusted BMI Z scores are the best-suited measure to assess long-term drug-induced weight gain in comparison to developmental changes.\nAlternative treatment should be considered in some cases. Other antipsychotics, like aripiprazole, may have a better benefit/risk ratio and then may be prescribed as a first prescription or as a switch. Associations of antipsychotics may also be of interest but we lack controlled studies in children and adolescents. In some cases, alternative treatments like repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS) may be required. Their efficacy and their place in the therapeutic strategy of pharmacoresistant schizophrenia in children and adolescents have to be assessed in regard to metabolic and blood side effects of clozapine."}, {"Title": "[Machado de Assis and psychiatry: a chapter in the relations between art and clinical practice in Brazil].", "Abstract": "Madness, its place in society, and the tenuous boundaries separating it from reason became a constant concern in Machado deAssis' literary production as of 1880, when a shift can be observed in his work.

A general practitioners' postal survey in the north-west region of France].", "Abstract": "Depression is a quite common condition, and its treatment is mainly provided by General Practitioner (GP). It is already known that detection and treatment requires significant improvement. The well known and high consumption of antidepressant drugs in France, the highest of all other European countries, requires specific studies. The causes of this situation are not clear and seem to be numerous: Patient's demands, social claims; lack of initial and continuous medical education, bad GP demographic trends, and lack of them in rural areas; pharmaceutical company pressure; and organisation of the health care system. GP are the main medical actors of the primary care system in France. The aim of this study was to survey GP perceptions on secondary care services, seek the views and barriers to the provision of good services, and ask them about perceptions and solutions they could suggest.\nA structured postal questionnaire was sent to all GP of the north-west region of France, asking physicians about obstacles perceived when taking care of depressive patients; factors influencing the use of services, specialised advice, treatments, access to psychiatrists and psychological care. Their psychiatric knowledge and demographic data were also assessed. Quantitative data were analysed using Epi-Info software, and qualitative data were transcribed and coded manually.\nA total of 25% of the GP returned the questionnaire (n=2097 in 8709). The sample profile was the same as the studied population. Less than a third of the GP (28%) were aware of the clinical guidelines on depression, and less than a fifth (18%) had clinical experience of psychiatry during their studies. Lack of time was not the main obstacle assessed by the GP. Their complaints were about lack of mental health services, difficulty in accessing services, and about general liaison between primary and secondary health care services: they reported difficulties obtaining quick and good response from the specialist either for emergency or non emergency cases. Regarding secondary care, they mainly referred to the psychiatrist, rather than to the psychologist, probably because this second option is not reimbursed by the social security system. Not surprisingly, medication was cited as the most frequently used treatment, followed by psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and almost never self help literature and self help groups. Trained GP considered they were much more comfortable coping with depressed patients, less frequently using secondary care providers, and easily alternative solutions rather than antidepressant drugs. This situation suggests the usefulness of medical education, and is attested by many qualitative answers.\nIt is not sure that the low rate of knowledge of the guidelines should be judged only as a lack of professionalism. According to the \"French Society of Primary Care\", clinical guidelines need updating, and it is known that those available could be useful only for half of the situations encountered in primary care. Operational propositions urgently need to be proposed. Recent questioning of the real interest of pharmaceutical options in the treatment of depression is another argument. Nor can we wait for a hypothetic rise in the demographic situation. The GP have several propositions to improve these problems, e.g. continuous medical education (CME) focusing on \"patient centred therapy\", dedicated hotline or circuit for depressed people, and an adapted sociomedical directory. They also feel that political awareness about lack of physicians is required, but say that improving quality of care does not rely only on improving demographics. They ask for funds for psychological care. When thinking about the circuit of care, the role of all care providers, and their communication, a global vision appears unavoidable, which would get rid of the divisions between out-patients and the hospital.\nDespite an unavoidable questioning on the dysfunctions of the health care system, quality of care and probably pharmaceutical consumption for the depressed patient might be improved by simple tools, such as adapted CME for primary care physicians, and communication improvement between secondary and primary care systems."}, {"Title": "[Descriptive study of suicidal adolescents conducted in Abidjan].", "Abstract": "The answer to the various problems encountered during adolescence is experienced in the form of behavioural thoughts and/or action expressed in conduct.

Because of the obligation for the doctors to perform an evaluation of their professional practices, a proposition to use a method presented by the High Authority of Health was looked for. Considering the necessity of favoring the exchanges between team members, the articulation of two methods was proposed: a morbidity mortality review (MMR) and an analysis of the detailed causes. The objective of the MMR is to analyze the deaths of certain predetermined morbid accidents within a service. The aim of the MMR is to highlight actions for improvement. The analysis of the causes allows the professionals to list all the causes of the problem identified, without limiting themselves to the immediate causes. In this case, a simple method was chosen: the Ishikawa diagram (or fishbone diagram, or also cause-and-effect diagram).\nA specific Ishikawa diagram for suicide was created by the coordinating physician and was proposed to the team. In the term of the first MMR, the tool was improved by the collective clinical experience and served as support of analysis for the studied events. Three cases related to the evaluation were prepared beforehand by the referent doctor and later presented by him in MMR sessions. For each case, approximately a dozen of professionals were invited to fill in the biography of the patient. A discussion was then engaged by the external doctor on the circumstances of self injuries or suicide attempts. The three detailed analyses of cases were transcribed into a virgin Ishikawa diagram. Furthermore, several points were discussed on the safety aspects (diversion of the possessions with suicidal aim, and importance of the \"almost incident\") and on the interest in exchanging on the current and\\or local professional practices (exchange on tools possibly used in the other psychiatric health establishments; favor the training). The actions of improvement put in perspective mainly concerned the professional practices. In this particular case, the awareness of professional knowledge was the most sought by the ancillary medical members of the team.\nWe observed an important investment of the team, as far as the MMR bases are concerned, on a shared clinical method. The participants easily got to grips with the tool. The initiation with the MMR tool was time consuming, in particular for the doctor coordinating the project and the referent doctor of the department (30 hours). The exchanges also permitted the assessment of the competence of each professional present, and the common priorities were fast identified and focused on sharing the professional practices. The intervention of an external speaker (doctor, qualitician or other) seems important since it favors the emergence of questionings in the team.\nWhen faced with unwanted events such as suicides or suicide attempts, the MMR method allows the care teams to have time to ponder, listen and argument. What is learnt from dealing with unexpected events should enable the collective development of the capacity to react with the right reflexes when a surprising situation occurs. The RMM should find a place in the systems of clinical risk management, as a supplement to the declaration of the incidence. The results make it possible to anticipate on the use of the MMR in other thematic studies or issues of risk management."}, {"Title": "[Consultative psychiatry examinations of patients--review of twelve months retrospective follow up].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric svymptoms in hospitalized somatic patients are not rare in practice, and therefore consultative psychiatric examinations are an important part of the treatment of patients in non-psychiatric departments.

The aim of the research was to determine the wards at which psychiatric consultations were the most frequent as well as the prevalence of psychiatric disorders.\nThe research included 887 patients hospitalized at the clinics of the Clinical Centre Nis, examined by consultant psychiatrists during the twelve month period. The research instrument was medical documentation (files of psychiatrist-consultants after the completed consultation).\nThe greatest number of psychiatric consultations was made at the Endocrinology Clinic, followed by the Neurology Clinic and the Surgery Clinic, and then at the Clinic for Cardiovascular Diseases. Most diagnoses were syndromological-descriptive, which entailed a relatively high percentage of multiple diagnoses. The most frequent diagnostic groups were chronic and acute psycho-organic syndromes, which cause a bad compliance and can lead to difficulties during somatic examination, intervention or pharmacological treatment. Immediately following are mental disorders due to the use of psychoactive substances, situational reactions and suicide attempts.

In spite of the influence of Byzantine medicine, its rationality in the interpretation of lycanthropy was forgotten in medieval and Renaissance times when it was replaced by explanations based on demonic possession and witchcraft.

The views of homosexuality held by the psychiatrists, and the main treatment strategies adopted (categorized as hospitalization, suppression, reorientation/'cure', and adjustment) are surveyed and illustrated from particular cases. The Edinburgh experience is also compared with perceptions and practices relating to the treatment of homosexual problems in Glasgow. It is concluded that psychiatrists at the JNH adopted a cautious, ad hoc approach to therapy, reflecting both ideological and resource constraints and an attachment to taxonomies of deviance rooted in established notions of sexual pathology."}, {"Title": "[Exhausted literature. The emergence of the new in Samuel Beckett's novels and plays].", "Abstract": "The article investigates literary subjectivity in some texts by Samuel Beckett. The article proceeds by relating the ways of how narration and speech acts constitute literary subjectivity to the problems of subjectivity that scientific investigations deal with. While successful self-regulation of the organism nourishes the roots of subjectivity, i.e., the habits, subjectivity decomposes in states of exhaustion, when self-regulation breaks down. As soon as a certain threshold is transgressed, fatigue sets in, alters the personality and eventually leads to exhaustion--a state, which psychiatrists compare to mental illness. Notwithstanding the different explanations given, scientists agreed about the effects of exhaustion. According to their investigations, the decomposition of personality by exhaustion generally does not involve apathy, withdrawal from activity or termination of movements, but rather mere action. Similarly, in Beckett's novels and plays exhaustion is much more than tiredness, as French philosopher Gilles Deleuze observed. For Beckett, exhaustion is rather the model for both literary innovation and a new concept of subjectivity, which he explores on the basis of a detailed knowledge of physiology, psychology, and psychiatry, but using his own literary means. The exhausted subject is beyond any calculus of activity. It will perform an activity even if he or she makes mistakes or loses control, and will thus act in an unpredictable way. This unpredictable action is not an exception in the continuation of the habits, but rather points to the moment when a new subjectivity emerges. Such new subjectivity suraces in Beckett's novels and plays in forms of literary innovation."}, {"Title": "[Information for patients about hospital infections in psychiatry: An assessment of healthcare professionals' knowledge, opinion and attitude].", "Abstract": "French legislation makes mandatory for healthcare providers the disclosure of hospital infection (HI) risk and actual occurrence to the patient. Given the specific diseases encountered in psychiatry, some difficulties may be expected in practical application of this regulation.\nThe aim of our study was to describe the knowledge, declared practices and opinions of healthcare workers (HCW) in psychiatry concerning information for patients about HI.\nWe randomly selected doctors, nurses and head nurses from four hospitals with psychiatric activity in Normandy. The HCW were asked to self-complete an anonymous questionnaire, including data describing the responding HCW and questions aiming at describing his/her knowledge, attitude in routine daily practice and opinion about information to patients about HI.\nOne hundred and forty-one HCW were initially selected, of which 114 (80.9%) eventually agreed to complete the questionnaire. Only eight HCW (7.0%) were considered to have a correct overall knowledge of legal obligations. Main errors concerned the obligation to inform the patient of the HI risk according to the medical procedures that are to be performed (43.9% of correct answers) and the obligation to inform the patient of the HI risk according to his/her medical condition (46.5%). The obligation to inform the patient of the occurrence of a HI was largely known (84.2%). HCW usually giving information about the risk of HI to patients without HI accounted for 5.3%. Main reasons advocated for not informing patients were a low level risk of HI in psychiatry (80.4%) and the lack of patients' demand (59.8%). In the case of HI occurrence, the percentage of HCW routinely informing patients was 13.2%. HCW systematically informing the patient's family about the occurrence of HI accounted for 9.6%. A large proportion of HCW supported delivering information to patients about HI (86.0%). HCW expected from information better approval of prevention programs by the patients (87.7%) but feared an increased anxiety in patients (75.4%) and a higher rate of care refusal (48.2%).\nWhereas a very large proportion of HCW in psychiatry support delivering information to patients about HI, our study shows HCW's lack of awareness of regulations and lack of declared practices. Among factors explaining this contrast, a lower perceived HI risk and severity level are to be mentioned. Training programs focusing on risk and mechanisms of HI could be offered to professionals in psychiatry. The issue of specific communication difficulties with psychiatric patients should be addressed as well. In order to develop information on HI, specific methods suited to those patients should be developed."}, {"Title": "[Rethink the panic disorder].", "Abstract": "We propose some reflexions on the validity of the conceptualization of panic disorder, its nosographical place, and its clinical homogeneity, through the study of the frequency of some of its psychiatric comorbidities.\nTo define a panic attack, DSM IV requires a number of symptoms which vary from four to 13. However, some patients suffer from panic attacks with less than four symptoms (paucisymptomatic attacks) and which fill the other criteria of panic disorder. These patients would have a biological vulnerability, familial antecedents, and a treatment response which are similar to those that fill the criteria of the panic attack according to the DSM. Some authors differentiate the panic disorder in several sub-groups, such as the panic disorder with cardiorespiratory symptoms, or vestibular symptoms, or cognitive symptoms. This division of the panic disorder in several sub-groups would have an interest in the knowledge of the etiopathogeny, the attacks' frequency, the disorder severity and the treatment response. Panic disorder with prevalent somatic expression includes crises without cognitive symptoms. This sub-type can be common in the medical context, especially in cardiology, but it is often ignored, at the price of loss of socio-professional adaptability, and a medical overconsumption.\nThe relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia appears to be the subject of controversies. According to the behavioral theory, phobic disorder is the primum movens of the sequence of appearance of the disorders. American psychiatry considers agoraphobia as a secondary response to the panic disorder, and pleads for a central role of panic attacks as an etiopathogenic factor in the development of agoraphobia. The distinction between panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder can be difficult. This is due to the existence of paucisymptomatic panic attacks. Their paroxystic nature is difficult to distinguish from the fluctuations of the generalized anxiety disorder. This frequent comorbidity could be also due to the community of certain symptoms of each disorder. These observations increase the validity of the anxiety generalized disorder as an autonomous morbid entity, rather than corresponding to a residual syndrome of the panic disorder, and could be an argument of an implicit return to the Freudian concept of the anxiety neurosis. The frequent comorbidity of panic disorder and personality disorders suggests the existence of a link. The pathological personality can be a factor of vulnerability in the panic disorder, as it can be a consequence of the panic disorder through the personality changing related on the evolution of the disorder and its complications. The relationship between panic disorder and depression has been interpreted in various ways, with mainly three assumptions: the unit position, which considers anxiety and depression as concerning a common diathesis; the dualistic position, which suggests that anxiety and depression are heterogeneous diagnostic categories and the anxio-depressive position that considers anxiety and depression combined as a syndrome differing from the pure anxiety and pure depression. The genetic studies, as well as the family studies, clearly show that the two entities are undissociated. Likewise, the therapeutic action of serotoninergic antidepressants in the two types of disorders reinforces the idea of a common biological vulnerability between anxiety and depression. Several studies have shown a significant association between panic disorder and suicide. However, the suicidal conducts are multiple and proceed by complex interactions between factors of features and states.

The current study aims at providing empirical data supporting an innovative solution: the provision of a self-help treatment manual. The samples consists of 33 adults (24 females, 9 males) aged between 20 and 59 and all suffering from pathological fear of heights. After participating in an experimental study, participants received a self-help manual to treat their acrophobia on their own. The severity of their claustrophobia was measured before and six months after participants were instructed on how to use the self-help book as a compensatory measure for their participation. Data also suggests that the participants were satisfied with the help provided in the self-treatment manual and that this is perceived in a positive way. To sum up, this study is not an outcome study for a new form of therapy; it simply offers researchers data supporting the use of an alternative compensatory measure. Indeed, using a self-help book represents an interesting solution."}, {"Title": "Systematic reviews to support evidence-based psychiatry: what about schizophrenia?", "Abstract": "To assess whether systematic reviews (SRs), the gold standard for scientific research, can offer valuable support in evidence-based psychiatry in the treatment of schizophrenia.\nWe used three database services (Ovid, PubMed and Cochrane) to identify SRs related to schizophrenia, found 163 reviews and grouped them by topic. We then evaluated each study's conclusions and divided them into three groups based on results (ranging from certain to null conclusions).\nSRs of pharmacological treatments represented 59% of the studies sampled, only 23% of which had reached certain conclusions. Other clinical topics were less frequently represented and had achieved lower degrees of certainty.\nOnly 40 SRs (22 studies investigating pharmacological treatment) provided clear-cut answers to clinical questions examined.

Neurology consultations requested by other services in in-patients are performed through intrahospital consultations. This study aims to make a descriptive study of the intrahospital consultations (IHC) requests received by a Neurology service. Material and methods. We conducted a retrospective study of the requests for consultations received in the Neurology Service in the Hospital Universitario Cl\u00ednico San Carlos in Madrid during the year 2007. The following endpoints were analyzed: number of consultations, number of visits made, date, delay in attention, specialties involved, syndromic diagnosis, final diagnosis and complementary tests requested. Results. A total of 390 intrahospital consultations corresponding to 351 patients were made. Total number of visits was 687. Internal Medicine was the specialty making the most requests with 31%, followed by Psychiatry (13.4 %) and Oncology (8 %). The most frequent syndromic diagnoses were neurological deficit (31.6%), seizures (18.2%) and awareness level disturbance (11.7%). The most frequent final diagnoses were epilepsy (19.9 %), cerebrovascular disease (15%) and movement disorders (10.5 %). Complementary tests were requested for 37% of the patients, the most common ones being cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging, Head CT and EEG. Conclusions. Because of its complexity and care load, intrahospital consultation should be considered an independent unit in the organization of a neurological service. As it involves a significant number of patients, it should be subject to evaluation and quality improvement programs."}, {"Title": "Incidence and correlates of delirium in a West African mental health clinic.", "Abstract": "To determine the incidence of delirium in those patients presenting to a psychiatric clinic in Nigeria and to examine if any demographic or clinical variables were correlated with this diagnosis.\nA prospective survey design; 264 consecutive new referrals to a psychiatric clinic in Nigeria were assessed for the presence of delirium using a standardised diagnostic scale.

No demographic variable was significant regarding the presence or absence of delirium. With regard to clinical variables duration of current symptoms, referral source and the presence of comorbid physical illness were significantly associated with the presence of delirium. Most delirium was due to infections.

Currently, the person whom the application for legal incapacitation involves, has to be examined by a psychiatry or neurology expert, as well as psychologist (553 par. 1), while par. 2 determines in details the scope of assessment, which should be in a forensic opinion, and doubtlessly they are in competency of the psychiatrist, similarly as moving a proposal of necessity of observation.\n1.

The study was based on a specially devised questionnaire, administered to doctors in June and July 2009. Responses from 184 psychiatry specialists were obtained during the conference \"Psychiatry 2009\" held in Krak6w, whereas the remaining respondents were questioned at their workplaces. The questionnaire consisted of ten questions concerning various aspects of somatic health, control of health parameters and effects of pharmacological treatment on the condition of schizophrenic patients.\nThe majority (73.05%) of the respondents were found to consider the somatic condition of their patients as important or very important. In the opinion of 70.54% of the physicians, metabolic disturbances were the most significant aspect of somatic health. Doctors in private practice paid more attention to sexual and endocrine system dysfunctions than those employed in hospital wards. Most psychiatrists performed physical examinations and checked laboratory parameters \"almost on every visit\".\nThe questioned physicians appreciate the importance of somatic condition assessment in schizophrenic patients and check the important laboratory parameters regularly. Taking into account the essence of the problem, establishing closer cooperation in this area with first-contact physicians should be considered.

Hughlings Jackson's formulation of a neurological science consisted of an axiomatic basis, an experimental methodology, and a clinical neurophysiology. His axiom--that the brain is an exclusively sensorimotor machine--separated neurology from psychiatry and established a rigorous and sophisticated structure for the brain and mind. Hughlings Jackson's experimental method utilized the focal lesion as a probe of brain function and created an evolutionary structure of somatotopic representation to explain clinical neurophysiology. His scientific theory of cerebral localization can be described as a weighted ordinal representation. Hughlings Jackson's theory of weighted ordinal representation forms the scientific basis for modern neurology. Though this science is utilized daily by every neurologist and forms the basis of neuroscience, the consequences of Hughlings Jackson's ideas are still not generally appreciated. For example, they imply the intrinsic inconsistency of some modern fields of neuroscience and neurology. Thus, \"cognitive imaging\" and the \"neurology of art\"--two topics of modern interest--are fundamentally oxymoronic according to the science of cerebral localization.

Moreover, diagnosis criteria only exist for adult psychiatry, and there are no therapeutic guidelines. The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 14-year-old girl presenting an overlap between psychogenic and neuroleptic induced catatonia, acute treatment and ten year's follow-up.\nA 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state.\nThe etiopathogenic diagnosis is problematic. Some indices in the familial history may suggest a traumatic event. But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Kleine-Levin syndrome: a case report].", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to report an original clinical case whose symptoms suggest a very peculiar pathology, because of its rarity, symptomatic expression and unclear etiopathogenesis: the Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS). During the regression of tonsillitis concomitant with an emotional shock, the 15-year-old patient exhibited a dramatic change in behaviour, at odds with his previous state, and accompanied by hypersomnia and confusion, megaphagia, irritability, hypersexuality and mood disorders. We observed a spontaneous and total regression of the symptoms after 12 days, except for the incomplete amnesia that proved to be persistent. Four months later, further to an ethylic drunkenness, the patient presented with a new and similar episode. The patient benefited from no medicinal treatment, even in the course of hypersomnia episodes and asymptomatic periods. After a clinical presentation of this patient, we will consider this case study from a more psychopathological angle by questioning the existence of a facilitating psychological profile. The discovery of an IQ equal to 86 from the scores of WISC-IV, and the identification of constructive visual difficulties made us suspect neurological disorders, but these abnormalities were not found during the completion of the Rey Complex Figure Test. The personality profile issued from the scores at the MMPI-A assessment was ranked as barely significant (type 2-4): indeed, it showed nothing specific to this patient. Literature data show that most of the patients presenting with a KLS have been seen by a psychiatrist at the time of the disease and diagnosed as suffering from hysteria, or schizophrenia, or bipolar disorders... Because of diagnostic wanderings, some patients have, hence, received inappropriate treatments. One should pay close attention to this very rare syndrome, on the border between neurology and psychiatry, since its diagnosis is essentially based on clinical features, and carefully think about the implementation of a medicinal treatment. This unique case seems unable to support our working hypothesis about the identification of a particular psychological profile in the KLS, but the question of an underlying fragility is still worth considering. We personally think that, even though links between the KLS and bipolar disorders have been suggested, this disease has to be considered as a separate entity."}, {"Title": "Description of outpatient utilization and costs in group of veterans with traumatic brain injury.", "Abstract": "In an attempt to increase understanding regarding the nonacute healthcare needs of veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI), we examined the outpatient utilization and cost patterns of 72 patients with TBI who were at least 4 years postinjury.

Politicians and decision-makers from the European Union and Ministers of Health and their deputies from many European countries raised the problems and difficulties to be tackled in a growing population with a high burden of disease, and asked scientists to write a consensus document with recommendations for future actions and decisions. Scientists and clinicians worked in parallel in three different groups, on health promotion and preventive actions, basic research in age-related disease, and clinical aspects of disease in older people. Beforehand, the format of the paper with recommendations was discussed, and it was finally agreed that, for a better understanding by decision- makers, it would be divided in two different columns: one with facts that were considered settled and agreed by most experts (under the heading We know), and a second with recommendations related to each fact (We recommend).

After careful and detailed discussion in each group, which in most cases included the exact wording of each statement, chairpersons presented the results in a plenary session, and new input from all participants was received, until each of the statements and recommendations were accepted by a large majority. Areas with no consensus were excluded from the document. Immediately after the Summit, the chairpersons sent the document both to the main authors and to a list of experts (see footnote) who had made presentations at the summit and agreed to review and critically comment on the final document, which is presented below. As regards the scientific aspects of the planning of the Summit, several organisations, under the leadership of the EUGMS, were asked both to review the program and to suggest names of speakers and participants. After the Summit, the Boards of these organizations (European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS), International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics-European Region (IAGGER), European Association of Geriatric Psychiatry (EAGP), International Society of Gerontechnology (ISG) and International Society for the Study of the Aging Male (ISSAM) agreed to consider the document as an official paper, and help with its dissemination. The name Silver Paper was used, recalling the grey or silvery hair of our older citizens, as an easy reference. It has been sent officially to several bodies of the European Union and to Health Ministers of most European countries; and will be published in other languages in local journals. Its declared intention is to foster changes in policies which may, in the future, reduce the burden of disease in old age."}, {"Title": "Perpetrators of homicide with schizophrenia: sociodemographic characteristics and clinical factors in the eastern region of Turkey.", "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to describe the social and clinical characteristics and offense details in a sample of people with schizophrenia convicted of homicide in the eastern region of Turkey. This study was performed in Elazig Mental Hospital between November 2004 and May 2007. We included 43 men and 6 women with schizophrenia convicted of homicide who were hospitalized in the forensic psychiatry unit for compulsory treatment. Preset data recording forms were used. The first part of the forms contained questions regarding the age, sex, marital status, residence, educational status, and occupation of the patients. The second part of the forms included questions about some clinical features of patients with schizophrenia: the presence of schizophrenia in any family member, duration of the disease, subtype of schizophrenia, previous contact with mental health services, types of antipsychotics (first and last drug used), and adherence to antipsychotic medication. The third part of the forms dealt with alcohol-substance abuse and features of the victim (sex of the victim and whether the victim was a stranger, partner, or an ex-partner in the family or an acquaintance). The mean +/- SD age of our patients was 36.98 +/- 10.07 years, and 55.1% of the patients were unmarried. In our sample, 42.9% of the patients were primary school graduates and 75.5% were unemployed. Of the perpetrators, 14.3% never had contact with mental health services. However, 85.7% of patients had previous contact with mental health services. We found that 85.7% of the patients were paranoid subtype and 85.7% were not using their medication regularly and that treatment compliance was considerably low. We found that haloperidol and trifluoperazine were the most preferred antipsychotic drugs, particularly being the first drugs used during treatment (haloperidol, 71.4%; trifluoperazine, 10.2%) and the last antipsychotics used before the offence (haloperidol, 46.9%; trifluoperazine, 20.4%). In 38.8% of cases, schizophrenia was present in the first-degree relatives. We also found that 69.4% of victims were one of the family members. In our sample, 24.5% of patients were using alcohol and 4.1% were using cannabis. It is plausible that rendering more effective communication might allow earlier intervention for unrecognized and possibly unrecognizable risk factors of homicidal acts in people with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Disturbance of perception in depressive disorders in the different diagnostical systems.", "Abstract": "Disturbances of perception play a considerable role in depressed patients' symptoms. These symptoms are mostly secondary in the daily practice, however, the disturbances of perception of a mild degree lead to cognitive distortions, and they make the recognition of the depression significantly more difficult.\nTo review several systems of diagnostic criteria, five developed in Europe, ten in the United Kingdom, five in the United States and five other diagnostic systems with respect to the kind of significance they ascribe to the disturbances of perception in the presence of depression.\nThe author establishes that the diagnostic systems examined in case of the patients suffering from depression ascribe different significances to the disturbances of perception despite the fact that all depressed patients suffer from these symptoms. In case of the 23 examined disturbances of perception, out of the 25 systems 20 ascribe significance to fewer than ten symptoms, 11 systems ascribe significance to five or fewer symptoms. In the process of the simplification of the diagnostic systems these symptoms do not obtain emphasis, which makes the establishment of the accurate diagnosis difficult. The author emphasizes that in the background of disturbances of perception the detection of the misshapen reality hides, from which the patients suffer the most. Out of the examined diagnostic systems the European and the complex diagnostic systems ascribe a more considerable emphasis to the disturbances of perception. In Kielholz's system there are 14, while in the CODE system there are 19 kinds of disturbances of perception.\nThe author establishes that the disturbances of perception and the symptoms developed by the consequences of the disturbances of perception have a greater significance in patients suffering from depressive disorders than it is known in the common knowledge. In fact most of the psychiatric signs and symptoms may be attributable to some kind of disturbance of perception. Out of the examined diagnostic systems Paul Kielholz's and Thomas Ban's complex diagnostic system, the CODE-DD takes the significance of the disturbances of perception into consideration in the largest degree. It is necessary to keep in mind that patients suffering from depression with disturbances of perception also present have difficulty in recovery. In the process of the simplification of the diagnostic systems these symptoms may evade the doctors' attention making the recognition of the illness more difficult and weaken the efficiency of the therapy. It would be justified to indicate the disturbances of perception as a diagnostic criterion in the ICD-11 and in the DSM-V among the illnesses related to depression. Paying attention to the disturbances of perception may transform the system of psychiatric classifications and the research of psychiatric illnesses not only in case of affective disorders but also in case of psychoses. Especially the genetic research concerning the disturbances of perception may support the objective judgement of the psychiatric disorders, its biological tenability could stabilize the situation of psychiatry among medical sciences."}, {"Title": "[The diversity of approaches for psychopathological disorders in school and university surroundings: surprises and paradoxes].", "Abstract": "In this review, we are addressing several issues of the approach of emerging mental disorders in school and university by first line professionals: diagnostic indicators, on-site care, referring and pathway to care.

Social causes to this phenomenon have been highlighted. In this paper, we review and discuss this literature from the cultural psychiatry perspective. We can point three limitations to these works : the definition of the studied groups, the cultural validity diagnoses, and the psychic impact of migration and its complexity not being considered enough. The above considerations lead us to go forward with studies addressing this question. The need to construct methodologies addressing psychiatric epidemiology, transcultural psychiatry and human sciences is underlined."}, {"Title": "[Case report of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis suspected of schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Recently, paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma, which predomi nantly affects young women, has been reported. Its symptoms are severe but often treatment-responsive and reversible. Various psychiatric symptoms occurring shortly after onset are characteristic of this encephalitis. A 22-year-old female who had a fever and common cold-like symptoms presented with short-term memory loss. She was suspected to have viral encephalitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed no marked change. Shortly after that, she developed delusions and hallucinations and presented with psychomotor excitement. She was suspected of having schizophrenia and admitted to the psychiatry department. However, several days after admission, she showed upper limb convulsion, orofacial dyskinesias, and central hypoventilation and became unresponsive. The results of laboratory tests were within the normal range, and there was no marked elevation of anti-viral antibody titers. Brain imaging was normal, but a solid tumor containing soft tissue and calcified components, probably an ovarian teratoma, was discovered on an abdominal CT scan. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody was positive in her CSF and blood serum, and we diagnosed her with \"Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis\". Gamma globulin was very effective, and the ovarian teratoma was removed. Finally, she could be discharged from our hospital without any sequela, and returned to her job. Psychiatrists often encounter encephalitis patients with psychiatric symptoms. If the type of encephalitis is unknown, we should keep this disease in mind."}, {"Title": "Personalized medicine in psychiatry: ethical challenges and opportunities.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenomic developments hold promise for personalized medicine in psychiatry with adjusted therapeutic doses, predictable responses, reduced adverse drug reactions, early diagnosis, and personal health planning. The prospects are exciting, but at the same time, these new techniques stand faced with important scientific, ethical, legal, and social challenges that need to be met in order for the scientific advances to be responsibly applied. This review discusses the ethical balance between challenge and opportunity of personalized medicine in psychiatry under the aspects of adequacy, cost:benefit ratio, and therapeutic equity. It is argued that the promising nature of these therapeutic possibilities makes it all the more important to avoid exaggerating the expectations, and that a sophisticated social infrastructure needs to be developed in order to ensure the realistic and responsible application of personalized medicine in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Stem cell approaches in psychiatry--challenges and opportunities.", "Abstract": "Exploring stem cells is a fascinating task, especially in a discipline where the use of stem cells seems far-fetched at first glance, as is the case in psychiatry.

For reasons that we will explain, this review will focus on affective disorders. The following section will give a more detailed account of stem-cell biology including current basic science approaches presenting in-vivo and in-vitro techniques. The final part will then look into future perspectives of using these stem cells to cure mental illnesses, and discuss the related challenges and opportunities."}, {"Title": "[Relationships between psychosomatics and somatopsychiatry in modern medicine].", "Abstract": "Progress in many clinical disciplines and neurobiology for the last decades give reason to reconsider some fundamental provisions of psychosomatic medicine and its relationships with somatopsychiatry. The universally accepted biopsychosocial model of the disease as proposed by V.N.Bekhterev implies involvement of psychological and psychosocial factors at early stages of many forms of somatic pathology. Intricate interplay between somatic and psychic components is exemplified by correlation of cardiovascular disorders and depression. Depression is diagnosed in 17-27% of the patients with coronary heart disease undergoing coronary angiography and in 16-45% of the post-infarction cases. Frequency of depression/hypertensive disease comorbidity is estimated at 30%. Similarity of pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases and depressive states is due to stress as their common provoking factor. Another important aspect of the relationship between medicine and psychiatry (disregarded until recently) is high frequency of somatic disorders in psychiatric patients. Cooperation of psychiatrists and representatives of different medical disciplines in such areas as research and practical health care is needed to address this problem."}, {"Title": "Methodology of a pilot study to improve the quality of medication use in older adults: Enhancing Quality in Psychiatry Using Pharmacists (EQUIPP).", "Abstract": "Medication-related problems are prevalent in older adults, contributing to increased harm and health care costs and negatively impacting quality of care. Older adults with psychiatric disease are at an increased risk because of their underlying disease and types of medications prescribed. Efforts to improve the quality of medication use often focus on select medication-related problems, select diagnoses, or predefined quality indicators; however, such an approach fails to consider the potential for multiple coexisting problems within individuals.\nA pilot study was conducted to test the feasibility of a medication management program designed to improve the quality of medication use in older adults with underlying psychiatric disease. This article describes the methodology of the study and details of the intervention, and presents baseline characteristics of the study population.\nEnglish-speaking psychiatry outpatients aged > or = 65 years taking > or = 2 drugs that are active in the central nervous system were enrolled into a medication management program, in which medication management was provided by a clinical pharmacist for 6 months. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data were collected on the patients' demographic characteristics, health and medications, health literacy, functional status, symptoms of depression, health services utilization, quality of medication use, adherence, and patient satisfaction with the program.\nOne hundred seventy-three older adults were assessed for inclusion; 146 were not eligible, not reachable, or not interested in participating. Twenty-seven older adults were enrolled in the study, all but one of whom completed the 3- and 6-month visits. The mean (SD) age of the 27 participants was 74.7 (8.1) years; 63% were female, 74% were white, and 70% had no cognitive impairment.\nThis pilot study tested the feasibility of a medication management program designed to improve the quality of medication use in older adults with underlying psychiatric disease.

All students were between 17 and 28 years of age, and completed an established international questionnaire entitled 'Attitudes Towards Psychiatry'. Within the group of physiotherapy students, the effect of a 65-hour course on psychiatric rehabilitation on their attitudes was evaluated.\nAttitudes towards psychiatry were moderately positive [mean (SD) 103.3 (9.9)]. There was a small but significant difference between physiotherapy students and non-medical students (Cohen's d=0.31). Female students had a more positive attitude towards psychiatry than their male peers (Cohen's d=0.44). Prior experience with mental illness was associated with more positive attitudes (Cohen's d=0.68). Attitudes increased in positivity after completion of a psychiatry course (Cohen's d=0.72).\nTo ensure basic physiotherapeutic treatment for the mentally ill, physiotherapy education should aim to promote positive attitudes towards mental illness as well as psychiatry.

The years between the two World Wars saw the GDA grow in importance with much international respect. The close collaboration between the GDA's protagonist Ernst R\u00fcdin and the National Socialist regime was certainly not an inhibiting factor for the worldwide recognition of the eugenic research conducted in Munich. Around the mid-1930s, the German psychiatrist \u00e9migr\u00e9 Franz Josef Kallmann brought the field of study which had been put into practice in Munich to the United States. He fought an uphill battle to be accepted by the North American scientific community, but finally he was able to establish himself as the main researcher in the field of psychiatric genetics. Interestingly enough, the fact that his kind of research had been heavily supported by the National Socialist regime was not a barrier to his acceptance. The fact that it took him a long time to establish the field of eugenics in the U.S.A. is better explained by the psychoanalytic research methods at the time, which gave hereditary transmission short shrift. At the New York State Psychiatric Institute he was able to continue his research, including the examination of race-hygienic motifs, where he designed a research program that was directly based on concepts and methods from Ernst R\u00fcdin's team of researchers in Munich. The only deviation from the original research was in terms of the use of eugenic prophylaxis where he aligned his research in the context of North American democracy in the post-war era. However, the eugenic goal of elimination of certain categories of peoples remained unchanged."}, {"Title": "[Validation of the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in Mexican patients with schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "To validate the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in schizophrenic patients.\nThe Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI v. 1) and the AUDIT were administered to 80 subjects with schizophrenia, of both sexes, more than 16 years of age, from the outpatient services at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City.\nOf the 80 schizophrenic patients, 57 were men and 23 women, with a mean age of 30.5 years and 34.3 years, respectively; the age at schizophrenia onset was 22 years for men, and 26 years for women; 35 subjects (43.7%) were consumers of alcohol at the time of the study.

In Brazil, a small group of therapists are resisting biomedicalization by keeping psychodynamic traditions alive and aiming to transform psychotherapy into a resource for politicized youth empowerment. Nevertheless, clinical practices demonstrate an increased use of biomedical diagnoses and therapeutic routines. On the basis of fieldwork with therapists and teachers, and a nine-year-long ethnography of young people, this article explores the localized effects of these potentially contradictory developments. Results show that the growth of biomedical practices alongside politicized therapeutic approaches is not indicative of underlying ambiguities but has, rather, emerged from the purposefully equivocal nature of Brazilian social, medical, and professional life.

The \"social case\" label emerges at the intersection of (1) plans by the state to deinstitutionalize public mental health care, (2) the rise of a new class of downwardly mobile and increasingly poor formerly working-class people, and (3) the desire of psychiatrists to protect their patients in the face of neoliberal assaults on Romanian welfare state support for publicly funded mental health care.

This article is a review of studies evaluating the relationship between nightmares and psychopathology, especially in regard to their intensity and content. For example, prepsychotic patients often report nightmares, particularly of body fragmentation and death of the dreamer. Nightmares have been repeatedly associated with the general level of psychopathology and with the personality factor \"neuroticism\". Nightmare distress, the impact on daily functioning caused by nightmares, may function as a mediating variable. Several studies in the last years have shown that nightmares can be treated with several cognitive-behavioral techniques. Have been also reported promising effects of pharmacological agents, especially prazosin, but they need to be evaluated in larger placebo-controlled trials. In summary, many findings on nightmares are preliminary and this field needs to be further investigated. Nevertheless psychiatry and general medicine need to pay more attention to nightmares; they are not merely a nightly symptom of anxiety, but a separate sleep disorder that should receive specific treatment."}, {"Title": "\"Where the need is greatest\": social psychiatry and race-blind universalism in Harlem's Lafargue Clinic, 1946-1958.", "Abstract": "Between 1946 and 1958, Harlem was home to a small psychiatric facility, the Lafargue Clinic. An interracial institution run entirely by volunteers, the clinic helped expand mental health care into underserved African American communities. Relying upon extant case files, this article examines how the Lafargue staff handled clinical situations with African Americans. In its attempt to forge a new antiracist approach, the staff struck a balance between viewing Harlem patients as psychological products of their unique social context (social psychiatry) and applying modern psychiatric principles to African Americans without adjusting for racial or sociological difference (race-blind universalism)."}, {"Title": "Gender, age, and diagnosis: the rise and fall of involutional melancholia in American psychiatry, 1900-1980.", "Abstract": "Between 1900 and 1980, American psychiatrists employed a diagnosis of involutional melancholia to characterize older individuals, primarily postmenopausal women, who had constellations of depressive symptoms and specific personality traits. American interest in this diagnosis represented a confluence of social and psychoanalytic assumptions about gender, increased interest in old age, and the development of somatic therapies by the middle of the century. In the decades after the introduction of psychiatric medications, however, involutional melancholia lost its significance as a specific disease and was absorbed into the broader category of major depressive disorder."}, {"Title": "Postgraduate psychiatric training in Thailand.", "Abstract": "In Thailand, after medical students graduated from medical schools, the general practitioners have to work for the government for at least three years. Then, they can enroll in postgraduate training program. Postgraduate training usually takes three to four years. All of the psychiatric training programs are supervised and monitored by the board of education of the Royal College of Psychiatrists of Thailand (RCPsychT). One of the missions of all training institutes is to prepare residents to be the high qualified psychiatrists to serve the mental well-being of Thai people. Additionally, they should teach the learners to be the leaders in academic and research fields in psychiatry. Currently, there are nine psychiatric training institutions in Thailand, most of which are running by university programs. The training program core curriculum composes of the compulsory rotations such as general psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, neurology, consultation-liaison psychiatry, mental hospital psychiatry and addiction psychiatry. Moreover, the residents also have three months for elective in each program. The learning process includes practicing in an out-patient and in-patient unit under psychiatric staff supervision, individual and group supervision, case conference, journal club, book club and grand round etc. Research in field of psychiatry and social sciences is also compulsory for board examination. The RCPsychT approved two Certificate Diplomas including Diploma of Thai Board of Psychiatry, and Diploma of Thai Board of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. There are only nine psychiatric training institutes and only thirty to forty residents enrolled in these programs in each year. The compact and collaboration of all training institutes bring about the benefits in efficiency programs management by regular meeting of representatives from each institute. They keep the standard of training program to progress in the same vision and direction. Furthermore, residents of each training programs can exchange and request for elective rotation at the other institutes."}, {"Title": "[Statistical investigation on cases associated with medical implication in administrative autopsy within the 23 wards of Tokyo: the role of the medical examiner system in investigation of cases associated with medical implication].", "Abstract": "Actual circumstances of administrative autopsies which proved connections between medical implication and death had not been very clear in the past. Therefore, using the records of administrative autopsies performed from 2003 to 2005 at Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office, this study looked into the cases in which a certain level of connection between medical implication and death was proved or suspected. This study dealt with 877 cases. The largest age group among the male was the one between 65 and 74, and the number of female cases increased as the age increased. The percentage of the studied cases among all the administrative autopsy cases has become larger after 2004. As regarding medical departments for implication, \"internal medicine\" had the largest number of the cases, and \"unknown\", \"psychiatry\", and \"emergency\" followed in order. 30 percent were being hospitalized during the final medical consultations, and the percentage went up to just over 60 when the deaths during and on the day after the final consultations were added to the figure. Regarding the causes of death, the great majority was natural death, and the other causes were 'unknown', 'fall', and 'asphyxia'. Also, about 80 percent of the natural deaths were caused by circulatory, gastroenteric and respiratory diseases. Contradictions between clinical and forensic diagnoses were found in approximately 10 percent of the cases. In any case, medical examiners are to diagnose the causes of deaths by autopsy, not to evaluate the quality and safety of medical treatment. But if the quality and safety of medical treatment could be improved through the diagnoses of administrative autopsy, the medical examiner system would function practically as a part of administration for health and welfare. However, as it handles not only deaths by medical treatment but also all the other types of unnatural deaths, the system can also deal with other social problems, for which the correct causes of death must be diagnosed initially. It is socially very unhealthy to focus only on death associated with medical implication, as other types of unnatural death could be seen as relatively less important. Therefore, it is considered that the medical examiner system is effective for investigation of a variety of unnatural death as well as cases associated with medical implication."}, {"Title": "[Aortic dissection and carotid arteries dissection complicated by ischaemic stroke in a patient with cystic medial necrosis].", "Abstract": "We present a case of a 62-year-old man who was admitted in grave condition to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology because of ischaemic stroke. Neurological examination re- vealed left-sided pyramidal hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) showed the ischaemic focus in the right cerebral hemisphere. Clinical examination and ultrasound examination revealed dissection of the aortic arch and extracranial arteries. Aortic dissection was confirmed in echocardiography and chest CT.

The aim of this work was to collect data about the expectations of senior medical students regarding their future professional practice. One hundred and twenty-five senior medical students were surveyed between September and December 2008. By using an anonymous survey, information regarding the expectations about their future professional practice was collected. The survey was answered by 82.4% (103/125) of the students and 98.0% (101/103) expressed their desire to enter a residence programme. Regarding specialty, pediatrics and psychiatry were the most chosen by women (27% vs. 8%, p=0.029 and 27% vs. 3%, p=0.004), and orthopedic surgery was the predominant choice in men (18% vs. 2%, p=0.019). Median of expected income at 5 years post graduation was $ 4.000 (minimum: $1,500, maximum: $10.000), at 10 years $7.000 (minimum: $3.000, maximum: $ 20.000) and at 20 years $10.000 (minimum: $3.000, maximum: $30,000), according to money value adjusted to December 2008 ($3.0 = US$ 1.0).

Our objectives were to (1) estimate the effect size of the medications used to treat adult ADHD, (2) determine if differences in the designs of studies confound comparisons of medication efficacy, (3) quantify the evidence for differences in effect sizes among medications, and (4) see if features of study design influence estimates of efficacy.\nThe following search engines were used: PubMed, Ovid, ERIC, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, the Cochrane database, e-psyche, and Social Sciences Abstracts. Presentations from the American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meetings were reviewed.\nA literature search was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of ADHD in adults published in English after 1979. Only trials that used DSM-III, -III-R, or -IV ADHD criteria and followed subjects for > or = 2 weeks were selected.\nMeta-analysis regression assessed the influence of medication type and study design features on medication effects.\nNineteen trials met criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. These trials studied 13 drugs using 18 different outcome measures of hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behavior. After trials were stratified on the class of drug studied (short-acting stimulant vs long-acting stimulant vs nonstimulant), significant differences in effect size were observed between stimulant and nonstimulant medications (P = .006 and P = .0001, respectively, for short- and long-acting stimulants vs nonstimulants), but the effect for short-acting stimulants was not significant after correcting for study design features. The effect sizes for each drug class were similar in magnitude to what we previously reported for medication treatment studies of children with ADHD. We found significant heterogeneity of effect sizes for short-acting stimulants (P < .001) but not for other medication groups.\nAlthough both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are effective for treating ADHD in adults, stimulant medications show greater efficacy for the short durations of treatment characteristic of placebo-controlled studies. We found no significant differences between short- and long-acting stimulant medications. Study design features vary widely among studies and can confound indirect comparisons unless addressed statistically as we have done in this study."}, {"Title": "Incidence and risk factors of workplace violence on nursing staffs caring for chronic psychiatric patients in taiwan.", "Abstract": "This one-year follow-up study determined the incidence and risk factors of workplace violence against nursing staff in a psychiatric hospital.

In this regard, there are consistent issues impeding effective psychiatric research, including limitations in efficiency, difficulty demonstrating significant differences between treatment arms, poor external validity, and ethical constraints. For example, research in the field of psychiatry shows that it is growing increasingly more challenging to demonstrate superiority of interventions to placebo in part related to the increasing placebo response rates. Various design innovations and other tricks of the trade have surfaced to improve sensitivity towards detecting drug-placebo differences and reduce sources of bias in psychiatric research. Diverse strategies have been developed to address these obstacles and improve the outcomes of clinical research in psychiatry. The current review highlights many of these innovations and describes examples of their practical use, mainly focusing on the study design and conduct perspectives.

A significant association was found between psychiatric hospitalization and suicide attempts. Immigrant patients present a combination of psychiatric, socio-economic and general medical conditions, which demands a holistic view of the patient. The evaluation of an immigrant patient must take into account the stress related to immigration, gender, culture of origin and the risk for suicide and hospitalization. Treatment recommendations include awareness of cultural diversities, acquiring information regarding the pre-immigration history, preferably using cultural consultants with background in the immigrants' culture and community.

In Japan, also, clinical trials are planned as the final stage of treatment development. In this field, an appropriate outcome measure has not been established due to the lack of experience in clinical trials. Treatments for muscular dystrophy are deemed effective only when increases in the muscle mass and muscle strength and improvements in the ADL and QOL as well as biological marker levels at target points have been demonstrated. The Muscular Dystrophy Clinical Study Group has addressed the development of these evaluation methods since 2002. Also, as treatments for muscular dystrophy being developed today are so-called tailor-made treatments aimed at specific mutations, a system that facilitates identification of the type and site of mutation in each individual must be prepared. The Gene Analysis Center was only just established in the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in 2009. Also, it is expected to be difficult to secure a sufficient number of subjects to start a clinical trial in a short period. Therefore, the Registry of Muscular Dystrophy (REMUDY), a system for the registration of patients with muscular dystrophy including their clinical and genetic information was implemented. This system, which provides information concerning the number of patients required by the protocol to researchers and pharmaceutical companies and the latest information regarding the development of treatments to patients, is expected to serve as a prototype for the establishment of the basis of clinical trials against rare diseases."}, {"Title": "[The Japanese Society of Neurology.

Until now, the contribution of Foucault to this critical movement has been little known. In this paper I reconstruct in a systematic and exhaustive way Foucault's critique of psychoanalysis and, in particular, of the Oedipus-complex theory. I demonstrate that this critique presupposes a very specific epistemology and social theory. On an epistemological level, Foucault focuses on the power effects of psychoanalysis as a discourse of subjectivity. On a social-theoretical level, Foucault assumes a functionalist conception of society. These two aspects of Foucault's critique of psychoanalysis have not been adequately recognized in the discussion about his relationship to psychoanalysis (Derrida, Miller, Whitebook, among others).

This is reflected in the continuing recourse to religious healers or texts, as well as in heated debates over the moral, social, religious and legal status of religious healers, in particular the relatively recent and more orthodox \"Qur'anic healers.\" The present study used a primarily qualitative analysis of Egyptian newspaper articles to explore media portrayals of this debate with a focus on how these contradictory cultural themes are situated and contested. The results show that psychiatric hegemony is reflected in media language that gives primacy to certain discourses over others, but that religious healing and religion in general exert an equal, if not more powerful influence on the form of these media portrayals. Different strategies used to negotiate the tensions between Qur'anic healing and psychiatry by those on both sides of the argument come across in the ways these arguments are portrayed in the media."}, {"Title": "Short admission in an emergency psychiatry unit can prevent prolonged lengths of stay in a psychiatric institution.", "Abstract": "Characterize and compare acute psychiatric admissions to the psychiatric wards of a general hospital (22 beds), a psychiatric hospital (80) and of an emergency psychiatry unit (6).\nSurvey of the ratios and shares of the demographic, diagnostic and hospitalization variables involved in all acute admissions registered in a catchment area in Brazil between 1998 and 2004.\nFrom the 11,208 admissions, 47.8% of the patients were admitted to a psychiatric hospital and 14.1% to a general hospital. The emergency psychiatry unit accounted for 38.1% of all admissions during the period, with a higher variability in occupancy rate and bed turnover during the years. Around 80% of the hospital stays lasted less than 20 days and in almost half of these cases, patients were discharged in 2 days. Although the total number of admissions remained stable during the years, in 2004, a 30% increase was seen compared to 2003. In 2004, bed turnover and occupancy rate at the emergency psychiatry unit increased.\nThe increase in the number of psychiatric admissions in 2004 could be attributed to a lack of new community-based services available in the area beginning in 1998. Changes in the health care network did affect the emergency psychiatric service and the limitations of the community-based network could influence the rate of psychiatric admissions."}, {"Title": "[Transfer of patients between a unit of geriatric psychiatry and general hospitals: a one-year analysis].", "Abstract": "Patients with psychogeriatric disorders normally are affected by comorbid medical illnesses.

He was a public health physician, a psychiatrist, and a medical examiner who spent his entire career in Salem, the capital of the State of Oregon. Salem was a unique place to work because, early in the history of Oregon, the state elected to build all of its original public institutions in the environs of the city. As the county medical examiner, Dr. Batten reviewed all questionable deaths that occurred within the county and in particular within the public institutions. Many of his findings were subsequently published, and these reports influenced the direction of mental health policy in these same institutions.

Using the Daubert guidelines as a framework, we examined each competency measure regarding its relevance to the Dusky standard and its error and classification rates.

In this paper we describe his training, that began as a physiologist, but turned into psychiatric and psychoanalysis in his formation in the United States and the United Kingdom during the forties. After returning to Chile, in the Chair of Psychiatry at the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad de Chile he developed pioneering ideas about undergraduate teaching of psychiatry, that were exposed not only in Chile but to the Pan-American Health Organization. He advocated decreasing the time spent in lectures, and increase clinical practice and group dynamic experiences centered in the students. He insisted that teaching had to be focused in issues useful for general physicians and non psychiatric specialists, as well as in the need to extend the psychosocial curriculum to the internship. He also pointed to the need of increasing the humanistic formation of medical students. When Matte Blanco emigrated to Rome in 1966, his influences seemed to wane, since most of his disciples inverted exclamation markeft the Cl\u00ednica Psiqui\u00e1trica Universitaria, where he taught.

In the 1950s, when American psychiatry under psychoanalytic dominance had little interest in psychiatric diagnosis, Edwin Gildea recruited to the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University faculty who advocated a medical model for psychiatry in which diagnosis had a central role. In 1967, at the urging of the then-resident John Feighner, a discussion group led by Eli Robins and including Sam Guze, George Winokur, Robert Woodruff, and Rod Mu\u00f1oz began meeting with the initial goal of writing a review of prior key contributions to psychiatric diagnosis. In their meetings over the next year, the task soon shifted to the development of a set of new diagnostic criteria. For three diagnoses, major depression, antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism, the authors could identify the original criteria from which this group worked and the rationale for many of the changes they introduced. Published in 1972, the Feighner criteria were soon widely cited and used in research, and they formed the basis for the development of the Research Diagnostic Criteria, which in turn were central to the development of DSM-III. The team that developed the Feighner criteria made three key contributions to psychiatry: the systematic use of operationalized diagnostic criteria; the reintroduction of an emphasis on illness course and outcome; and an emphasis on the need, whenever possible, to base diagnostic criteria on empirical evidence."}, {"Title": "Developing effective educational approaches for Liaison Old Age Psychiatry teams: a literature review of the learning needs of hospital staff in relation to managing the confused older patient.", "Abstract": "Deficiencies in the knowledge, skills and attitudes of all healthcare professionals working within the general hospital contribute towards the suboptimal care of older hospitalized patients with confusion.

Those living in care homes, and those with diagnosed mental illness (in the medical group) were excluded. A registered mental health nurse assessed mental and general health using validated and previously published instruments. A registered dentist made an independent assessment of dental health (examination to assess oral pathology, status of remaining teeth, and dentures) and made an overall judgment about whether the patient needed any dental treatment (a \"normative\" need).\nThe normative need for dental treatment was significantly higher among the psychiatry group compared to the medical group (85% vs 52%; p<0.001); even after taking account of the effect of age, gender, teeth status, physical comorbidity, cognition, depressive symptoms, and overall mental and social health [adjusted odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval): 4.32 (2.09, 8.91)]. The presence of any natural remaining teeth [OR: 4.44 (2.10, 9.42)] and Barthel Index [OR: 0.96 (0.93, 0.99)] were the two other independent predictors of the need for treatment.\nDental problems are common in community-living older people, especially those with some natural remaining teeth and those with mental illness.

It also evaluated endorsement of genetic and environmental causal attributions of mental illness.\nA qualitative approach using focus group methodology was selected as most appropriate because these issues are relatively unexplored. Participants (n=36) aged > or =18 years from metropolitan Sydney discussed their understanding of the role of genetic and environmental risk factors in mental illness and attitudes towards pre-symptomatic interventions based on genetic risk information.\nThirty-six participants attended four focus groups involving 8-10 participants per group. Participants predominantly viewed genetic risk factors for depression as predisposing rather than causal, with environmental risk factors acting as triggers. Hypothetical identification with a genetic variant suggesting predisposition to depression prompted strong interest in seeking further information about predictive genetic testing from medical professionals, willingness to reduce life stress, drugs and alcohol intake, willingness to increase exercise, and willingness to undertake cognitive and behavioural interventions at a pre-symptomatic stage. Mixed views prevailed as to whether stress was a modifiable risk factor. Preventive intervention at a presymptomatic stage of depression was viewed negatively in a minority of participants due to a fatalistic attitude towards a genetic predisposition and attitudes that intervention was futile in the absence of symptoms.\nThere is a likely public demand for preventive mental health interventions for healthy people on the basis of genetic susceptibility if predictive genetic testing becomes available in psychiatry. The findings have implications for general practitioner and public education about predictive genetic testing for susceptibility to common multifactorial disorders for at-risk groups."}, {"Title": "Darwinian dynamics of depression.", "Abstract": "Darwin's theory of sexual selection offers a challenge to psychology and psychiatry. We select each other, and have been doing so since social life first evolved. But who is selected and what happens to those who are not selected? What social structures have evolved to contain the unselected? What behaviours have evolved to manage the selection process? How do the selected relate to the unselected and what behaviours have evolved to manage this asymmetry in social relations? What mental states have evolved to characterize the selected and the unselected? These questions should be kept in mind when we observe and study the social structures, behaviours and mental states that we see displayed before us in all the variety of nature. It is suggested that a significant amount of current psychiatric disorder, especially depressive states and both social and generalized anxiety disorder, have evolved because they managed the processes of being unselected and de-selected, and maintained the unselected in that social role without loss of life or physical incapacity, and enabled the unselected to contribute to general social well-being."}, {"Title": "Ethological approaches to psychiatric disorders: focus on depression and schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Behavioural observation of psychiatric patient groups using ethological methodology has never been a mainstream approach in psychiatry.

Based on a Medline survey, the literature on ethological observation of patients with depression and schizophrenia was reviewed. Ethological observation of psychiatric patient groups has the potential to improve prediction of course and outcome of severe psychiatric disorders at a very early stage. Disadvantages of the ethological approach lie within its technical requirements and its inherent time-consuming evaluation of data.

Therefore, the importance of naturalistic studies in psychiatry is becoming recognized. The aim of present naturalistic study was to acquire data on efficacy, safety, and preference of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets during a 17-week treatment of depression. This prospective, open-label, multicenter study in patients with mild to severe depression was conducted at 47 mental health centers of Lithuania by 78 psychiatrists. Patients were initially given 15 mg or 30 mg of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets; the maximum allowed dose was 45 mg per day. The primary efficacy measure was the total score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD-17), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Tolerability was primarily measured by assessing the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Patients were evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17.

The syndrome of catatonia, however, remains in a diagnostic limbo, acknowledged predominantly as a subtype of schizophrenia. Yet, catatonia is present in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatry patients, only a minority of whom have schizophrenia. Among those with comorbid affective disorders, who comprise the largest subgroup of catatonic patients, the catatonic signs typically resolve dramatically and completely with benzodiazepine therapy. Those with schizophrenia respond less reliably, suggesting that the underlying processes causing the catatonia may be different in this group. The majority of patients with catatonia have concurrent psychosis. Failure to treat the catatonia before institution of antipsychotic medication may increase the risk of inducing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. At this point of time, the pathobiology of catatonia is unknown; the major reason for considering catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity would be to increase recognition of this eminently treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome."}, {"Title": "Psychodynamics in medically ill patients.", "Abstract": "This article explores the role of psychodynamics as it applies to the understanding and treatment of medically ill patients in the consultation-liaison psychiatry setting. It provides historical background that spans the eras from Antiquity (Hippocrates and Galen) to nineteenth-century studies of hysteria (Charcot, Janet, and Freud) and into the twentieth century (Flanders Dunbar, Alexander, Engle, and the DSM). The article then discusses the effects of personality on medical illness, treatment, and patients' ability to cope by reviewing the works of Bibring, Kahana, and others. The important contribution of attachment theory is reviewed as it pertains the patient-physician relationship and the health behavior of physically ill patients. A discussion of conversion disorder is offered as an example of psychodynamics in action. This article highlights the important impact of countertransference, especially in terms of how it relates to patients who are extremely difficult and \"hateful,\" and explores the dynamics surrounding the topic of physician-assisted suicide, as it pertains to the understanding of a patient's request to die.

We suggest three interconnected domains of inquiry in which the intersection of neuroscience and anthropology can productively inform our understanding of the relationship between human brains and their socio-cultural contexts. These are: the social construction of emotion, cultural psychiatry, and the embodiment of ritual. We build on both current research findings in cultural neuroscience and ethnographic data on cultural differences in thought and behavior, to generate novel, ecologically informed hypotheses for future study. In addition, we lay out a specific suggestion for operationalizing insights from anthropology in the context of cultural neuroscience research. Specifically, we advocate the development of field studies that use portable measurement technologies to connect individual patterns of biological response with socio-cultural processes.

The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was higher in the psychiatric group (34%) than the control group (27%), and the mean ESS score was also significantly higher in the psychiatric group. The prevalence of excessive sleepiness was higher for female psychiatric patients, but this pattern was not found in the control group.

Data collected included age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, medications, height, weight, fasting glucose, and lipid profile. Body mass index (BMI) was standardized for age and sex and converted to a z score. Overweight was defined as a BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile and obese as a BMI at the 95th percentile or greater for age and sex. The 2007 American Diabetes Association criteria for IFG and type 2 diabetes were used.\nAmong the 432 admissions, 167 (39%) had both height and weight measured, and 145 (34%) had fasting glucose measured. The mean zBMI was higher in the SGA-treated (n = 68), compared with the SGA-naive group (n = 99) (mean difference 0.81; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.16). In the SGA-treated group, 31% were obese and 26% were overweight, compared with 15% and 8%, respectively, in the SGA-naive group (P < 0.01). In the SGA-treated group (n = 65), 21.5% had IFG or type 2 diabetes, compared with 7.5% in the SGA-naive group (n = 80) (P = 0.01).\nYouth treated with SGAs have significantly higher rates of obesity and glucose intolerance than SGA-naive youth.

Our objective was to quantify and characterize routine and co-managed pediatric healthcare as provided by specialists in community settings.\nNationally representative data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2002-2006. We included office based physicians (excluding family physicians, general internists and general pediatricians), and a representative sample of their patients aged 18 or less. Visits were classified into mutually exclusive categories based on the major reason for the visit, previous knowledge of the health problem, and whether the visit was the result of a referral. Primary diagnoses were classified using Expanded Diagnostic Clusters. Physician report of sharing care for the patient with another physician and frequency of reappointments were also collected.\nOverall, 41.3% out of about 174 million visits were for routine follow up and preventive care of patients already known to the specialist. Psychiatry, immunology and allergy, and dermatology accounted for 54.5% of all routine and preventive care visits. Attention deficit disorder, allergic rhinitis and disorders of the sebaceous glands accounted for about a third of these visits. Overall, 73.2% of all visits resulted in a return appointment with the same physician, in half of all cases as a result of a routine or preventive care visit.\nAmbulatory office-based pediatric care provided by specialists includes a large share of non referred routine and preventive care for common problems for patients already known to the physician. It is likely that many of these services could be managed in primary care settings, lessening demand for specialists and improving coordination of care."}, {"Title": "Sleep problems as reported by parents in Swedish children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), child psychiatric outpatients and school children.", "Abstract": "To examine prevalence of sleep problems among children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as rated by their parents and the role of comorbidity.\nChildren and adolescents with OCD (n=185) referred to specialized OCD unit were compared with children from child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) outpatient units (n=177) and a school sample (GP) (n=317). All were assessed by parents on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).\nSleep problems were common in both the OCD (28.8 %) and CAP (20.3%) groups compared with the GP group (5.4%). While the OCD group significantly more often had less sleep than the CAP group (11.7% vs. 6.8%), small differences were found between these two groups for nightmares (5.9%, vs. 6.8% n.s.). Comparing the OCD and CAP groups on total sleep problem scores, OCD was a weak while the CBCL syndrome scales Thought problems (which includes OCD symptoms), Anxiety/Depressed, Somatic problems and Aggressive behaviour were strong predictors indicating that comorbidity rather than OCD might be especially important.\nSleep problems are common among children and adolescents with OCD as well as among regular CAP outpatients.

STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTION CRITERIA: We included any study in which either intended or adverse response to drug therapy was examined in relation to genetic variation in the germline or cancer cells in humans.\nStudy characteristics and data reported in abstracts were recorded. We further analysed full text from a random 10% subset of articles spanning the different subclasses of study.\nFrom 102,264 Medline hits and 1,641 articles from other sources, we identified 1,668 primary research articles (1987 to 2007, inclusive). A high proportion of remaining articles were reviews/commentaries (ratio of reviews to primary research approximately 25 ratio 1). The majority of studies (81.8%) were set in Europe and North America focussing on cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurology/psychiatry. There was predominantly a candidate gene approach using common alleles, which despite small sample sizes (median 93 [IQR 40-222]) with no trend to an increase over time, generated a high proportion (74.5%) of nominally significant (p<0.05) reported associations suggesting the possibility of significance-chasing bias. Despite 136 examples of gene/drug interventions being the subject of >or=4 studies, only 31 meta-analyses were identified. The majority (69.4%) of end-points were continuous and likely surrogate rather than hard (binary) clinical end-points.\nThe high expectation but limited translation of pharmacogenetic research thus far may be explained by the preponderance of reviews over primary research, small sample sizes, a mainly candidate gene approach, surrogate markers, an excess of nominally positive to truly positive associations and paucity of meta-analyses.

The main purpose of the present study is to discuss the subjective experience of sexuality in patients with psychosis within the general psychodynamic and phenomenological understandings of psychotic states. The authors, both psychotherapists, dealing with patients with psychoses, reflected experiences from their clinical work with the help of the conceptual frameworks of psychodynamic and phenomenological psychiatry. Willingness and need of patients to talk about sexuality, non-specificity of frequencies and variety of sexual disorders in psychotic patients, difficulties in establishment of a stable (sexual) identity and the question of homosexuality, absence of sexual activities with others and feelings of guilt and inadequacy, masturbation with its functions, impulsive sexual acts or lack of sexual self-control, erotic delusions and erotic transference were the main findings, dominating the sexual sphere of these patients. All these manifestations of sexuality in patients with psychosis can be seen - as exposed in discussion - as consequences of a basic self-disorder (phenomenological perspective) or of difficulties in regulating closeness and distance (psychodynamic perspective). Reasons of avoidance of treatment of sexuality by the therapists of psychotic patients are discussed as well. Implications for dealing with sexuality issues in psychotherapy of patients with psychoses were drawn from the above findings in the last part of the article."}, {"Title": "Psychosis: what it is and what it is not.

Patients and their mothers were interviewed separately on the patients' symptoms during the last 2 weeks prior to interview. An ADHD-ODD sum score ranging between 0 and 26 was computed reflecting the number of fulfilled diagnostic criteria within the 2-week period under investigation. Interviews were videotaped and re-rated by an independent second rater. Additionally, mothers filled out two questionnaires on their children's symptoms (FBB-HKS, a German ADHD scale based on ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria; strength and difficulties questionnaire, SDQ). We investigated 59 patients affected by AD(H)D according to DSM-IV recruited from our Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (39 males, 20 females; mean age: M=9.66, SD=2.30). Inter-rater correlation regarding the ADHD-ODD scores was r=0.98 with no significant differences in mean sum scores between rater 1 and rater 2. Internal consistency of the ADHD-ODD scale was 0.85 (Cronbach's alpha). Item difficulties and discriminative power of the items also proved to be adequate. Convergent and discriminant validity were indicated by middle to high correlations with mother-ratings of the children's externalizing symptoms and a low correlation with ratings of internalizing symptoms.

Narcissistic rage comprised DSQ \"omnipotence\" and HDHQ \"extraverted hostility\". Hierarchical multiple regressions analyses were performed. We showed that, in patients with disease duration less than one year, narcissistic rage had a minor impact on psychosocial variables studied, indicating that the rage was rather part of a \"normal\" mourning process.

The aim of this study was to investigate if the finding of an inverse correlation between spirituality and 5-HT(1A) could be seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder or replicated among healthy volunteers. A total of 23 patients with major depressive disorder and 20 healthy volunteers were examined with PET using [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 as the radioligand. The personality traits were measured using the Finnish version of the Temperament and Character Inventory and correlated with ligand binding (BP). No significant correlations were found between the different Temperament and Character Inventory subscales and BP in any of the studied brain regions (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nuclei, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri, medial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, insular cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex).

The biopsychosocial model often fails to sufficiently validate the existential suffering of patients. We review the major principles of recovery and the philosophical and psychiatric principles of existentialism. The ontological or intrinsic existential issues of death, isolation, freedom and meaninglessness are described and their manifestations are explored in clinical syndromes. When ultimate existential concerns are recognised, patients have an opportunity to understand their life on a deeper level that is not defined as a medical disorder but as a part of human existence. Understanding that existential concerns underlie a great deal of human behaviour helps to free patients from the stigma of psychiatric labels. An existential approach is a humanistic way toward recovery."}, {"Title": "New generation vs. first generation antipsychotics debate: pragmatic clinical trials and practice-based evidence.", "Abstract": "There has been significant confusion about the relative advantage of new generation antipsychotics over first generation antipsychotics as well as of clinical trials performed to evaluate their efficacy vs. those designed to evaluate their effectiveness. Pragmatic or effectiveness clinical trials like CATIE and CUtLASS sponsored by governments have challenged the current worldview of the greater advantages of new generation over first generation antipsychotics and suggested more clinical applicability of older antipsychotics. Public policy regarding the role and place of modern antipsychotics in schizophrenia treatment is usually guided by the imperfect state of clinical trials and by economic constraints. The right question is not whether new generation antipsychotics are better than first generation antipsychotics in terms of effectiveness, tolerability and safety. How to reach personalized , evidence based and value oriented decision making in the complex treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, that is the question now. Personalized medicine in psychiatry is not possible without the availability of enough number of different modern antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "Cultivating empathy for the mentally ill using simulated auditory hallucinations.", "Abstract": "The authors address the issue of cultivating medical students' empathy for the mentally ill by examining medical student empathy pre- and postsimulated auditory hallucination experience.\nAt the University of Utah, 150 medical students participated in this study during their 6-week psychiatry rotation. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Student Version, was used before and after the experience. The auditory hallucinations were provided as part of the \"Hearing Voices That Are Distressing\" curriculum created by the National Empowerment Center, which attempted to simulate the experience of hearing auditory hallucinations. While the students were listening to the auditory hallucinations, they underwent a psychiatric interview and simplified cognitive testing and were asked to socially interact in the community. We conducted a paired sample t-test of significance to identify pre- and postsimulated auditory hallucination changes in medical student empathy. Fifty students were randomly selected to serve as a comparison group.\nThe paired sample t-test revealed that after listening to the simulated auditory hallucinations and participating in the simplified neurocognitive testing, the students' empathy score increased. Students in the comparison group had no significant difference in their empathy scores.\nThese results suggest that empathy may increase when students are given a brief glimpse into the mind of a mentally ill patient by listening to simulated auditory hallucinations. Specific interventions to increase empathy for the mentally ill can lead to a better understanding of how empathy can improve patient care, enhance the doctor-patient relationship, and direct future educational strategies."}, {"Title": "Premorbid personality in chronic fatigue syndrome as determined by the Temperament and Character Inventory.", "Abstract": "Using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), we examined personality characteristics in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) compared with healthy control subjects, and CFS patients with and without psychiatric diseases. There have been no previous reports assessing personality in CFS patients using the TCI.\nA total of 211 CFS patients and 90 control subjects completed the TCI and the Chalder Fatigue Scale questionnaires.\nCompared with control subjects, CFS patients demonstrated significantly lower premorbid Novelty Seeking, and higher Harm Avoidance and persistence. The fatigue score for CFS patients with psychiatric diseases was higher than that for CFS patients without psychiatric diseases. Patients with CFS with psychiatric diseases showed lower premorbid Self-Directedness when compared with CFS patients without psychiatric diseases. The fatigue score was negatively correlated with premorbid Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness, and positively correlated with Harm Avoidance among CFS patients.\nThis study supported the stereotyped image of CFS patients as perfectionists, which is similar to the Persistence score, and neurotics, which is similar to the Harm Avoidance score. Patients displaying greater neuroticisms and poorer social and communication skills, similar to the Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness scores, tend to have intercurrent psychiatry diseases and show more severe symptoms of CFS."}, {"Title": "Family therapy in the Forbidden City: a review of Chinese journals from 1978 to 2006.", "Abstract": "This article provides a glimpse into the development of family therapy in China, by reviewing family therapy articles written in Chinese and published in journals in China that are not, therefore, readily accessible to the international community. A content analysis of journals published between 1978 and 2006 revealed 199 family therapy articles in 109 Chinese journals. Most of the studies were conducted by psychiatry or medical professionals, and were based on general systems theory or a systemic family therapy model. The articles focused on the promotion of family therapy theories and interventions in China, but did not specify the application of theory to specific clientele or symptoms. After the year 2000, a threefold increase in the number of family therapy publications was noted. These papers included the introduction of additional theories, but did not include critical assessment of the applicability of Western family therapy models to Chinese families. The researchers noted an absence of articles that identified Chinese approaches to family therapy, and a paucity of papers on gender, professional reflection, and the therapy process. The article concludes that there is room for improvement in the quality of family therapy publications in China, and that gains may be made by interdisciplinary collaboration among academics and practitioners."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial issues in the cancer patient.", "Abstract": "Systematic review of the literature.\nTo identify psychosocial issues affecting patients with a diagnosis of a spinal column or cord tumor.\nUsing the keywords \"cancer communication,\" \"psychosocial care,\" \"cancer patient,\" and \"spine cancer patient,\" a review of the English literature was performed on Medline, EMBASE, and PsycInfo, a database of the psychology and psychiatry literature in the United States.

A study of Spanish population].", "Abstract": "Dissociative Disorder is relatively uncommon. It has been associated to the presence of traumatic events and especially to sexual abuse in childhood. Our study presents a clinical sample of 36 patients with Dissociative Disorder, prospectively evaluated with standardized scales in an outpatient department of general psychiatry. The sample is mainly made up of married (86.1%) women (34/36), from medium-low class with important comorbidity (38.9% affective disorders, 52.8% conversive disorders, 41.7% anxiety disorders and 38.9%, personality disorders). Our results show a high rate of childhood traumatic events (58.3%) and a background of sexual abuse (27.8%) in this population as well as other traumatic events in adulthood (55.6%). The prevalence of any traumatic event (27/36) is higher than in general spanish population. However sexual abuse is only slightly higher than the estimated rate of sexual abuse in childhood. Higher scores in the traumatic event scale are correlated with the severity of dissociative symptoms. Only traumatic sexual traumas in childhood correlate with the severity of dissociative features measured by the DES (Dissociative Experiences Scale). Age of the first traumatic event does not correlates with the severity of dissociative symptoms. A background of traumatic sexual abuse in childhood is the only factor related with higher presence of comorbid affective disorders and conversive disorders."}, {"Title": "A guide for medical information searches of bibliographic databases - psychiatric research as an example.", "Abstract": "Information overload, demanding work with strict time limits, and the extensive number of medical bibliographic databases and other research sources all underline the importance of being able to search for up-to-date information effectively.

Hope exists to improve the outcome of severe mental illness by improving the quality of mental health care and by implementing evidence-based consensus guidelines. Adherence to guideline recommendations should reduce costly complications and unnecessary procedures. To measure the quality of mental health care and disease outcome reliably and validly, quality indicators have to be available. These indicators of process and outcome quality should be easily measurable with routine data, should have a strong evidence base, and should be able to describe quality aspects across all sectors over the whole disease course. Measurement-based quality improvement will not be successful when it results in overwhelming documentation reducing the time for clinicians for active treatment interventions. To overcome difficulties in the implementation guidelines and to reduce guideline non-adherence, guideline implementation and quality assurance should be embedded in a complex programme consisting of multifaceted interventions using specific psychological methods for implementation, consultation by experts, and reimbursement of documentation efforts. There are a number of challenges to select appropriate quality indicators in order to allow a fair comparison across different approaches of care.

In general this is a meaningful development, which will principally have a positive impact on routine health care in psychiatry. But several related problems should not be ignored. So far consensus on an internationally accepted evidence graduation could not be reached, due to several difficulties related to this. A principle question is also whether it is sufficient to base EBM primarily on the results of phase III trials with their high internal validity. Restrictions to generalise findings of phase III trials suggest the need for additional sources of evidence, amongst others \"effectiveness\" studies and other kinds of phase IV studies with their less restrictive methodological standards. Attempts to regulate psychopharmacotherapy in the sense of evidence-based medicine come closer to their limits the more complex the clinical situation and the respective decision-making logic are. Even in times of evidence-based medicine we are faced with the situation that a large part of complex clinical decision-making in psychopharmacotherapy still relies more on personal clinical experience and a group consensus about clinical experience, traditions and belief systems than on results of efficacy oriented phase III and effectiveness-oriented phase IV clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Brain imaging: on the way toward a therapeutic discipline.", "Abstract": "Brain imaging has proven its importance as an essential tool of neuroscientific research, especially in psychiatry.

First we discuss the question of whether there is and has been such an impact. The answer is yes: different conceptions of free will have inspired different systems of law and forensic psychiatry, as becomes clear when looking at the accountability doctrine as compared to the unique Swedish system rejecting this doctrine. However, there is no necessary connection between doctrines of responsibility and conceptions of free will, since the former primarily says something about when someone should be held responsible and the latter says something about when someone really is free in a sense relevant to responsibility. This leads to the second question: should conceptions of free will have an impact on law and forensic psychiatry? We argue: that they should not, given the implausibility the normative theory retributivism, which posits a direct connection between free will and punishment. More importantly, questions of free will are complicated and unresolved philosophical issues that are better left out of the everyday decision-making incumbent on the legal and psychiatric systems. Instead, we recommend using an empirically useful and gradual conception of autonomy to facilitate the determination of legal responsibility. This autonomy conception, being neutral on the question of free will, eliminates the need to take a stand on it."}, {"Title": "[A transcultural study of Taijin-kyofu and social phobia--differences of experiences of eye communication between Japanese and German patients].", "Abstract": "The transcultural psychiatry of \"Taijin-kyofu\" methodologically involves two problems.

By examining the cultural backgrounds of this difference, it was suggested that not only the nominative subject who does something in the actual mode but also the dative subject to whom a becoming process appears in the middle mode should be more closely studied."}, {"Title": "Political abuse of psychiatry--an historical overview.", "Abstract": "The use of psychiatry for political purposes has been a major subject of debate within the world psychiatric community during the second half of the 20th century. The issue became prominent in the 1970s and 1980s due to the systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union, where approximately one-third of the political prisoners were locked up in psychiatric hospitals. The issue caused a major rift within the World Psychiatric Association, from which the Soviets were forced to withdraw in 1983. They returned conditionally in 1989. Political abuse of psychiatry took also place in other socialist countries and on a systematic scale in Romania, and during the first decade of the 21st century, it became clear that systematic political abuse of psychiatry is also happening in the People's Republic of China. The article discusses the historical background to these abuses and concludes that the issue had a major impact on the development of concepts regarding medical ethics and the professional responsibility of physicians."}, {"Title": "[Case payments in hospital psychiatry in the USA. The Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Prospective Payment System (IPF PPS)].", "Abstract": "In Germany the introduction of a prospective payment system (PPS) is intended for inpatients hospitalised in psychiatric facilities. We investigate the various elements of the Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities (IFP PPS) which was established in the USA in 2005 with respect to their potential to be incorporated into a german PPS.\nThe most important elements of IFP PPS (impact of diagnosis, comorbidity, patient age, per diem adjustment for length of stay, various other adjustment factors like facility characteristics and geographical factors) are presented. The IFP PPS was especially designed for the requirements of psychiatric inpatient facilities in the USA. Complexity of the individual elements of the PPS appears to be manageable. However, various elements, e. g. the facility based adjustments including wage index or rural location and cost of living adjustments will not be applicable to countries other than the US. The 15 diagnosis related groups of the IFP PPS system refer to ICD-9 which is less differentiated than the ICD-10 which is in use in Germany, thus these psychiatric DRG will not be compatible under conditions of a german PPS. The per diem adjustment for length of stay is the predominating element of the IFP PPS, relation to effort/performance is insufficiently represented.\nSome elements of the IFP PPS may be applicable to a german prospective payment system for psychiatric inpatient facilities, especially with respect to the rules for per diem adjustment for length of stay and for handling of cases with frequent discharge and readmission of patients. Altogether a stronger representation of elements of performance of inpatient facilities seems to be desirable."}, {"Title": "Exploring barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice in psychiatry to inform health policy: a focus group based study.", "Abstract": "This study aims to explore the obstacles to Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) experienced by Belgian Dutch-speaking psychiatrists. We used an inductive, qualitative research strategy. Thirty-nine psychiatrists participated in five focus groups organised between September 2004 and September 2006. Data-analysis was guided by a 'grounded theory approach'. Three major themes emerged from the data: (1) Characteristics of evidence, including the lack of (use of) evidence and the applicability of evidence; (2) Characteristics of other partners in mental health care, including government, patients and drug companies and (3) Discipline-related barriers, including the complexity of diagnoses, the importance of the therapeutic relationship and personal experience, and the different schools of thoughts. A problem tree was developed, linking all obstacles. Although context-specific, the problem tree can assist policy makers working in health care systems with similar characteristics in formulating objectives and developing strategies that facilitate EBP in the field of psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Genetic overlap between autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "There is strong evidence that genetic factors make substantial contributions to the etiology of autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, with heritability estimates being at least 80% for each. These illnesses have complex inheritance, with multiple genetic and environmental factors influencing disease risk; however, in psychiatry, complex genetics is further compounded by phenotypic complexity. Autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are effectively syndromic constellations of symptoms that define groups of patients with broadly similar outcomes and responses to treatment. As such the diagnostic categories are likely to be heterogeneous and the boundaries between them somewhat arbitrary. Recent applications of whole-genome technologies have discovered rare copy number variants and common single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with risk of developing these disorders. Furthermore, these studies have shown an overlap between the genetic loci and even alleles that predispose to the different phenotypes. The findings have several implications. First, they show that copy number variations are likely to be important risk factors for autism and schizophrenia, whereas common single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles have a role in all disorders. Second, they imply that there are specific genetic loci and alleles that increase an individual's risk of developing any of these disorders. Finally, the findings suggest that some of the specific genetic loci implicated so far encode proteins, such as neurexins and neuroligins, that function in synaptic development and plasticity, and therefore may represent a common biological pathway for these disorders."}, {"Title": "Delirium: issues in diagnosis and management.", "Abstract": "Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness, cognition and perception that occurs frequently in medically ill patients. Although it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, it is often not recognized and treated by physicians. Literature searches were conducted using MEDLINE with the following keywords/ phrases: delirium, acute confusion and management. Additional articles identified by hand-searching in major journals of medicine and psychiatry, and a review of references cited within these sources supplemented the search. In this article, the available published literature regarding the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of delirium is systematically reviewed. Prevention and treatment strategies do not need to be complex or expensive but require well-coordinated interventions from multiple disciplines, including nursing, psychiatry, neurology and primary care, as well as the cooperation and significant effort of family and friends. Atypical antipsychotic agents offer some advantages over haloperidol and in a limited number of studies appear safe and effective for delirium."}, {"Title": "Quantification of brain macrostates using dynamical nonstationarity of physiological time series.", "Abstract": "The brain shows complex, nonstationarity temporal dynamics, with abrupt micro- and macrostate transitions during its information processing. Detecting and characterizing these transitions in dynamical states of the brain is a critical issue in the field of neuroscience and psychiatry. In the current study, a novel method is proposed to quantify brain macrostates (e.g., sleep stages or cognitive states) from shifts of dynamical microstates or dynamical nonstationarity. A ``dynamical microstate'' is a temporal unit of the information processing in the brain with fixed dynamical parameters and specific spatial distribution. In this proposed approach, a phase-space-based dynamical dissimilarity map (DDM) is used to detect transitions between dynamically stationary microstates in the time series, and Tsallis time-dependent entropy is applied to quantify dynamical patterns of transitions in the DDM. We demonstrate that the DDM successfully detects transitions between microstates of different temporal dynamics in the simulated physiological time series against high levels of noise. Based on the assumption of nonlinear, deterministic brain dynamics, we also demonstrate that dynamical nonstationarity analysis is useful to quantify brain macrostates (sleep stages I, II, III, IV, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep) from sleep EEGs with an overall accuracy of 77%. We suggest that dynamical nonstationarity is a useful tool to quantify macroscopic mental states (statistical integration) of the brain using dynamical transitions at the microscopic scale in physiological data."}, {"Title": "Treatment regimes in a psychiatric hospital and apparent contradictions: report from field work in a lock-up ward illustrated with a constructed case.", "Abstract": "The medical approach dominates in Norwegian psychiatry, but mental health nurses and other ward staff hold that milieu therapy constitutes an additional and important treatment approach for psychiatric patients. In this study, we wanted to explore these approaches as they are implemented in inpatient treatment. We conducted a 9-month ethnographic study in two lock-up psychiatric wards in a Norwegian psychiatric hospital. In this article, we present a constructed case, Mary, to illustrate the voices, experiences, and perspectives of patients and staff as observed primarily in the patients' smoking room, the corridor, and the staffroom. From the perspective of staff, we identified at least two professional perspectives concerning patients' daily life: a strong medical-psychiatric view and a weaker therapeutic milieu, which seemed difficult to implement. When considering the view of people in care, we observed that patients' experiences and points of view occurred and remained to a large degree in their smoking room, and patients seemed to have little impact on their own treatment programmes. This stands in sharp contrast to patients' legal rights to participate in any important decisions regarding their treatment and to the espoused person-centred orientation in health care today."}, {"Title": "A review of long-acting medications for ADHD in Canada.", "Abstract": "To review and comment on the long-acting medications presently marketed in Canada for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in terms of design, composition, mode of action and efficacy including other long-acting products that are not yet available in Canada.\nA literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and PubMed with additional information gathered from other sources.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and the Canadian Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Resource Alliance (CADDRA) while endorsing the stimulants as first line medications to treat ADHD also recommended the use of long-acting once-a-day medication for better efficacy, convenience and adherence. Most studies rated the controlled release and the immediate release medications as similar in efficacy. However, long-acting medication was shown to be superior in terms of remission rates.\nWhen a child is receiving a long-acting medication for treatment of ADHD, he may feel less stigmatized, is more likely to be adherent and achieve remission.

Data analysis was conducted using kappa statistics\nThe hospital computerized database consisted of 264 patients who were born from 1983 to 1985 and had had a diagnostic assessment at least twice over a 17-year period. The highest percentages of stable cases were of Mood disorders and Psychosis. Behavioural disorders and Anxiety disorders had lower percentages of stable cases but significant Kappa values suggesting fewer cases were stable but also fewer new cases were added. Substance related disorders had very low percentages and non-significant Kappa value. When divided into three groups based on the delay between first and second diagnosis, stability of diagnosis degraded sharply with time.\nThe results of this study show poor stability for all diagnoses, however the trend seemed to follow that reported in previous literature where moods disorders and schizophrenia showed more stability than other diagnoses. Explanations are provided for the results. A well-designed prospective longitudinal study utilizing structured diagnostic interviews to assign DSM-IV TR diagnosis from child hood to adulthood would improve the reliability of diagnoses and perhaps time for crystallization of psychopathology and clarification into more discrete diagnostic entities."}, {"Title": "Neuro syphilis: Portrayals by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.", "Abstract": "The developments in neuro syphilis in the 19 th century are integral parts of the history of psychiatry.

This article considers the various ways that the notion of reflective practice and reflective supervision is used in different disciplines and defines our understanding of its place in IMH training. The program content and delivery emphasize the development of reflective skills in students in a number of ways. These include a supportive relationship-based approach to training; a 12-month infant observation which provides students with the opportunity to understand early development, develop observational skills about infants and families as well as their own responses to the infant and family; ongoing clinical supervision and development of a reflective clinical journal; and study and assessment tasks that require the student to integrate new knowledge into clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Cultural neuroscience and psychopathology: prospects for cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is a long tradition that seeks to understand the impact of culture on the causes, form, treatment, and outcome of psychiatric disorders. An early, colonialist literature attributed cultural characteristics and variations in psychopathology and behavior to deficiencies in the brains of colonized peoples. Contemporary research in social and cultural neuroscience holds the promise of moving beyond these invidious comparisons to a more sophisticated understanding of cultural variations in brain function relevant to psychiatry. To achieve this, however, we need better models of the nature of psychopathology and of culture itself. Culture is not simply a set of traits or characteristics shared by people with a common geographic, historical, or ethnic background. Current anthropology understands culture as fluid, flexible systems of discourse, institutions, and practices, which individuals actively use for self-fashioning and social positioning. Globalization introduces new cultural dynamics and demands that we rethink culture in relation to a wider domain of evolving identities, knowledge, and practice. Psychopathology is not reducible to brain dysfunction in either its causes, mechanisms, or expression. In addition to neuropsychiatric disorders, the problems that people bring to psychiatrists may result from disorders in cognition, the personal and social meanings of experience, and the dynamics of interpersonal interactions or social systems and institutions. The shifting meanings of culture and psychopathology have implications for efforts to apply cultural neuroscience to psychiatry. We consider how cultural neuroscience can refine use of culture and its role in psychopathology using the example of adolescent aggression as a symptom of conduct disorder."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric treatments in dermatology: an update.", "Abstract": "There is a considerable degree of connection between psychiatry and dermatology.

We aimed to investigate the association between risperidone-induced weight gain, leptin concentration, and the leptin gene (LEP) -2548G/A variants in youths.\nMedically healthy 7- to 17-year-old children and adolescents, in extended naturalistic treatment with risperidone, were recruited through pediatric psychiatry clinics. Anthropometric measures and laboratory testing were conducted. Growth and medication history was obtained from the medical record. The effect of the LEP genotypes on leptin concentration and on the slopes of the weight and body mass index (BMI) Z-score curves before and after the onset of risperidone treatment was investigated .\nIn 74 individuals, chronically treated with risperidone, the A allele was associated with higher leptin concentration at low weight and BMI Z-scores. There was no effect of the LEP genotypes on weight or BMI Z-scores before risperidone was started. Afterwards, however, the A-allele carriers showed a steeper rate of increase in weight and BMI Z-scores. As a result, the GG-genotype carriers were 2.5 times less likely to be overweight/obese (i.e. having a BMI above the 85th percentile). This genetic effect on risperidone-associated weight gain did not extend to weight loss related to psychostimulants.\nThe LEP - 2548G/A variants seem to moderate the weight-altering effect of risperidone but not psychostimulants. This may be related to genetic differences in tissue sensitivity to leptin, resulting in differential body composition."}, {"Title": "Risky behaviour and patient safety: a critical culturist perspective.", "Abstract": "This paper aims to utilise cultural theory of risk to provide a broad analytic framework for examining how risk is constructed within the dominant discourses around patient safety within the domain of psychiatry. It also seeks to examine notions of blame and to consider the possibility of the creation of a no-blame culture.\nThe empirical element of the paper draws on qualitative interviews with a sample of psychiatrists to explore how culture may give rise to different perceptions and responses in respect of \"risky behaviour\" and \"safe practice\".\nThe paper discusses how psychiatry may be differentiated from other branches of medicine and concludes that the cultural grouping that appears to be most apposite in respect of psychiatrists is the egalitarian culture. However, changes in the NHS are resulting in the imposition of an individualistic culture on the community of psychiatrists with the effect that behaviours are being adopted as measures to avoid potential blame.\nThe paper finds that if the NHS is to improve patient safety then it must recognise that it is not possible to create a no-blame culture and, therefore, it is more important to consider which type of culture will impact most positively on patient safety. It appears that psychiatrists are being compelled to adopt an individualistic culture when an egalitarian culture would be more advantageous for patient safety.\nIn contrast with the methodological individualism of the current safety orthodoxy which interprets risk as an objective and measurable phenomenon, the paper draws on cultural theory of risk to develop a critical perspective on current safety policy and to explore how \"risky\" and \"safe\" practices are socially constructed in the context of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging of aggressive and violent behaviour in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "In recent years, a number of functional and structural neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural bases of aggressive and violent behaviour in children and adolescents. Most functional neuroimaging studies have persued the hypothesis that pathological aggression is a consequence of deficits in the neural circuits involved in emotion processing. There is converging evidence for abnormal neural responses to emotional stimuli in youths with a propensity towards aggressive behaviour. In addition, recent neuroimaging work has suggested that aggressive behaviour is also associated with abnormalities in neural processes that subserve both the inhibitory control of behaviour and the flexible adaptation of behaviour in accord with reinforcement information. Structural neuroimaging studies in children and adolescents with conduct problems are still scarce, but point to deficits in brain structures in volved in the processing of social information and in the regulation of social and goal-directed behaviour. The indisputable progress that this research field has made in recent years notwithstanding, the overall picture is still rather patchy and there are inconsistencies between studies that await clarification. Despite this, we attempt to provide an integrated view on the neural abnormalities that may contribute to various forms of juvenile aggression and violence, and discuss research strategies that may help to provide a more profound understanding of these important issues in the future."}, {"Title": "Relating with migrants: ethnopsychiatry and psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "After an historical review of cultural anthropology, transcultural psychiatry and ethno psychiatry, we will examine the literature on intervention with migrants within mental health system.

After the security of lab values and medical tests that characterize much of medical practice, the ambiguity of seemingly subjectively obtained information characteristic of psychiatry often leaves students somewhat uncomfortable with how psychiatric diagnoses are made and understood. This is, at its root, an issue of epistemology: How do we know what we say we know? Psychiatry can seem \"fuzzy\" to medical students, and it behooves psychiatry educators to explicitly address this discomfort but, at the same time, not apologize for the differences between psychiatry and \"the rest of medicine.\" In this article, the author strives to emphasize that this kind of epistemological challenge is ancient and esteemed, represented to some extent in the writings of Plato (who believed that we measure the world by comparing our experience with our innate sense of what we know is true) and Aristotle (who insisted that what we know is based largely on what we can measurably experience). Using humor, an imagined conversation among these ancient philosophers and a modern psychiatrist-medical educator might help to dispel some of the discomfort that psychiatry education sometimes engenders among future physicians. The author presents an example of such a conversation. After a brief discussion of the epistemological differences characteristic of Platonic and Aristotelian views, students could be shown a script similar to the example script and then asked to discuss and debate the arguments elucidated. Perhaps even better, students could be asked to write their own debates based on how Plato or Aristotle would be expected to behave."}, {"Title": "[Seclusion: a medical and political problem].", "Abstract": "Seclusion, i.e. locking up psychiatric patients in safety rooms as a coercive measure, is common practice in the Netherlands.

Since 2006, a nationwide project aimed at the reduction of the number and duration of seclusion episodes by 10% a year has yielded positive results in one-third of mental hospitals. The Dutch Minister of Health recently advocated a further reduction of seclusion rates by 50% over the next year. We argue that short-term abolition of seclusion is an illusion and that the safety of patients and employees on closed psychiatric wards must be guaranteed.

I argue that the medicalized response to an expectation for normativity demonstrates the convergence between psychiatric and palliative interventions. Based on a historically informed perspective of psychiatric interventions in the field of pain medicine, I examine the use of psychiatric medications for pain syndromes today and evaluate the interface between depression, chronic pain, and terminal illness. While not detracting from the medical imperative to alleviate pain, I question the usage of social criteria and normative judgments in the clinical decision of how to treat pain.

The quality of technical care is often taken for granted by older patients, and good or bad experiences are described more in terms of relational aspects of care. Older patients in hospital may feel worthless, fearful or not in control of what happens, especially if they have impaired cognition, or communication difficulties. Three key features of care consistently mediated these negative feelings and were linked to more positive experiences: \"creating communities: connect with me\", \"maintaining identity: see who I am\" and \"sharing decision-making: include me\".\nThese findings highlight the perspectives of older people and their relatives on the delivery of personalized and dignified care in acute settings. They lend support to previous calls for relationship-centred approaches to care and provide a useful experience-based framework for practice for those involved in care for older people."}, {"Title": "[Perception and use of an electronic medical record system by professionals of a public psychiatric hospital].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the interest taken by the health care providers in the electronic medical file and its use within the quality improvement process.\nOur institution is a 204-bed psychiatric hospital, employing 328 professionals and comprising three sectors: six units of complete hospitalisation (102 beds), one unit of week hospitalisation (15 beds), one unit of emergency (7 beds) and one unit of night hospitalisation (15 beds). Three extrahospital structures include the day hospitalisation (65 places), the medicopsychological centers (CMP) and the part-time therapeutic reception centers (CATTP) of the three sectors.\nWe conducted face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with health care providers of a public psychiatric hospital. All the solicited people agreed to answer the investigation. The interviews were conducted until no new ideas emerged in the content analysis performed in real time, comprising 60 care providers: 10 psychiatrists, 42 nurses and eight paramedical professionals. Content analysis was performed by two members of the steering committee who were skilled in textual analysis. A descriptive analysis was also performed. The variables were described by proportions and means. The proportions were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test where appropriate. A two-tailed P-value of greater than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 13.0.\nNinety-six percent of the interviewed subjects used the electronic medical file. The average number of daily use was seven (S.D.=5). Sixty-seven percent had a favorable opinion of the electronic medical file. Physicians had more frequent favorable opinions than nurses who considered that electronic medical files cannot capture real nursing activity. Health care providers considered that electronic medical file could be associated with improved quality of care, but two points should be taken into account: the increased documentation time (slow system response, multiple screens, the lack of computer knowledge, the absence of bedside documentation technology...) and dysfunctions in the information processing system. This could have an impact on documentation completeness, and quality and could also lead to a reduction of time devoted to care.\nThis study proposes tracks of improvement in the use of the DPIP. In spite of this, a true debate must be initiated on these new information systems in psychiatry since their real objectives can be perceived as ambiguous, so that programs of clarification, education and reinsurance can be set-up."}, {"Title": "[Heart rate variability. Applications in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The autonomic nervous system sends messages through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the cardioaccelerating center of the heart, the lungs (increased ventilatory rhythm and dilatation of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery contraction). It releases adrenaline and noradrenaline. As opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, it innervates the cardiomoderator center of the heart, the lungs (slower ventilatory rhythm and contraction of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery dilatation). It uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter. Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions function antagonistically to preserve a dynamic modulation of vital functions. These systems act on the heart respectively through the stellar ganglion and the vagus nerve. The interaction of these messages towards the sinoauricular node is responsible for normal cardiac variability, which can be measured by monitoring heart rate variability (HRV). Heart rate is primarily controlled by vagal activity. Sensorial data coming from the heart are fed back to the central nervous system. HRV is an indicator of both how the central nervous system regulates the autonomic nervous system, and of how peripheral neurons feed information back to the central level. HRV measures are derived by estimating the variation among a set of temporally ordered interbeat intervals. The state of perfect symmetry, which, in medical parlance, is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), can be described as a state of cardiac coherence. Obtaining a series of interbeat intervals requires a continuous measure of heart rate, typically electrocardiography (ECG). Commercially available software is then used to define the interbeat intervals within an ECG recording.\nThe autonomic nervous system is highly adaptable and allows the organism to maintain its balance when experiencing strain or stress. Conversely, a lack of flexibility and a rigid system can lead to somatic and psychological pathologies. Several studies have shown a link between reduced HRV in postmyocardial infarction patients and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Recently, studies indicate that patients with depression and anxiety disorders exhibit abnormally low HRV compared with non-psychiatric controls. Reduced HRV seems indicate decreased cardiac vagal tone and elevated sympathetic activity in anxious and depressive patients and would reflect deficit in flexibility of emotional physiological mechanisms. A few studies have also revealed that biofeedback using respiratory control, relaxation and meditation techniques can increase HRV. For now, there is insufficient data to determine if paced respiration or subjective relaxation is necessary or sufficient for the efficacy of HRV biofeedback. Although the literature is modest, this review suggests that the use of biofeedback with relaxation and meditation approaches may result in increased HRV and parasympathetic activity. Limitations of the review literature have also been considered to identify areas for future research."}, {"Title": "Can economic evaluation in telemedicine be trusted? A systematic review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine has been advocated as an effective means to provide health care services over a distance. Systematic information on costs and consequences has been called for to support decision-making in this field. This paper provides a review of the quality, validity and generalisability of economic evaluations in telemedicine.\nA systematic literature search in all relevant databases was conducted and forms the basis for addressing these issues. Only articles published in peer-reviewed journals and written in English in the period from 1990 to 2007 were analysed. The literature search identified 33 economic evaluations where both costs (resource use) and outcomes (non-resource consequences) were measured.\nThis review shows that economic evaluations in telemedicine are highly diverse in terms of both the study context and the methods applied. The articles covered several medical specialities ranging from cardiology and dermatology to psychiatry. The studies analysed telemedicine in home care, and in primary and secondary care settings using a variety of different technologies including videoconferencing, still-images and monitoring (store-and-forward telemedicine). Most studies used multiple outcome measures and analysed the effects using disaggregated cost-consequence frameworks. Objectives, study design, and choice of comparators were mostly well reported. The majority of the studies lacked information on perspective and costing method, few used general statistics and sensitivity analysis to assess validity, and even fewer used marginal analysis.\nAs this paper demonstrates, the majority of the economic evaluations reviewed were not in accordance with standard evaluation techniques. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for this and to address how economic evaluation in telemedicine best can take advantage of local constraints and at the same time produce valid and generalisable results."}, {"Title": "Suicide, mental illness, and psychiatry in Queensland, 1890-1950.", "Abstract": "This article contributes to the history of psychiatry by examining the practice of institutional and community psychiatry in early-twentieth-century Queensland. The source material for this article emerged from a larger project on the history of suicide and a review of the publications and lectures of the state's leading psychiatrist, John Bostock. The paper comes to several conclusions. First, asylums responded to the diversity of illnesses by making case-based judgments about the duration of treatment and the possibility of paroles. Many suicidal patients were not locked up for long periods if their ailments showed promise of alleviation. Second, we suggest that in the interwar period private practice was vibrant and worked interactively with traditional asylum committal. Third, even in rural areas there was awareness by the 1930s of urban-based alternatives to the asylums. Finally, we found evidence of attentive families who pursued several avenues of care for their loved-ones. Ultimately, the findings point to a complex mixed marketplace in psychiatric care during this time period."}, {"Title": "Drug evaluation and the permissive principle: continuities and contradictions between standards and practices in antidepressant regulation.", "Abstract": "Pharmaceuticals are not permitted on to the market unless they are granted regulatory approval. The regulatory process is, therefore, crucial in whether or not a drug is widely prescribed. Regulatory agencies have developed standards of performance that pharmaceuticals are supposed to meet before entering the market. Regulation of technologies is often discussed by reference to the precautionary principle. In contrast, this paper develops the concept of the 'permissive principle' as a way of understanding the departure of regulators' practices from standards of drug efficacy to which regulatory agencies themselves subscribe. By taking a case study of antidepressant regulation in the UK and the USA, the mechanisms of permissive regulatory practices are examined. An STS methodology of both spatial (international) and temporal comparisons of regulatory practices with regulatory standards is employed to identify the nature and extent of the permissive regulation. It is found that the permissive principle was adopted by drug regulators in the UK and the USA, but more so by the former than the latter. Evidently, permissive regulation, which favours the commercial interests of the drug manufacturer, but is contrary to the interests of patients, may penetrate to the heart of regulatory science. On the other hand, permissive regulation of specific drugs should not be regarded as an inevitable result of marketing strategies and concomitant networks deployed by powerful pharmaceutical companies, because the extent of permissive regulation may vary according to the intra-institutional normative commitments of regulators to uphold their technical standards against the commercial interests of the manufacturer. Likely sociological factors that can account for such permissive regulatory practices are 'corporate bias', secrecy and excessive regulatory trust in the pharmaceutical industry in the UK, political expediency and ideological capture in the USA, combined in both countries with some regulatory deference to the clinical autonomy of the psychiatry profession."}, {"Title": "Cost-effectiveness of interventions based on physical exercise in the treatment of various diseases: a systematic literature review.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to review studies reporting cost-effectiveness of exercise-based interventions in treatment of various diseases.\nSystematic literature search using several databases. Abstracts initially screened independently by two authors, full-text articles again evaluated by two authors, who decided whether an article should be included. Included were scientifically valid articles describing controlled studies that included an exercise-based intervention in the treatment of an established medical condition, and also reported on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, or its effect on the utilization of health services. Quality was assessed with an established approach.\nA total of 914 articles were identified, of them 151 were obtained for closer review. Sixty-five articles describing sixty-one studies were included. Most (82 percent) were randomized trials. Twenty-eight studies dealt with musculoskeletal disorders, fifteen with cardiology, four with rheumatic diseases, four with pulmonary diseases, three with urinary incontinence, and two with vascular disorders. There was one study each in the fields of oncology, chronic fatigue, endocrinology, psychiatry, and neurology. Exercise interventions in musculoskeletal disorders were deemed to be cost-effective in 54 percent, in cardiology in 60 percent, and in rheumatic diseases in 75 percent of the cases. There was some evidence that exercise might be cost-effective in intermittent claudication, breast cancer patients, diabetes, and schizophrenia.\nThe number of studies assessing cost-effectiveness of exercise interventions in various diseases is still limited. The results show large variation but suggest that some exercise interventions can be cost-effective. Most convincing evidence was found for rehabilitation of cardiac and back pain patients; however, even in these cases, the evidence was partly contradictory."}, {"Title": "Adjustment disorder: epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment.", "Abstract": "Adjustment disorder was introduced into the psychiatric classification systems almost 30 years ago, although the concept was recognized for many years before that. In DSM-IV, six subtypes are described based on the predominant symptoms, but no further diagnostic criteria are offered to assist the clinician. These are common conditions, especially in primary care and in consultation liaison psychiatry, where the prevalence ranges from 11% to 18% and from 10% to 35%, respectively. Yet they are under-researched, possibly due to the failure of some of the common diagnostic tools to allow for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Among the tools that incorporate adjustment disorder, the concordance between the clinical and interview diagnosis is very poor, with the diagnosis being made more commonly in clinical practice than the diagnostic tools allow for. Adjustment disorder is found in all cultures and in all age groups. The presence of a causal stressor is essential before a diagnosis of adjustment disorder can be made, while the symptoms vary and include those that are found in other common psychiatric disorders. It is also important to distinguish adjustment disorder from normal reactions to stressful events. Adjustment disorders are difficult to distinguish from normal responses to life's stressors, while the distinction from major depression also poses a classificatory conundrum since both are conceptually different. Adjustment disorder is a diagnosis based on the longitudinal course of symptoms in the context of a stressor, while a diagnosis of major depression is a cross-sectional one based on symptom numbers. Treatments consist mainly of brief interventions, while pharmacotherapy is limited to the symptomatic management of anxiety or insomnia. There are no robust studies demonstrating benefits from antidepressants. However, the number of studies of either type of intervention is very limited."}, {"Title": "Positions in doctors' questions during psychiatric interviews.", "Abstract": "In this article I apply the concept of positioning to the analysis of 15 initial psychiatric interviews. I argue that through their questions the psychiatrists-in-training impose positions requiring the patients to gaze at themselves and their actual problems from particular perspectives. I point to three such positions: (a) the position of the observing assessor, from which it is expected that the patients will make a detached assessment of themselves or their problems, (b) the position of the informing witness, which requires the patients only to verify the information about themselves, and (c) the marginal one, the position of the experiencing narrator, from which talk about experiences and problems is expected. I explore the roots and consequences of the positions, with particular attention toward objectivization of the patients' experiences in the dominant witness and assessor positions. I conclude with a discussion about the medical model in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "'A disgrace to a civilised community': colonial psychiatry and the visit of Edward Mapother to South Asia, 1937-8.", "Abstract": "In 1937, Edward Mapother, Medical Superintendent of the Maudsley Hospital in London, took a trip around the mental hospitals of Britain's dominions in South Asia.

We notice a gap between the orientations of these networks and the funding scheme forecast in the framework of the LAMal. In order to preserve the progressions of these last years and to avoid the negative effects of a too restrictive funding act for the assignment of the public psychiatry, the planification must result in a consensus between the state, the insurances and the multiple actors of the mental health.

What this type of research offers can be illustrated by the cohort study of migrant patients without health insurance who consulted the Department of Psychiatry of the Vaudois university medical center (CHUV) in 2008. While giving greater visibilty to the psychological suffering and social distress of these patients, the study also enabled the authors to determine which clinical procedures were actually offered to these patients and the amount these procedures cost the department. The small number of cases that were identified as well as their uneven distribution amongst the different services of the department suggest that considerable efforts must still be made to improve access for this population to public psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of nursing processes in psychiatry--a field study project].", "Abstract": "Professional nursing care can be characterised as a support in handling of and coping with activities of daily living. While somatic care mainly focusses on the compensation of physical complaints, the needs in the field of psychiatry leading to nursing interventions are quite different. The descriptive and explorative study presented here aims at finding typical needs for psychiatric nursing care and characteristic intervention patterns of nurses. Within the setting of a qualitative field study in an anthroposophically oriented hospital for mental disorders heuristic methods (Grounded Theory) were applied to evaluate those nursing events which induced a unique and specific nursing benefit. The narrative data from 59 episodes generated this way yielded four typical patterns of interpretation of nursing needs: integration versus autonomy and routine nursing versus crisis intervention. Our results are limited by the fact that only data of one hospital were analysed. However, due to quality control of internal and external validity, and adjustment of the results towards current findings it can be concluded that the study results have a heuristic potential for describing and precising other settings within and outside psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "DSM-IV-TR cultural formulation of psychiatric cases: Two proposals for clinicians.", "Abstract": "This article reviews some limitations of the current guideline for the DSM-IV-TR Cultural Formulation (CF) from the perspective of psychiatric practice that are based on the author's experience conducting doctoral courses on cultural psychiatry from 1996 to 2007 in the Department of Psychiatry at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (Spain). Two proposals are presented for facilitating use of the CF by general clinicians. These proposals offer a procedure for embedding only the most relevant clinical information in a psychiatric history, followed by a brief cultural formulation.

However, patients reported problems with defining their own culture and providing explanations of illness and therapists had difficulty identifying culturally-based difficulties in the clinical relationship. Additional information was needed about working with interpreters, therapists' attitudes towards the culture of the patient and towards their own culture, patients' previous experiences with discrimination and inaccessibility of care, gender issues, and specific cultures and subcultures.

During that year, two expert papers dealing with the application of the Mendelian Theory were published in Germany and in the United States. Only a decade after the \"rediscovery\" of the Mendelian Laws simultaneous efforts were being made to better understand the hereditary transmission process of mental diseases by means of the Mendelian Theory. The results of these efforts were disparate. While in the United States, the Mendelian theory was used to support the polymorphous theory of the hereditary transmission process of mental diseases, by which a common hereditary origin of mental diseases was assumed, the introduction of Mendelism in psychiatry in Germany focused on corroborating Emil Kraepelin's concept of a disease entity. The Mendelian Theory especially helps to underpin the idea of a specific genetic origin of the clinical diseases described by Kraepelin. AS German and North American psychiatric genetics were inspired by diverse disease and genetic concepts, so too was their use of the Mendelian Theory very divergent. Research linked to the use of the Mendelian Theory was both dissimilar and hotly contested. This was due to the fact that it was difficult, if not impossible to identify Mendelian patterns by studying the hereditary transmission profess.

The authors document the creation and 5-year progress of the Research Innovation and Scholarship in Education (RISE) program at the largest psychiatry department in Canada.\nThe authors analyzed the RISE archive of early proposals for enhancing scholarship in the department, the 5-year plan, annual reports, and curricular vitae of members and also gathered testimonials from inaugural residents and fellows of the program. Materials were analyzed using Boyer's framework of scholarship.\nOrganizationally, RISE has embodied all four tenets of Boyer's model of scholarship. The program has allowed education research, teaching, and creative professional development to flourish in the department, and there are considerably fewer barriers to pursuing an education career path. However, as the program expands, more work needs to be done to increase funding and protected time so that even more residents, fellows, and faculty can engage in educational scholarship.\nEnhancing medical education scholarship through a model that actively integrates research with teaching, creative professional development, and mentorship can help the trajectories of faculty and students wishing to make education a priority in their careers."}, {"Title": "Reworking therapeutic landscapes: the spatiality of an 'alternative' self-help group.", "Abstract": "Since Gesler first introduced the concept in 1992, the language of 'therapeutic landscapes' has attained a core position in the toolkit of health/place studies. Whilst many authors using the term acknowledge that therapeutic landscapes are often also spaces of contestation, few if any have extended this to incorporate a serious critique of therapy itself. In this article, I use the case study of an 'alternative' psychiatric survivor (self-help) group in the north of England to attempt just this. Based on a ten month period of ethnography, I engage with the spaces - meeting places and venues - occupied by the group, focusing on the dilapidated and reputedly dangerous city park where the group hosts its most regular meetings. Three qualities of these spaces were found to be particularly embraced by the group: spaces of agency and appropriation; a space in the world; and a non-technical relation with space. The article uses these three themes to explore how the unconventional spaces of the group are not mere products of marginality but a serious aspect of mobilising the dissident and 'anti-psychiatric' recovery sought by its members. Through attending to what the survivors' found helpful in the park, a more sensitive rendition of 'anti-psychiatry' as it relates to the group is developed. The therapeutic landscapes framework as put forward by Gesler retains currency in highlighting the importance of place to the processes and identity of the group. However, it is also suggested that the 'dissident topophilias' of the survivors express a critique of current therapeutic landscapes thinking, challenging the supposition that it is the planned, the pleasant and the professional that provide the best backdrops for recovery."}, {"Title": "[Epidemiologic study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from autopsy-confirmed cases].", "Abstract": "We investigated epidemiologic data from 61 cases of autopsy-confirmed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Dura mater-associated CJD cases and familial CJD cases were excluded. There were 34 male and 27 female cases, with an average age at onset of 66.0 +/- 10.5 years (range 27 to 89). At onset of CJD, 1 case was aged in the 20's and 1 in 30's, but there were no cases aged in the 40's. In 6 cases, age at onset was in the 80's. There was no significant difference in relation to the age at onset between males and females, averaging 66.2 +/- 12.4 years (range 27 to 89), and 65.9 7.5 years (range 53 to 82), respectively. Two cases had been employed as medical workers (a medical technologist and a nurses' aide) but neither had an apparent history of contact with CJD patients. No cases in the study had either family history of CJD or apparent contact with CJD patients. Ten cases had a history of hypertension, 5 cases had a history of diabetes mellitus, 2 cases had a history of malaria and 1 case had suffered from atomic bomb exposure. Twenty-one cases had operation history, including 2 cases of an operation involving the central nervous system. One case had a skull-base fracture operation 19 years before the onset of CJD and the other case had an atlantoaxial subluxation operation 11 years before the onset of CJD; there was no transplantation of dura mater graft in either operation. There was one case with a history of conservative treatment for cerebral hemorrhage; this case had symptomatic secondary epilepsy as a coexisting disease at the onset of CJD. Two cases had Parkinson's disease as a coexisting disease at the onset of CJD. The source hospitals enforcing medical treatment were located in the Aichi (n = 42), Gifu (n = 12) and Mie (n = 7) prefectures of the Tokai region of Japan. Regarding patients' place of residence, 22 cases resided in Nagoya-city. Nagoya University Hospital performed the autopsy in 12 cases, but 10 cases of those were transported after death from the source hospital. Departments of neurology provided clinical treatment in 54 cases. Other departments that provided treatment were Internal Medicine (n = 3), Psychiatry (n = 2), Geriatrics (n = 1), and Neurosurgery (n = 1). In 39 cases, prion protein gene analyses using peripheral blood leukocyte or cryopreserved brain tissue were performed. As for polymorphic codon 129, 36 cases (92%) showed Met/Met, 3 cases showed Met/Val (8%) and no case showed Val/Val polymorphism. Polymorphic codon 219 showed Glu/Glu homozygosity in all of the examined cases. Active autopsy performance of CJD in the Tokai region was suggested from the present study.

Like the peripheral noradrenergic system, the central noradrenergic system plays a pivotal role in fight/flight reactions and stress. Overactivity of the system induces not only a sympathotonic state but also hyperarousal accompanied by insomnia, anxiety, irritability, emotional instability, paranoia, and excitation. On the other hand, its underactivity lowers the sympathetic tone and arousal level, resulting in hypersomnia, blunted responsiveness, or apathy. It has been confirmed in animal experiments that excess stress causes dysfunctions of the central noradrenergic system as a result of compensation, such as the overutilization-induced oversynthesis of noradrenaline. Dysfunction of the system, particularly its overactivity, plays an important role in various functional psychoses such as anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorder, as well as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Pharmacologically, the sedative effect of minor and major tranquilizers on hyperarousal is mediated by their action as noradrenaline antagonists. Some antidepressants potentiate noradrenergic activity, and should be used carefully in hyperaroused depressive patients. Thus, clinical evaluation of the central noradrenergic pathophysiology will provide us with information related to arousal to advance our understanding and treatment of functional psychoses."}, {"Title": "[Use of Hunperdal Richter in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia can be regarded effective from the 1950-ies, by using \"first generation antipsychotics\" (FGA)--as now we call them.

The PCF-FW instrument was developed to measure support for parenting, dependent children and family relationships in order to promote child development and mental health in adult psychiatry. A 133-item PCF-FW questionnaire was developed; the content validity, construct validity and reliability of the instrument were ensured by expert review, pilot test and internal consistency. The final instrument was distributed to all nurses (n= 608), including registered nurses (n= 373) and practical mental health nurses (n= 235), working in 45 adult psychiatric units in five university hospitals in Finland. Some 51% of all nurses responded. Correlation variables in each subscale varied between 0.1 and 0.8. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.55-0.95 in each subscale, demonstrating the moderate to excellent internal consistency of the instrument. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the entire instrument was 0.94. In spite of some caveats, such as possible response biases, the present study suggests that the PCF-FW instrument is a valid and reliable tool for studying preventive child-focused family working in adult psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The pure being of writing. Ecriture automatique in 19th century psychiatry and early surrealism (Breton/Soupault: Les champs magn\u00e9tiques)].", "Abstract": "Ecriture automatique and psychoanalysis are often lumped together in literary studies, almost as a knee-jerk reaction. However, on closer inspection it can be seen that the discoverers of automatic writing--the surrealists--were more interested in the hysteria research that prevailed around the year 1900 (Pierre Janet, Alfred Binet) and in parapsychology (Frederic Myers). In these two branches of medicine, the theory and practice of automatic writing are based on an experimental constellation in which the relationship between the psychiatrist/experiment organiser and the patient/participant takes centre stage. Here, the latter writes in response to an order or question from the former, mostly while overcoming a physical or memory block. Andr\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault set up a very similar constellation in the Champs magn\u00e9tiques, though with some key alterations. Indeed, surrealism liberates the patient engaging in automatic writing from the dictates of the psychiatrist--but only to submit him to a yet more overwhelming force, a pure violence of writing, so to speak: the automatism of a 'higher reality'."}, {"Title": "Pattern of domestic violence amongst non-fatal deliberate self-harm attempters: A study from primary care of West Bengal.", "Abstract": "Evaluation of various clinico-demographic variables and pattern of domestic violence in non-fatal deliberate self-harm (DSH) attempters admitted in 3 Block Primary Health Centers (BPHC) of Sundarban region of West Bengal, India in the year 2002.\nA prospective study of 89 DSH cases admitted at 3 Sundarban BPHCs by using a specially designed DSH register and a questionnaire on domestic violence in Bengali along with detail clinical interview.\nAmong the total of 89 DSH cases (23 male and 66 female), young (less than 30 years), female sex, low education and married status constituted major part of the sample.

Changes in the knowledge base have added yet another dimension to this debate.\nThe subject is explored using historical figures and their writings and an overview of historic views on the psychiatry profession.\nThe demise of the psychiatrist as an expert and the profession of psychiatry as an expertise can be related to both real and perceived factors. Unlike, for instance, the language used by cardio-thoracic surgeons, the language used in and for professional communications in psychiatry has become very similar to that used in lay discourses on psychological and relationship matters in the general population--partly as a result of the Freudian project successfully insinuating itself into 'common knowledge' and partly as the influence of media grows across the globe. This language has been misappropriated by a wide variety of non-experts, who then speak and interpret it as if they are specialists and any challenge from professionals is seen as self-protection and heresy. As psychiatrists, we do not use technology in a persuasive way as other branches of medicine tend to and this takes away a powerful symbolic conveying 'expertise'. Increased consumerism adds yet another dimension to this discourse.\nThe patient is definitely the expert on how their illness affects their life, but it is the psychiatrist who is the expert on the illness rather than simply focusing on disease.

Specifically, the predictive utility of proactive and reactive peer-directed relational aggression, as well as romantic relational aggression, are explored in a large (N=1387) study of adults. The measure had adequate reliability and validity and the subscales demonstrated unique predictive abilities for a number of dependent variables. In particular, reactive but not proactive relational aggression was uniquely associated with history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and feelings of distress regarding relational provocation situations. Reactive relational aggression was also more strongly related to anger and hostility than proactive aggression. In addition, relational aggression in the context of romantic relationships was uniquely related to anger, hostility, impulsivity, history of abuse, hostile attribution biases, and emotional sensitivity to relational provocations, even when controlling for peer-directed relational aggression. Gender differences in overall levels of relational aggression were not observed; however, males were most likely to engage in peer-directed proactive and reactive relational aggression whereas females were most likely to engage in romantic relational aggression. In a second study (N=150), relational aggression was higher in a sample of adults with Intermittent Explosive Disorder than in a sample of healthy controls or psychiatric controls. The findings highlight the importance of assessing subtypes of relational aggression in adult samples.

Currently, mothers are mainly viewed as \"burdened caregivers.\" Because psychiatric patients no longer live in asylums and no longer are prescribed first generation antipsychotics that used to render them effectively sterile, more and more women with schizophrenia are bearing children-children that their mothers, more often than not, raise. This paper is about caregiving by grandmothers, especially as this pertains to daughters with schizophrenia and especially as it impacts on the grandmother's health and well-being. The role of the grandmother is characterized by divided loyalties, by the toll of caregiving, but also, unquestionably, by the rewards that come with raising children. The experience of grandmothers makes them potent allies in the battle against mental illness in their children and the children of their children. Expanding on their existing role as caregivers, mothers of the mentally ill are evolving into auxiliary therapists."}, {"Title": "[Vaccinations in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Vaccination is a well-known strategy for preventing and treating infections.

The first clinical results are very promising, but vaccines have not yet been applied clinically. With regard to Alzheimer's disease it has been shown by means of animal models that specific antibodies can prevent AlphaBeta aggregation and dissolve existing aggregates. On the basis of these findings various large-scale clinical trials have begun in order to study immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease. The first clinical results showed little neurocognitive effects.

Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is employed in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, it is most frequently used today to treat severe depressive episodes and remains the most effective treatment available for those disorders. Despite this, ECT continues to be the most stigmatized treatment available in psychiatry, resulting in restrictions on and reduced accessibility to a helpful and potentially life-saving treatment. The psychiatric and psychosocial ramifications of this stigmatization may include the exacerbation of the increasingly serious, global health problem of major depressive disorders as well as serious consequences for individual patients who may not be offered, or may refuse, a potentially beneficial treatment.

The state had relied on the expedient of subsidizing the impoverished at the private Hartford Retreat for the Insane that overtaxed that institution and left hundreds untreated. Despite abundant evidence to the contrary, well meaning officials oversold the idea that the Middletown site would promote cures and be cost effective. A number of unanticipated consequences occurred that mirrored fundamental changes in nineteenth-century psychiatry. The new hospital swelled by 1900 to over 2,000 patients, the largest in New England. Custodianship at the monolithic hospital became the norm. The hegemony of monopoly capitalism legitimated the ruling idea that bigger institutions were better and was midwife to the birth of eugenic responses. Class based psychiatry--the few rich at the Retreat and the many poor at Middletown--was standard as it was in other aspects of the Gilded Age.

However, with the growing focus in health care on patient-centered care, self-management of illness, and patient empowerment, the problem-oriented approach to nursing care is no longer sufficient. Assessing and strengthening patients' health assets has evolved into a complementary approach to problem-focused care, helping patients achieve and maintain their health and wellness. This requires a clear definition of the concept of health assets and a better understanding of their role in overall health and wellness. The purpose of this paper was to examine the concept of health assets, including its attributes, associated concepts, and application in a health care context.\nWe systematically reviewed 60 journal articles and Web documents dated from 1966 through March 2007. Data were then analyzed using Rodger's evolutionary method of concept analysis.\nThe health assets concept has not been widely used in health care. However, use has increased during recent years within multiple disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, nursing, medicine, social sciences, and public health. This concept analysis identified core attributes of health assets to be potentials in the individuals' possession. The core attributes embraces relational, motivational, protective, and volitional strengths, which are internal; and support, expectations of others, and physical and environmental elements, which are external. The antecedents of health assets are genes, values, beliefs, and life experiences. Health assets mobilize an individual to engage in deliberation, decision making, and change. Consequences of health assets are positive health behaviors that can lead to mastery, self-actualization, and improved health outcomes. We propose both a definition of health assets and a descriptive model of its components and relationships.\nFocusing nursing care on a person's health assets, as a complement to the traditional approach of addressing a person's health problems, may contribute to improved health behavior and outcomes.

The total scores of side-effect rating scales are, however, not sufficient statistics, implying that each symptom has to be analysed individually. Self-rating scales with very few items appear to be sufficient statistics when measuring the patients' own perception of quality of life.\nApplied psychometrics in psychiatry have been found to cover a pharmacopsychometric triangle illustrating the measurements of wanted and unwanted effects of pharmacotherapeutic drugs as well as health-related quality of life."}, {"Title": "'Salience syndrome' replaces 'schizophrenia' in DSM-V and ICD-11: psychiatry's evidence-based entry into the 21st century?", "Abstract": "Japan was the first country to abandon the 19th century term of 'mind-splitting disease' (schizophrenia). Revisions of DSM and ICD are forthcoming. Should the rest of the world follow Japan's example?\nA comprehensive literature search was carried out in order to review the scientific evidence for the validity, usefulness and acceptability of current concepts of psychotic disorder.\nThe discussion about re-classifying and renaming schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders is clouded by conceptual confusion. First, it is often misunderstood as a misguided attempt to change societal stigma instead of an attempt to change iatrogenic stigma occasioned by the use of misleading and mystifying terminology. Second, the debate is misunderstood as purely semantic, whereas in actual fact it is about the core concepts underlying psychiatric nosology. Third, it has been suggested that the debate is political. However, solid scientific evidence pointing to the absence of nosological validity of diagnostic categories lies at the heart of the argument. Fourth, there is confusion about what constitutes a syndrome (a group of symptom dimensions that cluster in different combinations in different people and for which one or more underlying diseases may or may not be found) and a disease (a nosologically valid entity with specific causes, symptoms, treatment and course).\nScientific evidence favours a syndromal system of classification combining categorical and dimensional representations of psychosis. The concept of 'salience' has the potential to make the public recognize psychosis as relating to an aspect of human mentation and experience that is universal. It is proposed to introduce, analogous to the functional-descriptive term 'Metabolic syndrome', the diagnosis of 'Salience syndrome' to replace all current diagnostic categories of psychotic disorders. Within Salience syndrome, three subcategories may be identified, based on scientific evidence of relatively valid and specific contrasts, named Salience syndrome with affective expression, Salience syndrome with developmental expression and Salience syndrome not otherwise specified."}, {"Title": "Methodological issues in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum.", "Abstract": "The obsessive-compulsive spectrum is a heterogeneous class of conditions.

A central task in forensic psychiatry has traditionally been to identify dangerous, mentally disordered subjects considered to be prone to commit violent acts. Over time, \"dangerousness\" has been reworded into \"risk\". Nevertheless, such assessments have generally been based on the psychiatric factors characterising the individual patient, while group interaction, situational factors, or social and cultural circumstances, such as the availability of alcohol and drugs, have been largely overlooked. That risk assessments have a focused on people with a diagnosis of \"mental disorder\" and been used as grounds for coercive measures and integrity violations has somehow been accepted as a matter of course in the public and political debate. Even the basic question whether offenders with a mental disorder are really more prone to criminal recidivism than other offenders seems to have been treated light-handedly and dealt with merely by epidemiological comparisons between groups of persons with broad ranges of psychosocial vulnerability and the general population. Legal texts, instructions and guidelines from the authorities in charge are often vague and general, while actors in the judicial system seem to put their trust in psychiatric opinions. The exchange of professional opinions, general public expectations, and judicial decision processes poses a huge risk for misunderstandings based on divergent expectations and uses of terminology."}, {"Title": "Mental disorder is a cause of crime: the cornerstone of forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The assumption that mental disorder is a cause of crime is the foundation of forensic psychiatry, but conceptual, epistemological, and empirical analyses show that neither mental nor crime, or the causation implied, are clear-cut concepts. \"Mental\" denotes heterogeneous aspects of a person such as inner experiences, cognitive abilities, and behaviour patterns described in a non-physical vocabulary. In psychology and psychiatry, mental describes law-bound, caused aspects of human functioning that are predictable and generalizable. Problems defined as mental disorders are end-points of dimensional inter-individual differences rather than natural categories. Deficits in cognitive faculties, such as attention, verbal understanding, impulse control, and reality assessment, may be susceptibility factors that relate to behaviours (such as crimes) by increasing the probability (risk) for a negative behaviour or constitute causes in the sense of INUS conditions (Insufficient but Non-redundant parts of Unnecessary but Sufficient conditions). Attributing causes to complex behaviours such as crimes is not an unbiased process, and mental disorders will attract disproportionate attention when it comes to explanations of behaviours that we wish to distance ourselves from. Only by rigorous interpretation of what psychiatry actually can inform us about, using empirical analyses of quantified aggressive antisocial behaviours and their possible explanatory factors, can we gain a clearer notion of the relationship between mental disorder and crime."}, {"Title": "The influence of neighborhood environment on treatment continuity and rehospitalization in dually diagnosed patients discharged from acute inpatient care.", "Abstract": "Environmental contingencies inherent in neighborhoods and communities have been shown to affect individual behavior. The authors analyzed neighborhood and individual factors predicting initial outpatient treatment attendance and rehospitalization within 1 year among patients who were dually diagnosed with at least one mental disorder and a substance use disorder and discharged from an acute psychiatric inpatient care unit.\nStepwise-forward logistic regression modeling and a geographic information system were utilized to assess data extracted from the medical records of 380 patients who, upon hospital admission, had one or more mental health disorders and a positive urine drug screen for prototypical illicit drugs. Geographic data on patients' neighborhood environment were obtained from public sources. Outcome variables were whether a patient attended the first outpatient treatment appointment within 30 days of hospital discharge and whether a patient was readmitted to the inpatient unit within 1 year of discharge. Predictor variables were features relating to individual-level patient characteristics and features associated with neighborhood environment.\nFactors that decreased the likelihood of attending the initial outpatient treatment were returning home following hospitalization (versus returning to an institutional setting), residing in an area with a high vacant housing rate, residing in an area far from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting location, having the chief complaint of bizarre behavior (i.e., grossly inappropriate behavior), and having a urine drug screen positive for heroin. The likelihood of being rehospitalized within 1 year was greater for Hispanic patients, patients who had at least one prior hospital admission, and patients who lived in close proximity to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting location. Patients living in areas with higher educational attainment had a reduced likelihood of rehospitalization.\nA more explicit focus on the neighborhood and community context represents an important area in psychiatry, in terms of both research and clinical practice, which can potentially enhance long-term care and treatment planning for psychiatric patients. Future research is needed to better understand the influence of the neighborhood environment to help predict important clinical outcomes."}, {"Title": "Implementing standardized assessments in clinical care: now's the time.", "Abstract": "In this Open Forum the Committee on Psychopathology within the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry (GAP) strongly encourages clinicians and health systems to implement standardized assessments of patients' outcomes for mental disorders, particularly disorders such as depression.

The comorbid substance abuse in violent offenders was usually unrecognized and misdiagnosed. Furthermore, comorbidity in forensic psychiatry describes the co-occurrence of two or more conditions or psychiatric disorder known in the literature as dual diagnosis and defined by World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, many violent offenders have multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Recent studies have confirmed causal relationship between major psychiatric disorders and concomitant substance abuse (comorbidity) in 50-80% of forensic cases. In general, there is a high level of psychiatric comorbidity in forensic patients with prevalence of personality disorders (50-90%), mood disorders (20-60%) and psychotic disorders (15-20%) coupled with substance abuse disorders. Moreover, the high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities could be found in mentally retarded individuals, as well as, in epileptic patients. Drugs and alcohol abuse can produce serious psychotoxic effects that may lead to extreme violent behavior and consequently to serious criminal offence such as physical assault, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder and homicide, all due to an altered brain function and generating psychotic-like symptoms. Studies have confirmed a significant statistical relevance in causal relationship between substance abuse and violent offences. In terms of forensic psychiatry, the comorbidity strongly contributes in the process of establishing psychiatric diagnosis of diminished mental capacity or insanity at the time of the offence in the course of clinical assessment and evaluation of violent offenders. Today, the primary focus of forensic psychiatry treatment services (in-patient or community) is management of the violent offenders with psychiatric comorbidity which requires a multilevel, evidence based approach to the patient. Forensic treatment service effectiveness appears to be associated with individual case management and approach including psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and occupational therapy in order to achieve optimal rehabilitation, prevention of recidivism and stability in social functioning of the patient in the community."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of depressive and dermatologic disorders - therapeutic aspects.", "Abstract": "Depressive disorders are more common in the population affected with dermatologic disorders. Comorbidity of depression and dermatologic disorders is around 30%. The correlation between depressive and dermatologic disorders still remains unclear. In psychodermatology three disorders are described: a) psychophysiological disorders (both disorders induced and maintained by stressors), b) secondary psychiatric disorders (mental disorder as a result of skin leasions and treatment) and c) primary psychiatric disorders (skin alterations as a result of mental disorders and treatment). In depression and dermatology disorders in which certain precipitating factors are required thereby causing alteration of the patient's immunological identity causing a combination of hereditary features and ones acquired through adaptation occur to cause the disorder to develop. The cytokines are vital in the regulation of the immunology response and are also mediators of non-infective inflammatory processes leading to recurrent hormonal secretion affecting the function of the vegetative and central nervous system leading to so called \"sickness behaviour\", marked by loss of appetite, anhedonia, anxiety, decrease of concentration and interest along with other changes which generate a picture of depressive disorder. Treatment of depressive and dermatologic disorders is complex and requires an integral therapeutic approach encompassing all aspects of both disorders and their comorbidity. Therefore therapeutic success lies in a team approach to the patient under the auspice of consultative-liason psychiatry by setting the frame for efficient collaboration and bridging the gap between the mental and the physical in everyday clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder comorbidity in suicidal patients: diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.", "Abstract": "Suicidality is one of the great challenges in contemporary psychiatry. Suicidal patients are often misdiagnosed in clinical practice. It is very important to evaluate possible comorbidity in diagnostic assessment of suicidal patients. The high prevalence of comorbid bipolar (BD) and borderline personality disorders (BPD) presents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge. Although the primary treatment for patients with BPD is psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy is a core component for the treatment of comorbid conditions such as bipolar disorder. Because of heterogeneity of the BPD, pharmacologic treatment has evolved to some particular dimensions of BPD rather than the disorder in its entirety. The dimensions include affective instability, impulsive aggression and identity disturbance. Effective medication management reduces the overall suffering of the patient and enables to make greater use of psychotherapeutic interventions which is very important for BPD patients with BD comorbidity."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity in psychiatry: its impact on psychopharmacological treatment.", "Abstract": "The existence of two or more diagnoses (psychiatric, or a combination with somatic) in one person leads to a dilemma when choosing psychopharmacs for the treatment of the patient.

Personalized psychiatry follows the principles of personalized medicine. A constituent part of an individually adapted approach towards the psychiatric patient presents itself thorough personalized psychiatry. The development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics as well as the nanotechnology based on them ensures implementation of personalized medicine principles in psychiatry to a greater extent than other medical disciplines. In the field of pharmacogenomics, the greatest advance was achieved by the study of genetic variability in drug metabolism. All the predispositions are now present for the implementation of pharmacogenetic tests in routine practice. Pharmacogenetic testing for medications which are metabolised thorough two polymorph cytochromes P 450: CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 is of special significance due to their involvement in most adverse and ultrafast metabolism of psychopharmacs. The potential application of personalized medicine in psychiatry, supported by pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, are: personalized medication choice, personalized dosage, anticipation of possible side-effects individually and personalized follow-up treatment with rehabilitation. The authors conclude how the development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics as well as the nanotechnology based on them, presents a step forward in creating a personalized therapeutic approach in psychiatry. However, the burden of applying the most appropriate therapeutic agent and medication tapering remains based on clinician decision. Pharmacogenetics can only help by making therapeutic decisions with one less unknown element."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacotherapy and comorbidity: conceptual and epistemiological issues, dilemmas and controversies.", "Abstract": "Comorbidity is one of the greatest research and clinical challenges to contemporary psychiatry.

A description of the different of hormone entry into saliva is followed by a detailed description of analytical methods and approaches for reliable collection of saliva, including several interesting applications in diverse fields including psychiatry, stress research, clinical endocrinology, sport medicine, and veterinary medicine. Although saliva has not yet become a mainstream sample source for hormone analysis, it has proven to be reliable and, in some cases, even superior to other body fluids. Nevertheless much effort will be required for this approach to receive acceptance over the long term, especially by clinicians. Such effort includes the development of specific and standardized analytical tools, the establishment of defined reference intervals, and implementation of round-robin trials.

But is this increase of knowledge, for example in the field of neurogenetics, of such magnitude that a revision of the psychiatric classification is necessary and promises to be fruitful? The current plans for DSM-V or ICD-11, respectively, focus on different improvements. In this context also the introduction of a purely syndromatic/dimensional approach without including etiopathogenetic hypotheses, is discussed. A switch to such a dimensional approach, which was discussed among others in the DSM-V task force Deconstructing Psychosis, would be the most radical development. It could avoid many theoretical pre-assumptions about causal hypotheses, which are still associated with ICD-10 and DSM-IV. This would indeed increase the validity of psychiatric classification, but it would also reduce the information as compared to traditional diagnostic categories with all the current implications concerning etiopathogenesis, therapy and prognosis. Such a dimensional approach would also mean that the syndromes would have to be assessed in a standardized way for each person seeking help from the psychiatric service system or for each person undergoing psychiatric research. This would have to be a multi-dimensional assessment covering all syndromes existing within different psychiatric disorders. Based on the different aspects that must be considered in this context, a careful revision seems more advisable than a radical change of classification."}, {"Title": "[Demographic change in psychiatry and psychotherapy--relevance of the age-relation].", "Abstract": "The demographic change will lead to new challenges for the German social and health system in the near future, because it will be accompanied with a large increase of gerontopsychiatric disorders, such as dementia or depression.

We thus aimed to compare the outcome of delirium treatment in a large, university-affiliated general hospital.\nWe used retrospective medical charts analysis over a one-year period. Those included were all patients who had been admitted to an acute internal medicine ward for delirium or who had developed delirium during their hospital stay.\n191 patients' records were analysed. Mean age for the group was 78.8 +/- 1.1 years. There were 108 males (56.5%) and 83 (43.5%) female patients. The most frequent co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis was that of dementia (106; 56%). The most common physical conditions were: cardiovascular (75 patients) and sepsis (24 patients). Patients suffering from delirium were mostly treated with an antipsychotic: 147 (77%) were treated either with risperidone (73 patients) or classical antipsychotics (74 patients). The most frequently used classical antipsychotic was haloperidol (59/74). Mean risperidone dose was 1.7 +/- 0.4 mg/daily. Mean haloperidol dose was 7.8 +/- 1.9 mg/daily. Mean duration of antipsychotic treatment was 3.8 days for the classical antipsychotics group and 2.6 for the risperidone group (p = 0.04). In the untreated group, mean delirium episodes lasted 5.6 days - significantly longer than that of either treated groups, p = 0.02.Mean hospital stay (days) for the group was 12.8 +/- 1.4.

To resolve this situation, the Japanese government has organized a task force and has been working to increase psychiatrists' clinical skills to improve care for children and adolescents with mental health problems. Using an online questionnaire system, the authors have conducted a survey to investigate the perceptions, experiences, and interests of early-career psychiatrists in CAP.\nThe subjects of this study were 182 psychiatrists in Japan whose individual clinical experiences did not exceed 15 years. The authors of this study created an online questionnaire system and e-mailed the URL and login password to all subjects. Respondents anonymously answered the questions. Most questions required an answer indicating a level of agreement scored on a nine-point scale. Responding to the questionnaire was considered to constitute consent, and all respondents' privacy was carefully protected.\nThe mean age and clinical psychiatric experience of the subjects were found to be 33.1 +/- 4.5 years and 5.43 +/- 3.5 years, respectively.

Only responses from rural CEOs are presented (Arkansas n = 39 and Illinois n = 22).\nPhysician shortages were reported by 51 CEOs (83.6%). Most reported physician shortages in Arkansas were for family medicine, internal medicine, cardiology, obstetrics-gynecology, general surgery, and psychiatry. Most reported physician shortages in Illinois were for family medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedic surgery, internal medicine, cardiology, and general surgery. Additionally, registered nurses and pharmacists were the top 2 allied health professions shortages. Multivariate analysis (factor and discriminant analyses) examined community attributes associated with ease of recruiting physicians. Six factors were identified and assessed as to their importance in influencing ease of recruitment, with the state included in the model. Three factors were identified as discriminating whether or not physician recruitment was easy: community supportive for family, community cooperates and perceives a good future, and community attractiveness.\nSimilarities in shortages and attributes influencing recruitment in both states suggest that efforts and policies in health professions workforce development can be generalized between regions. This study further reinforces some important known issues concerning retention and recruitment, such as the importance of identifying providers whose preferences are matched to the characteristics and lifestyle of a given area."}, {"Title": "Epigenetic mediation of environmental influences in major psychotic disorders.", "Abstract": "The major psychotic disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are etiologically complex involving both heritable and nonheritable factors. The absence of consistently replicated major genetic effects, together with evidence for lasting changes in gene expression after environmental exposures, is consistent with the concept that the biologic underpinnings of these disorders are epigenetic in form rather than DNA sequence based. Psychosis-associated environmental exposures, particularly at key developmental stages, may result in long-lasting epigenetic alterations that impact on the neurobiological processes involved in pathology. Although direct evidence for epigenetic dysfunction in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is still limited, methodological technologies in epigenomic profiling have advanced. This means that we are at the exciting stage where it is feasible to start investigating molecular modifications to DNA and histones and examine the mechanisms by which environmental factors can act upon the genome to bring about epigenetic changes in gene expression involved in the etiology of these disorders. Given the dynamic nature of the epigenetic machinery and potential reversibility of epigenetic modifications, the understanding of such mechanisms is of key relevance for clinical psychiatry and for identifying new targets for prevention and/or intervention."}, {"Title": "Forever changed: posttraumatic stress disorder in female military veterans, a case report.", "Abstract": "PURPOSE. This paper examines the experience of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a female veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, including the barriers to treatment she encountered in an outpatient psychiatry clinic. DESIGN AND METHODS. Case report data were obtained through review of records and interviews with a veteran combat nurse diagnosed with chronic PTSD. CONCLUSIONS. Sex differences in PTSD are controversial, but PTSD in female military veterans is a significant problem. Gender may complicate diagnosis and treatment. This case report discusses these issues and invites further research. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS. Advanced practice psychiatric nurses increasingly will see female veterans with PTSD in their practices."}, {"Title": "Epileptiform discharges in psychiatric patients: a controversy in need of resurrection.", "Abstract": "The current view of the psychiatric significance of inter-ictal spike discharges (IIS) in nonepileptic, psychiatric patients is that the discharges are \"incidental\" and are of no clinical significance. Hence, despite a voluminous literature suggestive that such discharges may have clinical relevance, electroencephalograms are hardly ever recorded in nonepileptic psychiatric patients. This literature is briefly summarized, and one detailed example of a disorder (i.e., autistic spectrum disorders) where such discharges are particularly common is provided. The argument is made that this is an area of psychiatry that is under-investigated and that research devoted to elucidating the mechanisms of development of IIS, their possible clinical relevance, and the role of anticonvulsants in managing such patients, could be very profitable."}, {"Title": "Combined student ratings and self-assessment provide useful feedback for clinical teachers.", "Abstract": "Many evaluation instruments have been developed to provide feedback to physicians on their clinical teaching but written feedback alone is not always effective. We explored whether feedback effectiveness improved when teachers' self-assessment was added to written feedback based on student ratings. 37 physicians (10 residents, 27 attending physicians) from different specialties (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Neurology, Dermatology, Ophthalmology, ENT, and Psychiatry) were invited to fill out a self-assessment questionnaire on their teaching skills. Students completed an almost identical questionnaire to evaluate the same teachers based on their experiences during clerkships. After receiving written feedback incorporating their self-assessment and the student ratings, the teachers indicated their perceptions of the self-assessment exercise and the written feedback in a questionnaire (five-point Likert scale items) and next, in more detail, in semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 12 of the participating teachers. 25 physicians participated (67%). The results showed that self-assessment and student feedback were both perceived as useful (3.7, SD 1.0) but the latter was considered more effective. The physicians we interviewed considered the combination of self-assessment with student ratings more effective than either self-assessment or written feedback alone. Notably, discrepancies between student ratings and self-assessment were deemed a strong incentive for change. We conclude that self-assessment can be a useful tool to stimulate improvement of clinical teaching when it is combined with written feedback based on student ratings. Future research among larger groups is needed to confirm our findings and examine whether these combined tools actually lead to improved teaching."}, {"Title": "Brief intervention in substance-use among adolescent psychiatric patients: a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of a brief motivational enhancement intervention in adolescents referred to psychiatric treatment who reported substance-use. In a sample of adolescents (n = 237) consecutively admitted to a psychiatry department, 143 were identified as users. Subjects were randomly allocated to one of two groups: an experimental group that received a brief intervention aimed at increasing their awareness of the risks of substance-use, or a control group. All subjects received standard treatment according to the primary diagnosis. Structured questionnaires assessing knowledge, problems, perception of risks and intention of use of psychoactive substances were administered upon admission and 1 month later. Fifty-nine subjects entered the experimental group and 44 the control group. No significant differences between the two groups were identified in socio-demographic features or substance-use. Non-parametric analyses showed a significant increase across time in overall knowledge about drugs and perception of risk in the experimental group (P < 0.05). A significant increase in overall knowledge in the experimental group compared to controls was found (P < 0.05). No differences were observed for other variables such as intention of use or perception of risk. Brief intervention in adolescents entering psychiatric treatment led to a significant change in overall knowledge about psychoactive substances but not in other variables related to use.

Depression was measured by the Harvard Department of Psychiatry National Depression Screening Day Scale (HANDS).\nThe rate of depression scores in the likely/very likely range was 2.5 times higher among Arabs than among Jews (24.9 vs. 10.6%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women were more likely to express symptoms of depressive episode than were men (22.0 vs. 13.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and the depression rate increased with age, from 11.0% in the youngest group (26-35) to 25.0% in the oldest (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The rate of increase in depression by age was different for the genders, rising more steeply for women than for men. However, the age-gender differential was not identical for the two ethnic groups. The differences in depression prevalence between Arabs and Jews were maintained after controlling for confounding variables, except that when controlling for education, the difference between the ethnic groups was no longer significant.

An international conference, \"Rehabilitating Torture Survivors\", was organized by the Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims (a rehabilitation clinic and global knowledge and research centre with government support) in collaboration with the Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2008. The main topics were: the context of torture; mental problems including psychotherapy; internet-based therapy and pharmaco-therapy; chronic pain; social integration and family; and functioning and rehabilitation. Available evidence highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to rehabilitation, but scientifically rigorous studies of comprehensive rehabilitation programmes for torture survivors are lacking. Therefore, effect studies are urgently warranted. Nevertheless, by combining expertise from different scientific and professional areas, important elements in the problems of torture survivors can be addressed from an evidence base generated both from traumatized and non-traumatized patient populations. Thus, trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and/or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, as well as interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation, should be components of a successful rehabilitation process, and great attention should be paid to contextual components."}, {"Title": "Attitude of young psychiatrists toward coercive measures in psychiatry: a case vignette study in Japan.", "Abstract": "Every psychiatrist must pay careful attention to avoid violating human rights when initiating coercive treatments such as seclusion and restraint.

In this study, we investigated young psychiatrists' attitudes toward psychiatric coercive measures.\nA total of 183 young psychiatrists participated as subjects in our study. A questionnaire with a case vignette describing a patient with acute psychosis was sent to the study subjects via the Internet or by mail. This questionnaire included scoring the necessity for hospitalization, and the likelihood of prescribing seclusion and/or restraint, on a 9-point Likert scale (with 9 indicating strong agreement).\nThere was general agreement among the study subjects that the case should be admitted to a hospital (8.91 +/- 0.3) and secluded (8.43 +/- 1.0). The estimated length of hospitalization was 13.53 +/- 6.4 weeks. Regarding the likelihood of prescribing restraint, results showed great diversity (5.14 +/- 2.5 on 9-point scale); psychiatrists working at general hospitals scored significantly higher (6.25 +/- 2.5) than those working at university hospitals (5.02 +/- 2.3) or psychiatric hospitals (4.15 +/- 2.6).

In part related to these changes - and relatively unknown to sports medicine practitioners - the field of sport psychiatry has steadily evolved and grown. This paper focuses on what these changes have been. A sport psychiatrist is a physician-psychiatrist who diagnoses and treats problems, symptoms and/or disorders associated with an athlete, with their family/significant others, with their team, or with their sport, including spectators/fans. The primary aims of the specialty are to (i) optimize health, (ii) improve athletic performance, and (iii) manage psychiatric symptoms or disorders. The training includes medical training to provide knowledge and skills unique to physicians; psychiatric training to provide knowledge and skills inherent in that field, and training and/or experience in sport psychiatry to provide knowledge and skills about psychiatric aspects of sports. The sport psychiatrist first makes an individual, family-systems and phenomenological diagnosis of the clinical situation. Based on this evaluation, he sets goals for not only the athlete, but also for significant others involved. He delivers treatment based on the psychiatric disorder or problem using a combination of medication, psychotherapy or self-help group interventions plus strategies targeted to specific sport performance issues. Evolution of the International Society of Sport Psychiatry as well as the field, including incorporation into school and professional team sports, is described along with a 'typical day' for a sport psychiatrist.

Rather, appropriate referral to a specialist to exclude organic disease is important and a role as the coordinator is large to the patient to refuse a psychiatric consultation. To serve as a role for such coordination, a family physician has to response the patient's emotional side and focus on the construction of the doctor-patient relationship and response.

I discuss these and offer a brief case presentation followed by a general discussion of the role of existential concerns and of their intertwining with psychoanalytic insights and interpretations in the treatment of older patients from our contemporary culture. The particular case of a relatively mild narcissistic personality disorder is used as an example of the kinds of difficulties contemporary psychoanalysts and psychodynamic psychiatrists run into in the current treatment of the aging patient population. The analyst's beliefs and personality are seen as more important than in classical Freudian psychoanalysis, and deliberate attention to the patient's existential concerns and cultural milieu cannot be avoided. A great deal of correction of what Gedo called \"apraxias\" is necessary, but I argue that in this situation each person must develop one's self in one's own way and without education and intrusion by the analyst. This self development in the face of one's inevitable future is seen as a vital aspect of contemporary psychoanalytic treatment of aging patients, regardless of which of the five orientation channels (that I have discussed elsewhere) are employed. The patient is seen as dealing both with his or her own infantile neurosis that is interfering with adult functioning and at the same time with universal existential human problems that become increasingly pressing as one ages. I contend that the current biological orientation of psychiatry is insufficient to address these difficulties, regardless of what advances we make in psychopharmacology and neurobiology. An exclusive neurobiological orientation can represent what existentialists label an \"inauthentic choice\" and a retreat from the spirit of humanism."}, {"Title": "The repetition compulsion in psychodynamic psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "The repetition compulsion-the propensity to repeat formative early life experiences, for good or ill-is one of psychoanalysis's most important contributions to the understanding of human nature.

This article will discuss the repetition compulsion as a core concept of psychodynamic psychiatry. Principles of the compulsion to repeat will be applied to the dynamics of personality disorders, and will be illustrated by discussion of its usefulness in understanding and treating several common and representative psychiatric conditions: reactive depression, punitive superego function, and traumatic neurosis.

Our analysis suggests that antidepressant monotherapy continues to be the most widely used drug treatment approach, accounting for 84 percent of depression treatment regimens. Antidepressant monotherapy is more prevalent among primary care physician-prescribed treatment regimens (92%) than psychiatry-prescribed regimens (73%). Combination treatment regimens have become increasingly more common as physician perception of disease severity increases, with antidepressant combination therapy accounting for eight percent, 17 percent, and 27 percent of treatment regimens for mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. The most commonly used agents in addition to an antidepressant in combination treatment regimens include another antidepressant (40% of combination regimens), an anxiety agent (40%), and/or atypical antipsychotics (18%).

Cases were segregated into earlier disease onset (25%), tremor dominant (31%), non-tremor dominant (36%) and rapid disease progression without dementia (8%) subgroups. We found a strong association between a non-tremor dominant disease pattern and cognitive disability. The earlier disease onset group had the longest duration to death, and greatest delay to the onset of falls and cognitive decline. Patients with a tremor dominant disease pattern did not live significantly longer than non-tremor dominant patients and showed no difference in mean time to onset of falls and hallucinations. Rapid disease progression was associated with older age, early depression and early midline motor symptoms, and in 70% of the cases, tremulous onset. The non-tremor dominant subgroup had a significantly higher mean pathological grading of cortical Lewy bodies than all other groupings (P < 0.05) and more cortical amyloid-beta plaque load and cerebral amyloid angiopathy than early disease onset and tremor dominant groups (P = 0.047). An analysis of cases with pathologically defined neocortical Lewy body disease confirmed the link between bradykinetic onset, cognitive decline and Lewy body deposition in the neocortex.

Comprehensive ABA treatment programs are comprised of multiple intervention procedures, such as discrete trial instruction and natural environment training, and are founded on basic principles of learning and motivation, such as positive reinforcement, extinction, stimulus control, and generalization. Clinicians in the fields of ABA and psychiatry have similar goals regarding client outcome, and several ABA measurement and analysis procedures produce information that may be useful to psychiatrists.\nABA treatment programs for individuals with autism are supported by a significant amount of scientific evidence and are therefore recommended for use.

For instance, neuropeptides are capable of affecting the metabolism of cells belonging to the immune system. Conversely, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-gamma, contribute to the receptor resistance of neuropeptides, reduce the availability of amino acids which are needed for the synthesis of neurotransmitters or show neurotoxic effects. Other cytokines like granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be highly attractive candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Cytokines are decisively involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or anorexia nervosa as well as in neurological, respectively neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.

A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to third, fourth and final year students and to medical graduates doing their internship in these four medical institutes. A total of 909 medical students and graduates participated in the study. Seventeen percent of participants responded positively regarding their interest in psychiatry as a career. Significantly higher proportion belonged to private medical institutes (14% vs. 24%, P-value =0.001). There was no significant difference in reporting interest for psychiatry in regard to age, sex, year in medical school and whether or not the participant had done a psychiatry ward rotation. However significantly higher proportion of participants (22%, n=43) were reporting their interest in the field of psychiatry who had done more than a month long psychiatry ward rotation as compared to those participants (14%, n=54) with less than a month or no psychiatry rotation (P-value=0.01). More students were reporting their interest in psychiatry with a family history of psychiatric illness as compared to without family history (24% vs 16%, P-value=0.03). In conclusion, students and graduates with more than a month long rotation in psychiatry, studying in private medical colleges and with a family history of psychiatric illness were more interested in choosing psychiatry as a career."}, {"Title": "Epistemology of mental symptoms.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric diagnosis is dependent on the identification of mental symptoms. On the assumption that they are 'natural kinds', the latter are routinely entered as correlational variables in empirical research. Published work on the philosophy of psychiatry has tended to concentrate on the concept of mental disorder or on individual symptoms but has given less attention to mental symptoms as a class. This paper deals specifically with the epistemology of mental symptoms, that is, with focusing on the nature of mental symptoms as a class of 'objects' and how the clinician gets to know them. In order to do this, mental symptoms can be explored from various perspectives, namely: (i) as types of objects, (ii) as structures, (iii) as definitions, (iv) as pockets of meanings, (v) as comprising constituents, (vi) as attractors in specific dialogical contexts, etc. In this paper, on account of space constraints, we deal only with the former 4 perspectives.\nOur analysis shows mental symptoms to be unstable constructs with implications for both correlational research and further theoretical exploration."}, {"Title": "[Pharmaco-therapeutic evaluation of medical treatments of adult autistics and multi-handicapped patients in a public mental health unit].", "Abstract": "This paper presents a survey conducted on a population of multi-handicapped patients and autistic adults hospitalised long term in the Paul Guiraud mental health Hospital in Villejuif France.\nThe aim of the survey is to deepen the knowledge of the treatments for this specific population.\nA preliminary medical investigation was conducted on the population in order to target different groups of patients. Once patients had listed and defined their medical needs, prescriptions were analysed to assess whether clinical characteristics had an impact. Thus, the analysis of treatments was carried out for the 57 patients (14% of the hospital population) and compared to other investigations conducted on the population commonly hospitalised in Psychiatry. The evaluation of the treatments was obtained through a questionnaire which enabled us to target the therapeutical goals and to obtain additional clinical information. The drugs with a high rate of prescription were compared between the autistic group and the multi-handicapped group. The important comorbidity and the multi-symptomatology of autism often involves the polymedication of these patients (8+/-0.8 drugs per patient).\nFifty per cent of the treatments are referred to as somatic treatments. The average length of stay (22.3 years) and the high average age are aggravating factors for polymedication. The average number of psychotropic molecules also appears higher than in the populations studied in the literature. The heterogeneity of clinical forms of autism and polyhandicap encourages prescribers to multidrug therapy. The prescriptions usually remain stable (17.5% of psychiatric treatment is adapted and only 7% of somatic treatment). Epilepsy and constipation are the main treated somatic disorders. In psychiatry, the oral route is the privileged route of administration (81% of treatments) with, more specifically, the use of drinkable solutions for the psychiatric treatment. Neuroleptic drugs are the basic treatment of these patients (82% of prescriptions). The aim of the prescription of neuroleptics is essentially to obtain behavioural or antipsychotic sedation. Cyamemazin is the most prescribed drug (46% of neuroleptic prescriptions), mainly for its anxiolytic effects. Co-prescription is frequent (55.3%) and corresponds to 53% of co-prescriptions of an association of phenothiazine and butyrophenone. Doses are high, which implies the prescription of treatments against the neuroleptics side-effects (86% of patients have such a prescription). The rate of prescriptions of the other psychotropic drugs (hypnotics, anxiolytics, etc.) is approximately equivalent between our population and the \"classical\" hospitalised psychiatric population, except for antidepressants (7% of prescriptions) because the differential diagnosis is difficult in these patients. Nearly 60% of patients have prescriptions of hypnotic drugs. However, this figure is tempered by prescriptions of drugs \"if necessary\" in two-thirds of the cases. Finally, only 30% of patients have systematic hypnotic prescriptions.\nAlthough autistics are clinically different from multi-handicapped patients, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in their prescriptions, which implies a similar pharmacological management. It is difficult to clearly distinguish these two populations only according to the type of drugs used and the doses prescribed."}, {"Title": "Affect in Parkinson's disease: validation of the two-factor approach.", "Abstract": "Depression in Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is frequent, difficult to recognize, under managed and has a profound impact on quality of life. Current categorization of diagnosis in psychiatry poorly applies to the protean manifestations of mood disorders presented by parkinsonian patients. In this study we have chosen to dissect the state of depressive mood as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at different points in time of pharmacological interventions using a dimensional approach. The 21 items of the BDI were classified in two new categories or factors: hyperkinetic and hypokinetic. The hyperkinetic factor included all items related to unbalanced intrusions of negative feelings and ideas, as well as to behavioral hyperactivity. The hypokinetic factor included all items related to loss of drive for appetitive behaviors and loss of mental and physical energy. The objectives were to (1) compare different pharmacological treatments on the two-factor approach in PD depression, (2) determine the influence of levodopa therapy on the two-factor approach, and (3) explore the two-factor approach in placebo conditions. Three sets of analyses using the hypo/hyperkinetic dichotomy favour a neurobiological dissociation of these factors in response to pharmacological intervention: symptoms of the hyperkinetic factor are responsive to serotonergic drugs while those of the hypokinetic one are not and may even show deterioration under SSRIs. In contrast, the hypokinetic factor is responsive to dopaminergic drugs and may show deterioration under serotonergic drugs. Furthermore, the two factors seem to transiently dissociate on placebo intervention aiming at correcting either mood or motor status. The dimensional approach to depression symptomatology may thus be of heuristic value in probing aminergic modulation of mood in IPD and establishing new correlations between affective and motor symptoms."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of pedagogic effects: adaptation of goal attainment scales to the needs of a juvenile penal system].", "Abstract": "In youth welfare quality management increasingly gains in importance over the last decades. Tools used for quality assurance have to be broadly acceptable in everyday practical work. To meet that precondition it is essential that everyday practice and the different problem situations of children and adolescents are accordingly represented by these assessment scales. On the other hand they also require good methodical quality and generalization, thus, allowing to provide information about the effectiveness in a multiplicity of different residential institutions. Therefore, goal attainment scales have to be adapted to specific pedagogic settings as well as to the particular clientele. However, universal goals of pedagogic processes should be assessed as well. At the university hospital of Ulm, department child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy, a scale was developed to measure the attainment of social competence and individual goals (P\u00e4dZi). With the intention of an application of these scales in youth forensic context within a project (MAZ) in Switzerland the scales were adapted and expanded based on qualitative interviews with experts from the forensic and educational fields.

Variables included psychiatric diagnoses and treatment recommendations as well as individual and family characteristics such as type of school absence (school refusal vs. truancy), intelligence, anxiety, school career, parental occupational status, and parental divorce. Furthermore, differences between three groups of patients (anxious school refusers, truants, mixed school refusers) were explored. The results showed a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders and associated risk factors in the sample. Although some of the expected differences between the groups were obtained, the results yielded much overlap between anxious school refusers and truants and thus tended to stress the similarities among children who refuse to attend school."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry for the person.", "Abstract": "This review considers much recent work focused around the Psychiatry for the Person Programme of the World Psychiatric Association.

The percentage of honors awarded during 3rd year clerkships during 2005 were collected for analysis. Across clerkship specialties, there were no statistically significant differences between the mean percentage of honors given by the medical schools examined with Internal Medicine (27.6%) the low and Psychiatry (33.5%) the high. However, inter-institutional variability observed within each clerkship was high, with surgery clerkship percentage of honors ranging from 2% to 75% of the students.

Its roots, however, are by far older. Psychiatry and pediatrics can be looked upon as mother disciplines. But there are also other roots outside medicine, comprising pedagogics, philosophy, psychology, law and social sciences. During national socialism, child psychiatry took a disastrous development, associated with systematic murder of children in so-called \"special children's units\". This previous history complicated its development after the Second World War. According to the Zeitgeist, six chronologically overlapping phases in West Germany can be distinguished: (1) Search for orientation and reorganization, (2) decade of consolidation and uncertainty, (3) decade of social psychiatry and anti-psychiatric movements, (4) decade of reforms in psychiatry, (5) decade of return to biological psychiatry, and (6) decade of integration of different schools of thoughts and procedures. In West-Germany, child and adolescent psychiatry reached its autonomy 1968 which was of great importance for its further development. In the post-war period after the Second World War, the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Philipps-University Marburg played an important role which is reflected in the establishment of the first chair of child and adolescent psychiatry in 1958 in West Germany (full professorship) as well as in important impulses for the improvement of care, research initiatives as well as for the development of international cooperation.

This meaning, I will argue, is trivial. Then, I will move on to its technical meanings, including three classic sub-areas: descriptive, clinical and structural psychopathology, stemming from the studies of Karl Jaspers, Kurt Schneider and the phenomenological movement in psychiatry.\nI will address the meanings of the term 'psychopathology' in current literature and contrast it with its meanings in continental 20th century tradition.

This mismatch is greatest in Urban Family Medicine with far fewer students interested in this career at medical school entry compared to the current proportion of practicing physicians. There are also fewer students interested in Psychiatry than the current proportion of practicing physicians.\nThis mismatch between the student interest and the current proportion of practicing physicians in the various specialties in Canada is particularly disturbing in the face of the current sub-optimal distribution of physicians.

Increase in sexual activity and promiscuity were significantly more common in patients with BD vs. the other two groups. Lifetime dysfunctions in all three phases of the sexual response cycle explored were significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts in patients with BD and with thoughts of death in patients with UD.

We measured color contrast thresholds with a computerized test designed to assess red-green and blue-yellow color confusion axes against a background of luminance noise. We calculated the ratio of red-green threshold to blue-yellow threshold (R-G/B-Y ratio) for each patient. Because central vision was impaired in all patients, we used a sectoral annular stimulus that projected to the retina at 12.5 degrees eccentricity.\nThere were 10 patients with age-related macular degeneration and CBS who were hallucinating in a predominant color or combination of colors at the time of recruitment. Patients hallucinating in red, green, or a combination of red and green had R-G/B-Y ratios of less than 1.0 (n = 5). Patients hallucinating in blue, yellow, or a combination of blue and yellow had R-G/B-Y ratios of greater than 1.0 (n = 2).

Improvement in many areas of provided medical services and in integration process community-based psychitric care forms is needed. Moreover, it is necessery to create a comprehensive national program of chronic mentaly ill persons' rehabilitation based on individual and community resources. It is necessary to analyse unfavourable phenomena which occured in the psychiatric care system (marginalization, stigmatization of chronic mentaly ill persons, istitutionalization or transitutionalization). The mentioned phenomena show tendencies towards rejection of the de-centralization of health service."}, {"Title": "Professional opinions of the use of telemedicine in child & adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The Telemedicine project at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow was set up in 2004 to aid in the rapid diagnosis of children at a distant location. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are now the largest users. CAMHS use this service for clinical work, service development and to aid research. Twenty four CAMHS professionals with experience of the telemedicine facility were asked to complete questionnaires outlining their opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the facility; 19 responded. The results showed a wide variety of professionals use the facility and that clinical work makes up the majority of the use. An advantage to rural populations in Scotland was considered the most important benefit. Saving time and an improved method of communication were also highlighted as important. Failure of technology and problems with sound quality were highlighted as drawbacks. Seventy nine percent of subjects stated that they preferred Telemedicine to Telephone conferencing. The results show the Telemedicine facility is perceived as a positive addition to CAMHS in Scotland. Therefore, its use should be encouraged in other areas of medicine and surgery."}, {"Title": "Cranial nerve I: olfaction.", "Abstract": "Olfactory (smell) testing is one of the most interesting and revealing individual neurologic tests in psychiatric research.

The disorder is fairly common in the US general population (3-6%) as well as in primary care (7%) and mental health settings (up to one-third of psychiatric outpatients). While the etiology of dysthymia remains unknown, there appears to be a genetic susceptibility, which may manifest in the presence of various psychosocial stressors.

Because of the psychological pressure inherent to this process, all medical schools should have easily accessible medical student mental health services. Some schools of medicine provide these services through departments of psychiatry or other associated training programs. Since this stressful lifestyle often continues through residency training and life as a physician, this is a critical period in which to develop and utilize functional and effective coping strategies.

During the period 2004-2007, the videophone network was used for different types of teleconsultation (orthopaedics, psychiatry, diabetes, rehabilitation), continuing education and various patient care and administrative meetings. Qualitative research with observation and interviews with 30 professionals (physicians, nurses, psychiatric nurses, physiotherapists) was carried out in early 2007 to find out health-care professionals' attitudes toward telehealth and to see how the attitudes were connected to telehealth usage. Overall, the attitudes were more positive than negative, ranging from negative to enthusiastically positive. Diversity of attitudes occurred in relation to time, situation, profession, health centre and telehealth application. Ten different types of telehealth adopters were recognized: enthusiastic user, positive user, critical user, hesitant user, positive participant, hesitant participant, critical participant, neutral participant, negative participant and positive non-participant. Telehealth was especially well accepted in continuing education and in diabetes teleconsultations. The study showed that a negative attitude was not a definite barrier to telehealth adoption, but it did require additional attention from project workers and managers. Project staff and managers need to take into account the diverse attitudes of health professionals, because different people require different actions to adopt telehealth in their work."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry appointments in a continuing care setting: kept, cancelled and no-shows.", "Abstract": "We reviewed the appointment data for a psychiatry service in California that provided consultations and also therapy through telepsychiatry. Over an 18-month period, there were 7523 telepsychiatry appointments and 115,148 conventional (face-to-face) appointments. A higher proportion of the telepsychiatry appointments was kept (92% telepsychiatry vs. 87% non-telepsychiatry). Also, telepsychiatry appointments were significantly less likely to be cancelled by patients (3.5% vs. 4.8%) and significantly less likely to be no-shows (4.2% vs. 7.8%). These findings were similar in three of the four counties where the service was delivered. However, one county was different, and further examination suggested that the morale of the staff and patients may have contributed to the unenthusiastic acceptance of telepsychiatry. We conclude that telepsychiatry can be used effectively in continuing care settings as well as in evaluation settings, and that staff and patient morale are important factors in successful telepsychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Ethnopsychiatry in the elderly].", "Abstract": "Ethnopsychiatry is defined as an approach aimed to understand the ethnic and cultural dimensions of mental illnesses. The triple interest of cross-cultural approach in psychiatry in the elderly is highlighted by a review of the literature and five clinical vignettes. The first interest is to help the diagnosis of mental disorders in aged immigrants. The second is to take into account the ethnopsychogeriatric specificities by the sanitary and social systems. The third involves some aspects of psychiatry in the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa. With aging, the immigrant has to reinvent, successfully or not, new rationalizations of his/her presence. Moreover, he/she often presents a premature physical over-deterioration linked to difficult existing conditions. Caring for the elderly from an ethnopsychiatric approach supposes firstly, to grant him correct life and physical health conditions; secondly, training of professionals to consider their specific cultural dimensions and at last, adapting the care and help services. Ethnopsychiatry or cultural psychiatry in the elderly must take into account the social and cultural representations of the diseases. Presently, depression among the elderly is common in Africa and dementia is not rare."}, {"Title": "The organization of the psychiatric service and criminality committed by the mentally ill.", "Abstract": "Over the past 40 years, a marked deinstitutionalisation in favour of social and community psychiatry has taken place in many countries. During this same period of time, there has been an increase in the number of mentally ill criminals. The purpose of this study is to analyse the correlations between the reorganization of the psychiatric treatment system, the growing number of forensic patients and the increase in serious crime, homicide, arson and violence associated with the mentally ill.\nUsing registers and other data sources, we estimated the annual positive or negative growth rate of consumed psychiatric beds and in social and community psychiatry (explanatory variables) and in prevalence and incidence of forensic patients, homicide, arson and violence (response variables) from 1980 to 1997 for each of the Danish counties. We analysed the immediate effect of the changing treatment structure by relating response variables to explanatory variables. The long-term effect was analysed in the form of between county analysis with both single and multiple regressions.\nBed closure had no immediate effect on either the number of forensic patients or serious criminality. The between county analysis shows, however, that over time the (negative) growth rate in number of consumed beds is significantly correlated with the (positive) growth rates for forensic patients, homicide and arson. Social and community psychiatry have little effect, if any.\nThe study is based on historical data, but the results are still valid. We have used two sets of data firstly the number of forensic patients and, secondly the reported number of crimes associated with the mentally ill. The uniformity of the results leads us to consider them for certain: That the decreasing effort invested in inpatient treatment is causing an increase in the crime rate among the mentally ill.\nMany forensic patients suffer from schizophrenia. These patients are not only offenders, but also the victims of an inadequate treatment system. Modern inpatient treatment facilities should be established."}, {"Title": "Staffs' knowledge and perceptions of working with women with intellectual disabilities and mental health problems.", "Abstract": "There is a growing evidence of the physical and mental health inequalities in people with intellectual disability (ID) although less has been written concerning the mental health of women with ID (International Association for the Scientific Study of Intellectual Disabilities).

The aim of this study was to explore a range of health and social care staffs' knowledge and perceptions of caring for women with ID who have mental health problems focusing upon risk and resilient/protective factors.\nA qualitative methodology was used. Eight focus groups were conducted with hospital, community and residential staff across one region of the UK. The focus groups were audiotaped and the transcriptions were subjected to a thematic content analysis using Newell & Burnard's framework.\nSix inter-related risk factors were identified by the participants as potential causes for the women with ID to develop a mental illness and these were: having an ID and being female, unmet expectations, dysfunctional family upbringing, unstable relationships/loss of children, domestic violence and negative life experiences. Few of the participants acknowledged hormonal issues as a risk factor. Resilient/protective factors included being proactive, greater community participation, early recognition and mental health maintenance.\nThese results are discussed in light of current developments and policy within mainstream psychiatric gender approaches.

To this end, spliceome-profiling is a new methodological approach that has considerable conceptual relevance for discovery and clinical translation of novel biomarkers for psychiatric illnesses. Advances in microarray technology now allow for improved sensitivity in measuring the transcriptome while simultaneously querying the \"exome\" (all exons) and \"spliceome\" (all alternatively spliced variants). The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of spliceome-profiling to discern transcriptomic biomarkers of psychosis. METHODS: We measured exome and spliceome expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 schizophrenia patients, nine bipolar disorder patients, and eight healthy control subjects. Each diagnostic group was compared to each other, and the combined group of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients was also compared to the control group. Furthermore, we compared subjects with a history of psychosis to subjects without such history. RESULTS: After applying Bonferroni corrections for the 21,866 full-length gene transcripts analyzed, we found significant interactions between diagnostic group and exon identity, consistent with group differences in rates or types of alternative splicing. Relative to the control group, 18 genes in the bipolar disorder group, eight genes in the schizophrenia group, and 15 genes in the combined bipolar disorder and schizophrenia group appeared differentially spliced. Importantly, thirty-three genes showed differential splicing patterns between the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia groups. More frequent exon inclusion and/or over-expression was observed in psychosis. Finally, these observations are reconciled with an analysis of the ontologies, the pathways and the protein domains significantly over-represented among the alternatively spliced genes, several of which support prior discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first blood-based spliceome-profiling study of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to be reported. The battery of alternatively spliced genes and exons identified in this discovery-oriented exploratory study, if replicated, may have potential utility to discern the molecular subtypes of psychosis. Spliceome-profiling, as a new methodological approach in transcriptomics, warrants further work to evaluate its utility in personalized medicine. Potentially, this approach could also permit the future development of tissue-sampling methodologies in a form that is more acceptable to patients and thereby allow monitoring of dynamic and time-dependent plasticity in disease severity and response to therapeutic interventions in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Focus on aripiprazole: a review of its use in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To review published literature regarding aripiprazole in child and adolescent psychiatry.\nA literature review was conducted using the medline search term: 'aripiprazole' with limits: Human trials, English language, All Child (aged 0-18 years). Additional articles were identified from reference information and poster presentation data.\nAripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic which was recently approved for use in Canada, but has been available for several years in the United States. Pharmacologically, aripiprazole is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors. Randomized controlled trial data is available showing efficacy for aripiprazole in the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and behavioural problems associated with autism. Open-label evidence is also available for use of aripiprazole in other disorders such as tic disorders, aggression and disruptive behavior disorders. Unlike some other available atypical antipsychotics, there does not appear to be any effect on QTc interval on the electrocardiogram. Adverse effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, sedation, headache, nausea were significant in clinical trials in children and adolescents. The possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded. In this population, aripiprazole appears to have minimal impact on the metabolic profile compared to most other atypical antipsychotics, with minimal changes in weight or body mass index, no significant changes in glucose or lipid metabolism, and a decrease in serum prolactin.\nAripiprazole may represent an important alternative for some children and adolescents who have experienced poor efficacy or significant metabolic adverse effects with their current antipsychotic treatment regimen."}, {"Title": "The early course of bipolar disorder in youth at familial risk.", "Abstract": "There has been substantial clinical and research interest in describing the complete natural history of bipolar disorder, and related to this significant debate in regard to the validity of the bipolar diagnosis in very young children. Given the high heritability of bipolar disorder, longitudinal high risk studies can provide important information in regard to the evolution of the disorder.\nA selected review and discussion of the findings from key longitudinal high risk studies are presented focusing on the relevance for mapping the early course of illness, addressing the validity of the bipolar diagnosis in very young referred children and implications for diagnosis and organization of services.\nTo date, there have been findings reported from several longitudinal high risks studies starting with well characterized affected parents, all of which support an evolution of psychopathology from non-specific disorders to frank bipolarity. Early childhood antecedents include internalizing and sleep disorders and typically not behavioural disorders. In the majority of cases, the early mood pathology and associated morbidity is related to the depressive polarity. None of these studies have reported a single case of pre-pubertal mania.\nThese findings highlight the importance of considering the clinical course and the family history in diagnostic formulation in pediatric patients early in the course of a psychiatric illness. The implications of these findings for early intervention and organization of child psychiatry services are discussed."}, {"Title": "Dangerous or merely difficult? The new population of forensic mental hospitals.", "Abstract": "During recent decades, there has been a substantial increase in admissions to forensic mental hospitals in several European countries. It is not known if reforms implemented in mental health policies and practices are responsible for this development.\nOur study examined the development of mental health care in Austria and the incidence and prevalence of mentally disordered offenders judged not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI).\nWe analysed data on service provision and data from criminal statistics between 1970 and 2008 from several national sources.\nDuring the first decade when reforms to mental health practice were implemented, the incidence and prevalence of offenders judged NGRI remained unchanged, despite a reduction of mental hospital beds by nearly 50% and little outpatient care. Surprisingly, the enormous increase in admissions to forensic inpatient treatment began in Austria only after community mental health services were rolled out across the country in the 1990s. This increase was primarily due to admissions of patients who had committed less severe offences, while rates of those who had committed homicide remained unchanged.\nOur results cannot be explained by details of the reforms such as the downsizing of mental hospitals or a lack of outpatient facilities, nor by changes to criminal sentencing. Rather, the results provide evidence of an increasingly inadequate provision of comprehensive care for \"difficult\" but not extremely dangerous psychotic patients living in the community. This may result from the attitudes of mental health professionals who have become less inclined to integrate aggressive behaviour into their understanding of psychosis. As a consequence, increasing numbers of \"difficult\" patients end up in forensic psychiatric institutions. This development, which can be observed in nearly all European countries, raises concerns with regard to efforts to destigmatize both patients and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Development of a brief screen for violence risk (V-RISK-10) in acute and general psychiatry: An introduction with emphasis on findings from a naturalistic test of interrater reliability.", "Abstract": "Most violence risk assessment scales were originally developed for use in forensic settings at the time of discharge or release of patients into the community after long-term treatment. However, there is a considerable need for specialized, brief and structured risk assessment tools to inform risk decisions in short-term psychiatric treatment. The present study reports on research findings from the development and implementation of the violence risk screening-10 (V-RISK-10) in two acute psychiatric settings in Norway. The 10-item screen is easy to use, time-saving and may be used for screening of violence risk during hospital stay and after discharge into the community. Prospective validation studies of the screen concerning inpatient and post-release community violence have been conducted. Although data analyses are not yet complete, preliminary findings indicate that the screen has good predictive validity. This suggests that the screen is a promising tool in short-term acute psychiatric settings. However, the importance of reliability in mental health data and tests is well recognized, and a screen with good predictive validity is not worth much if clinicians are unable to agree on the scoring of one and the same patient. In this article we report results from a naturalistic interrater reliability investigation that involved 25 mental health professionals and 73 acute psychiatric patients. V-RISK-10 scoring was accomplished by two raters for each patient. The interrater reliability value for total scores was acceptable. Variations pertaining to the individual V-RISK-10 item, patient characteristics and rater characteristics are discussed."}, {"Title": "Genetics of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome which is comorbid with childhood conduct disorder, alcoholism, substance abuse, dis-social personality disorder, and affective disorders. A small but consistent overlap with autistic symptoms has also been established. Twin and family studies of ADHD show a substantial genetic heritability with little or no family environmental effect. Linkage and association studies have conclusively implicated the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). DAT1 has also been confirmed as being associated with bipolar disorder. Remarkably, and for the first time in psychiatry, genetic markers at the DAT1 locus appear to be able to predict clinical heterogeneity because the non-conduct disordered subgroup of ADHD is associated with DAT1 whereas other subgroups do not appear to be associated. The second most well replicated susceptibility gene encodes the DRD4 dopamine receptor and many other dopamine related genes appear to be implicated. It is becoming increasingly clear that genes causing bipolar mania overlap with genes for a subtype of ADHD. The key to understanding the genetics of ADHD is to accept very considerable heterogeneity with different genes having effects in different families and in different individuals. It is too early to interpret the new wave of genome-wide association and copy number variant studies but preliminary data support the overlap with affective disorder genes and also with CNS connectivity genes likely to be involved in autism and affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial functioning in consultation-liaison psychiatry patients: influence of psychosomatic syndromes, psychopathology and somatization.", "Abstract": "This study investigated whether the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) were able to predict psychosocial functioning in addition to psychiatric diagnoses and somatization in consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) patients.\nA consecutive sample of 208 CLP patients were recruited and assessed for sociodemographic and medical data, psychopathology (SCID), psychosomatic syndromes (DCPR structured interview) and somatization (SCL-90-R SOM scale and multisomatoform disorder, MSD). The main endpoints were the mental and physical components of psychosocial functioning (SF-36).\nA total of 185 (89%) patients had any psychiatric diagnosis, 51 (25%) had MSD positive criteria, 176 (85%) had any DCPR syndrome, and 105 (51%) had multiple DCPR syndromes. Although psychiatric and psychosomatic syndromes were variously associated with psychosocial functioning, hierarchical regression and effect size analyses showed that only DCPR syndromes, particularly demoralization and health anxiety, with somatization but not DSM-IV psychopathology independently predicted poor psychosocial functioning.\nThe presence of psychosomatic syndromes, assessed with DCPR criteria, and high levels of somatization had larger effect size and were independent predictors of the mental and physical components of psychosocial dysfunction, over and above psychopathology. The DCPR classification can provide CLP professionals with a set of sensitive diagnostic criteria for a comprehensive clinical evaluation of psychosomatic syndromes that might play a significant mediating role in the course and the outcome of medical patients referred for psychiatric consultation."}, {"Title": "A psychoneuroendocrinology service.", "Abstract": "Research evidence has highlighted the relevance of endocrine/metabolic abnormalities in psychiatry and of psychosocial implications in endocrinology. However, the value of interdisciplinary expertise has not been implemented in clinical practice.

The main reasons for referral were endocrine assessment (n = 40), unexplained medical symptoms (n = 18) and poor response to treatment (n = 17). The most frequent medical diagnoses were obesity/overweight (n = 22), hypertension (n = 20) and hypothyroidism (n = 11).

His was primarily a psychiatry of affects and bodily feelings, and he focused uncannily and empathically on the patient's experience. The basis of his rich, heartfelt, wise, and inimitable approach was not just classically psychoanalytic, or existential, or ego-oriented, or self-psychological, or interpersonal-relational, or even humanistic or adaptational.

An aging population was studied; replication is needed in younger populations.\nThe absence of positive well-being forms a substantial risk factor for depression, independent of the presence of negative functioning and impaired physical health. Older people with low PWB are very likely to become depressed over 10 years, and preventative intervention and monitoring of these individuals are indicated."}, {"Title": "[The closeness to medical profession and the attitude towards euthanasia].", "Abstract": "Periodically debates on the legalization of active euthanasia are conducted in the Austrian media.

In this study notion towards active euthanasia of (1) medical lays, (2) medical students and medical specialists in psychiatry, surgery and internal medicine are explored by means of a semistructured questionnaire. We found that increasing closeness to the medical profession is associated with an increasing refusal of active euthanasia.

We hypothesized that ADHD is associated with the impairment of the cardiac autonomic regulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac autonomic regulation in children with ADHD at the rest and during orthostasis using short-term heart rate variability (HRV) analysis.\nEighteen children with ADHD admitted to the Department of Children and Adolescent Psychiatry, Clinic of Psychiatry, University Hospital in Martin, Slovak Republic between January and September 2006 and 18 matched healthy subjects were recruited. HRV analysis was carried out in three positions: supine (S1)-orthostasis (O)-supine (S2). Evaluated parameters were: the mean R-R interval, mean squared successive difference (MSSD), spectral powers in low (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands, total power (TP), coefficients of component variance (CCV LF, CCV HF), LF/HF ratio.\nThe mean R-R interval was significantly shorter in ADHD group compared to controls in all positions (P<0.05, P<0.001). S1: The parameters MSSD, CCV HF, logHFpower were significantly lower (P<0.05, P<0.05, P<0.01) and ratio LF/HF was significantly higher (P<0.05) in ADHD group compared to controls. O: The parameters MSSD, CCVHF, logHFpower, logTP were significantly lower in ADHD group compared to controls (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.01). S2: The parameters MSSD and logHFpower were significantly lower in children with ADHD compared to controls (P<0.05).\nThe children with ADHD had decreased cardiac vagal modulation and tachycardia in supine positions with altered ability of dynamic activation of the autonomic nervous system in response to orthostasis indicating changes in the cardiac autonomic regulation.

It considers publications from 2008 and early 2009, as well as a few important older works that have not yet been reviewed in these pages.\nThe history of forensic psychiatry is a mixtum compositum that challenges historians to reassess their stock narratives in many different ways. Recent studies have demonstrated that the traditional research paradigms of modernization, medicalization, and professionalization fail adequately to capture the historical complexity and contingency of forensic practices and experiences. These deficits have prompted historians to set out in search of new, more hybrid historiographic strategies. Accordingly, their research is turning increasingly to the thresholds of forensic psychiatry where they are exploring how a heterogeneous array of concepts, images, and materials are exchanged and circulated in ways that shape the historical disposition of forensic psychiatry.\nThis review assesses three historiographic domains in which historians have traditionally situated forensic psychiatry. It argues that we need to be cognizant of these different domains and to recognize that enhancing our historical understanding will require us to reflect more carefully on the relationship between them."}, {"Title": "Clinical differences in daytime wetting subtypes: urge incontinence and postponed voiding.", "Abstract": "Urge incontinence and voiding postponement are common subtypes of daytime wetting in children. We analyzed clinical and behavioral differences in children with urge incontinence, voiding postponement and healthy controls at 2 centers.\nA total of 49 consecutive children 5 to 13 years old with urge incontinence (22) or voiding postponement (27) who presented to the department of urology or child psychiatry were examined as well as 32 age and gender matched controls. Instruments included physical examination, sonography, uroflowmetry, urinalysis, a 48-hour bladder diary, the Child Behavior Checklist, a structured psychiatric interview and an intelligence test.\nThe incontinent group consisted of 28 boys and 21 girls with a mean age of 7.35 years. Controls included 13 girls and 19 boys with a mean age of 7.31 years. Incontinent children had a higher rate of pathological uroflow curves (33% vs 25%) and urinary tract infection (6% vs 3%), greater post-void residual volume (6.3 ml vs 3.8 ml) and a thicker bladder wall. Mean IQ was the same in the 2 groups (103). The Child Behavior Checklist showed that significantly more incontinent children had clinical total behavior (41% vs 9%, p <0.01), and externalizing (35% vs 0%, p <0.001) and internalizing (29% vs 6%, p <0.05) scores than controls. Also, more children with voiding postponement had total clinical scores than those with urinary incontinence (56% vs 24%, p <0.05). Of incontinent children 49% fulfilled the criteria for at least 1 ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis vs 9% of controls (p <0.001). There were no differences between children recruited at the departments of urology and child psychiatry.\nThis study shows that urge incontinence and voiding postponement are significantly associated with somatic complaints and psychological abnormalities compared to a control population. Children with voiding postponement have more externalizing behavioral disorders. Children seen at urological departments carry the same psychiatric risks and require the same attention to behavioral problem diagnosis."}, {"Title": "[Treatment of tobacco dependence: a responsibility of psychiatry and addiction medicine].", "Abstract": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) considers smoking to be the biggest avoidable health risk.

Approximately 27% of the German adult population smoke regularly and the proportion of smokers addicted to tobacco or nicotine is estimated to be around 60%. Many of these smokers have undertaken numerous unsuccessful attempts at abstinence. A professional support for smokers who are motivated to give up smoking enhances the chances of success. The current treatment guidelines recommend a combination of psychotherapeutic techniques (e.g. motivational interviewing, behavioural therapy-oriented support either individually or in groups) together with pharmacological support (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion or varenicline).

Contrary to a common view, and in spite of an established tradition for mental diseases, emerging neurology had a much stronger influence on psychiatry ('alienism') than the reverse. This was largely due to the school built up by Jean-Martin Charcot, which was organized around the study and management of hysteria. Although Charcot himself always claimed his disinterest in mental medicine, he stimulated the development of an original scientific approach to nervous system conditions, along with a structured academic teaching, while alienism paradoxically remained stuck in organicism, after Antoine Bayle's report in 1822 of 'arachnitis' as the substratum of general paresis of the insane. Contrary to alienism, the young neurological school was able of self-criticism, and progressively underscored mental factors in hysteria. This led to the paradox that neurologists were active in a disease with a recognized lack of organic lesion, while alienists were postulating brain lesions in all mental disorders. The neurological activity thus indirectly and involuntarily led to the first developments of psychodynamic concepts in mental diseases. The academic evolution led to the launch of a faculty chair of mental and brain diseases in 1875, which was taken over for nearly half a century by direct pupils of Charcot: Benjamin Ball, Alix Joffroy, and Gilbert Ballet held the position until 1916, supporting the development of modern psychiatry in general hospitals, while alienism progressively disappeared at the turn of the century."}, {"Title": "Bullying of trainee psychiatrists in Pakistan: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey.", "Abstract": "Bullying is widely prevalent in health care organizations and medical institutions.

Eighty percent of participating trainees reported experiencing at least one bullying behavior in the preceding 12 months. There was no significant association between likelihood of experiencing bullying and any of the sociodemographic variables. However, in view of the small number of psychiatry trainees in Pakistan, this finding needs to be interpreted cautiously.

The survey assessed domains such as work hours, didactics, home and family life, and mentorship.\nOf the chief psychiatric residents surveyed, 49% reported that they did not have a clearly defined career development mentor, and 39% reported that they did not feel adequately mentored. Gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, moonlighting, medical school (American versus international), and type of residency program (academic versus community based) did not show significant association with either \"having a clearly defined mentor\" or \"feeling adequately mentored,\" based on chi-squared tests for independence. Chief residents who had authored peer-reviewed publications were significantly more likely to report having a clearly defined mentor and to feel adequately mentored than those who did not author publications. Logistic regression analysis showed that having a clearly defined mentor was associated with twice the odds for feeling well prepared to practice psychiatry upon graduation compared with those who did not have a clearly defined mentor, even after controlling for gender, race, medical school, and residency program type.\nHalf of the psychiatric chief residents surveyed reported the lack of a clearly defined career development mentor. In addition, a chief resident's response of lacking a clear mentor was associated with the perception of being less prepared to practice psychiatry upon graduation.

The questions assessed the presence and intensity of stigmatizing attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder, dementia and drug and alcohol addiction.\nThe study revealed higher levels of stigma towards patients with depression, alcohol and drug addiction in this Sri Lankan sample compared to UK data but attitudes towards schizophrenia were less stigmatized in Sri Lanka. Blaming attitudes were consistently high across diagnoses in the Sri Lankan sample. Sri Lankan medical students displayed more negative attitudes than doctors (P < 0.001). Overall stigma was greatest towards patients with drug addiction, followed by, alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder and dementia.\nSri Lankan doctors and undergraduates endorse stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illnesses and are especially prone to see patients as blameworthy.

After the rotation, students evaluated the overall clerkship, patient care activities, and usefulness of the three instructional methods using a 5-point Likert scale (1=poor to 5=excellent) and listed their area of future specialty. Of 156 students who completed the rotation, 117 (75%) completed the evaluation. Thirty (26%) chose specialties providing chronic disease management such as family, internal medicine, and psychiatry; 34 (29%) chose specialties providing primarily procedural services such as surgery, radiology, anesthesiology, pathology, and radiation oncology. Students rated the usefulness of the GICS as good to very good (mean+/-standard deviation 3.3+/-1.0). Similarly, they rated overall clerkship as good to excellent (3.8+/-1.0). Analysis of variance revealed no significant group difference in any of the responses from students with the overall clerkship (F(112, 4)=1.7, P=.20). Students rated the geriatric clerkship favorably and found the multimodal instruction to be useful. Even for students whose career choice was not primary care, geriatrics was a good model for interdisciplinary care training and could serve as a model for other disciplines."}, {"Title": "Treatment of conversion disorder.

Data from all patients presenting to a psychiatric emergency room were collected prospectively for a 3 months period as part of a local quality check project. A questionnaire was used to collect patient demographic data, diagnosis, treatment decisions and the personal and professional characteristics of the residents who performed the assessments. During the 3 months of the study period we obtained data on all 251 emergency assessments carried out by all six residents working in the service. These were 3 female and 3 male 3rd year residents in psychiatry. There was no difference between male and female residents concerning ICD-10 diagnostic assessment, adherence to local hospitalization criteria guidelines, psychotherapeutical and pharmacological treatments administered. A similar distribution between male and female residents was found for diagnoses. No difference was found in the rate of hospitalization decisions between male and female residents. However, surprisingly, there were more voluntary hospitalizations by the women residents (P = 0.035; \u03c72 = 4.443) and more involuntary admissions by the men residents (P = 0.005; \u03c72 = 7.643). There was no correlation between the gender of the patient and the assessment or hospitalization decision of either male or female residents. Although this study has methodological limitations, it suggests that female emergency psychiatry residents are more likely to propose voluntary hospitalizations."}, {"Title": "Antiepileptic drugs in epilepsy and other disorders--a population-based study of prescriptions.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to quantify the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in epilepsy and other indications in a nation-wide population using a prescription database.\nPrescription data of AEDs were collected from the Norwegian Prescription Database for the period 2004-2007, including 5.1 million prescriptions from 144,653 patients, all having at least one prescribed and dispensed AED. Diagnosis-related reimbursement codes were used as indicators for clinical use.\nOf the AEDs used, 71% was in epilepsy, 15% in psychiatry, 13% in neuropathic pain, and <1% in migraine, trigeminus neuralgia and cancer adjuvance. The use in epilepsy increased steadily from 7.0 to 7.5 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day (7%) from 2004 to 2007. The use of AEDs in other indications increased considerably more from 2004 to 2007: Neuropathic pain to 1.40 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day (360%), psychiatry to 1.59 (200%), and migraine to 0.005 (642%). The prevalence of AED users increased and in 2007 it was 0.97% in epilepsy, 0.8% in neuropathic pain, 0.33% in psychiatry and 0.001% in migraine. In 2007, 49% of the AEDs used in epilepsy were a new drug, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and valproate being most frequently used. New AEDs were used in 96% in migraine prophylaxis, 94% in neuropathic pain, and 64% in psychiatry.\nBased on a nation-wide prescription database, this study quantifies the wide and increasing use of AEDs, in particular the newer drugs."}, {"Title": "Practice-based depression screening for psychiatry outpatients: feasibility comparison of two-types of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scales.", "Abstract": "The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) has been validated to avoid misdiagnoses of major depression in routine psychiatric outpatient settings, but it was reported to be only marginally feasible in these specific settings. A briefer and simpler version, known as the 10-item CES-D, meant to attain adequate feasibility, has been validated in geriatric outpatient settings, but it has not yet been examined in psychiatry outpatient settings. The purpose of the present study was therefore to compare the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the two types of CES-D.\nA cross-sectional analysis was conducted of 86 consecutive outpatients in a psychiatric department in a general hospital.\nThe 10-item CES-D has a higher feasibility than the 20-item CES-D, and its internal consistency, reliability, and validity are almost identical to those of the 20-item CES-D.\nThe 10-item CES-D is the better instrument to use because of the higher feasibility than the 20-item CES-D in psychiatric outpatient settings. The different answer format used in each questionnaire (a yes or no format in the former vs a multiple-choice format in the latter) may influence the feasibility, rather than the number of items."}, {"Title": "Endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: rationale, evidence and future potential.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heritable and debilitating neuropsychiatric condition. Attempts to delineate genetic contributions have met with limited success, and there is an ongoing search for intermediate trait or vulnerability markers rooted in the neurosciences. Such markers would be valuable for detecting people at risk of developing the condition, clarifying etiological factors and targeting novel treatments. This review begins with brief coverage of the epidemiology of OCD, and presents a hierarchical model of the condition. The advantages of neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging as objective measures of brain integrity and function are discussed. We describe the concept of endophenotypes and examples of their successful use in medicine and psychiatry. Key areas of focus in the search for OCD endophenotypes are identified, such as measures of inhibitory control and probes of the integrity of orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Finally, we discuss exciting findings in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with OCD that have led to the identification of several candidate endophenotypes of the disorder, with important implications for neurobiological understanding and treatment of this and related conditions."}, {"Title": "Right prefrontal brain activation due to Stroop interference is altered in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder - A functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common finding in school children. Because it was suggested to be related to frontal lobe dysfunction, we hypothesized that brain activation would be altered during an event-related color-word matching Stroop task in comparison to a healthy control group. Twelve medication-free boys suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder were compared with 12 education- and age-matched healthy boys. As an imaging method we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy, because it is particularly insensitive to movement artifacts and, accordingly, well suited for studies in children. Generally, the Stroop task led to activations in the lateral prefrontal cortex of both patients and control subjects. Moreover, data suggest that Stroop interference elicited (presumably compensatory) higher oxygen consumption and brain activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. This effect was not confounded by behavioral differences, because boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder showed only a non-specifically increased reaction time in comparison with control subjects. In sum, our results indicate that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by functional impairments of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our study further establishes functional near-infrared spectroscopy as an imaging tool for studies in neurodevelopment and child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Health staff priorities for the future development of telehealth in Western Australia.", "Abstract": "The views of health managers and physicians working in non-metropolitan areas of Western Australia (WA) were sought about which telehealth services are most needed.\nChief executives and nurse managers of rural hospitals were sent a simple, open-ended questionnaire and asked to consider the current health situation and problems in their area, and to list the four most-needed telehealth services. In addition, they were asked to hand the questionnaire to one of the GPs or medical officers working with them. A total of 78 questionnaires were sent.\nThe response rate for managers and doctors was 51% and 43%, respectively. The first priority of the managers was wound care (28%). The first priority of the doctors was psychiatry (35%). The collective priorities of the two groups were similar, with managers listing wound care, emergency, psychiatry and ophthalmology; and doctors listing psychiatry, wound care, emergency and ophthalmology.\nPrioritizing potential telemedicine applications is a subject largely absent from the literature.

It is a condition in which individuals experience the strong and specific desire for amputation of a healthy limb. Research suggests this disorder may be of neurological origin, specifically that the body image centers of the brain lack a cortical representation for a particular limb. A curious aspect of this condition is that sufferers often report an attraction to amputees in addition to desiring their own limb be removed. We postulate that sexual 'aesthetic preference' for certain body morphology is dictated in all individuals in part by the cortical representation of one's body image."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacotherapy and remission of patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a clinical syndrome of variable, but profoundly disruptive, psychopathology that involves cognition, emotion, perception and other aspects of behavior The Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG) has defined criteria for symptomatic remission based on achieving and maintaining a consistently low symptom threshold for at least six consecutive months.

Currently, deep brain stimulation in psychiatry is investigated for obsessive-compulsive disorder, Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, and major depression. This chapter reviews the application of deep brain stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Preliminary results suggest that deep brain stimulation in obsessive-compulsive disorder can effectuate a decrease of 40-60% in at least half of the patients. Although various side effects occur, most of these are transitory and linked to specific stimulation parameters which can be changed. Because only a few studies have been performed with a limited number of patients in accordance with varying research protocols, appliance of deep brain stimulation to obsessive-compulsive disorder is still at an experimental stage. The speed of the effect of deep brain stimulation causes fundamental assumptions on the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in a battle zone.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the arrival and treatment of 164 severe chronic psychiatric patients who were displaced from the Serbian army-controlled Jakes psychiatric hospital and off-loaded on the afternoon of 28th of May, 1992 at the gates of the Psychiatry Clinic in Tuzla.

This study's primary objective was to determine the relative importance that doctors in different specialties place on different attributes of a medical professional.\nAttending staff and resident doctors in acute care (anaesthesia, emergency medicine, surgery) and longitudinal care (internal medicine, psychiatry) specialties at a large academic hospital completed an anonymous, web-based survey. The forced-choice format required respondents to narrow down 25 professional attributes to three. The main outcome measure was the number of doctors in the two specialty groups who chose one or more attributes in each of six underlying categories.\nAlmost two-thirds of respondents in both groups chose Moral and Ethical attributes. Significantly more longitudinal than acute care doctors chose Relationships with Patients attributes (76% versus 58%) and Communication Skills attributes (28% versus 18%), whereas significantly more acute care doctors chose Clinical Competence attributes (44% versus 29%). Specialty group was more important in choice of professional attributes than gender or position as a resident or attending staff doctor.\nMost respondents chose attributes that the literature and organised medicine define as core elements of medical professionalism. The differences between specialty groups suggest that attributes in the Relationships with Patients and Communication Skills categories be emphasised for trainees in acute care specialties, and attributes in the Clinical Competence category be emphasised for trainees in longitudinal care specialties."}, {"Title": "[Stress research in psychiatry: a complex story].", "Abstract": "Research into the role of stress in psychiatric disorders faces major challenges.

There have been no long-term naturalistic studies of psychiatric outpatient treatment of older adults in the United States. This study examines outcome and predictors of various levels of depression among a biracial sample of geropsychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn, NY.\nWe conducted a naturalistic study (median: 33 months) of 143 persons aged 55 and over with diagnoses of depression drawn from 15 psychiatry outpatient clinics and 2 geriatric day programs. Their mean age was 68 years, 87% were female, and 43% were white and 57% were black, among whom 37% were African Caribbeans. Using George's Social Antecedent Model of Depression, we examined the impact of 15 predictor variables on two outcome measures: presence of any either subclinical or clinical depression (CES-D score > or = 8) and presence of clinical depression (CES-D score > or = 16).\nOn follow-up, 84% and 90% of subclinically and clinically depressed persons at baseline, respectively, were depressed (CES-D > or = 8); 62% of those in remission at baseline were depressed. In logistic regression, 3 variables were significant predictors of any level of depression on follow-up: baseline depression, baseline anxiety, greater increase in anxiety symptoms during the follow-up period. These 3 variables along with financial strain were significant predictors of clinical depression on follow-up. There were no inter- or intra-racial differences in outcome.\nThe bleak outcome findings among older psychiatric outpatients in Brooklyn were consistent with unfavorable results reported in European studies. Because there were only a few predictors of outcome, strategies that target high risk persons - e.g., such as those with subclinical depression, anxiety, or in more economic distress - may prevent transition to severe and persistent depressive states."}, {"Title": "Should non-fat-phobic anorexia nervosa be included in DSM-V?", "Abstract": "Cross-cultural data suggest that rationales for food refusal vary in anorexia nervosa (AN), and a variant, termed non-fat-phobic AN (NFP-AN), has been described.

Aggregating across eligible studies, patients with NFP-AN or low-DT-AN score at least 2/3 of a standard deviation lower on measures of eating pathology than patients with conventional AN. Transcultural comparison of drive for thinness suggests significantly lower norms in non-Western cultures.\nNFP-AN occurs with wide distribution.

Research shows that the implementation of community mental health legislation presents complex clinical and practical issues that require further investigation. Recognition that compulsory treatment is an objective event which is subjectively experienced by patients, families and clinicians has led to research investigating stakeholder views. The therapeutic relationship has been found to be an important modifier of the experience of compulsory treatment. Recent studies have also focused on specific coercive practices, such as forced medication and seclusion, and the use of these in patient subgroups, including those with eating disorders and adolescents. The debate about whether compulsory treatment is ethical continues in the literature.\nCompulsory treatment in psychiatry remains an ethically and clinically contentious issue.

We also examined the effect of a structured educational programme on explanatory models in a randomized controlled trial. Explanatory models were assessed using the Tamil version of the Short Explanatory Model Interview.\nEighty two subjects were recruited for the trial; half of them received structured education while the other half received treatment as usual. There was agreement between perceptions related to the individual's own illness and their opinion of illness in others as assessed using a vignette at baseline and at follow-up. There were no significant differences in explanatory models between patients who received education and those who did not.\nThe results of this study show that during periods of remission, patients can clearly see the relationship between their own illness and that described in others, suggesting that insight is state dependent and may be related to psychopathology with good recovery of insight during periods of remission. These findings also argue for the fact that the current multi-dimensional models of insight which focus on biomedical explanations and treatments are not culturally sensitive. The assessment of insight demands universal conventions with comparison to the local cultural standards rather than universal definitions and yardsticks which employ Western and biomedical perspectives."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia-like GABAergic gene expression deficits in cerebellar Golgi cells from rats chronically exposed to low-dose phencyclidine.", "Abstract": "One of the most consistent findings in schizophrenia is the decreased expression of the GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD(67) and GAD(65) in specific interneuron populations. This dysfunction is observed in distributed brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In an effort to understand the mechanisms for this GABA deficit, we investigated the effect of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP), which elicits schizophrenia-like symptoms in both humans and animal models, in a chronic, low-dose exposure paradigm. Adult rats were given PCP at a dose of 2.58 mg/kg/day i.p. for a month, after which levels of various GABAergic cell mRNAs and other neuromodulators were examined in the cerebellum by qRT-PCR. Administration of PCP decreased the expression of GAD(67), GAD(65), and the presynaptic GABA transporter GAT-1, and increased GABA(A) receptor subunits similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia. Additionally, we found that the mRNA levels of two Golgi cell selective NMDAR subunits, NR2B and NR2D, were decreased in PCP-treated rats. Furthermore, we localized the deficits in GAD(67) expression solely to these interneurons. Slice electrophysiological studies showed that spontaneous firing of Golgi cells was reduced by acute exposure to low-dose PCP, suggesting that these neurons are particularly vulnerable to NMDA receptor antagonism. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to low levels of PCP in rats mimics the GABAergic alterations reported in the cerebellum of patients with schizophrenia (Bullock et al., 2008. Am. J.

A particular aim was to elucidate the possible effect of comorbidity on pain descriptors, disability, quality of life, assessed working ability and rehabilitation needs. Six hundred and thirty-five long-term sick leavers were referred from National Insurance Offices and consecutively accepted for investigation. Several self-report questionnaires were used. All patients were examined by three board-certified specialist physicians in psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation medicine, respectively. Fifty-five percent of the patients had psychiatric-somatic comorbidity. The three most frequent combinations of diagnoses in the comorbidity group were fibromyalgia/myalgia and depressive episode, fibromyalgia/myalgia and recurrent depression, spinal pain and depressive episode, whereas the three most frequent in those with psychiatric diagnosis only were depressive episode, recurrent depression, phobias/anxiety. Differences in pain descriptors and in difficulties with activities were found among the three groups. All had lower health-related quality of life than references. Only one-sixth had no assessed working capacity and only 3% were assessed as able to resume work without rehabilitation; 80% were multidisciplinarily assessed as needing rehabilitation.

Shared decision making was seen as useful for well-informed and compliant patients and for those who currently dislike their antipsychotic, but it was not seen as useful in cases of potentially reduced decisional capacity. Psychosocial matters (for example, work therapy, future housing, and psychotherapy) were considered more suitable for shared decision making than were medical and legal decisions (for example, hospitalization, prescription of antipsychotics, and diagnostic procedures).\nIt should be clarified whether and how patients with schizophrenia can be empowered and educated so they can share important treatment decisions."}, {"Title": "Ethical and Scientific Perspectives of Placebo-controlled Trials in Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Clinical trials for development of new medications are essential in all fields of medicine. The requirement for a placebo arm in pharmaceutical trials presents ethical and clinical dilemmas that are especially complicated with regard to mentally ill persons whose free choice and ability to provide informed consent may be questionable. On the other hand, we do not believe that this predicament justifies unconditional rejection of placebo use in psychiatry, when the investigational drug may ultimately provide substantial benefit for some patients.

However, previous studies have indicated variation in its provision, and uncertainty about structure and content. Workplace-based assessments (WPBAs) were introduced in 2007 as part of major postgraduate medical training reform. Placing considerable time demands on trainees and supervisors alike, the extent to which WPBAs should utilise ES time has not been specified. As ES and WPBAs have discrete (although complementary) functions, there is the potential for this increased emphasis on assessment to displace other educational needs.\nAll junior doctors and their educational supervisors in one UK psychiatry training scheme were surveyed both before and after the introduction of WPBAs. Frequency and duration of ES were established, and structure, content and process were ascertained. Opinions on usefulness and responsibility were sought. The usage of ES for WPBAs was also assessed.\nThe response rate of 70% showed general agreement between trainees and supervisors, but some significant discrepancies. Around 60% reported 1 hour of ES taking place weekly or 3 times per month. Most agreed that responsibility for ES should be shared equally between trainees and supervisors, and ES was largely seen as useful. Around 50% of trainees and supervisors used 25-50% of ES time for WPBAs, and this did not appear to affect the usefulness of ES or the range of issues covered.\nES continues to be an important component of psychiatric training. However, using ES for WPBAs introduces the potential for tension between trainees' education and their assessment by emphasising certain training issues at the expense of others. The impact of reduced training time, WPBAs and uncertainties over ES structure and content should be monitored to ensure that its benefits are maximised by remaining tailored to individual trainees' needs."}, {"Title": "Some clinical characteristics of children who survived the Marmara earthquakes.", "Abstract": "The Marmara earthquakes occurred in the Marmara Region (North West) of Turkey in 1999 and resulted in a death toll of approximately 20,000. This paper investigates the relationships between diagnoses and certain variables in children who developed emotional and/or behavioral disturbances in the aftermath of the Marmara earthquakes and were subsequently seen at a child psychiatry outpatient clinic. The variables evaluated are gender, age, the location where the earthquake was experienced, and the degree of losses, bodily injuries, and damage to the residence. Medical records of 321 children and adolescents ranging in age from 2 to 15 years who presented at the clinic due to problems associated with the earthquake between August 1999 and February 2000 were reviewed. Of the patients, 25.5% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 16.5% with acute stress disorder (ASD) and 38% with adjustment disorder. No relationship is found between gender and diagnosis. Younger age groups tended to be diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Those who had lost relatives, friends or neighbors were more frequently diagnosed with ASD or PTSD. The same was true for children whose residence was heavily damaged. Children and adolescents constitute the age group that is most severely affected by natural disasters and display significant emotional-behavioral disturbances. The frequency of ASD and PTSD found in our study is considerably high. Although rarely mentioned in the literature, adjustment disorder appears to be one of the most common reactions of children to trauma."}, {"Title": "Assessment of a point-of-care metabolic risk screening program in outpatients receiving antipsychotic agents.", "Abstract": "To assess the usefulness of a metabolic risk screening program, including point-of-care glucose testing, to quantify baseline metabolic risk in outpatients receiving antipsychotics.\nRetrospective, cross-sectional, cohort study.\nUniversity-affiliated department of psychiatry clinic.\nA total of 92 adult outpatients (49 women, 43 men; mean +/- SD age 38.96 +/- 12 yrs) who were receiving antipsychotics and had undergone screening for metabolic syndrome at the clinic during 2004-2007.\nPatient data were recorded on a metabolic screening checklist by a pharmacist or nurse. The checklist captured demographics, vital signs (height, weight, body mass index [BMI], blood pressure, waist and hip circumference, point-of-care random glucose level), personal and family knowledge of current illnesses (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), modifiable risk factors (smoking, alcohol, level of activity), current drug therapy, and recommendations to the psychiatrist. The patient population who underwent screening included 49 African-Americans (53%), 21 Caucasians (23%), 16 Hispanics (17%), and 6 Asians (7%). Diagnoses were documented for 88 patients: schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in 53 patients (60%), and bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder was equally divided in the remaining 35 patients (40%). Of 89 patients (three patients had missing data on waist circumference), 63 (71%) met criteria for level 1 metabolic risk (abdominal obesity); of these 63 patients, 38 (60%) met criteria for level 2 risk (abdominal obesity plus hypertension). Patients with a random glucose level greater than 140 mg/dl had a higher likelihood for being at level 2 risk than level 1 risk (chi(2)=5.99, df=1, p=0.014). Women had a significantly higher likelihood for level 1 metabolic risk compared with men (chi(2)=5.99, df=1, p=0.019).

The growing use of cognitive impairment as an intermediate phenotype, or \"endophenotype\", in psychiatry raises the issue of whether global measures of cognition, such as IQ, or assays of more specific cognitive domains, such as working memory, will best serve to enhance power in detecting susceptibility loci in molecular genetic studies.\nThis paper will review the research on general intelligence in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses as a candidate intermediate phenotype.\nAlthough global measures of cognition may not be optimal as intermediate phenotypes in bipolar disorder, certain clinical traits that overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, such as psychosis, may be predictive of poor performance on global measures, regardless of DSM-IV categorisation.\nGlobal measures of cognition represent good intermediate phenotypes in schizophrenia. Current research does not support the use of global measures of cognition as intermediate phenotypes for bipolar disorder.

The majority of this research has been conducted in the United Kingdom (Beck and Rector in Am J Psychother 54:291-300, 2000) where the National Health Service recommends that CBT be delivered to all people with schizophrenia (NICE in Schizophrenia: core interventions in the treatment and management of schizophrenia in primary and secondary care (update). http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG82/NiceGuidance/pdf/English , 2009). In contrast, the corresponding American Psychiatric Association guidelines describe CBT as an adjunctive technique that \"may benefit\" patients (Lehman et al. in Am J Psychiatry 161:1-56, 2004, p. 35). Anecdotal evidence also suggests a difference between UK and US clinicians' use of and views on CBT with schizophrenia (Tarrier in Clinical handbook of psychological disorders: a step-by-step treatment manual. Guilford, New York, 2008). In the present study 214 clinicians in the UK and US completed an internet survey examining this apparent discrepancy. UK and US participants were equally aware that empirical research supports the efficacy of CBT with schizophrenia. However, UK participants were more likely to practice CBT, rated CBT effectiveness more highly, and were more optimistic about the chances of recovery.

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of training in patient-centred interviewing on the interview performance of psychiatric residents.\nPsychiatric residents (n=10) each interviewed 12 different anonymized standardized patients (SPs), eight before and another four after training. SPs simulated psychiatric out-patients who attended for a first visit to the psychiatric out-patient clinic. The consultations were videotaped, transcribed and coded with a classification scheme developed for psychiatric consultations from which an interview performance index was derived. An interrupted time-series design and a segmented regression analysis with multilevel analysis explored the performance trend within the series of consultations.\nThe regression model evidenced a horizontal slope at pre- and post-training, with a significant level change. These findings excluded the presence of a practice effect and indicated a significant effect of training. Performance variability between and within residents over the series of consultations increased at post-training.\nThe training improved patient-centred interviewing performance.

The main issue under debate was whether all depressions, which vary from severe cases in psychiatric hospitals to mild cases in general practices, should be considered symptomatically hetero- or homogeneous. The former is related to the binarian perspective, which was represented by Kraepelin and was adopted mainly in continental Europe, while the latter, the unitarian perspective proposed by Meyer, was adopted in the United States. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, there was vigorous debate as to whether the Meyerian or Kraepelinian perspective should be adopted. In 1926, Mapother asserted that the unitarian concept was the most appropriate because there were no qualitative symptomatic differences between manic-depressive psychosis and neurasthenia, only quantitative differences in severity. In opposition to Mapother, Gillespie proposed the binarian perspective, which shifted the essential feature of manic-depressive psychosis or melancholia from etiological (\"no precipitating event\") to symptomatic (\"mood-nonreactivity\"). However, subsequent to Mapother, Lewis proposed that, in clinical practice, we must refer to other dimensions, such as etiology, constitution, and environment, rather than only symptoms. Furthermore, he related severity with acuteness for psychosis, and mildness with chronicity for neurosis. Consequently, Lewis's unitarian concept and relationships became tacit assumptions in psychiatry until the 1950s. With progress in somatic therapies in psychiatry, the binarian perspective gradually came to the forefront. In the mid-1940s, a new method of reexamining psychiatric diagnosis in accordance with the specific efficacy of convulsion therapy was developed. Mayer-Gross asserted the importance of the symptomatic distinction of endogenous depression in clinical practice and noticed, similarly to Gillespie's idea, that \"mood-nonreactivity\" was a symptomatic feature of endogenous depression, and suggested the application of somatic therapies. For Mayer-Gross, the term \"endogenous depression\" did not necessarily indicate severe forms of depression. In 1957, the concept of \"mild endogenous depression\" was proposed in a paper by Watts, who was not a psychiatrist but a general practitioner. Prior to the publication of his paper, Watts had already stated in 1956 that \"Endogenous depression is a condition that is often overlooked,\" and \"Not more than one-quarter of the cases are seen by a psychiatrist. Endogenous depression is essentially a disease of general practice.\" Consequently, it was \"discovered\" that a substantial portion of patients with mild depression who had formerly been assigned to receive psychotherapy, had actually required somatic therapies, and many of them had sought help from general practitioners, not psychiatrists. In addition, it was also \"discovered\" in the sense that physicians had been released from a fixed preoccupation with the equivalence of mildness and neurosis. In the same year, Kuhn confirmed the marked effects of imipramine on vital forms of depression, eventually equivalent to endogenous depression. Subsequently, the focus of this debate shifted from clinical intuition to statistical methods, such as factor and cluster analyses. However, some methodological and technical flaws were identified by Eysenck; thereafter, statistical research on the symptomatic classification of depression began to decrease over time. In contrast, the unitarian perspective continued to prevail in the United States despite some interesting research by binarians such as Klein, who proposed the concept of \"endogenomorphic depression\" and insisted that the existence of mild endogenous depression supported the rejection of the unitarian perspective. At present, the unitarian perspective dominates operational diagnostic criteria, such as those in the DSM and ICD, and little attention is focused on the significance of mild endogenous depression; however, it should be reappraised as a concept that can help to avoid the over-diagnosis of depression and provide guidance for the appropriate prescription of antidepressants."}, {"Title": "The validity and utility of subtyping bulimia nervosa.", "Abstract": "To review the evidence for the validity and utility of subtyping bulimia nervosa (BN) into a purging (BN-P) and a nonpurging subtype (BN-NP), and of distinguishing BN-NP from binge eating disorder (BED), by comparing course, complications, and treatment.\nA literature search of psychiatry databases for studies published in peer-reviewed journals that used the DSM-definitions of BN and BED, and included both individuals with BN-NP and individuals with BN-P and/or BED.\nTwenty-three studies compared individuals with BN-NP (N = 671) to individuals with BN-P (N = 1795) and/or individuals with BED (N = 1921), two of which reported on course, 12 on comorbidity and none on treatment response-the indicators for validity and clinical utility.

Brain 1996;119:551-68] demonstrated that the ability to modulate walking cadence remains intact in PD, and could correspond to a compensatory mechanism. More advanced disease stages of the disease are characterized by abnormal temporal parameters (such as stride length variability, stride time variability and cadence elevation) which are unresponsive to levodopa therapy and may be correlated with the occurrence of falls and freezing of gait (FOG). Lastly, postural instability also results in falls and is poorly responsive to levodopa. A link between gait impairment and frontal disorders has recently been suggested. After a few years of evolution, paradoxical episodic phenomena are described: festination (\"hastening gait\" with rapid small, short steps) and FOG (involuntary and sudden cessation of gait). Both symptoms are often incapacitating for PD patients, because of their resultant loss of independence and their poor response to levodopa therapy. Kinematical studies of FOG revealed a decrease in velocity, stride length and an exponential increase in cadence, prior to a FOG episode.

Deep brain stimulation may also be effective in treating a number of psychiatric disorders, including treatment refractory depression and OCD. Although DBS is a widely accepted therapy in motor disorders, it remains an invasive and expensive procedure. The ethical and social challenges of DBS need further examination, and discussion and emerging applications of DBS in psychiatry may also complicate the ethical landscape of DBS.\nTo identify and characterize current and emerging issues in the use of DBS, we reviewed the neurosurgical literature on DBS as well as the interdisciplinary medical ethics and relevant psychological and sociological literatures. We also consulted the USPTO database, FDA regulations and report decisions, and the business reports of key DBS manufacturers.\nImportant ethical and social challenges exist in the current and extending practice of DBS, notably in patient selection, informed consent, resource allocation, and in public understanding. These challenges are likely to be amplified if emerging uses of DBS in psychiatry are approved.\nOur review of ethical and social issues related to DBS highlights that several significant challenges, although not insurmountable, need much closer attention. A combination of approaches previously used in neuroethics, such as expert consensus workshops to establish ethical guidelines and public engagement to improve public understanding, may be fruitful to explore."}, {"Title": "Education research: Bias and poor interrater reliability in evaluating the neurology clinical skills examination.", "Abstract": "The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) has recently replaced the traditional, centralized oral examination with the locally administered Neurology Clinical Skills Examination (NEX). The ABPN postulated the experience with the NEX would be similar to the Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise, a reliable and valid assessment tool. The reliability and validity of the NEX has not been established.\nNEX encounters were videotaped at 4 neurology programs. Local faculty and ABPN examiners graded the encounters using 2 different evaluation forms: an ABPN form and one with a contracted rating scale. Some NEX encounters were purposely failed by residents. Cohen's kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for local vs ABPN examiners.\nNinety-eight videotaped NEX encounters of 32 residents were evaluated by 20 local faculty evaluators and 18 ABPN examiners. The interrater reliability for a determination of pass vs fail for each encounter was poor (kappa 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11, 0.53). ICC between local faculty and ABPN examiners for each performance rating on the ABPN NEX form was poor to moderate (ICC range 0.14-0.44), and did not improve with the contracted rating form (ICC range 0.09-0.36). ABPN examiners were more likely than local examiners to fail residents.\nThere is poor interrater reliability between local faculty and American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology examiners. A bias was detected for favorable assessment locally, which is concerning for the validity of the examination.

AIM AND SETTING: This study describes the adaptation of the OSCE method for training purposes in a postgraduate psychiatry training center in India and the initial findings with regard to trainee performance.\nThe adapted method was called the objective structured clinical assessment with feedback (OSCAF). The adaptation included several steps--modifying existing OSCE patterns for language and cultural appropriateness, using supervised roleplaying instead of standardized or simulated patients and evolving an assessment method (14-item checklist) that would generate feedback. This exercise was conducted in front of a group of multidisciplinary peers and supervisors.\nDescriptive statistics and ANOVA were used.\nAnalysis of the performance based on the 14-item checklist assessing common elements of any patient-related interaction in 34 different OSCAF tasks indicated the following: less-than-satisfactory (<75%) performances in the following areas--assuring confidentiality (73.5%), assessing comfort (62%), summarizing (60%), closure (62%) and checking whether the 'patient' had understood what was being communicated (42%). Based on the nature of clinical situations, performances on some specific and difficult OSCAF situations were found to be inadequate and indicated need for further training.\nWe have been able to demonstrate OSCAF to be a convenient, cost-effective training method in psychiatry, with limited demands on resources; however, further refinements in ratings and feedback methods and studies on effectiveness may enhance its utility."}, {"Title": "Improving care for patients with dementia hospitalized for acute somatic illness in a specialized care unit: a feasibility study.", "Abstract": "Persons with dementia hospitalized for an acute illness have a high risk of poor outcomes and add to the burden on acute care systems. We developed a segregated Special Care Unit (SCU) in a somatic hospital for patients with challenging behavior resulting from dementia and/or delirium. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and patient outcomes.\nThe SCU was established with environmental features that allow for safe and unrestricted ambulation within the unit and create a home-like atmosphere. Daytime activities structure the day and assure additional professional presence. The staff received intensive specialized training. Feasibility criteria were: acceptance by the staff, avoidance of transfers to geriatric psychiatry, lack of serious falls and mortality. Patient outcome criteria were ADL (Barthel index), mobility scores and behavior scores (Wilcoxon's, McNemar tests, pre-post design).\n332 consecutively admitted patients were enrolled. The SCU has been well received by the staff. Length of hospital stay did not differ from other hospital patients (15.3 +/- 8.3 vs. 15.0 +/- 10.3 days, p = 0.54). Six patients were transferred to geriatric psychiatry. Two patients suffered a fall-related hip fracture. The median Barthel Index improved significantly (admission 30, discharge 45, p < 0.001), with only 8.5% of patients suffering functional loss. Wandering, aggression and agitation were significantly reduced (p < 0.001).\nThe SCU has improved the care of patients with challenging behavior. Decline in ADL function and institutionalization occurred to a lesser degree than would be expected in this group of patients.

The following factors were investigated: sociodemographic and illness-related variables, pretreatment, the reasons for change of treatment (lack of efficacy, side effects, non-compliance), side effects of pretreatment and body-mass-index (BMI).\nSociodemographic and most illness-related variables did not have an influence on the physicians' choice of medication. Risperidone was more frequently prescribed in patients with severe positive symptoms than amisulpride or quetiapine. Rigidity, orthostatic dizziness and gynecomastia during pretreatment were frequently associated with starting patients on ziprasidone. In patients with diminished sexual desire ziprasidone was preferred over olanzapine. Amisulpride was used more commonly than olanzapine if patients had experienced weight gain during pretreatment. Moreover, patients who were prescribed amisulpride had a significantly higher BMI in comparison to patients who were prescribed olanzapine. The reasons for current change of treatment, as well as the drug history (total number of antipsychotic drugs prescribed during the course of the illness) did not have an influence on the physicians' choice of antipsychotic.\nIn summary, the data suggest that side effects have a larger influence on the choice of antipsychotic than demographic or illness-related variables, except the severity of positive symptoms."}, {"Title": "Stigma, negative attitudes and discrimination towards mental illness within the nursing profession: a review of the literature.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper was to review the existing literature pertaining to stigma, negative attitudes and discrimination towards mental illness, specifically as viewed through the lens of the nursing profession.

Because of the high incidence of depression in the involutional period, its symptomatic characteristics, and somewhat poor prognosis, this was recognized as valid at that time. Nowadays, the broadening concept of mood disorder denies involutional melancholia as a valid independent entity, and so it is included in mood disorders. A closer psychopathological inspection, however, still reveals several crucial differentiating points, which suggest that should be separated from the current mood disorder concept. Its cardinal symptoms are as follows: unveiled basic anxiety (Schneider K), specific autistic thinking (Kranz H), lack of insight, dissimulation, and severe suicidal thoughts. Patients fear that their innermost mind will be revealed, try to hide it, and even pretend to be healthy. Melancholic patients are believed to be at an extremely high risk of suicide. Difference between species and types of disease and the diagnostic hierarchial rule, which classifies all mental disorders into four different hierarchies (groups), are also referred to.

Violent acts in this study were defined as deliberate and nonconsensual acts of actual, attempted or threatened harm to a person or persons, and classified into categories of any type of violence, physical violence and non-physical violence, which is in accordance with approaches used in other risk assessment researches,\nThe authors present four cases of mentally ill inpatients whose violent behaviour toward self or other persons resulted in self-destruction and physical aggression against other persons. The presented cases involved: 1) self-injury in a patient with acute organic mental disorder after jumping through a hospital window, 2) suicide by drowning of a patient with acute mental disorder after escaping from intensive care unit, 3) suicide in a depressive patient after escaping from a low-security psychiatry unit, 4) physical violence against body and life of other persons in a patient with chronic mental disorder.\nThe presented cases are considered to be rare in clinical practice and risk of violent behaviour and the consequent danger of mentally ill inpatients may be efficiently predicted and prevented with appropriate hospital management based on 1) repeated escalation of violent behaviour and 2) protection of the patient and others. Hence, if the physician in order to prevent harmful consequences, does not apply all the necessary measures, including appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, as well as treatment in an adequate setting, such act is against the Criminal Law of the Republic of Serbia which sanctions physician's negligence.

This preliminary study examines similarities and differences between the Training Psychotherapy Experience (TPE), an elective offered to residents in a large psychiatry training program, and psychotherapy conducted by the same clinicians in their private practices (TAU). We used the Psychotherapy Process Q-set (PQS; Ablon & Jones, 1988; Ablon, Levy, & Katzenstein, 2006). All program consultants who perform TPE were offered their standard fee to complete one PQS while envisioning a typical TPE session and another while envisioning a typical TAU session, using their own assessment of what happens in such sessions. These data were subjected to factor analysis to develop prototypes (TAU and TPE) that could be compared with each other and with validated prototypes developed by Ablon and Jones (1998, 2002). Twenty-two of the 25 clinicians who perform TPE (88%) responded to the study. We found two distinct prototypes in both TPE and TAU. One correlated significantly with Ablon and Jones' Cognitive-Behavioral and Interpersonal prototypes, and the other with their Psychodynamic prototype. There was no significant difference between corresponding TPE and TAU prototypes. We conclude, first, TPE offers trainees an experience of psychotherapy that is very similar to psychotherapy of actual patients. Second, experienced clinicians integrate a broad array of useful interventions into both TPE and TAU."}, {"Title": "Implications of the current insolubility of the mind-brain problem for the contemporary practice of psychodynamic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Abstract Even in this so-called era of the brain, there has been no consensual agreement on understanding the genesis of the mind by the brain, the problem that also baffled Freud, the neurologist at the start of his great discoveries. Especially, there has been no progress in solving what is known as the \"hard problem,\" namely, how neurophysiological processes in the brain can produce conscious experiences, feelings, and intentions that constitute the \"qualia,\" the various aspects of the phenomena of consciousness. Some of the predominant contemporary positions on the mind-brain problem, from Freud's Project for a Scientific Psychology to the present day, will be described and some of the technical vocabulary will be explained. I will conclude from this review that the \"mysterian\" position or some derivatives of it such as \"anomalous monism\" or \"agnostic materialism\" are probably the most plausible, given the present state of our knowledge and capacities. The latter two positions suggest that we simply do not know enough about the physical world of matter at this time but eventually perhaps discoveries about the nature of matter may solve the problem. But as of now, the implication of this impasse is that the introspective data of consciousness are ontologically subjective, pointing to the absolute necessity for our studying this data in its own domain through introspection. The most meticulous and thorough method for this study is psychoanalytic psychiatry, which was specifically devised by Freud for that purpose."}, {"Title": "Designing for dissemination: development of an evidence-based tobacco treatment curriculum for psychiatry training programs.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry training programs provide a unique arena for affecting professional norms and increasing access to tobacco cessation services among smokers with mental illness.

Medical students viewed psychiatry as the least attractive specialty for the degree to which patients are helped effectively and in terms of having a reliable scientific foundation. However, it rated well in regard to being intellectually challenging, a rapidly advancing field of medicine, and providing research opportunities and a good lifestyle. Psychiatry is less respected than most other specialties by students and they perceive this discipline to be poorly respected by other medical students and current medical practitioners. After viewing the DVD, there were improved student ratings of the benefits of a career in psychiatry, especially in relation to the specialty being enjoyable, offering effective treatment and having a scientific foundation. There was also enhanced understanding of the role of a psychiatrist in just over half of the participants and increased interest in psychiatry in about 30% of participants.

We evaluated relations between length of stay and clinical and socio-demographic features (linear regression) and possible differences confronting BPRS scores at admission and discharge in the different diagnostic subgroups (ANOVA for repeated measures).\nAll the sample of patients showed a significant improvement in symptomatology during hospitalization. Worse symptomatology in anxiety-depression domain of BPRS at admission in the whole sample was positively correlated with length of stay. A longer length of stay was also shown in patients with diagnosis of depressive disorder.

Different diagnostic groups had different response to hospitalization, showing faster improvement in characteristic symptomatology, but the anxiety-depression domain showed the highest percentage of change for all the diagnostic groups.

It is widely acknowledged that social functioning and social cognition are impaired in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although an impressive amount of neuroscientific research has been conducted in ADHD, little effort has been made to link those deficits in social cognition and functioning to the well-known brain abnormalities detected in structural and functional neuroimaging studies. We review seven functional and magnetic resonance studies conducted at our laboratory in ADHD samples during the last 5 years in order to scrutinize whether the putative neuroanatomic regions underpinning social cognition are affected in ADHD. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the caudate nucleus, the ventral striatum, and the cerebellum are among those regions that displayed functional or morphometric abnormalities in our ADHD samples. The OFC is clearly involved in social cognition, and several features of OFC dysfunction may be related to the social cognition and function impairment in ADHD. In contrast to the OFC, the role of the caudate nucleus, the ventral striatum, and the cerebellum is elusive. However, on one hand, there is converging evidence from human and animal neuropsychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry that support the role of such areas in social cognition, mainly through its involvement in emotional processing. On the other hand, the morphometric and functional ADHD abnormalities in these regions could account for the impoverished social functioning and the deficient social cognition skills of ADHD children."}, {"Title": "Priapism associated with olanzapine.", "Abstract": "Priapism is a rare but serious adverse effect of psychotropic drugs where antipsychotic agents were implicated in 15 to 26% of priapism associated with medications.

The authors aim to understand how students are learning and growing in these domains and to modify the clerkship in an ongoing manner.\nData were collected from the Dartmouth Medical Encounter Documentation System (DMEDS) for all student encounters in required third-year psychiatry clerkships during academic years 2004-2007, in which students had intensive involvement in patient care.\nOne hundred seventy three students reported a total of 4,676 patient encounters, averaging 27.2 encounters per student and 1.8 psychiatric diagnoses per patient. Students met \"learning targets\" for anxiety disorder, bipolar affective disorder, depression, personality disorder (borderline), posttraumatic stress disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, and substance abuse (alcohol), but not for disorders more likely seen in outpatient settings. For the 10 counseling skills learning targets, students only met those for family issues. In the four \"newer\" competency domains, students reported struggling with issues in 0.3% to 12.6% of encounters. Students documented being challenged by professionalism issues most often and recorded examples of how these competencies played out for them during the clerkship.\nUse of a required web-based medical encounter reporting system for student-patient-faculty encounters during a psychiatry clerkship can be of significant value in assessing what students are seeing, doing, and learning on this required third-year experience. The results provide helpful current information to the clerkship director and data that help the director modify the clerkship on an ongoing basis to better meet students' educational needs."}, {"Title": "Severity of neglect predicts accuracy of imitation in patients with right hemisphere lesions.", "Abstract": "Goldenberg [Goldenberg, G. (1996). Defective imitation of gestures in patients with damage in the left or right hemisphere. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 61, 176-180] proposed that the vulnerability of the imitation of meaningless gestures to right or left brain damage depends on the body parts that are involved in the gestures. Whereas imitation of hand postures was disturbed only in patients with left brain damage, imitation of finger postures was affected to similar degrees in left and right brain damage. Subsequent studies confirmed the selective vulnerability of hand postures to LBD but failed to replicate the severe disturbance of finger postures in RBD. In contrast to Goldenberg's studies, these studies excluded RBD patients with neglect. The present investigation aimed to explore the relationship between spatial neglect and imitation of finger postures in RBD patients. Presence and severity of spatial neglect and accuracy of imitation of hand and finger postures were tested in 50 RBD patients. Disturbance of imitation was much more severe for finger than hand postures and was tightly correlated with severity of neglect. The number of errors was higher for fingers which from the patient's perspective were located on the left side of the examiner's demonstrating hand but this spatial bias was not sufficient to explain all errors. Possible causes for non-lateralized errors could be a general narrowing of the focus of attention and reduced capacity for processing of visual information which have been postulated to be regular companions of the lateral displacement of attention in spatial neglect."}, {"Title": "[The effect of psychoeducation on quality of life in depressive disorders - results of an evaluation study in Graz].", "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of psychoeducation (PE) on quality of life in depressive patients at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Medicine of Graz.\nWe tested 49 depressive patients who participated in 9 PE group sessions at twice weekly intervals.

Data were collected for the years 1992 through 2002.\nFour subgroups were identified. Two \"low trauma\" subgroups had infrequent histories of abuse and out-of-home placement but were distinguished by low/moderate versus high levels of parental impairment. Two \"complex trauma\" subgroups were characterized by histories of either physical abuse or sexual abuse with multiple perpetrators, as well as extensive out-of-home placement and severe parental impairment. All subgroups had similar profiles of psychiatric diagnoses. Complex trauma status was associated with behavior problem severity and lower body mass index over and above the effects of psychiatric diagnoses, gender, and ethnicity. Although abuse history was a factor in subgroup membership, the multiple out-of-home placements variable was the most consistent correlate of externalizing and internalizing problems and psychosocial impairment.\nChildhood adversity that may constitute complex trauma was associated with externalizing behavior problems and psychosocial impairment among psychiatrically hospitalized children, and this association cannot be accounted for fully by existing psychiatric diagnoses, gender, or ethnicity."}, {"Title": "Implementation of CYP2D6 genotyping in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Response to pharmacotherapy is subject to large inter-individual variation. Most medicine is metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, including CYP2D6. CYP2D6 activity is determined substantially by the genetic composition. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 are associated with inadequate response on treatment with psychotropics. The large number of polymorphisms of CYP2D6 raises the question of the way associations between genotype and clinical outcome measurements should be analysed and implemented into a clinical setting.\nSeveral methods used for grouping CYP2D6 genotypes are discussed, including the Predicted Phenotype method, the Semi-quantitative Gene Dose system and the Activity Score system. Possible ways to translate genetic information into dose recommendations and to implement genetic information into a clinical setting are discussed.\nA 100% accurate prediction of metabolic activity is not possible due to the effect of non-genetic factors on metabolic activity. When used for clinical purposes, none of the methods for grouping CYP2D6 genotypes has substantial advantages. The Semi-quantitative Gene Dose or Activity Score system might be preferred for research purposes. Large clinical studies on cost-efficiency will be needed to assure the cost-efficiency of routinely genotyping CYP2D6. Creating more awareness among prescribers of psychotropics about the genetic causes for aberrant drug response, and the possibility of genotyping, is desirable."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatry in north Africa.", "Abstract": "This is the first review of literature regarding forensic psychiatry in north Africa that analyzes diversity of practice in this region of the world and its impact on mental health patients dealing with the judicial system.\nThe present study shows similarities and differences in various countries in north Africa.

Guidelines recommend using cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with this group. Clearly, mental health professionals require training and supervision to deliver CBT-based interventions. This study tested which antipsychotic-resistant patients were most likely to respond to brief CBT delivered by psychiatric nurses. Staff were trained over 10 consecutive days with ongoing weekly supervision. Training for carers in the basic principles of CBT was also provided. This article represents the secondary analyses of completer data from a previously published randomized controlled trial (Turkington D, Kingdon D, Turner T. Effectiveness of a brief cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention in the treatment of schizophrenia. Br J Psychiatry. 2002;180:523-527) (n = 354) to determine whether a number of a priori variables were predictive of a good outcome with CBT and treatment as usual. Logistic regression was employed to determine whether any of these variables were able to predict a 25% or greater improvement in overall symptoms and insight. In the CBT group only, female gender was found to strongly predict a reduction in overall symptoms (P = .004, odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33, 4.30) and increase in insight (P = .04, OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.03, 3.29). In addition, for individuals with delusions, a lower level of conviction in these beliefs was associated with a good response to brief CBT (P = .02, OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.51, 0.95). Women with schizophrenia and patients with a low level of conviction in their delusions are most likely to respond to brief CBT and should be offered this routinely alongside antipsychotic medications and other psychosocial interventions."}, {"Title": "Adult outcomes of youth irritability: a 20-year prospective community-based study.", "Abstract": "Irritability is a widely occurring DSM-IV symptom in youths. However, little is known about the relationship between irritability in early life and its outcomes in mid-adulthood. This study examines the extent to which youth irritability is related to adult psychiatric outcomes by testing the hypothesis that it predicts depressive and generalized anxiety disorders.\nThe authors conducted a longitudinal community-based study of 631 participants whose parents were interviewed when participants were in early adolescence (mean age=13.8 years [SD=2.6]) and who were themselves interviewed 20 years later (mean age=33.2 years [SD=2.9]). Parent-reported irritability in adolescence was used to predict self-reported psychopathology, assessed by standardized diagnostic interview at 20-year follow-up.\nCross-sectionally, irritability in adolescence was widely associated with other psychiatric disorders. After adjustment for baseline emotional and behavioral disorders, irritability in adolescence predicted major depressive disorder (odds ratio=1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.00-1.78]), generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio=1.72, 95% CI=1.04-2.87), and dysthymia (odds ratio=1.81, 95% CI=1.06-3.12) at 20-year follow-up. Youth irritability did not predict bipolar disorder or axis II disorders at follow-up.\nYouth irritability as reported by parents is a specific predictor of self-reported depressive and anxiety disorders 20 years later. The role of irritability in developmental psychiatry, and in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders specifically, should receive further study."}, {"Title": "Neurophobia and its implications: evidence from a Caribbean medical school.", "Abstract": "Neurology is regarded as a difficult component of the medical curriculum.

A survey tool successfully used in other schools was adapted to assess perceived level of difficulty, knowledge and interest in various medical sub-specialties including, neurology, cardiology, psychiatry, geriatrics, endocrinology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology and pediatrics. Questions asked included: \"What is your current level of interest in the following medical specialties?\"; \"What is your current level of knowledge in the given medical specialties?\"; \"Do you think the subject is easy or difficult?\" and \"Why do you think neurology is difficult?\" Students were required to answer using a Likert scale and results were tabulated into mean scores and standard errors.\nThe response rate was 65% (167/255). Neurology was identified as the subject which students found most difficult (score 3.89 +/- 0.068) and had least knowledge of (2.32 +/- 0.075). These scores were significantly different from those observed for the other disciplines (p < 0.001). The need to know basic neuroscience was identified as the biggest contributor to the difficulty associated with neurology (3.89 +/- 0.072) followed closely by the complex clinical examination associated with neurology (3.69 +/- 0.072). Greater clinical and practical exposure, more time being spent on the subject, and improved teaching skills of lecturers were put forward as suggestions for improving the teaching of neurology.\nThis study provides empirical evidence that 'neurophobia' may indeed exist among the student population of the school.

Despite the fact that classical psychiatric training provides theoretical knowledge and practical skills relevant to both clinical and forensic psychiatric work, the latter requires a quite different understanding of doctor-patient relationship, ethic-development and legally oriented practice to be developed. Almost all researchers or opinion leaders in forensic psychiatry agree that, in this distinguished area, specific principles and characteristics apply: the forensic psychiatrist supports mainly the legal system rather than the patient, he needs to develop new interview techniques and a new database of knowledge in order to deal with the \"psycho-legal\" questions to be answered, and he also needs to avoid psychiatric jargon and adjust his terminology to terms understandable by the legal profession. At the same time forensic psychiatrists should be ready to confront the examinees with contradictory information they may provide and contact third parties to check the validity of their impressions, keeping in mind the probability of malingering or other reasons behind observed behaviours. Moreover the conclusions presented by the forensic psychiatrist to the courts need to be, to a certain degree, safe results based on his observations, examinations and theoretical scientific knowledge, despite the fact that he is frequently asked to comment on issues concerning the past or the future. Finally confidentiality issues are irrelevant to forensic work and the inevitable distribution of reports to all involved parties may result, in some cases, to questioning of the expert witness's professional opinion and his involvement in disciplinary or penal prosecution.

The aim of this report was to present a case of migraine headache aggravated after sexual abuse, which did not respond to treatment. An 11-year-old girl admitted to the outpatient department of the Neurology Clinic with headache complaint for the past two years. Neurological examination, neuroimaging and laboratory tests were normal. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-II criteria, the headache was diagnosed as migraine without aura and treatment as prophylaxis was planned. Her headache did not respond to treatment, so she was consulted with the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and diagnosed as major depressive disorder. During one of the psychological interviews, she confessed that she had been sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend for two years. After this confession and punishment of the abuser, her headache improved dramatically. The prevalence of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse during childhood has been estimated between 13% and 27%, and these children may suffer chronic pain, headache or depression. Sexual abuse has been strongly associated with the migraine-depression phenotype when abuse first occurred before the age of 12 years. Despite the high prevalence of abuse, many physicians do not routinely ask about abuse history. In conclusion, child abuse must be kept in mind in intractable childhood headache.

Nonetheless, given our profound, enduring attachments to culture, it appears reasonable that host societies should, at least in part, co-operate with refugees, voluntary migrants and/or ethnic minority groups in re-shaping elements of public services to optimize their appropriateness to the linguistic and historical traditions of such groups. This is particularly relevant to services that address complex states of psychological distress. In addition, it is apparent that globalization is revising received notions of citizenship and opening up political processes to groups who were previously excluded, including the mentally ill. While it is necessary to avoid excessive shifts away from the rights of the individual towards the rights of culturally defined sub-groups, it is important that public services recognize the myriad challenges and opportunities presented by evolving models of culture and citizenship in a globalizing world."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and movies.", "Abstract": "As one of the most potent and substantial form of mass communication, film exercises a very significant influence upon the perceptions of the audience, especially in relation to mental illness issues, and that perception is very much blurred with populists' misinterpretation and lack of awareness regarding problems faced by persons suffering from mental disorders. Movies such as \"Psycho\", \"One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Exorcist\", despite being valuable in an artistic sense, corroborated and encouraged confusion and undermined the clarity and certainty concerning the fine line separating mental health from mental illness. Modern film makers and movie theoreticians try to overcome these limitations which are often generated by exploitation of stereotypes and myths referring to mentally ill people. This paper defines and discusses the most frequent thematic stereotypes seen in movies which are perpetuating stigmatization of mentally ill people. They are: free-spirited rebel, maniac on a killing spree, seducer, enlightened member of society, narcissistic parasite, beastly person (stereotype of animal sort). Psychiatry and cinematography are linked inseparably not only because they creatively complement each other, but also as an opportunity of mutual influences blending into didactical categories and professional driving forces, benefiting both the filmmakers' and the psychiatrists' professions."}, {"Title": "Use or underuse of therapeutic guidelines in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "A rapid expansion of new treatment options in recent decades and the increasing volume of scientific evidence published on a daily basis have been followed by the necessity of introduction of clinical guidelines and therapeutic algorithms. The development of these guidelines and algorithms has also been driven by increased cost-awareness and the increasing pressure to improve cost-efficiency. The Serbian Physicians Society published \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Schizophrenia\" in 2003 and \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder\" in 2004. The School of Medicine, University of Belgrade published \"Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Depression\" in 2004. All of these national guidelines, at the moment of development, were based upon up-to-date scientific evidence. According to the recently conducted survey at the Institute of Psychiatry, Clinical Centre of Serbia, about 65% of psychiatrists stated that they adhere to the national or relevant international therapeutic guidelines. When asked to cite which international or foreign guidelines in particular they used, approximately 50% failed to do so, while the other half cited mostly the APA Guidelines or NICE Guidelines. Among the national guidelines, physicians are, according to the survey, familiar with the Therapeutic Guidelines for the treatment of Schizophrenia (46.3%), Therapeutic Guidelines of Depression (41.5%) and Therapeutic Guidelines for the Treatment of Bipolar Affective Disorder (34.1%). The majority of Serbian psychiatrists rely on the efficacy and safety of the drugs as the major determining factors in the choice of therapy, bearing in mind the patients' best interests. However, it is unclear why such a discrepancy between practice and guidelines still persists, since guidelines also recommend therapy based on their safety and efficacy data. It is possible that a substantial percentage of psychiatrists obtain indicators on drugs' efficacy and safety from their personal professional experience. It is doubtful whether this knowledge is valid, or just represents unproven prescribers' habits. Furthermore, the influence on other factors, such as treatment costs or drug availability should be further investigated."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic profile of transsexual patients.", "Abstract": "Gender identity disorder is a rare entity in psychiatry which affects deep instincts and personal identity. A review of the recent literature has shown that research of socio-demographic characteristics of transsexual patients is sporadic. There are very few investigations which consider the socio-demographic characteristics in individuals with disharmonized sex and gender identity. This kind of research has not been done in Serbia until now. The objective of this research was to evaluate and analyze socio-demographic data of transsexual persons with a homosexual orientation.\nThe paper presents the mentioned characteristics on sample of 30 gender dysphoric persons. The patients were examined by The Belgrade team for gender identity. The transsexuals were in a stage of preparation for the sex-reassignment surgery (SRS), and transsexualism was diagnosed and guided within this program (used criteria were keeping with ICD X, DSM IV and Diagnostic schedule recommended by Standards of Care for Dysphoric Persons of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association). We have examined the following socio-demographic characteristics: sex, age, place of residence, educational level, employment and religion.\nResults and analysis of obtained data have shown that the socio-demographic profile of transsexual patients included in the research is: predominantly males (male/female sex ratio 3:2); refer for psychiatric help in younger age (frequently before 26); most of them with high school education; live in urban communities; mostly Orthodox religion; equally employed and unemployed.\nGathering and analysis of sociodemographic data is important for elucidating the transsexual patient's profile. It facilitates better understanding, timely recognition and choice of appropriate treatment for these patients."}, {"Title": "How medical students in their pre-clinical year perceive psychiatry as a career: the study from Belgrade.", "Abstract": "Taking the Initiative to evaluate students' affinity toward psychiatry seems to be a global issue and is an essential part of programs to improve the status of the profession. The aim of this study is to explore medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry in comparison to other residencies (internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, gynecology and general medicine) in the pre-clinical year and to observe which factors influence the creation of these attitudes.\nThe survey included 114 students of the second year, School of Medicine in Belgrade (academic year 2007/08). The data was collected trough a 23-item questionnaire.\nFifteen percent of students stated that psychiatry was their career of choice, while 25% expressed a strong aversion. Psychiatry was ranked less attractive than internal medicine, surgery and pediatrics, but more attractive than general medicine or gynecology. Those who like psychiatry attributed more importance to an interesting and challenging job than to prestige and financial reward. Also, they found this field to be intellectually challenging and to rapidly expand the frontier of medicine. Students with negative attitude were convinced that psychiatry was lacking in scientific foundation and was clinically inefficient, they disliked intensive emotional involvement, exposure to stress and frequent unpleasant situations and had prejudices toward the patients or simply a lack of the interest.\nThe present study is the first of its kind in Serbia which used a precise and internationally comparable methodological instrument and It shows that pre-clinical medical students at the University of Belgrade, have a stronger affinity towards psychiatry when compared to their peers from most countries worldwide. Also, the study points out the fact that prejudices toward patients with mental dysfunctions and lack of confidence in the efficacy of psychiatric treatment should be specially targeted by the curriculum in the later part of undergraduate education. How this will affect the attitude of clinical students and graduates is to be examined."}, {"Title": "The historical development of psychiatry in Serbia.", "Abstract": "The authors present the development of the concept of mental disease and treatment in Serbian medicine.

After World War I, in 1923, the Faculty of Medicine was established in Belgrade to which the coryphaei of Serbian medicine educated in Europe, mostly in France and Germany, flocked and that same year the Psychiatry Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine in Belgrade was set up. Its first seat was on the premises of the Mental Hospital in Belgrade, and it became a training base and laid the foundations of the future Neuropsychiatry Clinic in Belgrade, which in time evolved into the nursery of psychiatric professionals for all of Serbia.

Patients who died within 1 year of psychiatric consultation were compared to age-matched patients from the same group who survived on demographic and clinical domains.\nSixty-nine patients (15.2%) died within 1 year of referral for psychiatric consultation. Delirium was the only psychiatric diagnosis significantly associated with 1-year mortality [52.2% vs. 29.9%, P=.01; hazard ratio (HR), 1.7]. Cancer was the only medical condition associated with 1-year mortality (24.6% vs. 6.0%, P<.0001; HR, 3.03). Having both delirium and cancer shortened mean survival time significantly. Mortality risk was also associated with time duration between admission and psychiatric consultation.\nThe 1-year mortality rate in this group of medical-surgical inpatients referred for psychiatric consultation was 15.2%. Mortality was independently associated with delirium and cancer. Mortality was also associated with greater length of time from admission to consultation, which raises a question about whether earlier psychiatry consultation may have a positive impact on survival."}, {"Title": "Ethical psychiatry in an uncertain world: conversations and parallel truths.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric practice is often faced with complex situations that seem to pose serious moral dilemmas for practitioners. Methods for solving these dilemmas have included the development of more objective rules to guide the practitioner such as utilitarianism and deontology. A more modern variant on this objective model has been 'Principlism' where 4 mid level rules are used to help solve these complex problems. In opposition to this, there has recently been a focus on more subjective criteria for resolving complex moral dilemmas. In particular, virtue ethics has been posited as a more sensitive method for helping doctors to reason their way through difficult ethical issues. Here the focus is on the character traits of the practitioner. Bloch and Green advocated another way whereby more objective methods such as Principlism and virtue ethics are combined to produce what they considered sound moral reasoning in psychiatrists. This paper points out some difficulties with this approach and instead suggests that a better model of ethical judgment could be developed through the use of narratives or stories. This idea puts equal prima facie value on the patient's and the psychiatrist's version of the dilemma they are faced with. It has the potential to lead to a more genuine empathy and reflective decision-making."}, {"Title": "Brain dysfunction behind functional symptoms: neuroimaging and somatoform, conversive, and dissociative disorders.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging research in psychiatry has been increasing exponentially in recent years, yet many psychiatrists are relatively unfamiliar with this field. This article summarizes the findings of the most relevant research articles on the neuroimaging of somatoform, conversive, and dissociative disorders published from January 2007 through June 2008.\nNeuroimaging findings summarized here include alterations of stress regulation and coping in somatoform pain disorders, the importance of catastrophizing in somatization disorder, and the relevance of a history of physical/sexual abuse in irritable bowel syndrome. Regarding fibromyalgia, three of the most significant advances have been the impossibility of differentiating primary and concomitant fibromyalgia in the presence of quiescent underlying disease, the role of hippocampal dysfunction, and the possibility that fibromyalgia may be characterized as an aging process. In dissociative disorders, the high levels of elaborative memory encoding and the reduced size of the parietal lobe are highlighted.\nThe most promising clinical consequence of these studies, in addition to improving knowledge about the etiology of these illnesses, is the possibility of using neuroimaging findings to identify subgroups of patients, which could allow treatments to be tailored."}, {"Title": "Regional distribution of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in rat brain and peripheral organs on chronic clomipramine administration.", "Abstract": "The tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clomipramine has been widely used in psychiatry for over 40 years. More recently, its therapeutic potential as an antineoplastic drug has been identified. However, there are no prior data on regional distribution in the brain of clomipramine and its primary metabolite (desmethylclomipramine) after chronic oral administration. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine in different rat-brain regions and to compare those with levels in plasma and peripheral organs after chronic oral treatment of Sprague Dawley rats (15 mg/kg) for 14 days. The levels of both parent TCA and metabolite were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography in six brain regions (cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, brainstem and cerebellum), five peripheral organs and in plasma. Our data show that the cerebral cortex had the highest concentration of clomipramine (2.9 microg/mg), with successively lower concentrations in the hypothalamus, striatum, cerebellum, hippocampus and brainstem. Of the peripheral organs, the lungs and liver, had the highest levels of clomipramine, while in the heart, only the metabolite was detected. The plasma concentration (0.17 microg/ml or 0.48 microM) was comparable to that in the hippocampus and cerebellum (approximately 0.20 microg/mg). The differential distribution of clomipramine in different brain regions and the regional variation in clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine ratios have implications for the use of clomipramine in psychiatry and neuro-oncology."}, {"Title": "The modified SCID Hypomania Module (SCID-Hba): a detailed systematic phenomenologic probing.", "Abstract": "Diagnosing past hypomania is a difficult task. Current structured interviews (e.g. CIDI, SCID) limit the ability to probe for hypomania. A modified SCID Hypomania Module was published by us (Benazzi and Akiskal, J Affect Disord 2003; Akiskal and Benazzi, J Clin Psychiatry 2005) in order to overcome the limitations of structured interviewing. Our papers outlined the framework of the modified SCID. In response to requests from many readers of this journal and other clinicians and investigators, we are hereby providing a more explicit step-by-step phenomenologic probing interview. DSM-IV criteria have to be met, but the probing for hypomania is very different from that of the SCID. All past hypomanic symptoms are assessed. No negative meaning is given to symptoms, as hypomania often improves functioning and it is seen by patients as a state of well being. The first step is probing for overactivity (increase in goal-directed activity), because observable behaviors are easier to remember by patients and key informants. There is no gold-standard for overactivity: each person becomes his/her own standard to 'measure' a clear-cut departure form the usual behavior. Questions, correspondingly, can change from patient to patient. The emotions associated with behavioral change are easier to be remembered than asking them first, as in the structured interviews. Structured interviews have mood change (elation, irritability) as stem question (corresponding to the criterion A of DSM-IV, which postulates that it must always be present). However, apart from a likely recall bias of past emotions, the description of mood change appears more or less negative in structured interviews (to increase specificity but by much reducing sensitivity, i.e. the false-negatives). Presenting mood change as simply having been more elated/irritable than usual can easily be interpreted as normal mood fluctuations, while presenting mood change as much more than usual could be understood as a severe mental disorder. Both ways are likely to lead to a negative response, moving the interviewers to unipolar disorders (the skip-out instruction). Our modified SCID is a fully semi-structured interview: many questions are asked about each symptom to make the question understandable according to each patient, and, very importantly, examples of the 'events' are systematically asked to check understanding and clinical relevance. Our interview follows DSM-IV criteria (apart from the minimum duration, 2 days versus DSM-IV 4 days), i.e. mood change must always been present, but our probing detects more hypomanic episodes than the SCID."}, {"Title": "The application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 among geriatric psychiatry patients: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) was fully implemented in October 2007 in England and Wales.

We performed a factor analysis on the attitude items and used hierarchical regression analysis to explore the degree to which competency, reported weight loss, physician, training and practice characteristics explained the variance in each attitude factor.\nThe overall response rate was 63%. More than 40% of physicians had a negative reaction towards obese patients, 56% felt qualified to treat obesity, and 46% felt successful in this realm. The factor analysis revealed 4 factors-Physician Discomfort/Bias, Physician Success/Self Efficacy, Positive Outcome Expectancy, and Negative Outcome Expectancy. Competency and reported percent of patients who lose weight were most strongly associated with the Physician Success/Self Efficacy attitude factor. Greater skill in patient assessment was associated with less Physician Discomfort/Bias. Training characteristics were associated with outcome expectancies with newer physicians reporting more positive treatment expectancies. Pediatric faculty was more positive and psychiatry faculty less negative in their treatment expectancies than internal medicine faculty.\nPhysician attitudes towards obesity are associated with competency, specialty, and years since postgraduate training.

The present study aimed to ascertain whether VIP immunoreactivity really does exist in the human cerebellum by making a systematic analysis of samples removed post-mortem from all of the cerebellar lobes. The study was carried out using light microscopy immunohistochemical techniques based on a set of four different antibodies (three polyclonal and one monoclonal) against VIP, carefully selected on the basis of control tests performed on human colon. All of the antibodies used showed VIP-immunoreactive neuronal bodies and processes distributed in the cerebellar cortex and subjacent white matter of all of the cerebellum lobes, having similar qualitative patterns of distribution. Immunoreactive neurons included subpopulations of the main neuron types of the cortex. Statistical analysis of the quantitative data on the VIP immunoreactivity revealed by the different antibodies in the different cerebellar lobes did not demonstrate any significant differences. In conclusion, using four different anti-VIP antibodies, the first evidence of VIP immunoreactivity is herein supplied in the human post-mortem cerebellum, with similar qualitative/quantitative patterns of distribution among the different cerebellum lobes. Owing to the function performed by VIP as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, it is a candidate for a role in intrinsic and extrinsic (projective) circuits of the cerebellum, in agreement with previous demonstrations of receptors for VIP in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei. As VIP signalling pathways are implicated in the regulation of cognitive and psychic functions, cerebral blood flow and metabolism, processes of histomorphogenesis, differentiation and outgrowth of nervous tissues, the results of this study could be applied to clinical neurology and psychiatry, opening new perspectives for the interpretation of neurodevelopment disorders and development of new therapeutic strategies in cerebellar diseases."}, {"Title": "Melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatric illness.", "Abstract": "The aim of this review was to summarize the potential use of melatonin in the treatment of mental disorders, specifically bipolar disorders, depression, and schizophrenia.

The brain is an intricate sensory and motor organ which receives information from both the external and internal environments. It transduces information into complex chemical and electrical signals which are transmitted throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and the organism.

Yet, the doctor-patient relationship is fundamental to both specialties, and the principles that derive from psychotherapy theory and practice apply to that relationship regardless of the specialty. It is common knowledge that a large proportion of patients seen in the context of the practice of medicine have some kind of emotional disturbance. Moreover, patients with organic disease may also have significant emotional difficulties that complicate both the primary illness and its treatment. This experience inevitably has drawn attention to the need for the nonpsychiatric physician to have an understanding and proficiency in psychiatric diagnosis and psychotherapeutic principles. In this article, we consider basic psychotherapeutic principles that are useful in the everyday practice of neurologists and other nonpsychiatric physicians. These skills are important not only for practical reasons, but also because responsiveness to their emotional distress is essential to maintain empathy and caring as cornerstones of the art of medicine.

Students rated 22 questionnaire items addressing clerkships' global evaluation and domains related to structure, supervision, and clinical and problem-solving learning (PSL) activities using a five-point Likert scale. The authors performed statistical analysis using principal component analysis and regression analysis of items associated with students' global evaluation of clerkships.\nCorrelation between clerkships' global ratings and ratings derived from the evaluation questionnaire was 0.871 (P < .0001). Clerkships' quality was mainly related to their organization, students' integration into clerkship, improvement of clinical skills, supervision, and residents' availability (r = 0.405; P < .0001). Among learning activities, opportunities for clinical practice predominated as the contributing factor to the overall perceived quality of most clerkships, but less than PSL activities in psychiatry (r = 0.070 versus 0.261, respectively; P < .001) and community medicine (r = 0.126 versus 0.298, respectively; P < .001); in surgery, both clinical practice and PSL activities contributed minimally to the clerkships' perceived quality (r = 0.150 and 0.148, respectively; P > .05).\nFactors influencing students' evaluation of a clerkship vary among medical specialties and depend not only on the teaching and teacher but also on the clerkship's organization, supervision, and learning activities.

All patients had a negative experience about their families just before having the conversion. Diagnosis was made according to the DSM-IV criteria. A control group consisting of similar patient demographics of the disease group has been selected. Socio-demographic information forms, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Dissociation Questionnaire (DIS-Q), were completed on the patients.\nCTQ total (t=12.12, P<0.001) and subscales, emotional abuse and emotional neglect (EA-EN) (t=12.74, P<0.001), physical abuse (PA) (t=10.05, P<0.001), and sexual abuse (SA) (t=7.69, P<0.001) were significantly high in the conversion group. DIS-Q mean points were statistically higher in the conversion group (t=11.05, P<0.001).\nThe findings suggest that pseudoseizures (conversion disorder) should be included within dissociative disorders in DSM system as in ICD. It is usually uncommon for the patient to tell about childhood trauma without being specially questioned about this issue. Thus, it would be helpful to uncover these experiences by using related scales in conversion disorder patients."}, {"Title": "Maternal representations, infant psychiatric status, and mother-child relationship in clinic-referred and non-referred infants.", "Abstract": "To examine the relations between maternal representations, infant socio-emotional difficulties, and mother-child relational behavior, 49 clinic-referred infants and their mothers were compared to 30 non-referred controls. Clinic-referred infants' psychiatric status was determined with the DC 0-3-R classification of Zeanah and Benoit (Child Adolesc Psychiatry Clin N Am 4:539-554, 1995) and controls were screened for socio-emotional difficulties. Mothers were interviewed with the parent development interview (Aber et al. in The parent development interview. Unpublished manuscript, 1985) and dyads were observed in free play and problem-solving interactions. Group differences emerged for maternal representations and relational behaviors. Representations of clinic-referred mothers were characterized by lower joy, coherence, and richness, and higher anger experienced in the mother-infant relationship compared to controls. During free play, clinic-referred mothers showed lower sensitivity and higher intrusiveness and provided less adequate instrumental and emotional assistance and support during problem solving. Referred children showed lower social engagement during free play. Associations were found among maternal representations, maternal interactive behavior, child social engagement, and the child's ability to self-regulate during a challenging task. These findings provide empirical support for theoretical and clinical perspectives suggesting a reciprocal link between maternal negative representations and mother and child's maladaptive behaviors in the context of early socio-emotional difficulties and mental health referrals."}, {"Title": "[Hungarian translation of the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and our first experiences with the test].", "Abstract": "According to the dimensional approach of the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), it is possible to identify phenotypic subtypes--so called dimensions--within the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of OCD by statistical techniques (principal component analysis). The Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS) measures the presence of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms within the phenotype. The scale is a semi-structured instrument, which includes a symptom list divided into six dimensions for the patients and a part reserved for the clinician. The authors gave their written permission for the translation of the DY-BOCS test into Hungarian, revised the back-translation of the Hungarian version and the final, revised version is published for the first time, in Hungary. The Hungarian DY-BOCS was administered to seventeen OCD patients at 2nd Department of Psychiatry, Ny\u00edr\u00f4 Gyula Hospital. The reliability analysis produced strong correlation coefficients. The internal consistency (Cronbach alpha) scores were high, ranging from 0.97 to 0.99. The scores of the validity scales were also good. There was a strong convergent validity between the gold standard, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) global severity scores and the DY-BOCS global severity scores (p=0.001 / r=0.744). The examination of the internal validity showed that the DY-BOCS global score and the aggressive and miscellaneous dimension severity rating scores are strongly correlated. We also experienced strong correlation between the DY-BOCS global score and the component scores of the global severity ratings (time, distress, interference, and impairment), the Pearson's r ranged from 0.815 to 0.960. There was no significant inter-correlation between the dimensions, which supports the assumption that these dimensions are independent constructs. In the divergent validity measures, we used the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) to compare OCD dimensions with the most common comorbid disorder (depression) symptoms. The severity scores of the HAM-D were correlated with the severity scores of the DY-BOCS dimensions. In this latter validity test, we found only one significant correlation between the aggressive dimension and the severity of the depression. In the case of the remaining dimensions, there was no significant correlation between the dimensions and the severity of depression; thus, it seems that the two tests examine widely different psychological phenomena . The evaluating scores of the Hungarian version of the DY-BOCS are very close to the original published scores. These results indicate that the Hungarian version of the DY-BOCS is a reliable and a valid clinical tool and we hope that by using the test, Hungarian professionals will become familiar with and accept the dimensional approach of OCD."}, {"Title": "Smoking ban in a psychiatry department: are nonsmoking employees less exposed to environmental tobacco smoke?", "Abstract": "Staff members of psychiatric facilities are at high risk of secondhand smoking.

However, if patients report experiencing a lower level of pleasure than controls, they report experiencing as much pleasure as controls with online measurements of emotion.\nThe Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) measures pleasure experienced in the moment and in anticipation of future activities. The TEPS is an 18-item self-report measurement of anticipatory (10 items) and consummatory (eight items) pleasure. The goal of this paper is to assess the psychometric characteristics of the French translation of this scale.\nA control sample was composed of 60 women and 22 men, with a mean age of 38.1 years (S.D.: 10.8). Thirty-six were without qualification and 46 with qualified professional diploma. A sample of 21 patients meeting DSM IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia was recruited among the community psychiatry service of the department of psychiatry in Lausanne. They were five women and 16 men; mean age was of 34.1 years (S.D.: 7.5). Ten obtained a professional qualification and 11 were without qualification. None worked in competitive employment. Their mean dose of chlorpromazine equivalent was 431 mg (S.D.: 259). All patients were on atypical antipsychotics. The control sample fulfilled the TEPS and the Physical Anhedonia Scale (PAS). The patient sample fulfilled the TEPS and was independently rated on the Calgary Depression Scale and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. For comparison with controls, patients were matched on age, sex and professional qualification. This required the supplementary recruitment of two control subjects.\nResults with the control sample indicate that the TEPS presents an acceptable internal validity with Crombach alphas of 0.84 for the total scale, 0.74 for the anticipatory pleasure scale and 0.79 for the consummatory pleasure scale. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model is well adapted to our data (chi(2)/dl=1.333; df=134; p<0.0006; root mean square residual, RMSEA=0.064). External validity measured with the PAS showed R=-0.27 (p<0.05) for the consummatory scale and R=-0.26 for the total score. Comparisons between patients and matched controls indicated that patients were significantly lower than control on anticipatory pleasure (t=2.7, df(40), 2-tailed p=0.01; cohen's d=0.83) and on total score of the TEPS (t=2.8, df (40), 2-tailed p=0.01; cohen's d=0.87). The two samples did not differ on consummatory pleasure. The anticipatory pleasure factor and the total TEPS showed significant negative correlation with the SANS anhedonia, respectively R=-0.78 (p<0.01) for the anticipatory factor and R=-0.61 (p<0.01) for the total TEPS. There was also a negative correlation between the anticipatory factor and the SANS avolition of R=-0.50 (p<0.05). These correlations were maintained, with partial correlations controlling for depression and chlorpromazine equivalents.\nThe results of this validation show that the French version of the TEPS has psychometric characteristics similar to the original version. These results highlight the discrepancy between results of direct or indirect report of experienced pleasure in patients with schizophrenia. Patients may have difficulties in anticipating the pleasure of future enjoyable activities, but not in experiencing pleasure once in an enjoyable activity. Medication and depression do not seems to modify our results, but this should be better controlled in a longitudinal study. The anticipatory versus consummatory pleasure distinction appears to be useful for the development of new psychosocial interventions, tailored to improve desire in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Major limitations of the study are the small size of patient sample and the under representation of men in the control sample."}, {"Title": "Genetics of anxiety and trauma-related disorders.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in the United States with approximately 30% of the population experiencing anxiety-related symptoms in their lifetime [Kessler RC, Berglund P, Demler O, Jin R, Merikangas KR, Walters EE (2005) Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.

In the present review, we discuss the latest findings regarding the genetic and environmental influences on the development and symptomatology of anxiety disorders. Specific emphasis is placed on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to its uniqueness as an anxiety disorder; its diagnosis is dependent on a precipitating traumatic event and its development appears to be mediated by both genetic and environmental contributions. The co-morbidity of anxiety disorders and the potential re-classification of anxiety disorders as part of DSM-V are reviewed given the potential impact on the interpretation and design of genetic investigations. Lastly, several keys to future genetic studies are highlighted.

To date, most of the data regarding CADRs to psychotropic medications are anecdotal, and systematic studies are lacking, particularly with respect to modern \"second-generation\" drugs.\nData were drawn from a database of 208,401 psychiatric inpatients monitored by the multicenter drug safety surveillance project Drug Safety in Psychiatry (Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie [AMSP]) during the years 1993-2005. The project surveys clinically relevant adverse reactions to all marketed psychotropic drugs.\nTwo hundred fourteen cases of clinically relevant CADRs with a \"probable\" or \"definite\" attribution to a single psychotropic compound were identified (0.1%), of which 7 were life threatening (3.3% of CADR cases). Eruptions occurred irrespective of age and mainly in women. The gender effect was significant only for mood-stabilizing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; P = .001). Substances with the highest and statistically significant CADR risk were AEDs (P < .0001), particularly lamotrigine and carbamazepine. For the most part, the incidence in antidepressants did not differ from the mean CADR rate of the monitored drugs in this survey (0.103%). However, CADRs were seen significantly less often with modern antidepressants (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and dual-mechanism or other second-generation antidepressants) than with classical tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (P = .048). Conventional and atypical antipsychotics alike had the lowest rates of dermatologic side effects.\nAlthough serious complications are rare, clinicians should be aware of CADRs, particularly with AED mood stabilizers. Modern second-generation drugs appear to be associated with a rather low CADR risk."}, {"Title": "A critical appraisal of lithium's efficacy and effectiveness: the last 60 years.", "Abstract": "The history that depicts the evaluation of lithium's efficacy presents an interesting contrast: on the one hand, conviction that, of all psychotropic drugs, lithium has the best demonstrated efficacy; on the other hand, repeated attempts to question it. Those contesting lithium's stabilizing abilities have argued from several angles, for example that the proof was methodologically incorrect or insufficient, that the number of responders is small, or that the response is poor in practice and does not last. But there is a good explanation for this paradox. While the early challenges to lithium's value in recurrent mood disorders reflected mainly that psychiatry had not yet developed a methodology suitable for testing long-term efficacy, more recent questioning has resulted mostly from retesting its efficacy and effectiveness in a substantially broadened bipolar spectrum, outside the classical diagnosis. Lithium, however, continues to stabilize very well the patients suffering from typical bipolar disorder--the condition for which its efficacy was originally demonstrated. More recently, lithium has also proven to dramatically reduce suicidal behavior and mortality and to augment markedly the efficacy of antidepressants in unresponsive patients."}, {"Title": "The history of lithium therapy.", "Abstract": "The use of lithium in psychiatry goes back to the mid-19th century.

In this paper, performance management is introduced and examined within an Irish healthcare context and with reference to its use in other countries. Some of the challenges faced by Irish mental health nurses and the potential benefits of working within a performance managed workplace are discussed. The paper concludes that performance management is likely to increasingly affect nurses, either as active agents or as passive recipients of a change that is thrust on them. The authors anticipate that the performance management 'image problem' will give way to recognition that this is a fundamental change which has the potential to enable health services to change. This change will bring high standards of transparency, worker involvement in decision making, an explicit value base for health services and individual teams. It provides the potential for clear practice standards and high standards of transparency as well as worker welfare in all aspects, including supporting employment and career progression."}, {"Title": "Drawing the line: the cultural cartography of utilization recommendations for mental health problems.", "Abstract": "In the 1990s, sociologists began to rethink the failure of utilization models to explain whether and why individuals accessed formal treatment systems. This effort focused on reconceptualizing the underlying assumptions and processes that shaped utilization patterns. While we have built a better understanding of how social networks structure pathways to care and how disadvantaged sociocultural groups face substantial barriers to treatment, we have less understanding of the larger cultural context in which individuals recognize and respond to symptoms. Drawing from recent innovations in the sociology of culture, we develop the concept of \"cultural mapping\" to describe if and how individuals discriminate among different available sources of formal treatment. Using data from the 1996 Mental Health Module of the General Social Survey, we compare Americans' willingness to recommend providers in the general medical and specialty mental health sectors. The results indicate that, despite unrealistically high levels of endorsement, individuals do discriminate between providers based on their evaluation of the problem, underlying causes, and likely consequences. While perceived severity leads individuals to suggest any type of formal care, problems attributed to biological causes are directed to general or specialty medical providers (doctors, psychiatrists, and hospitals); those matching symptoms for schizophrenia or seen as eliciting violence are allocated to the specialty mental health sector (psychiatry, mental hospital); and those seen as being caused by stress are sent to nonmedical mental health providers (i.e., counselors). These findings help to explain inconsistencies in previous utilization studies, and they suggest the critical importance of maintaining a dialogue between medical sociology and the sociology of culture."}, {"Title": "Completion of risk assessment and monitoring within forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is a clear need for high standards of risk assessment and monitoring within forensic psychiatry.

High-frequency rTMS has predominantly an activating effect on the stimulated brain region while low-frequency rTMS has an inhibitory effect. In addition to its usefulness as a research tool and in neurological diagnostics, rTMS may prove useful as a therapeutic option in psychiatry, especially in disorders that are associated with regional changes in cortical activity. For instance, rTMS is under current investigation in the treatment of depression and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. A hypofrontality or a fronto-limbic imbalance associated with both syndromes could be corrected by activating, high frequency rTMS. Conversely, a regional hyperactivity in the temporo-parietal cortex has been described in subjects suffering from auditory hallucinations and tinnitus. Low frequency, inhibitory rTMS is currently evaluated as a therapeutic option in these subjects. In addition to the effects on the directly stimulated brain area, other biological effects of rTMS may exert a beneficial influence on brain function. Amongst these are a modulation of cortico-cortical circuits (e. g. fronto-cingular and fronto-parietotemporal circuits), effects on monoaminergic neuromodulation and neuroendocrine effects. The current knowledge about the therapeutically relevant neurophysiological and neuroendocrine effects of rTMS are reviewed. An improved understanding of the neurophysiological basis of the therapeutic effects of rTMS and of the pathophysiology underlying neuropsychiatric diseases may lead to optimized therapeutic rTMS applications and new clinical indications for rTMS."}, {"Title": "[Behavior disorders and psychopathology in non-human primates? A proposal].", "Abstract": "When speaking about primates we must distinguish between non-human primates and human primates, as the latter are part of the primate order. Due to their phylogenetic closeness to humans, non-human primates have been of special interest for such disciplines as neurophysiology, biology, genetics and behavior. Research has included a wide range of species and themes, from socioecology to neuroethology, cognition and phenomena such as empathy and theory of mind. In this article, we aim to demonstrate the occurrence of psychopathology, mental disorders and psychopathy in non-human primates and to propose the alternative use of the concept of condition, which refers to how the individual interacts and adapts to the environment. We discuss the fact that human behavioral disorders can also be found in non-human primates. From the perspective of evolutionary psychiatry and developmental psychology, behavior, psychopathology and psychopathy in general are conditions derived from the interaction of biological, psychological and sociological variables, and that reflect strategies with which individuals and groups of individuals contend with the environmental demands in order to survive."}, {"Title": "[Validity of the Child Psychiatric Hospital Teacher Questionnaire for the assessment of ADHD.

The Child Psychiatric Hospital Teacher Questionnaire (CPHTQ) of the Hospital Psiqui\u00e1trico Infantil Dr. Juan N. Navarro was designed for the assessment of ADHD symptoms, externalizing symptoms and school functioning difficulties of children and adolescents.\nInternal consistency, criterion validity, construct validity and sensitivity of the scale to changes in symptom severity were evaluated in this study.\nThe scale was administered to 282 teachers of children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years who came to a unit specialized in child psychiatry. The validity analysis of the instrument showed that the internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha was 0.94. The factorial analysis yielded 5 factors accounting for 59.1% of the variance: hyperactivity and conduct symptoms, predatory, conduct disorder, inattentive, poor functioning and motor disturbances. The CPHTQ scores on the scale showed positive correlation with the Clinical Global impression (CGI) scale in the patients' response to drug treatment.\nThe CPHTQ shows adequate validity characteristics that demonstrate its utility in the evaluation of patients with ADHD and its comorbidity with other behavior disorders."}, {"Title": "[Off-label use in child and adolescent psychiatry. An ongoing ethical, medical and legal problem].", "Abstract": "Off-label use is an ongoing problem in child and adolescent psychiatry. Except methylphenidate and atomoxetine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most substances used to treat children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders are prescribed off-label. In additional to aspects of drug safety and efficacy the widespread off-label use raises issues of liability in the case of adverse events. In Germany off-label use also poses problems of reimbursement by the health insurance. In the future we expect, driven by written request of the FDA, numerous new indications for novel antipsychotics in the USA for the treatment of so-called childhood bipolar disorders. Given another diagnostic framework in context in Europe, these so-called bipolar disorders in children are very rarely diagnosed. Anyhow, antipsychotics are widely used in the USA and in Europe to treat impulsivity or aggressiveness in children and adolescents. There is still a lack of European labelling of novel antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. In clinical practice given the risk of liability and other forensic issues in the treatment of schizophrenic patients, this is still one of the major hindrances in the treatment of young schizophrenic patients in Europe. Whereas these drugs may urgently be needed for treatment of psychotic disorders and of impulsivity or aggressiveness, the indication of bipolar as used in the USA leads to a misconception and does not increase availability of licensed modern antipsychotics for minors."}, {"Title": "Review of the 6th symposium for the search for the causes of schizophrenia, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 3-6 February 2009.", "Abstract": "In this review, we present the main findings of the 6th Symposium for the Search for the Causes of Schizophrenia, which took place between 3 and 6 February 2009, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In a few short years, the landscape of the causes of schizophrenia has changed dramatically. The flat and featureless epidemiological horizon has developed undulating contours, which promise new avenues for research, particularly if we are able to integrate such findings with tantalising new findings from genetics as novel methods for identifying genuine sites of genetic risk emerge. The Search highlighted and fostered the emerging acknowledgement that we will need to integrate knowledge across traditionally disparate disciplines in psychiatry in order to develop complex, testable hypotheses in the search for the causes of schizophrenia. Such challenges are beginning to be addressed. From epidemiology, gene-environment studies are becoming more sophisticated, while neuroscience is increasingly concerned about social organisation and how social factors impinge upon biological pathways to potentially lead to psychosis. Tantalising new insights from genome-wide association studies offer new clues about rare genetic mutations, which have large effect sizes for schizophrenia, including copy number variants and de novo mutations. It is only through forums such as the 6th Symposium for the Search for the Causes of Schizophrenia that the seeds of integrated collaborations across disciplines can be sown to address the complex polyfactorial basis of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Participation of French hospital physicians to continuing medical education events: a survey with 300 physicians to assess duration, methods, financing, and needs.", "Abstract": "Little data on the educational needs and practices of French hospital physicians have been obtained through surveys. Given that continuing medical education (CME) information is now available on http://www.cnfmc.fr and providers are accredited, we investigated CME practices and knowledge of the CME system with the use of a representative sample of hospital physicians.\nA questionnaire was prepared during 2 work sessions organized by TNS Healthcare Sofres in July 2007. A sample of 300 physicians was selected to represent hospital physicians throughout 5 main regions and hospital types. Telephone numbers were dialed automatically in order to meet quota objectives. Questionnaires were administered by telephone between August 30 and September 7, 2007 by trained operators.\nAmong the 300 interviewed physicians, 218 (73%) were from general or specialized hospitals and 82 (27%) were from university hospitals. They were located equally all over France. Their specialties were: medicine, 130 (43%); laboratory, 51 (17%); pharmacy, 45 (15%); surgery, 15 (5%); psychiatry, 9 (3%); and others, 49 (17%), including emergency and radiology. One hundred twenty-five of the physicians (42%) stated that they took part in continuing education programs for more than 10 days per year, 122 (41%) between 6 and 10 days per year, and 51 (17%) less than 5 days; 2 (<1%) did not answer. Two hundred fourteen of the physicians subscribed to either specialized or general medical journals; 86 (29%) did not subscribe to any journal. For live in-class events, approximately 65% of the educational, travel, and lodging expenses were paid for by physicians and hospitals. The pharmaceutical industry paid for 25% of these expenses. In response to the question \"Did you participate in a performance improvement program in your hospital?\", 75 (25%) said that they had (16% for the 82 physicians in university hospitals, and 29% for the 211 physicians in general hospitals), 210 (70%) said that they had not, including the 134 (45% of the 300) who said that it was scheduled, and 15 (5%) did not answer. Seminars were preferred for continuing education programs, and interactive workshops and e-learning methods were requested for the future. Among the 300 physicians, 246 (82%) expressed difficulties following up on CME events, and 54 (18%) had no difficulty with their education.\nThis telephone survey of 300 hospital physicians showed that although they took part in many educational programs, they had organizational, personal, and financial issues.

However, only in recent years, their topicality with respect to the construct validity of the concept of the schizophrenia spectrum has been explicitly acknowledged, mainly as a consequence of the increasing focus on early detection and prevention of psychosis. The current study tested the hypothesis of a specific aggregation of self-disorders (SDs, various anomalies of self-awareness) in schizophrenia-spectrum conditions, comparing different diagnostic groups; 305 subjects, previously assessed in the Copenhagen Schizophrenia Linkage Study, were grouped into 4 experimental samples, according to their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) main diagnosis: schizophrenia, (n = 29), schizotypal personality disorder (n = 61), other mental illness not belonging to the schizophrenia spectrum (n = 112), and no mental illness (n = 103). The effect of diagnostic grouping on the level of SDs was explored via general linear model and logistic regression. The diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizotypy predicted higher levels of SDs, and SDs scores were significantly different between spectrum and nonspectrum samples; the likelihood of experiencing SDs increased as well with the diagnostic severity. The findings support the assumption that SDs are a discriminant psychopathological feature of the schizophrenia spectrum and suggest their incorporation to strengthen its construct validity, with potential benefit for both early detection and pathogenetic research."}, {"Title": "Negotiating 'depression' in primary care: a qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry has provided primary care physicians with tools for recognising and labelling mild, moderate or severe 'depression'. General practitioners (GPs) in the UK have been guided to manage depression within primary care and to prescribe anti-depressants as a first-line treatment. The present study aimed to examine how GPs would construct 'depression' when asked to talk about those anomalous patients for whom the medical frontline treatment did not appear to be effective. Twenty purposively selected GPs were asked in an interview to talk about their experience and management of patients with depression who did not respond to anti-depressants. GPs initially struggled to identify a group, but then began to construct a category of person with a pre-medicalised status characterised by various deviant features such as unpleasant characters and personalities, manipulative tendencies, people with entrenched social problems unable to fit in with other people and relate to people normally. GPs also responded in non-medical ways including feeling unsympathetic, breaking confidentiality and prescribing social interventions. In effect, in the absence of an effective medical treatment, depression appeared to become demedicalised. The implications of this process are discussed in relation to patients' subsequent access or lack of access to services and the way in which these findings highlight the processes by which medicine frames disease."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in psychiatry: evaluating the ethical consequences for patient care.", "Abstract": "According to many researchers, it is inevitable and obvious that psychiatric illnesses are biological in nature, and that this is the rationale behind the numerous neuroimaging studies of individuals diagnosed with mental disorders. Scholars looking at the history of psychiatry have pointed out that in the past, the origins and motivations behind the search for biological causes, correlates, and cures for mental disorders are thoroughly social and historically rooted, particularly when the diagnostic category in question is the subject of controversy within psychiatry. This is obscured by neuroimaging studies that drive researchers to proclaim 'revolutions' in psychiatry, namely in the DSM. Providing neuroimaging evidence to support the contention that a condition is 'real' is likely to be extremely influential, as has been extensively discussed in the neuroethics literature. This type of evidence will also reinforce the pre-existing beliefs of those researchers or clinicians who are already expecting a biological description. The uncritical credence given to neuroimaging research is an ethical issue, not in its potential for contributing to misdiagnosis per se but because of the motivations that often drive this research. My claim is that this research should proceed with an awareness of presumptions and motivations underlying the field as a whole, in addition to an explicit focus on the past and potential future consequences of classification and diagnosis on the groups of individuals under study."}, {"Title": "The contribution of epidemiology to defining the most appropriate approach to genetic research on schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Psychosis is thought to have a strong genetic component, but many efforts to discover the underlying putative schizophrenia genes have yielded disappointing results. In fact, no strong associations emerged in the first genome-wide association studies in psychiatry and weakly observed associations were not related to the candidate genes identified in previous studies. These partially successful findings may be explained by the fact that genetic research in psychiatry suffers from confounding issues related to phenotype definition, the considerable degree of phenotypic variability and diagnostic uncertainty, absence of specific neuropathological features and environmental influences. To make progress it is first necessary to deconstruct psychosis based on symptomatology, and then to correlate particular phenotypes with genetic variants. Moreover, it is time to conduct studies that define persistent aspects of the schizophrenic profile that are more likely to represent an underlying biological pathogenesis, as opposed to fluctuating symptoms that are possibly environmentally mediated. In fact, progress in understanding the etiology of schizophrenia will depend upon the availability of good measures of genetic liability as well as relevant environmental exposures during critical periods of an individual's life. If environmental and/or genetic factors are not precisely measured, it is impossible to study their independent effects or interactions."}, {"Title": "Mental health services for people with intellectual disability in residential care in Israel.

The hypothesis of the present study was that the perceptual restoration of speech would also be reduced with similar envelope discontinuities that may occur in real life due to the release time constants of hearing-aid compression. In an effort to make the conditions more relevant to hearing aids, speech was amplitude-compressed and normal-hearing listeners of varying ages were recruited. Envelope amplitude ramps were placed at the onsets/offsets of speech segments of interrupted sentences and the restoration effect was measured in two ways: objectively as the improvement in intelligibility when noise was added in the gaps and subjectively through the perceived continuity measured by subjects' own reporting. Both measures showed a reduction as the ramp duration increased--a trend observed for subjects of all ages and for all ramp configurations. These findings can be attributed to envelope discontinuities, with an additional contribution from reduced speech information due to ramping and temporal masking from loud noise bursts."}, {"Title": "Public sector mental health systems in South Africa: inter-provincial comparisons and policy implications.", "Abstract": "There is growing recognition that mental health is an important public health issue in South Africa.

Main Outcome Measure Improvement of cognitive functions.\nTurning on the subthalamic nucleus electrodes improved motor symptoms but left cognitive performance almost unchanged. Turning on electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert resulted in markedly improved cognitive functions. The improvement in attention, concentration, alertness, drive, and spontaneity resulted in the patient's renewed enjoyment of former interests and enhanced social communication.\nSuch a broad effect on cognition is consistent with ample experimental evidence revealing that the nucleus basalis of Meynert provides cholinergic innervation to the cortical mantle, complemented by glutaminergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid-transmitting projections from the basal forebrain. These projections provide background tuning facilitating cortical operations. Furthermore, nucleus basalis of Meynert stimulation paired with sensory stimuli can accomplish persistent reorganization of specific processing modules. The improvements in cognitive and behavioral performance in our patient are likely to be related to the effects of stimulating residual cholinergic projections and cell bodies in the nucleus basalis of Meynert."}, {"Title": "[The patient's satisfaction in relation with the treatment in hospital psychiatry: a comparison between Italy and Germany].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to compare psychiatric patients' satisfaction with their treatment in Munich and in South Tirol. For this purpose, besides clinical and social-demographic factors, for each sample-group of patients, their general satisfaction, their valuation of the different aspects of hospital treatment and life quality were considered and compared. The relevance of these elements in the global satisfaction was examined with linear multiple regression models. The results of the research show a rather high level of global satisfaction in both sample-groups, even if statistically relevant differences occur in evaluations of several aspects of the treatment. In Munich's sample-group a higher rate of satisfaction emerged in relation with the treatment: the attitude of the medical staff, the psycho-pharmacological treatments, the clinic's image and the conduct of the nursing staff. In both groups the most relevant factor for patients' satisfaction, besides the positive results of the treatment, was the attitude of the doctor, and in particular way his empathy with the patient. In regard to the age, the diagnosis and the duration of the hospitalization, it was not possible to demonstrate, in both sample-groups, any statistically relevant connection with the general satisfaction rate, while a high rate of trust in the doctors and in the medicines was found to be, in each group, a significant condition for a positive evaluation of the treatment.

The relevant psychiatric assessment criteria are identical with those of mental and volitional competence in general. However, a different profile of patients and other disorders are involved, mainly depressive syndromes, but also chronic alcoholism as well as schizophrenic and paranoid syndromes. The assessment has to be based on the legal concept of mental disorder, which is different from the current diagnostic classifications in psychiatry.

Each psychiatric diagnosis was based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn, Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Traumatic dental injuries were recorded using the classification of the World Health Organization, which was slightly modified by Andreasen and Andreasen (Textbook and color atlas of traumatic injuries, 3rd edn. Copenhagen, Denmark: Munksgaard; 1994. p. 151). Thirty-two percent (78/247) of the ADHD children presented 103 traumatized teeth. The frequency of dental injuries peaked in children who were 10-12 years of age, and showed no significant difference between subtypes of ADHD or gender. The maxillary central incisors were the most vulnerable to injury, and there were no differences between the right and the left sides in terms of susceptibility. Uncomplicated crown fracture (52.4%) and complicated crown fracture (16.6%) were the most commonly encountered types of injury. The main causes of dental injury were falls, collisions with objects, violence, and traffic accidents, and there was no difference in the frequencies of these causes between subtypes of ADHD, age, or gender. Only 5.1% (4/78) of the ADHD children sought treatment within the first 24 h of the injury. In conclusion, children with ADHD experience dental injuries more frequently than was previously described."}, {"Title": "[Psychopharmacological treatments in childhood and adolescence].", "Abstract": "Compared to adults, the use of psychopharmacological substances in childhood and adolescence is significantly more controversial. Often sensation-seeking media reports on the negative effects of psychopharmacological treatments of children and adolescents intensify this controversy on a regular basis. In addition, even pharmacologically trained experts--though frequently without expertise in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry--question the seriousness and thus the demands for treatment of psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence. Considering this background evidence based treatment decisions in pediatric psychopharmacology are of utmost importance. Effective psychopharmacotherapy needs to be distinguished from ineffective treatments. The pros and cons of such evidence based treatment approaches ought to be weighted out carefully together with the patients and their families. The aim of this article is to provide a rational and concise foundation for the use of psychopharmacotherapy for clinicians treating children and adolescents as well as to point out the currently best evidence for psychopharmacological treatments of selected disorders in child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The CHAT project: paediatricians and mental health clinicians: working together for the sake of the children.", "Abstract": "The Shared Care model, originally developed to address the paucity of adult mental health resources, has potential applicability to the design and delivery of mental health services for children and youth. With a similar prevalence of mental illness and more difficulty accessing mental health care than adults, Canadian children and youth have been even less well served than their parents. As there is a significant overlap in the types of health concerns for which children and youth are seen by mental health clinicians and paediatricians, building improved collaboration between these groups is an obvious, though under-utilized, method of enhancing mental health care for this population. The CHAT project was a one year collaboration involving three different types of collaborative activities between mental health clinicians and paediatricians.\nOut-patient mental health clinicians and community paediatricians were surveyed about their educational needs and interests. A community paediatrician joined an outpatient mental health care team, continuing professional educational activities were provided by each group for the other and were evaluated.\nThe paediatrician's participation was evaluated positively by team members. Eighty-three percent of mental health clinicians (n=10) rated the educational sessions positively and 77.8% (n=7) noted increased knowledge. Paediatricians expressed strong interest in having more mental health-related educational activities.\nThis small project provided opportunities for useful exchanges between mental health clinicians and community paediatricians and preliminary evidence that shared care initiatives for children and youth should be further researched."}, {"Title": "When is pharmacogenetic testing for antidepressant response ready for the clinic? A cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from the STAR*D study.", "Abstract": "The potential of personalized medicine to transform the treatment of mood disorders has been widely touted in psychiatry, but has not been quantified. We estimated the costs and benefits of a putative pharmacogenetic test for antidepressant response in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) from the societal perspective. Specifically, we performed cost-effectiveness analyses using state-transition probability models incorporating probabilities from the multicenter STAR*D effectiveness study of MDD. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared for sequential antidepressant trials, with or without guidance from a pharmacogenetic test for differential response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Likely SSRI responders received an SSRI, whereas likely nonresponders received the norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion. For a 40-year old with MDD, applying the pharmacogenetic test and using the non-SSRI bupropion for those at higher risk for nonresponse cost $93,520 per additional QALY compared with treating all patients with an SSRI first and switching sequentially in the case of nonremission. Cost per QALY dropped below $50,000 for tests with remission rate ratios as low as 1.5, corresponding to odds ratios approximately 1.8-2.0. Tests for differential antidepressant response could thus become cost effective under certain circumstances. These circumstances, particularly availability of alternative treatment strategies and test effect sizes, can be estimated and should be considered before these tests are broadly applied in clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Non-psychiatric hospitalization of people with mental illness: systematic review.", "Abstract": "This paper is a report of a literature review of the evidence regarding outcomes experienced by severely mentally ill individuals hospitalized in general medical-surgical settings for non-psychiatric conditions.\nSeverely mentally ill individuals experience chronic medical illnesses at a rate greater than the general population. When hospitalized in non-psychiatric settings, they tend to be experienced as 'difficult' by nurses and to have longer lengths of stay.\nThe CINAHL and PUBMED databases were searched from 1 to 9 March 2008 to identify studies published between 1998 and 2008 investigating outcomes among people with mental illness hospitalized for non-psychiatric illness in general hospitals.\nIncluded studies were those published in English in peer reviewed journals and investigating patient outcomes. The studies were reviewed for relevance and inclusion criteria; the methodological quality of studies was not evaluated.\nTwelve studies met inclusion criteria. All studies examining length of stay, costs of care or resource utilization showed increased measures for patients with psychiatric comorbidity. Interventions described included psychiatric liaison psychiatry and nursing, which failed to demonstrate improvement in outcomes.\nNurses play a pivotal role in improving the inpatient care of this vulnerable population, but they struggle in their attempts to do so. Research to determine the best approaches to promote nurses' knowledge, positive attitudes and self-confidence in caring for patients with psychiatric comorbidity is needed.

We review the extent and correlates of dropping out of mental health treatment for individuals with schizophrenia and suggest strategies for facilitating treatment engagement. Although rates vary across studies, reviews of the literature suggest that up to one-third of individuals with serious mental illnesses who have had some contact with the mental health service system disengage from care. Younger age, male gender, ethnic minority background, and low social functioning have been consistently associated with disengagement from mental health treatment. Individuals with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, as well as those with early-onset psychosis, are at particularly high risk of treatment dropout. Engagement strategies should specifically target these high-risk groups, as well as high-risk periods, including following an emergency room or hospital admission and the initial period of treatment. Interventions to enhance engagement in mental health treatment range from low-intensity interventions, such as appointment reminders, to high-intensity interventions, such as assertive community treatment. Disengagement from treatment may reflect the consumer's perspective that treatment is not necessary, is not meeting their needs, or is not being provided in a collaborative manner. An emerging literature on patient-centered care and shared decision making in psychiatry provides suggestive evidence that efforts to enhance client-centered communication and promote individuals' active involvement in mental health treatment decisions can also improve engagement in treatment."}, {"Title": "Clinical coaching in forensic psychiatry: an innovative program to recruit and retain nurses.", "Abstract": "Ontario is currently experiencing a nursing shortage crisis.

Only few studies, however, compared both clinical disease entities directly and no larger study has tried to take different disease stages into account. The objectives of this study are to investigate whether hippocampal volumes are reduced in patients with schizophrenia and those with major depression with the same duration of illness compared to healthy controls and to assess further changes at different disease stages. A total of 319 inpatients and healthy controls were enrolled and investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hippocampal volumes were measured using the segmentation software BRAINS. Bilateral hippocampal volume reductions were detected in both schizophrenic and depressed patients compared to healthy control (HC) subjects. Although younger, schizophrenic (SZ) patients showed in their MRI scans significant bilaterally reduced hippocampal volumes compared to patients with major depression. Although the hippocampal reductions were similar at the onset of symptomatic manifestation of both diseases, there was a further significant reduction of the left hippocampus in the recurrently ill SZ subgroup. The data suggest rather dynamic structural brain alterations in schizophrenia compared to major depression. Here, the presented application of the comparative neuroscience approach, by the use of large neuroimaging MRI databases, seems highly valuable. In the field of psychiatry, with its still controversial operationalized descriptive diagnostic entities, the cross-nosological approach provides a helpful tool to better elucidate the still unknown brain pathologies and their underlying molecular mechanisms beyond a single nosological entity."}, {"Title": "Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection and characteristics of seropositive patients in general hospitals in Daejeon, Korea.", "Abstract": "To figure out the epidemiological status and relevance with other diseases in toxoplasmosis, we checked serum IgG antibody titers of 1,265 patients and medical records of seropositive patients. Seropositive rates were 6.6% by latex agglutination test (LAT) and 6.7% by ELISA. No significant differences were detected between sexes and age groups. The peak seroprevalence was detected in the 40-49-year-old age group. According to clinical department, Toxoplasma-positive rates were high in patients in psychiatry, ophthalmology, health management, emergency medicine, and thoracic surgery. Major coincidental diseases in seropositive cases were malignant neoplasms, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, chronic hepatitis B, chronic renal diseases, schizophrenia, and acute lymphadenitis, in the order of frequency. In particular, some patients with chronic hepatitis B and malignant neoplasms had high antibody titers. These results revealed that the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in a general hospital-based study was similar to that in a community-based study, and T. gondii seropositivity may be associated with neoplasms, diabetes, and other chronic infections."}, {"Title": "Familiality of novel factorial dimensions of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Factor analysis of the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia yields dimensional phenotypes that may relate to underlying genetic variation. Examination of familiality of factor scores can demonstrate whether they are likely to be of use in genetic research.\nTo produce a broader set of factorial phenotypes that are tested for familiality including core symptoms of schizophrenia and additional indicators of social, work, and educational dysfunction.\nThe study used psychiatric assessment data collected from several large samples of individuals with schizophrenia who have participated in family or case-control genetic studies (1988-2006) in the Epidemiology-Genetics Program in Psychiatry, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland. Seventy-three signs and symptoms were selected from direct assessment interviews and consensus diagnostic ratings (integrating interview data, medical records, and informant reports).\nStudy participants were recruited from across the United States, and a few additional participants were recruited from Canada, Greece, Italy, Poland, and Israel. Assessments generally were performed in the individuals' homes.\nForty-three percent of 1199 volunteers had largely white European backgrounds.

Although at first glance these issues may seem somewhat peripheral to the clinical practice of psychiatry, we suggest that they may have unanticipated effects upon the care of patients with mental illness. Certainly, the philosophical issues surrounding free will are of tremendous consequence to persons who commit crimes while suffering severe symptoms of mental illness. In addition, the opening up of a lucrative new \"enhancement\" market for the sale of new therapies could divert commercial resources away from the development of therapies for mental illness, although it is also possible that some enhancements will have secondary benefits as treatments for disease. Social acceptance of enhancement therapies could have a beneficial, normalizing effect on public attitudes toward those who receive mental health treatment. On the other hand, a moral backlash against enhancements as \"quick fixes\" that deprive individuals of authenticity could have a secondary effect of increasing the stigma of mental health treatment. For all of these reasons, it has become increasingly important for psychiatrists to be informed about and active participants in the public conversation about neuroethics. Psychiatric patients appear to have much at stake in these ethical debates, and psychiatrists have valuable expertise to offer as professionals with intimate knowledge of the human mind, its limitations, and its potential."}, {"Title": "The revolution in forensic ethics: narrative, compassion, and a robust professionalism.", "Abstract": "For 5 decades modern forensic psychiatry has struggled with the seminal question of which master it serves: is it a field that answers chiefly to the law or to psychiatry?

In reviewing the historical narrative of modern forensic ethics, this article explores whether the field has developed to the point that it is insufficient to apply legal or medical ethics alone.

As has been noted for some time, unless proactive work is done to identify, clarify, and remediate ethical challenges (see Table 2 for research directions), deleterious effects on research can result, including research bans, unduly overprotective stances, or inaccurate weighing of risks and benefits of research by review boards. With regard to proxy consent, a number of issues require further study. These include: how state laws address (or fail to address) research involving cognitively impaired individuals and what effects this has on research conduct; how IRBs define and weigh risks and benefits in considering research involving proxy consent; how various stakeholders, including the general public, people with disorders that may impair decision-making capacity, and proxies themselves view proxy consent for research; and to what degree proxies' research decisions reflect what patients themselves would decide. The use of advanced directives as a stand alone method for future consent is fraught with difficulties around adequate informed consent for a particular study; however, future study may clarify if such directives provide surrogates with improved understanding of their relative's overall views of the research enterprise and possibly the types of studies they would be willing to participate in even if they are no longer able to provide their own consent.

Unfortunately, most psychiatrists have no more training in ethics than their nonpsychiatric colleagues. Psychiatric consults spurred by ethical dilemmas can provoke anxiety in psychiatrists and leave anxious colleagues without the clear recommendations they seek. C-L psychiatrists, and probably all psychiatrists, need more training in clinical ethics. C-L psychiatrists do not need to become clinical ethicists, but competence in handling the ethical issues most commonly seen in C-L work is needed. The 2008 ABPN guidelines for specialists in psychosomatic medicine mention specific ethics topics important in C-L work, and ways of attaining competence in these areas have been discussed in the C-L literature. The four cases discussed here illustrate the high level of complexity often seen in situations in which ethical dilemmas arise in C-L psychiatry. Given the sometimes furious pace of hospital work, it can be easy for C-L psychiatrists to be seduced by the idea of the quick, focused consult that simply responds to a simple question with a simple answer. Because cases involving ethical dilemmas often involve multiple stakeholders, each with his or her own set of concerns, a brief consult focused only on the patient often leads to errors of omission. A wider approach, such as that suggested by the Four Topics Method, is needed to successfully negotiate ethical dilemmas. Busy C-L psychiatry services may struggle at first to find the time to do the type of global evaluations discussed here, but increasing familiarity with approaches such as the Four Topics Method should lead to quicker ways of gathering and processing the needed information."}, {"Title": "Ethical considerations in military psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Military psychiatrists are faced with multiple, difficult questions that shape the context for ethical patient care.

In 3 cases the procedure was complicated by stroke: in 2 patients directly after the procedure and in 1 patient 45 days after embolization. 1 patient died due to a recurrent stroke over 1 year after the procedure. Technical failure was noted in 1 patient (stent misplacement from target vessel - the middle cerebral artery to the internal carotid artery, and therefore it did not cover the neck of the aneurysm).\nVascular remodelling with intracranial stents in treating wide-neck intracranial aneurysms is a promising method allowing the indications for endovascular embolization to be increased.

People with mental health problems are very vulnerable. However those with mental health problems who have additional social problems are even more vulnerable. Currently psychiatric services in Ireland are provided on a 'catchment area' basis, with a consultant psychiatrist leading a multi-disciplinary team providing a service to the population of a defined geographical area. These services comprise both outpatient and inpatient care, and there is significant regional variation in terms of both bed availability and multidisciplinary team staffing. Sub-specialities, with the exception of child psychiatry and psychiatry of old age, are often unavailable, particularly outside Dublin. In such cases, some additional duties (eg. liaison, rehabilitation, perinatal) are assumed by the local general adult services. However, the overall distribution of services is uneven. Instead of services being concentrated upon those areas of greatest need, the opposite is often the case, with the most deprived areas having the least services in terms of acute beds and community mental health teams per thousand people. These areas also have less psychological services and specialist services despite increased levels of mental illness. Within this vulnerable population there are a number of sub-groups who are even further marginalised, and for whom there are significant barriers both at point of contact with services and with accessing appropriate follow up services. These include the homeless, the ever-increasing cohort of migrants to this country, those in prison and children and adolescents.

Furthermore, recent theories proposed that psychopathology may result from the failure to integrate the activity of different areas involved in cognitive processes, rather than from the impairment of one or more brain areas (2)); within this view, a reliable brain imaging tool should be able to explore the dynamics of complex interactions among brain regions, with high sensitivity to the subtle deviation in complex processes that last fractions of seconds; psychophysiological techniques, indeed, offer the possibility to explore the functional correlates of major psychiatric illnesses, as well as to understand of the effects of psychotropic drugs on the central nervous system, with incomparable time resolution. Finally, the recent technical possibility to combine different brain imaging approaches has further fostered a renovated enthusiasm to ward the use of EEG-based techniques in psychiatry. This contribution will provide an historical overview of the EEG-based brain imaging techniques and an update on some recent advances concerning the use of such techniques within the psychiatric field. Finally, some examples of psychophysiological and ''multimodal'' imaging investigations in subjects with different psychiatric conditions will be provided."}, {"Title": "Special gender issues in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Significant gender differences exist in the course, manifestation and treatment of mental illness. Regardless of specific diagnosis age is one of the key factors in gender differences. Such differences between the sexes exist not only concerning origin and perpetuation of specific psychiatric diseases, they are also available and notable in specific fields of pharmacological and psychotherapeutically treatment. That review should sensitize clinicians for their responsibility to provide individualized, optimally effective, gender-specific care to patients suffering from mental diseases in some special topics.

Especially his theory of resentment with its core thesis unconscious prejudices were influencing our behaviour was able to illuminate the complex structure of human will. Taking into account this horizon of psychiatric history of ideas the presentation wants to persecute the following three questions: 1) Why the postulate which Nietzsche was giving on cultural prejudices of our thoughts, feelings and acts was so provocative so that many of the classical thinkers of psychological understanding were taking it up according to the needs of their disciplines sociology, psychology, psychiatry and philosophy? 2) What were the results of this inspiring theory which could be especially seen in the works of Karl Jaspers and Kurt Schneider? In other words: What were the aspects in which they agreed in their reception of Nietzsche and what were the points in which the two psychiatrists of the school of Heidelberg differed in the way they took the theory of resentment into account for their psychological understanding? 3) What could be the actual significance of the historical fact that Nietzsche and in his footsteps Max Weber were taking deep influence on psychiatric thinking around 1900?"}, {"Title": "Use pattern and off-label use of atypical antipsychotics in bipolar disorder, 1998-2002.", "Abstract": "Postmarketing surveillance that identifies patients at high risk for receiving off-label medications will help ensure that the benefits of such treatment outweigh the risks. Because many off-label uses have little scientific support, tracking the extent to which they occur as well as the particular circumstances under which they occur is important.\nTo describe the drug-use pattern for patients with bipolar disorder, and to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with off-label use of atypical antipsychotics before US Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication.\nUsing the PHARMetrics medical claims database, a total of 105,771 adult patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were evaluated during the 5-year (1998-2002) study period. Study drugs included mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. Off-label use of an atypical antipsychotic was defined as a patient taking olanzapine before March 2000 (when it received an indication for bipolar disorder) or any other atypical antipsychotic during the entire study period. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio of receiving a drug off-label.\nUtilization of and reimbursement for atypical antipsychotics increased during the 5-year period. Of the 10.5% of patients who took atypical antipsychotics, 7.1% took these drugs off-label. In addition, 11% of patients received lithium, 25% received other anticonvulsants, and 34% received antidepressants. Off-label use of atypical antipsychotics was associated with psychiatry specialist prescribers (odds ratio = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.44-1.59) and certain comorbidities, such as substance abuse (odds ratio = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38-1.66), anxiety disorder (odds ratio = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37), cerebral vascular disease (odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.45), and hypertension (odds ratio = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20). Over time, there has been an increase in the number of drug therapies, including atypical antipsychotics, used to treat bipolar disorder.\nBecause of the significant association found between atypical antipsychotic use and several key comorbidities, it is important for physicians to recognize these associations and weigh the risks and benefits of atypical antipsychotics in their treatment strategies."}, {"Title": "Psychological implications in ENT diseases.", "Abstract": "We are sometimes faced with psychic derangement or overlay in some of the ENT diseases and the link between patient's psyche and any ENT disease at times becomes signifi cant and troublesome.

Similarities between Peale's problem-solving techniques and Milton E. Erickson's psychotherapeutic methods are demonstrated, and Blanton's indebtedness to psychoanalytic theories and methods is also shown. The Peale-Blanton collaboration suggests that pastoral counselors may legitimately employ these very different therapeutic approaches depending on the needs of the individual counselee. On the other hand, the fact that they subscribed to very different therapeutic approaches raises the question as to whether the two men shared anything in common as far as their professional work with individuals was concerned.

Psychiatric diagnoses including SDs and clinical variables were collected. Those with SDs were followed-up 1 year later, and structured interviews were applied.\nPatients with MUS had a high level of psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression (35.6%) and anxiety disorder (29.7%), rather than SDs (9.9%). Most diagnosed with SDs suffered from persistent MUS at the 1-year follow-up. Pain was the most common presentation of MUS. Most of the subjects diagnosed with SDs were female and younger, with multiple painful sites at presentation, no past psychiatric diagnosis and no comorbid organic diagnoses. The diagnosis of SDs was seldom given in those with simultaneous MUS and mood symptoms.\nA significant proportion (9.5%) of patients in psychiatric consultation suffered from MUS, and most were comorbid with depression and anxiety.

The purpose of this study was to develop and empirically validate an appropriate path model for the QOL of patients suffering from major depression. We recruited a total of 237 patients suffering from depression from the outpatient psychiatry department of a university-affiliated hospital in northern Taiwan. The sample was predominantly female (74.3%), had at least a high school level of education (79.7%), had a mean age of 46.95 years, and were living with their families (87.3%). Path analysis was used to identify the 'best fit' model for the QOL of the patients in four domains: physical, psychological, social and environmental. The key determinant for all QOL domains is found to be the intensity of the depressive symptoms, with social support also affecting QOL both directly and indirectly, whilst stigma is found to have an indirect effect on QOL mediated by the intensity of the depressive symptoms, mastery and social support. We conclude that more effective improvements in all aspects of QOL for patients suffering from depression could be achieved by the provision of comprehensive intervention programs aimed at reducing stigma, as well as placing greater emphasis on a reduction in the patients' depressive symptoms, and enhancements to their social support and mastery."}, {"Title": "Urinary ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) assessment: valuable tools to improve verification of abstention in alcohol-dependent patients during in-patient treatment and at follow-ups.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were (i) to assess the effect of additional urinary ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS) assessment on diagnosed relapse rates in detoxified alcohol-dependent patients; and (ii) to compare dropout rates between EtG- and EtS-negative and -positive patients.\nTwo studies on detoxified alcohol-dependent patients.

Nevertheless, assessing functional remission in schizophrenia is problematic, as it is a multifactorial and complex entity reflecting various aspects such as symptoms severity, personal skills and socio-cultural expectancies. The purpose of this study was to create and validate a novel scale for the evaluation of functional remission in schizophrenia. Unlike previous scales, the scale was built on the basis of patients with few schizophrenia symptoms. The \"Functional Remission of General Schizophrenia\" (FROGS) scale was developed using the expert consensus method following a MEDLINE and standard database search. Out of the 61 initially proposed, 19 items were selected as gathering the core aspects of functional remission in schizophrenia detected in the literature. The FROGS was then evaluated in 432 patients with DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia, all of them meeting the symptomatic remission criteria of Andreasen et al.

Their clinical hallmarks affecting judgment, insight, impulsivity, motivations, and regulation of emotions, as well as their frequently chaotic lives (internal and external), inaccurate perceptions, rationalizations, and comorbid syndromes can have a marked effect on many civil, criminal, and institutional (eg, corrections) issues. Individuals with BPD are overrepresented in civil, criminal, and child custody forensic situations. The character psychopathology of these individuals is substantial, but is often not obvious to laypersons, including lawyers, judges, and jurors. The presence of BPD rarely affects basic responsibility for the person's actions, nor does it usually compromise most forms of competency. Function, not diagnosis, is the key arbiter of forensic relevance. BPD is associated with an increase in the likelihood of doctor-patient problems, including patient complaints and lawsuits that may not be deserved. Forensic professionals evaluating persons with BPD and related traits should be aware of personal and professional bias, particularly that associated with true countertransference."}, {"Title": "Science fiction or reality?", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is a topic that has long fascinated the film industry.

Quetiapine facilitates oligodendrocyte development and prevents mice from myelin breakdown and behavioral changes. Mol Psychiatry 2008;13:697-708]. The present study asked if the timing of demyelination (i.e., juvenile period or adulthood) influenced abnormal behavior.\nB57BL/6 mice were fed with 0.2% cuprizone either from postnatal day 29 (P29) to P56 (early demyelination group) or from P57 to P84 (late demyelination group), and then returned to normal mouse chow until P126, when the behavioral analysis was initiated.\nIn both groups, the intake of cuprizone for 28 days produced massive demyelination in the corpus callosum by the end of the treatment period, and subsequent normal feeding restored myelination by P126. In a Y-maze test, the spatial working memory was impaired in both groups right after the cuprizone feeding ceased, consistent with previous studies, whereas only the early demyelination group exhibited impaired working memory after remyelination took place.

Imperforate anus is a congenital disease involving a deformity of the anorectum. The early surgery and invasive follow-up treatment associated with IA may affect the child psychosocially, including the child-parent relationship. By developing and testing a questionnaire for children born with anorectal anomalies, a tool for measuring psychosocial functioning can be realized.\nFirst, a literature review on \"Imperforate Anus\" was performed. Second, an exploratory interview study was conducted with patients/adolescents with IA and their parents. The findings from these interviews were the foundation for construction of the questionnaire. The Imperforate Anus Psychosocial Questionnaire (IAPSQ) was tested and revised three times before its completion. It contains 45 items on Likert scales. A total of 87 children completed the IAPSQ: 25 children with IA and two comparison groups. Face and content validity were considered. The Rasch approach, an item response theory model, was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IAPSQ, where item difficulty and person ability are concurrently approximated.\nThe findings of the Rasch analysis revealed that the psychological dimension was reasonable, and that person reliability (0.83) was moderate and item reliability (0.95) was sufficient. The social dimension showed satisfactory item reliability (0.87). The person reliability (0.52) of the social dimension was weak.

Iproniazid and imipramine made two fundamental contributions to the development of psychiatry: one of a social-health nature, consisting in an authentic change in the psychiatric care of depressive patients; and the other of a purely pharmacological nature, since these agents have constituted an indispensable research tool for neurobiology and psychopharmacology, permitting, among other things, the postulation of the first aetiopathogenic hypotheses of depressive disorders. The clinical introduction of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the late 1980s, once again revolutionized therapy for depression, opening the way for new families of antidepressants. The present work reviews, from a historical perspective, the entire process that led to the discovery of these drugs, as well as their contribution to the development of the neuroscientific disciplines. However, all of these antidepressants, like the rest of those currently available for clinical practice, share the same action mechanism, which involves the modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission at a synaptic level, so that the future of antidepressant therapy would seem to revolve around the search for extraneuronal non-aminergic mechanisms or mechanisms that modulate the intraneuronal biochemical pathways."}, {"Title": "Feasibility and effectiveness of telepsychiatry services for chinese immigrants in a nursing home.", "Abstract": "This study investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of providing telepsychiatry services to Chinese immigrants in a nursing home. The psychiatrist interviewed patients face-to-face for the initial consultation, and encouraged them to participate in this study to receive telepsychiatry-based follow-up visits. The feasibility and outcomes of telepsychiatry visits and satisfaction of the subjects, their families, and the nursing home staff were assessed. Nine monolingual Chinese immigrants, 8 women and 1 man, ranging from 54 to 88 years of age, were enrolled. The main reasons for psychiatric consultation were mood and behavioral problems. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) subjects participated in videoconference follow-up visits, and 1 subject (11.1%) declined. Among the 8 subjects, 6 were referred for psychiatric intervention, 1 for differential diagnosis, and 1 for suicide assessment. At the end of the study, all 6 subjects referred for intervention had greatly improved; the subjects, their families, and the nursing staff were highly satisfied with the telepsychiatry service. It is feasible to provide psychiatry consultations to ethnic immigrants in a nursing home despite the fact that many of them are unfamiliar with the technology and suffer from dementia and psychotic symptoms. Telepsychiatry provides an efficient way for ethnic elders in nursing homes to connect with mental health professionals with the appropriate language and cultural background, regardless of location. Telepsychiatry may decrease the disparities in treatment of mental illnesses among ethnic immigrants in nursing homes."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to describe the referral patterns, assessment and suggested management of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples referred to an inner-city general hospital psychiatry service. The overarching goal was quality improvement.\nParticipants were identified from the consultation-liaison psychiatry database of all referrals to the service from the general hospital and Emergency Department. All people over 18 identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander seen during the period 1 July 2004-30 June 2007 were included. Information regarding referral and liaison patterns, suggested psychiatric management, disposition and follow up were gathered retrospectively from the medical records, with a particular focus on cultural references.\nThere were 162 referrals to the consultation-liaison psychiatry team of people identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. The rate of referral to consultation-liaison psychiatry was 3%. The Emergency Department had the highest rate of referral followed by Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The most common reason for referral was assessment of risk. The patient's Aboriginal ethnicity was mentioned in 52.5% of consultation-liaison assessments. An Aboriginal health worker was consulted in 48.1% of cases. The most common management approach involved pharmacotherapy. The consultation-liaison service instigated legal interventions in 25% of cases. Forty-five patients were referred for psychiatric admission following their assessment. Mental health follow up was arranged in 43.8% of cases.\nThe range of mental health problems referred and types of diagnoses made in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples reflect what has been previously reported, particularly in relation to comorbidity. Aboriginal ethnicity was variably identified and Aboriginal health workers, general practitioners and families were not routinely involved in consultation-liaison psychiatry assessments, highlighting an opportunity to improve communication and the quality of patient care."}, {"Title": "Paradoxical anxiogenic response of juvenile mice to fluoxetine.", "Abstract": "Depression, anxiety, and conduct disorders are common in children and adolescents, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used to treat these conditions. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is the first approved SSRI for the treatment of depression in this population. Although it is believed that overall, fluoxetine is effective in child and adolescent psychiatry, there have been reports of specific adverse drug effects, most prominently, suicidality and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, worsening of depression, and anxiety. Chronic fluoxetine substantially increases brain extracellular 5-HT concentrations, and the juvenile developing brain may respond to supraphysiological 5-HT levels with specific adverse effects not seen or less prominent in adult brain. Using novelty-induced hypophagia, as well as open-field and elevated plus maze tests, we show that both Swiss Webster and C57Bl/6 mice, receiving fluoxetine in a clinically relevant dose and during their juvenile age corresponding to child-adolescent periods in humans, exhibit a paradoxical anxiogenic response. The adverse effects of juvenile fluoxetine disappeared upon drug discontinuation and no long-term behavioral consequences were apparent. No adverse effect to chronic fluoxetine was seen in adult mice and a dose-dependent anxiolytic effect developed. These data show that the age of the mice, independently of the strains and tests used in this study, is the determining factor of whether the response to chronic fluoxetine is anxiolytic or anxiogenic. Taken together, the response of the juvenile and adult brain to fluoxetine could be fundamentally different and the juvenile fluoxetine administration mouse model described here may help to identify the mechanism underlying this difference."}, {"Title": "Prescribing of psychotropic medication to the intellectually disabled by community paediatricians - a survey.", "Abstract": "Children with intellectual disability are often managed by community paediatricians and have a high prevalence of mental disorder.

Postal questionnaires were sent to all members of the British Association of Community Child Health in the north and north western regions (n= 155), between summer 2004 and autumn 2005.\nA total of 70.1% (n= 110) of questionnaires were returned of which 66 were completed. The most common reason for non-completion was that the respondent did not look after the intellectually disabled. A total of 54.5% of respondents did not have access to specialist psychiatry services for children and adolescents with an intellectual disability. Community paediatricians were most likely to prescribe for sleep disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was a significant relationship between perceived adequacy of training and paediatrics prescribing for ADHD, but there was no such relationship for sleep disorders. The vast majority of community paediatricians did not feel adequately trained to prescribe for challenging behaviour or depression, although a small minority did prescribe.\nCommunity paediatricians play a substantial role in prescribing psychotropic medications for this group. A substantial minority of community paediatricians do not feel that they have enough training to prescribe for ADHD and sleep disorders, and perceived competency is more likely to inform prescribing for ADHD than for sleep disorders. This may have implications for training. Although these children pose complex difficulties, access to specialist mental health services for children and adolescents with intellectual disability remains patchy, especially in the north-west, and further development of these services is needed."}, {"Title": "Common statistical and research design problems in manuscripts submitted to high-impact psychiatry journals: what editors and reviewers want authors to know.", "Abstract": "Journal editors and statistical reviewers are often in the difficult position of catching serious problems in submitted manuscripts after the research is conducted and data have been analyzed.

Our primary goal was to facilitate communication between journal editors/reviewers and researchers/authors and thereby improve the scientific and statistical quality of research and submitted manuscripts.\nEditors and statistical reviewers of 54 high-impact psychiatry journals were surveyed to learn what statistical or design problems they encounter most often in submitted manuscripts. Respondents completed the survey online. The authors analyzed survey text responses using content analysis procedures to identify major themes related to commonly encountered statistical or research design problems.\nEditors and reviewers (n=15) who handle manuscripts from 39 different high-impact psychiatry journals responded to the survey. The most commonly cited problems regarded failure to map statistical models onto research questions, improper handling of missing data, not controlling for multiple comparisons, not understanding the difference between equivalence and difference trials, and poor controls in quasi-experimental designs.\nThe scientific quality of psychiatry research and submitted reports could be greatly improved if researchers became sensitive to, or sought consultation on frequently encountered methodological and analytic issues."}, {"Title": "[Behavioural changes during forensic psychiatric treatment: a multicenter study].", "Abstract": "In forensic psychiatry it is essential that patients' risks of reoffending are assessed as reliably as possible.

The most common mental capacity issues were placement (303 assessed of whom 54% lacked capacity), treatment (86 assessed, 59% lacking capacity) and finances (70 assessed, 79% lacking capacity). Cognitive impairment, dementia and delirium, rather than mental disorders were associated with incapacity. Those assessed and deemed to lack capacity for placement decisions were twice as likely to be placed in a care home, and four times as likely to be placed in an elderly mentally ill (EMI) facility, independent of dementia diagnosis and cognitive functioning.\nReferrals to a liaison psychiatry service for older people for assessment of mental capacity are common. The main mental capacity issues in older people were those linked to discharge planning.

Female patients seem to significantly predominate those diagnosed with late-onset schizophrenia. Generally, paranoid delusions of reference with family members, neighbors, and friends are observed as clinical features of such late-onset schizophrenia conditions. Medical treatment for such a condition is often effective and considered to improve the prognosis. The authors conducted clinical research at Jichi Medical University Hospital psychiatric ward involving 38 late-onset schizophrenia patients (7 males; 31 females) diagnosed over the age of 40 using DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria. Subjects were selected from 316 schizophrenia patients (164 males; 152 females) admitted to the hospital for schizophrenia treatment at some time during the 13 years from April 1, 1993 to March 31, 2006. Also, another 14 late-onset schizophrenia patients diagnosed over the age of 40 (1 male; 13 females), with additional investigation, were selected from 130 cases (50 males; 80 females) treated in related facilities at some time during the 2 years from April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006. The investigation revealed the following results: (1) Cases showing an onset after the age of 40 comprised 12% of the total population. Female cases comprised 20.4%, being significantly higher than that of male cases (4.3%). Within the psychiatric ward, cases showing an onset after 40 made up 10.8% of the total population. Female cases comprised 16.3%, being significantly higher than that of male cases (2.0%). (2) The paranoid type comprised 55.3% of the total population of late-onset cases, being significantly higher than in early-onset cases younger than 40 years old. A total of 55.3% of late-onset cases also showed depressive symptoms, being significantly higher than in early-onset cases. (3) For late-onset, 55.3% of patients showed an introverted premorbid character, while 15.8% of patients exhibited an extroverted premorbid character. Regarding late-onset cases, the number of introverted premorbid character cases significantly lower than in early-onset cases diagnosed at 40 years or younger; however, no significant difference was observed for the extroverted premorbid character. (4) A total of 65.8% of the population of late-onset cases were diagnosed as having psychosocial stresses as their cause. In addition, 36 % of subjects with psychosocial stress recognition had experienced a sense of loss. Of these, 66.6% of the loss experience involved separation from their family members. (5) Cases showing a successful recovery from schizophrenia comprised 55.3 % of the total population. On the other hand, cases with an unsuccessful outcome were observed in 34.2% of the total population, accounting for a relatively large portion. A total of 30.8% of subjects with an unsuccessful outcome were unmarried at the time of onset, and made up 57.1% of the late-onset population. According to the results of this investigation, late-onset schizophrenia represents about 10% of the total cases, and female cases are significantly more common than male cases. For late-onset patients, subjects' self-functions were more developed compared to those of early-onset patients, so they did not seem to clearly show early-onset symptoms during a younger period. The late-onset type has a tendency to show a better rate of successful recovery; however, there are situations where the condition reverts toward the \"disorganized type\", moving closer toward Kraepelin's early-onset disorganized schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of anxiety disorders and anxiety subtypes in patients with Parkinson's disease.", "Abstract": "Anxiety disorders are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but are not well characterized. This study determined the prevalence and clinical correlates of all DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorder diagnoses in a sample of 127 subjects with idiopathic PD who underwent comprehensive assessments administered by a psychiatrist and neurologist. A panel of six psychiatrists with expertise in geriatric psychiatry and/or movement disorders established by consensus all psychiatric diagnoses. Current and lifetime prevalence of at least one anxiety disorder diagnosis was 43% (n = 55) and 49% (n = 63), respectively. Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified, a DSM diagnosis used for anxiety disturbances not meeting criteria for defined subtypes, was the most common diagnosis (30% lifetime prevalence, n = 38). Compared with nonanxious subjects, panic disorder (n = 13) was associated with earlier age of PD onset [50.3 (12.2) vs. 61.0 (13.7) years, P < 0.01], higher rates of motor fluctuations [77% (10/13) vs. 39% (25/64), P = 0.01] and morning dystonia [38% (5/13) vs. 13% (8/62), P < 0.03].

Elementary phenomena.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper and its pair is to provide a comprehensive review, from the different perspectives of neurology and neuropsychiatry, of the phenomenology and mechanisms of hallucinatory experience in epilepsy. We emphasise the clinical and electrophysiological features, and make comparisons with the primary psychoses. In this paper, we consider definitions and elementary hallucinatory phenomena. Regarding definition, there is a clearly divergent evolution in meaning of the terms delusion, illusion and hallucination in the separate traditions of neurology and psychiatry. Psychiatry makes clear distinctions between the terms and has focussed on the empirical use of descriptive psychopathology in order to delineate the various psychiatric syndromes, including those in epilepsy. These distinctions in psychiatry have stood the test of time and are useful in clinical descriptive terms, but do not help to understand the basic mechanisms. The focus of neurology has been to regard delusions, illusions and hallucinations in epilepsy as a result of localised or network based neuronal epileptic activity that can be investigated especially using intracranial stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). The neurological approach leads to a more synoptical definition of 'hallucination' than in psychiatry and to the conclusion that there is little point in differentiating hallucination from illusion or delusion in view of the overlap in the physiological bases of the phenomena. The semiologically derived differentiation of these terms in psychiatry is not supported by similarly discrete electrophysiological signatures. However, as discussed in the second paper, some psychotic states are associated with similar electrophysiological changes. The wide range of hallucinatory symptoms occurring during epileptic seizures recorded during intracranial SEEG and brain stimulation are reviewed here, including: experiential and interpretive phenomena, affective symptoms, as well as auditory, olfactory, gustatory, somatic and visual hallucinatory phenomena. Several conclusions can be drawn. First, it is clear that there is only limited anatomical specificity of many hallucinatory states. Repeated seizures or stimulation of a single area, even within the same patient can produce different psychic responses, whilst stimulation of widely distinct areas (especially in the limbic system) within the same individual can produce remarkably similar phenomena. This lack of specificity applies particularly to psychic symptoms, including experiential phenomena, and complex hallucinatory states. The most anatomically specific areas from this point of view are the elementary hallucinations arising from primary visual and auditory cortices. Involvement of the limbic cortex is a pre-requisite for the occurrence of complex hallucinatory states. It is clear that on the basis of these findings, as has been recognised at least since the 1960s, that even apparently focal epileptic seizures, (especially in the mesial temporal lobe, insula and limbic cortices), must involve widely distributed neuronal networks."}, {"Title": "The feminisation of Canadian medicine and its impact upon doctor productivity.", "Abstract": "We examined the differences in work patterns between female and male doctors in Canada to gain insight into the effect of an increased number of female doctors on overall doctor productivity.\nData on the practice profiles of female and male doctors across Canada were extracted from the 2007 National Physician Survey. A doctor productivity measure, 'work hours per week per population' (WHPWPP), was created, based on the number of weekly doctor hours spent providing direct patient care per 100,000 citizens. The predicted WHPWPP was calculated for a hypothetical time-point when the female and male doctor populations reach equilibrium. The differences in current and predicted WHPWPP were then analysed.\nFemale medical students currently (2007) outnumber male medical students (at 57.8% of the medical student population). The percentage of practising doctors who are women is highest in the fields of paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and family practice. Female doctors work an average of 47.5 hours per week (giving 30.0 hours of direct patient care), compared with 53.8 hours worked by male doctors (35.0 hours of direct patient care) (P < 0.01, chi(2) test). Female doctors tend to work less on call hours per week and see fewer patients while on-call. Female doctors are also more likely to take parental leave or a leave of absence (P < 0.01, chi(2) test).

A multiple-choice questionnaire is sent to all members of the Italian Society of Psychiatry, with 1,202 psychiatrists responding (20.23% of the sample). The data are evaluated using SPSS with chi-square test calculations for discrete and continuous variables and t-testing for independent samples (significance p < .05). Almost all psychiatrists (90.9%) have experienced verbal aggression; 72% have been threatened with dangerous objects and 64.58% have suffered physical aggression. Physical aggression experiences result in a 50% increase in the probability of modifying one's therapeutic behaviour.

Researchers have identified the three types of cognitive resources needed to combat uncertainty (technical, personal, or conceptual), as well as the affective stress reactions physicians have when confronted with uncertainty. In this study, we explored the relationship between primary care physicians' stress reactions to uncertainty and the conceptual resource of epistemology.\nUsing Likert-type measures of epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with 78 board-certified and resident physicians in primary care. A simple bivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty (Model 1), and a multivariate regression analysis was performed to test for the independent effect of epistemology on stress reactions to uncertainty while controlling for gender, specialty, and professional development status (Model 2).\nPhysician epistemology and stress reactions to uncertainty were significantly related in both models.\nAmong primary care physicians, a biopsychosocial epistemology is associated with less stress reactions to uncertainty, and a biomedical epistemology is associated with more stress reactions to uncertainty."}, {"Title": "[Panic attacks simulated by occipital lobe seizures].", "Abstract": "Eleven-year-old Stephanie was admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatry day hospital with symptoms of an anxiety and panic disorder, and compulsive and self-harmful behavior.

The overview of the available literature reveals that numerous authors have described subnormal auditory abilities in groups of children with developmental language disorders, dyslexia or ADHD. However, little or no relationship between the severity of clinical impairment and auditory deficits has been found. Thus auditory deficits do not appear to be causally related to learning disorders or conduct disorders. With respect to the diagnostic process the review makes clear that the validity of the diagnosis CAPD is low. There is no agreement about diagnostic criteria, and the reliability of most auditory tests in insufficient. Moreover, while an auditory training can only improve the directly trained auditory functions, there is no transfer effect to learning ability of behavior.

The main theme of the past fifty years has been the shift from long-stay public hospitals to acute care provided in private settings. States have reduced their costs by shifting their financial burden to federal dollars and commercial insurers through managed care practices. The net result has been a reduction in, and shortage of, psychiatric beds.

Negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activations in the pgACC were assessed during emotional stimulation. Quantitative J-resolved magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the pgACC enabled simultaneous determination of glutamine, glutamate, N-acetylaspartate, glucose, and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations. Subjective emotional intensity ratings as well as various clinical parameters were determined.\nThe patients were recruited and evaluated in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Zurich, while the measurements were performed in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and the Technical University Zurich.\nNineteen unmedicated patients with MDD and 24 healthy subjects.\nReduced glutamine levels and lower functional responses in pgACC in anhedonic depressed patients were expected to be the predominant effect of abnormal glutamatergic transmission. It was further tested if, among patients, the ratings of emotional intensity on visual stimulation predicted the amount of metabolic and functional alterations in terms of reduced relative metabolite concentrations and BOLD changes.\nPatients with highly anhedonic MDD show decreased glutamine but normal glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations, with glutamine concentrations being dissociated from glucose concentrations. Glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations in pgACC correlate with negative BOLD responses induced by emotional stimulation in MDD; whereas in healthy subjects, negative BOLD responses correlate with gamma-aminobutyric acid instead. Negative BOLD responses as well as glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations correlate with emotional intensity ratings, an anhedonia surrogate, in those with MDD but not in healthy subjects.\nAberrant neuronal activation patterns of the pgACC in anhedonic depression are related to deficits of glutamatergic metabolism."}, {"Title": "The histamine H4 receptor is functionally expressed on neurons in the mammalian CNS.", "Abstract": "The histamine H4 receptor is the most recently identified of the G protein-coupled histamine receptor family and binds several neuroactive drugs, including amitriptyline and clozapine. So far, H4 receptors have been found only on haematopoietic cells, highlighting its importance in inflammatory conditions. Here we investigated the possibility that H4 receptors may be expressed in both the human and mouse CNS.\nImmunological and pharmacological studies were performed using a novel anti-H4 receptor antibody in both human and mouse brains, and electrophysiological techniques in the mouse brain respectively. Pharmacological tools, selective for the H4 receptor and patch clamp electrophysiology, were utilized to confirm functional properties of the H4 receptor in layer IV of the mouse somatosensory cortex.\nHistamine H4 receptors were prominently expressed in distinct deep laminae, particularly layer VI, in the human cortex, and mouse thalamus, hippocampal CA4 stratum lucidum and layer IV of the cerebral cortex. In layer IV of the mouse somatosensory cortex, the H4 receptor agonist 4-methyl histamine (20 micromol x L(-1)) directly hyperpolarized neurons, an effect that was blocked by the selective H4 receptor antagonist JNJ 10191584, and promoted outwardly rectifying currents in these cells. Monosynaptic thalamocortical CNQX-sensitive excitatory postsynaptic potentials were not altered by 4-methyl histamine (20 micromol x L(-1)) suggesting that H4 receptors did not act as hetero-receptors on thalamocortical glutamatergic terminals.\nThis is the first demonstration that histamine H4 receptors are functionally expressed on neurons, which has major implications for the therapeutic potential of these receptors in neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Borderline personality disorder: ontogeny of a diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to describe the development of the borderline personality disorder diagnosis, highlighting both the obstacles encountered and the associated achievements.\nOn the basis of a review of the literature, the author provides a chronological account of the borderline construct in psychiatry, summarizing progress in decade-long intervals.\nBorderline personality disorder has moved from being a psychoanalytic colloquialism for untreatable neurotics to becoming a valid diagnosis with significant heritability and with specific and effective psychotherapeutic treatments.

In future studies, it would be useful to focus on the limbic system and to investigate which parts of the frontal lobes and cerebral networks that are of interest in the psychopathic personality. Moreover, the reviewed material highlights some of the methodological difficulties in this area of research such as selection bias in the recruitment of patients, inadequate matching of control subjects, and sometimes incongruous results.

Ethics issues in contemporary neuroscience as they apply separately to genetics and neuroimaging have been a growing focus for research but, to date, there has not yet been a rigorous exploration of the ethical dimensions of the territory in which they overlap. Here we propose that the ethics challenges associated with the combination of these methods call for an expanded \"neuro-space\" in which societal and ethical values are closely and explicitly integrated with the new science. We build specifically on the model delivered by Roffman et al.

Harv Rev Psychiatry 14:78-91] for neuroimaging, and develop the argument that the ethics issues parallel the heightened discriminative and cumulative power of imaging genetics. In the new combined space, features of discriminative power concern better differentiation of disease, sometimes by ethnicity, and incidental findings. Clinical utility, prediction and intervention, and stigma and labeling reflect a common ground between discriminative and cumulative power. Privacy, autonomy, response sensitivity and attitudes, resource allocation for research and for health care, and commercialization, are features of cumulative power. Parallel to the clinical features highlighted in the Roffman et al. map, the combined space yields additional neuroethics features. These are characterized by new knowledge and new implications for health care, justice, and policy.

The authors investigate the reading materials and learning methods used by clinical clerks in their preparation for the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Psychiatry Subject Exam (PSE).\nClerkship students from six U.S. medical schools who had recently completed their psychiatry clerkship and PSE were surveyed regarding reading material use, teaching methods encountered, and other relevant resources which may have influenced their PSE scores.\nThe most frequently used PSE preparation material was a \"step-or-prep\" book, followed by practice questions, handouts, and assigned texts. No single preparation material type or combination proved significantly different in influencing PSE scores. The didactic methods used in clerkships did differ significantly in their influence on PSE scores. Students in the top quartile used slightly more books and different combinations of books than students in the bottom quartile.\nStudents exhibited several trends in their preparation for the PSE. The most striking findings were the heavy student reliance on step-or-prep books over other learning resources and that step-or-prep books did not demonstrate significance as a superior preparation resource for the PSE.

As increasing attempts are made to extend this tool to psychiatric training and education, it has been suggested that SPs can be useful not only to expose students to the variety of psychopathologic states, but also to teach and assess complex interpersonal processes such as empathic engagement and psychodynamic psychotherapy. The author argues that current enthusiasm for this modality should be tempered with caution about its limitations.\nCurrent uses of SPs in psychiatry as described in the psychiatric education and general medical education literature are critically reviewed.\nInherent problems in the use of SPs in psychiatry are described as they relate to the nature of empathy and the uniquely interpersonal nature of psychiatry.\nSPs are useful additions to our educational toolbox but have intrinsic limitations for our field due to psychiatry's roots in the nature of empathy and the patient-psychiatrist relationship. Standardized patients are most appropriate for exposing trainees to a variety of psychopathologies and testing very discrete skills; the use of SPs is most problematic for teaching psychotherapy and assessing complex interpersonal skills, such as empathic responsiveness."}, {"Title": "The effect of psychiatric third-year rotation setting on academic performance, student attitudes, and specialty choice.", "Abstract": "Few studies have directly compared the effects of third-year clerkship rotation type on measures of academic performance, student attitudes about psychiatry and psychiatric patients, and level of interest in psychiatry as a career. The goal of this study was to assess the extent to which rotation type influenced these outcome variables among third-year medical students.\nThe authors conducted a prospective study of 647 third-year medical students administratively assigned to one of three clinical settings: an acute inpatient ward, a hospital-based consultation-liaison service, and an outpatient mental health care clinic. Academic performance was estimated using scores from a nationally standardized examination provided by the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), while responses to an anonymous survey developed by the investigators were used as indicators of student attitudes about and interest in psychiatry as a potential career field. Administrative residency match data were collected on all participants.\nRotation type had no effect on NBME exam scores after controlling for grade point average, age, gender, rotation order, and rotation year. Although individuals who rotated on the inpatient service scored an average of 1.8 points higher on the examination relative to individuals who rotated on the consultation service, this small difference was not considered academically meaningful. Similarly, there were no statistically meaningful patterns that emerged between survey responses and rotation type. Approximately 4% of our sample matched into psychiatric residencies after graduating from medical school. Rotation type and survey responses were not statistically correlated with specialty choice.\nRotation type does not appear to affect acquisition of psychiatric knowledge as estimated by standardized examination scores, nor does it appear to influence students' perceptions of psychiatry or specialty choice."}, {"Title": "Innovative training in pediatrics, general psychiatry, and child psychiatry: background, outcomes, and experiences.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the history, rationale, and outcomes of combined training programs in pediatrics, psychiatry, and child psychiatry (\"triple board\"), including narrative feedback from graduates and reflections upon the important components of the program.\nThis article reviews the background and experiences of triple board graduates and programs using published data regarding triple board history and outcomes, reflections and follow-up information collected from triple board graduates as part of a national triple board network development, and direct experiences with triple board training programs.\nThe triple board training program provides a unique training background for physicians who serve children and their families.

The original trans-methylation hypothesis was proposed at a time when chlorpromazine had been synthesized but not yet marketed as an antipsychotic (Thorazine). The premise was that abnormal metabolism led to the methylation of biogenic amines in the brains of schizophrenia patients and that these hallucinogenic compounds produced positive symptoms of the disease. At the time, some psychiatrists were interested in drugs such as mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide that replicated clinical symptoms. They understood that these compounds might provide a biological basis for psychosis. The amino acid methionine (MET) was given to patients in the hopes of confiriming the transmethylation hypothesis. However with time, many realized that the hunt for an endogenous psychotropic compound would remain elusive. We now believe that the MET studies may have produced a toxic reaction in susceptible patients by disrupting epigenetic regulation in the brain. The focus of the current review is on the coordinate regulation of multiple promoters expressed in neurons that may be modulated through methylation. While certainly the identification of genes and promoters regulated epigenetically has been steadily increasing over the years, there have been few studies that examine methylation changes as a consequence of increased levels of a dietary amino acid such as methionine (MET). We suggest that the MET mouse model may provide information regarding the identification of genes that are regulated by epigenetic perturbations. In addition to our studies with the reelin and GAD67 promoters, we also have evidence that additional promoters expressed in select neurons of the brain are similarly affected by MET administration. We suggest that to expand our knowledge of epigenetically-responsive promoters using MET might allow for a better appreciation of global methylation changes occurring in selected brain regions."}, {"Title": "Ethics and evidence in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "Many psychiatrists have endorsed the idea of evidence-based psychiatry, the application of the principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) to psychiatric practice. Proponents of an evidence-based approach to psychiatry hope that if practice is driven by \"hard\" scientific data, there will be greater potential to help patients. In other words, advocates of evidence-based psychiatry aim to bolster psychiatry's ethical standing through scientific evidence. Can EBM provide this ethical substantiation to psychiatry? This article provides an overview of some of the main ethical issues within psychiatry and examines three interrelated questions: (1) to which ethical values is EBM committed? (2) which ethical theory is reflected in these values? and (3) can these values and theories resolve existing ethical issues in psychiatry? EBM strives for the \"greatest good for the greatest number,\" where good is defined as improved health. This utilitarian orientation cannot, however, address critical areas of moral importance for psychiatry, such as how its practitioners differentiate normal from abnormal, how they determine which forms of suffering should be alleviated through psychiatric means, and when involuntary intervention is ethically justified. The ethical principles implicit in EBM are too limited to serve as an ethical basis for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The neurobiology of Meditation and its clinical effectiveness in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews the evidence for changes of Meditation on body and brain physiology and for clinical effectiveness in disorders of psychiatry. The aim of Meditation is to reduce or eliminate irrelevant thought processes through training of internalised attention, thought to lead to physical and mental relaxation, stress reduction, psycho-emotional stability and enhanced concentration. Physiological evidence shows a reduction with Meditation of stress-related autonomic and endocrine measures, while neuroimaging studies demonstrate the functional up-regulation of brain regions of affect regulation and attention control. Clinical studies show some evidence for the effectiveness of Meditation in disorders of affect, anxiety and attention. The combined evidence from neurobiological and clinical studies seems promising. However, a more thorough understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of action and clinical effectiveness of the different Meditative practices is needed before Meditative practices can be leveraged in the prevention and intervention of mental illness."}, {"Title": "[Cognitive remediation and cognitive assistive technologies in schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "Cognitive impairments are a core feature in schizophrenia. They impact several cognitive abilities but most importantly attention, memory and executive functions, consequently leading to great difficulties in everyday life. Most schizophrenia patients need assurance and require assistance and help from care workers, family members and friends. Family members taking care of a patient have additional daily work burden, and suffer psychological anguish and anxiety. Therefore, improving cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients is essential for the well-being of patients and their relatives. Reducing these deficits may decrease the economic burden to the health care system through lower numbers of hospital admissions and shorter hospitalisation periods, for example. Cognitive rehabilitation was developed to address the limited benefits of conventional treatments on cognitive deficits through the use of assistive technology as a means of enhancing memory and executive skills in schizophrenia patients.\nTo provide clinicians with comprehensive knowledge on cognitive trainings, programs of remediation, and cognitive assistive technologies.\nLiterature review. A search in the electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Index Medicus) for recent articles in the last 10 years related to cognitive remediation published in any language using the words: cognitive and remediation or rehabilitation and schizophrenia, and a search for chapters in psychiatry and rehabilitation textbooks.\nWe found 392 articles and 112 review paper mainly in English. First, we identified cognitive remediation programs that were beneficial to schizophrenia patients. Programs available in French (IPT, RECOS, and RehaCom) and others (CET, NET, CRT, NEAR, APT and CAT) were identified. In addition, since memory and executive function impairments could be present in people without schizophrenia, we reviewed inventories of cognitive assistive technologies proven to enhance cognitive skills in other populations. Finally, we present a review of recent studies testing innovative devices developed to assist schizophrenia patients.\nFirst, we found several cognitive programs proven to be effective with schizophrenia patients, but only three were validated in French. It could be useful to adapt other programs for French-speaking populations. Unfortunately, we found that very few of the existing cognitive assistive technologies are proposed to be used with schizophrenia patients. In fact, most of the available cognitive orthoses were tested primarily in people with neurological injuries (for example, various memory impairments caused by traumas), and in elderly illnesses (like Alzheimer disease). Devices for patients with mental deficits (e.g., mental retardation) were developed later, and only very recently explored for use in schizophrenia. As a result of an international collaboration between France and Canada, currently a tool called MOBUS is being tested. This technology aims at improving the autonomy of schizophrenia patients, by helping them plan and remember their daily activities. Furthermore, it encourages patient-caregiver communication, and permits monitoring patients' subjective reports of their symptoms. The use of cognitive assistive technologies is not meant to isolate patients by replacing the human element of relatives and caregivers by a machine. On the contrary, they offer a sense of security and they improve interpersonal relationships by permitting enhanced autonomy and greater self-confidence. Finally, a literature review of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia emphasizes the importance of a structured application of the technique in order for it to succeed. First, it is crucial to detect the impairments that will be targeted in each patient presenting a specific pattern of impairments. For this purpose, validated and customised neuropsychological tests are required. Then, cognitive remediation programs must be customised to each patient's needs in order to motivate the patient to participate. Finally, long-term effects must be assessed in order to verify whether reinforcement is needed. Following these steps, most of the studies show an improvement in the well-being of patients with schizophrenia. These recommendations are also suitable for the cognitive remediation programs, as for treatments with cognitive assistive devices. An important hurdle facing the advance of cognitive assistive technology programs is that different research groups work individually without a coordinated effort to improve and validate the existing programs.\nSchizophrenia treatments must take into account not only patients' symptoms, but also the associated cognitive deficits which constitute an important factor in their social problems. It has been shown that several cognitive remediation programs are efficient in schizophrenia. New technologies complement the benefits of such programs, and support pharmacological treatments and psychotherapies."}, {"Title": "[Prescribing patterns of antipsychotics in 13 French psychiatric hospitals].", "Abstract": "The commercial introduction of atypical antipsychotics, called second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), a few years ago, has led to a world-wide reappraisal of the established treatment strategies for people with psychotic or bipolar disorders. They permitted improvements in the pharmacologic management of psychiatric diseases. As compared to conventional neuroleptics or first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), they promised better efficacy especially on negative symptoms and cognitive impairments of psychiatric diseases and, at the same time, better tolerance on neurological side effects. Now, they have shown other side effects and they have a higher acquisition cost than FGAs.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the prescribing practices of antipsychotic drugs in French psychiatric hospitals for adult inpatients and to compare them with other surveys and guidelines. In June 2004, we conducted a one-day, cross-sectional, observational and naturalistic study in 13 hospitals, members of the PIC network.\nTwo thousand one hundred and ninety-two prescriptions with antipsychotic treatment were collected. One thousand one hundred and fifty-four prescriptions (52.6%) included a SGA, but the FGAs were the most prescribed (65.8%; n=2259), principally cyamemazine (24.7%). There was one antipsychotic in 50.7% of prescriptions, two antipsychotics in 42.2%, but the second neuroleptic used was a sedative (82.6%), principally cyamemazine. Multiple antipsychotics were present in 1081 prescriptions (49.3%), with an average number of 1.57 antipsychotics. A mood stabiliser, an antidepressant, an anxiolytic and a hypnotic were coprescribed in respectively 37, 30.5, 65.1 and 41.6%. There were 2.48 psychotropic drugs associated with the principal antipsychotic; in total, with correctors of side-effects of the antipsychotics, there were 3.38 drugs per prescription. The SGAs aimed more often for psychotic (F20-F29) patients (61.9% versus 43.3% with FGAs), who were males (61.4% versus 68%), younger (42.6 years versus 44.1 years; p<0.02), with higher average daily doses, more associated with other neuroleptics (p<0.0004) and less associated with anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents (p<10(-4)) than FGAs. Compared to other surveys, these results showed that the SGAs have become the first-line treatment for psychiatric disorders. The highest average daily doses corresponded to treatments of psychotic patients and, hence, the values might largely exceed the authorized maximum doses. Furthermore, in more than half of the cases, an FGA, generally a sedative, was associated with an SGA that did not comply with the principle of monotherapy established by the national and international guidelines; that also annulled the expected benefit of the SGAs on the awakening, cognition and the neurological tolerability of the treatment. The coprescriptions of the other psychotropic drugs to neuroleptics also remained the rule in psychiatry, showing all the complexity of pharmacological psychiatric medications. Prescriptions also included treatments for side effects of antipsychotics; even on the prescriptions including the SGAs, there was the coprescription of anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs, the deleterious character of which one knows on cognition. This resulted in a difficulty of understanding the prescription for the patient, associated with reduced compliance and increased risks of pharmacological side effects. The heterogeneity of the situations of crisis in psychiatric hospitals could make the strict application of guidelines' recommendations difficult. Nevertheless, the educational interventions in psychopharmacology for patients and the training campaigns for psychiatrists and nurses are necessary to improve the therapeutic management of the patient and ensure him/her optimal quality of life.\nThis kind of survey, far too rare, was very important because it showed the routine clinical settings in which these new drugs were really used. The results showed that SGAs appeared to take the place of the FGAs used in the treatment of psychoses, particularly schizophrenia, but also in the treatment of mood disorders and they reflected actual clinical practices. Other surveys must be conducted to see whether our study confirms the general trend concerning the use of these drugs and, therefore, to reassess these prescribing practices."}, {"Title": "Survival and its discontents: the case of British psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Sub-divisions of labour in health settings are common and medical dominance and encroachment from competitors are well known.

British psychiatric orthodoxy has faced challenges to its legitimacy for over a century. However, since the 1980s, in the wake of de-institutionalisation and a new shared service commitment to 'recovery', these challenges have taken new shape. They are explored by considering: the current ambit of mental health care; the sub-division of labour in specialist mental services; recent governmental expectations of the mental health workforce; and the contested legacy of theory and practice in mental health work. The conclusion is that the profession is not under immediate threat of collapse but that its fate may now rest on whether a biomedical or a biopsychosocial model of practice predominates in routine service delivery."}, {"Title": "\"You may wade through them without seeing them\": general practitioners and their young patients with mental health problems.", "Abstract": "To gain insight into the management of children and adolescents with mental health problems by their GPs as the GPs describe it.\nA qualitative analysis of data from focus group interviews with GPs.\nWestern Coast of Norway.\nA strategic sample of 19 GPs.\nAccording to the informants psychosomatic and other internalizing disorders are the most frequent mental health problems in their practice.

The papers were an effort to examine context by offering a theoretical framework for the concept of \"level\" in intervention science, and advocating for \"multi-level\" approaches to social/behavioral change. They presented examples of ways in which interventions targeted social \"levels\" either simultaneously or sequentially by working together with communities across levels, and drawing on and co-constructing elements of local culture as components of the intervention. The papers raised a number of important issues, for example: (1) How are levels defined and how should collaborators be chosen; (2) does it matter at which level multilevel interventions begin; (3) do multilevel interventions have a greater effect on desired outcomes than level-specific interventions; (4) are multilevel interventions more sustainable; (5) are multilevel interventions cost effective to run, and evaluate; (6) how can theories of intervention be generated and adapted to each level of a multilevel intervention; (7) how should intervention activities at each level coordinate to facilitate community resident or target population empowerment?

However, the nature of any relationship between self-esteem and psychopathology remains unknown. This exploratory study assessed levels of self-esteem using the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Manual for the Self-Perception Profile for Children. University of Denver, CO: Denver; 1985) and psycho-social adjustment using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry, 1997; 38: 581-586) and examined child and parent understanding, attitudes and the perceived impact of reading difficulties on daily life. Sixty-eight children assessed as dyslexic on the basis of discrepancy scores (mean age 11.2 years; 44 male), and their parents, participated. No global self-esteem deficit was found, but the mean score for both child and parent-rated scholastic competence was significantly lower than that of the general population. Rates of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties were significantly higher than in the general population and were correlated with self-esteem. For children who had high global self-worth, both children and their parents had more positive attitudes towards their reading difficulties and were less likely to perceive a negative impact on relationships. The association between academic self-esteem and emotional symptoms is consistent with the proposed link between dyslexia and internalizing difficulties. Good self-esteem and a good understanding of dyslexia may help children avoid some of these difficulties. Further research with larger more representative samples is necessary as understanding the factors that promote successful psycho-social adjustment is essential to the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies."}, {"Title": "fMRI study of brain activity elicited by oral parafunctional movements.", "Abstract": "Parafunctional masticatory activity, such as the tooth clenching and grinding that is associated with bruxism, is encountered by clinicians in many disciplines, including dentistry, neurology and psychiatry.

Mean per cent signal changes showed significant between group differences in motor cortical (supplementary motor area, sensorimotor cortex and rolandic operculum) and subcortical (caudate) regions. Supplementary motor area data suggest that motor planning and initiation, particularly during the act of clenching, are less prominent in individuals with oromotor parafunctional behaviours.

In this article Siegel catalogues his early encounters with figures--contemporary and real--from Sigmund Freud to influential department chairs to an analyst who would become legendary for introducing a bold new theory into the psychoanalytic canon. Charting key experiences that shaped his adoption of this new approach--a depression in response to his first patient, a clinical treatment with Heinz Kohut, and exposure to others who dared to challenge Freud--Siegel describes the theory that brought both himself and his patients to life. After outlining the principles that guide the new theory and practice known as self psychology, Siegel tells of the empathic ambiance that can now emerge in the consulting room. Finally, he shows how this new theory of human motivation provides not merely a rationale for psychotherapy but an explanatory apparatus for understanding human action in the world beyond the consulting room. He turns to a brief study of aggression and war, as expressed in a 1932 correspondence between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, to illustrate how the understanding of aggression and war changes significantly when empathy is the field's data collecting instrument."}, {"Title": "[Towards a history of the family care of psychiatric patients].", "Abstract": "Inserting adults with psychic problems into families has recently been practiced in various European countries and also in Italy, where some mental health departments support such families. Beyond the well known story of Gheel, the etero and omofamily care of psychiatric patients has a forgotten history.\nOn the basis of unexplored and exceptionally rich sources from the archives of the asylums in Florence, as well as of the Province di Florence, which funded assistance to the mentally ill--this research focuses on the subsidized \"domestic custody\" of hundreds of psychiatric patients, who had already been institutionalized. Beginning in 1866, outboarding was supported by the provincial administration in Florence with the collaboration of the asylum medical direction.\nIn the late 19th C. and in the early 20th C. prestigious psychiatrists sought alternatives to the institutionalisation. These alternatives involved varied participants in a community (the patients and their families, the administrators and the medical specialists, the neighborhood and the police). The families played a special role that historians of the psychiatry exclusively dedicated to the insane asylums have not really seen.\nThe role of the families in the interaction with the psychiatric staff is not, even on a historiographical level, simply an additional and marginal chapter of the practices and of the culture of the mental health.

The field of epigenetics--DNA modifications that can affect gene expression--offers new models to understand discordance in MZ twins. In the past, MZ twins were regarded as genetically-identical controls for differing environmental conditions. In contrast, the evolving current concept is that epigenetic differences between MZ twins may modulate differences in diverse phenotype, from disease to personality.

The gene coding for CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, resulting in a significant part of the population being poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers. Individuals who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, have an increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when treated with CYP2D6-metabolized drugs, suggesting that CYP2D6 genotyping might be beneficial for patient care. This might be especially important in psychiatry, where approximately 50% of the patients use at least one drug primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. In particular, ADRs and poor response to treatment are major problems for some antipsychotics, including risperidone. However, there are no published cost-effectiveness studies on CYP2D6 genotyping, and the benefit that pharmacogenetic testing might represent by identifying problematic patients is still unclear. The present European Commission study found that current clinical and economical data concerning the frequency and direct healthcare costs of risperidone-related ADRs, the relation of such ADRs with the patients CYP2D6 genotypes, and costs for CYP2D6 genotyping, are not sufficient for determining if routine CYP2D6 genotyping might be cost beneficial for patients treated with risperidone. Therefore, efforts should be put on performing prospective cost-benefit studies with randomized treatment according to the CYP2D6 genotype to establish the utility of CYP2D6 genotyping for personalizing antipsychotic treatment."}, {"Title": "How the conflict between American psychiatry and neurology delayed the appreciation of cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis.", "Abstract": "Whereas cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS) were documented in the original clinicopathological description by Charcot, the extent and nature of cognitive dysfunction was poorly understood in the U.S. until over a century later. Our objective was to discern reasons for this misunderstanding and to examine forces shifting this topic to center stage of research and increased awareness in clinical practice. We hypothesized that during the 19th century, conflict between psychiatrists and neurologists over control of treatment of the mentally ill fueled a misunderstanding of the nature of MS which led neurologists to treat diseases of the body, and psychiatrists, diseases of the mind. The importance of cognitive deficits in MS was thus minimized until scientific breakthroughs could once again bring them to light. As the rift between disciplines peaked, awareness of cognitive deficits diminished, and vice versa. This may have been one contributing factor affecting how MS was mistakenly conceptualized for a century."}, {"Title": "Nursing care for sleep problems in psychiatry: is there a problem?", "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to provide insight into the current state of nursing care for sleep problems in inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care for adults and the elderly, and to determine if there is any benefit to the implementation of alternative, evidence-based interventions. To research this, the authors carried out a cross-sectional survey by means of a specially developed questionnaire. Between October 2005 and June 2006, 1,181 questionnaires were sent to a sample of nurses working in inpatient and outpatient care for psychiatric patients in five different psychiatric institutions in the Netherlands. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the properties of the sample and its strata. The authors explored differences between subgroups using chi-square, Mann-Whitney or Students t-tests. The authors found that daytime interventions to prevent sleep problems are mostly structural, introducing a structured environment with, for example, set going to bed and getting up times, and stress management activities. Sleep problems during the night are typically approached by observation, environment control and stress management. Experience, knowledge gained by initial training and eminence advice (advice from peers, physicians or experts) are the most frequently used knowledge sources in the care of sleep problems. Nurses were seen to be aware of the importance of sleep and the importance of a good nursing management for sleep problems. However, interventions are rarely evidence-based. Although nurses are satisfied with the care being provided for sleep problems, they are willing to apply alternative evidence-based care. They identified the lack of knowledge, skills and time as obstacles for such implementation."}, {"Title": "Capturing the ebb and flow of psychiatric symptoms with dynamical systems models.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms play a crucial role in psychology and psychiatry. However, little is known about how dimensions of symptoms--other than symptom level--relate to psychiatric outcomes. Until recently, methods for measuring dynamic aspects of symptoms have not been available to clinicians or researchers. The authors sought to test whether systematic patterns of change in psychiatric symptoms can be recovered across weekly assessments of individuals at high risk for violence. A secondary objective was to explore whether dynamic features of symptoms (specifically, oscillation speed and dysregulation) are concurrently associated with violence, an important indicator of functional impairment for these individuals.\nParticipants (N=132) were drawn from a sample of patients evaluated at the emergency room of an urban psychiatric hospital. Patients actuarially classified as being at high risk for violence were eligible for participation in the study. Participants and collateral informants were interviewed weekly for 26 weeks following an acute psychiatric evaluation. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory. Measures of symptom fluctuation and regulation were derived using dynamical systems models. Involvement in violence was assessed using self, informant, and official reports.\nIndividuals' symptom dynamics were recovered by a linear oscillator model that described how quickly symptoms oscillated and whether symptoms were amplifying or moving back toward equilibrium across time. Patterns of rapid symptom fluctuation and symptom amplification were concurrently associated with violence.\nPsychiatric researchers and clinicians have long been interested in adopting more dynamic approaches to understanding symptom change. This study is the first to demonstrate that systematic fluctuations in symptom patterns may be captured by dynamic models. Moreover, the concurrent association between symptom dynamics and violence suggests avenues for future research to test how features of symptom fluctuation could affect behavior."}, {"Title": "Physician suicide in Taiwan, 2000-2008: preliminary findings.", "Abstract": "Research regarding physician suicide in Taiwan is lacking. Using national physician insurance data from January 1, 2000 to April 30, 2008, the present study aimed to explore the association between physicians' suicide and their characteristics, including age, sex, specialties, area of residence, hospital types, and suicide methods. The majority (53.1-70.6%) of suicide cases occurred among physicians in their 40s. More suicides were reported among physicians serving in the community, living in urban areas, and from specialties such as general practice, family practice, psychiatry, and surgery. The leading suicide methods were hanging/suffocation, drowning, jumping from heights, charcoal burning and drug poisoning. In conclusion, physicians committing suicide were likely to be in their 40s, to serve in the community and to live in urban areas. Future efforts should focus on exploring the causes and possible interventions for physician suicide."}, {"Title": "An historical framework for psychiatric nosology.", "Abstract": "This essay, which seeks to provide an historical framework for our efforts to develop a scientific psychiatric nosology, begins by reviewing the classificatory approaches that arose in the early history of biological taxonomy. Initial attempts at species definition used top-down approaches advocated by experts and based on a few essential features of the organism chosen a priori. This approach was subsequently rejected on both conceptual and practical grounds and replaced by bottom-up approaches making use of a much wider array of features. Multiple parallels exist between the beginnings of biological taxonomy and psychiatric nosology. Like biological taxonomy, psychiatric nosology largely began with 'expert' classifications, typically influenced by a few essential features, articulated by one or more great 19th-century diagnosticians. Like biology, psychiatry is struggling toward more soundly based bottom-up approaches using diverse illness characteristics. The underemphasized historically contingent nature of our current psychiatric classification is illustrated by recounting the history of how 'Schneiderian' symptoms of schizophrenia entered into DSM-III. Given these historical contingencies, it is vital that our psychiatric nosologic enterprise be cumulative. This can be best achieved through a process of epistemic iteration. If we can develop a stable consensus in our theoretical orientation toward psychiatric illness, we can apply this approach, which has one crucial virtue. Regardless of the starting point, if each iteration (or revision) improves the performance of the nosology, the eventual success of the nosologic process, to optimally reflect the complex reality of psychiatric illness, is assured."}, {"Title": "Cardiac monitoring for cholinesterase inhibitors: a survey.", "Abstract": "There is no consensus on the monitoring for rare but potentially serious cardiac adverse events associated with cholinesterase inhibitor drugs in the treatment of dementia. Different protocols have been proposed, with and without ECG examination. We surveyed an urban old age psychiatry service to investigate the variables that may influence the implementation of such protocols.\nCase notes of 45 consecutive patients assessed for dementia were scrutinized, to establish how many underwent an ECG or other cardiac examination prior to drug treatments. Data were collected on demographics, medical conditions and drug treatments. Patient files were searched for indications of investigations and any outcomes.\nHalf of all patients treated with a cholinesterase inhibitor (11/22) had an ECG before treatment. In five cases no pulse or cardiac symptoms were recorded in the absence of an ECG. Medical history, findings on examination, seniority of the clinician, and patient cooperation all may have influenced whether patients had an ECG. In three cases treatment was not prescribed due to concerns over cardiac effects, and with five ECGs new diagnoses were made. A protocol based on pulse monitoring would only have indicated ECGs in two out of 22 cases.\nSeveral factors may influence decisions on cardiac monitoring. Fewer ECGs could be done if only pulse and cardiac symptoms were monitored before cholinesterase inhibitor prescription, but new cardiac diagnoses might then be missed. Protocols can be devised to incorporate both cardiac investigation and cholinesterase inhibitor monitoring."}, {"Title": "Ten years of cholinesterase inhibitors.", "Abstract": "In this editorial we have summarised ten years of evidence relating to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's and other dementias.

We also briefly outline recent political and legal events surrounding the 2007 NICE guidance and the possible long-term impact of cholinesterase inhibitors on clinical practice. Whilst cholinesterase inhibitors continue to play a part in the management of Alzheimer's disease, it is possible that their most important legacy will be their contribution to the increased awareness and recognition of dementia as a neurodegenerative disease and the resulting transformation of old age psychiatry services."}, {"Title": "Cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists as potential pharmacotherapies for drug abuse disorders.", "Abstract": "Since the discovery of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) in 1988, and subsequently of the CB2 receptor (CB2R) in 1993, there has been an exponential growth of research investigating the functions of the endocannabinoid system. The roles of CB1Rs have been of particular interest to psychiatry because of their selective presence within the CNS and because of their association with brain-reward circuits involving mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems. One potential role that has become of considerable focus is the ability of CB1Rs to modulate the effects of the drugs of abuse. Many drugs of abuse elevate dopamine levels, and the ability of CB1R antagonists or inverse agonists to modulate these elevations has suggested their potential application as pharmacotherapies for treating drug abuse disorders. With the identification of the selective CB1R antagonist, rimonabant, in 1994, and subsequently of other CB1R antagonists, there has been a rapid expansion of research investigating their ability to modulate the effects of the drugs of abuse. This review highlights some of the preclinical and clinical studies that have examined the effects of CB1R antagonists under conditions potentially predictive of their therapeutic efficacy as treatments for drug abuse disorders."}, {"Title": "Weight gain and metabolic abnormalities during extended risperidone treatment in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of clinical and laboratory metabolic abnormalities during long-term risperidone treatment in children and adolescents.\nMedically healthy 7- to 17-year-old children chronically treated, in a naturalistic setting, with risperidone were recruited through child psychiatry clinics. Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted. Developmental and medication histories were obtained from medical records.\nIn 99 patients treated with risperidone for an average of 2.9 years, a significant increase in age- and gender-adjusted weight and body mass index (BMI) (i.e., z-scores) was observed. Concomitant treatment with psychostimulants did not attenuate this weight gain. Risperidone-associated weight gain was negatively correlated with the BMI z-score obtained at the onset of risperidone treatment. Compared to lean children, overweight and obese children had higher odds of metabolic abnormalities, including increased waist circumference, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). They also tended to have a higher insulin level and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. As a result, upon recruitment in the study, children with excessive weight were 12 times more likely to have at least one laboratory metabolic abnormality and seven times more likely to have at least one criterion of the metabolic syndrome compared to lean subjects. In contrast to excessive weight status, gaining > or =0.5 BMI z-score point during risperidone treatment was not associated with a significantly higher occurrence of metabolic disturbances.\nThe long-term use of risperidone, especially when weight is above normal, is associated with a number of metabolic abnormalities but a low prevalence of the metabolic syndrome phenotype. Future studies should evaluate the stability of these abnormalities over time."}, {"Title": "Pain-related anxiety and anxiety sensitivity across anxiety and depressive disorders.", "Abstract": "Fear-anxiety-avoidance models posit pain-related anxiety and anxiety sensitivity as important contributing variables in the development and maintenance of chronic musculoskeletal pain [Asmundson, G.

This is particularly problematic, considering the desire of mental health professionals to attain the goal of a restraint-free environment. Respecting the inherent worth, dignity, and autonomy of the patient is necessary if a therapeutic outcome is to be achieved; however, protecting the safety of the patient, other patients, and the caregivers is of no less importance, yet this responsibility also carries with it legal and ethical implications. Balancing these two responsibilities can be realized even in a situation where supportive therapeutic interventions have been ineffective in de-escalation of an aggressive patient.

The selection of doses in paediatric psychiatric patients requires a consideration of pharmacokinetic parameters and the development of central nervous system, and warrants specific studies in children and adolescents. Because these are lacking for most of the psychotropic drugs applied in the Child and Adolescent and Psychiatry, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a valid tool to optimise pharmacotherapy and to enable to adjust the dosage of drugs according to the characteristics of the individual patient. Multi-centre TDM studies enable the identification of age- and development-dependent therapeutic ranges of blood concentrations and facilitate a highly qualified standardized documentation in the child and adolescent health care system. In addition, they will provide data for future research on psychopharmacological treatment in children and adolescents, as a baseline for example for clinically relevant interactions with various co-medications.

The prefrontal cortex figures prominently in several wisdom subcomponents (eg, emotional regulation, decision making, value relativism), primarily via top-down regulation of limbic and striatal regions. The lateral prefrontal cortex facilitates calculated, reason-based decision making, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in emotional valence and prosocial attitudes/behaviors. Reward neurocircuitry (ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens) also appears important for promoting prosocial attitudes/behaviors. Monoaminergic activity (especially dopaminergic and serotonergic), influenced by several genetic polymorphisms, is critical to certain subcomponents of wisdom such as emotional regulation (including impulse control), decision making, and prosocial behaviors.\nWe have proposed a speculative model of the neurobiology of wisdom involving frontostriatal and frontolimbic circuits and monoaminergic pathways.

Gerontologically, these diseases should be considered as geriatric syndrome. For the differentiation between depression and that associated with Alzheimer's disease, radiological examinations such as single photon emission CT and psychological examinations using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Vitality Index are useful. Against depressive state with Alzheimer's disease, in addition to donepezil hydrochloride, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are effective, and a small dose of sulpiride is also expected to be effective. In the treatment of elderly depression, its stage should be classified as acute or chronic. Treatment in the acute stage is similar to that in other age groups. In the chronic stage, activation treatment focusing on the prevention of functional decreases is necessary. For both depression and dementia, care and support for daily life are indispensable."}, {"Title": "The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the biological treatment of bipolar disorders: update 2009 on the treatment of acute mania.", "Abstract": "These updated guidelines are based on a first edition that was published in 2003, and have been edited and updated with the available scientific evidence until end of 2008.

This study presents the results of a randomized clinical trial aimed at the prevention of depression in nursing home residents. Residents were screened with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and a diagnostic interview. Those with elevated GDS scores who did not meet diagnostic criteria for depression were randomly assigned to a treatment or control (treatment as usual, TAU) condition. The treatment was an adaptation of the Coping with Stress program developed by Clarke et al. (1995; Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 34, 312-321), and focused on various components typical of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) programs (e.g. increasing pleasant events, reducing negative cognitions). Both groups were assessed on measures of depression before treatment, after treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up points. Compared with the TAU group, residents receiving the intervention showed considerable improvement over the 6-month follow-up on the GDS. Average scores on the GDS, for example, went from 14.0 to 9.4 in the CBT group over the course of treatment and follow-up, vs. scores from 13.4 to 12.3 for the TAU group over the same time. However, results on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at 3 months were nonsignificant. Overall, the results of this study suggest that a brief, group-based CBT program can have significant benefit in nursing home residents at risk for depression."}, {"Title": "[Intensity of limb pain and fatigue in fibromyalgia syndrome, depressive disorders and chronic back pain.

FMS patients scored higher in the subscales \"heart problems\" and \"dyspepsia\", but both subscales did not contribute to a differentiation of the samples. The rates of reclassification of the subsamples based on the subscales \"limb pains\" and \"fatigue\" ranged between 80 and 93%.\nHigh levels of the intensity of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and chronic fatigue may form the basis of a symptom-based diagnosis of FMS."}, {"Title": "Neurofunctional view of psychiatry: clinical brain imaging revisited.", "Abstract": "Despite an exponential increase in the use of brain imaging in neuroscience, it has as yet hardly been integrated into clinical psychiatry. Our aim is to examine the potentials and perspectives of functional brain imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.\nThis review focuses on functional MRI in probing neural activation and on diffusion tensor imaging in delineating functionally related fibre-track organization. As a case study, it examines the state-of-the-art in applying these methods in schizophrenia by referring to several hurdles in the common clinical practice of psychiatry. First, we evaluate the ability of functional brain imaging to target various neuropathological mechanisms such as neurodegeneration, disrupted development and dysconnection. Then we discuss the use of brain-imaging genomics in identifying disease-specific genetic-based neuroendophenotypes. Lastly, we describe the current effort in using brain imaging to designate the most effective and least adverse treatment for patients with schizophrenia.\nBy examining the use of advanced MRI techniques in schizophrenia, we show both the remarkable variety of functional inferences, as well as their possible implications in clinical psychiatry. We advocate the need for extending the view on neuropathology from region-based to network-based, for integrating neurogenomic features as biological markers for illness definition and for relying on neural parameters to guide effective individual treatment."}, {"Title": "Unpromising configurations: towards local historical geographies of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper introduces a theme section comprising of three other papers, written from cross-disciplinary perspectives, exploring what might be termed 'local historical geographies of psychiatry', and in particular demonstrating how pioneering innovations in the treatment of mental health problems sometimes emerge from the most 'unpromising' of spaces and places.

A perspective of the Heidelberg school (1913-2008)].", "Abstract": "The accomplishments of Heidelberg psychopathology and their continued development are illustrated using the example of the concept of psychosis. Jaspers founded the Heidelberg school by methodologically collating the psychiatric knowledge of his time in a structured fashion and in doing so laid the foundation for modern nosology. While, however, ICD and DSM classifications tend to be modelled on symptoms of expression and behaviour, the phenomenological models which Jaspers introduced into the field of psychiatry rather focused on symptoms of subjective experience. The phenomenological developments of psychopathology which originated in this context are, in the case of the schizophrenic psychoses, presented in a kaleidoscope-like manner. It becomes evident that a legacy-oriented, phenomenological search for specific symptoms is of continued relevance. This historical wealth of knowledge and the clinical exploration of phenomena continue to represent sources of impetus and momentum for the field of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Disruptive insights in psychiatry: transforming a clinical discipline.", "Abstract": "Mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and depression have become the predominant chronic diseases of young people, accounting for approximately 40% of the medical burden for people aged 15-44 in the United States and Canada.

This investigation assessed the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S) for the detection of cognitive impairment in BD.\nAfter short training, psychiatrists at 40 outpatient clinics administered the SCIP three times over two weeks to a total of 76 consecutive type I BD admissions. Experienced psychologists also administered a comprehensive battery of standard neuropsychological instruments to clinical sample and 45 healthy control subjects.\nFeasibility was supported by a brief administration time (approximately 15 minutes) and minimal scoring errors. The reliability of the SCIP was confirmed by good equivalence of forms, acceptable stability (ICC range 0.59 to 0.87) and adequate internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha of 0.74). Construct validity was granted by extraction of a single factor (accounting 52% of the variance), acceptable correlations with conventional neuropsychological instruments, and a clear differentiation between bipolar I and normal samples. Efficiency was also provided by the adequate sensitivity and specificity.\nThe sample size is not very large. The SCIP and the neurocognitive battery do not cover all potentially relevant cognitive domains. Also, sensitivity to change remains unexplored.\nWith minimal training, physicians obtained a reliable and valid estimate of cognitive impairment in approximately 15 minutes from an application of the SCIP to type I BD patients."}, {"Title": "Empirical ethics as dialogical practice.", "Abstract": "In this article, we present a dialogical approach to empirical ethics, based upon hermeneutic ethics and responsive evaluation. Hermeneutic ethics regards experience as the concrete source of moral wisdom. In order to gain a good understanding of moral issues, concrete detailed experiences and perspectives need to be exchanged. Within hermeneutic ethics dialogue is seen as a vehicle for moral learning and developing normative conclusions. Dialogue stands for a specific view on moral epistemology and methodological criteria for moral inquiry. Responsive evaluation involves a structured way of setting up dialogical learning processes, by eliciting stories of participants, exchanging experiences in (homogeneous and heterogeneous) groups and drawing normative conclusions for practice. By combining these traditions we develop both a theoretical and a practical approach to empirical ethics, in which ethical issues are addressed and shaped together with stakeholders in practice. Stakeholders' experiences are not only used as a source for reflection by the ethicist; stakeholders are involved in the process of reflection and analysis, which takes place in a dialogue between participants in practice, facilitated by the ethicist. This dialogical approach to empirical ethics may give rise to questions such as: What contribution does the ethicist make? What role does ethical theory play? What is the relationship between empirical research and ethical theory in the dialogical process? In this article, these questions will be addressed by reflecting upon a project in empirical ethics that was set up in a dialogical way. The aim of this project was to develop and implement normative guidelines with and within practice, in order to improve the practice concerning coercion and compulsion in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Why psychiatry can't afford to be neurophobic.", "Abstract": "The original vision of psychiatry was as a medicine - or physic - of the mind.

The Social Distance Scale-Japanese version was used to measure social distance from schizophrenia subjects in Japan. This scale consists of eight questions graded using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3 points), with higher scores representing increased social distance. A translation of the SDSJ into Chinese was used to assess social distance in China. The Knowledge of Illness and Drugs Inventory was used to determine participant knowledge of mental illness and its treatment (medication) through 20 questions (responses are graded as correct or incorrect, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge). A Chinese version of this questionnaire was also created.\nTotal scores of both scales were significantly higher in Japanese subjects than in Chinese subjects.\nSocial distance associated with schizophrenia is large in both Beijing and Fukuoka, but the features of social distance differ between countries. It is important to determine the features of stigma associated with schizophrenia and develop anti-stigma programs based on trans-cultural considerations."}, {"Title": "The challenge of interdisciplinary collaboration in acute psychiatry: Impacts on the occupational milieu.", "Abstract": "This paper, based on a larger ethnographic exploration of the acute inpatient environment for older people with mental illness, describes and provides interpretations of staff perceptions and actions in order to highlight tensions between professional groups which adversely affect opportunities for patients to engage in meaningful occupations.

AD were diagnosed according to the new stress-response-model of AD (Maercker et al. in Psychopathology 40(3):135-146, 2007).\nData from 3048 persons from four different refugee settings in Ethiopia, Algeria, Gaza, and Cambodia were reanalyzed. Life events were assessed by an adapted version of the Life Events and Social History Interview (Mollica et al. in Am J Psychiatry 144:1567-1572, 1987). The current study focuses on non-directly life threatening events related to AD (e.g. loss of property) in contrast to life-threatening events related to Posttraumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). AD Symptom measures were obtained from available psychopathology assessments: composite international diagnostic interview (WHO in CIDI, Geneva, 1997) and structured interview for disorders of extreme stress (Pelcovitz et al. J Trauma Stress 10:3-16, 1997).\nThe majority of the subjects had experienced one or more AD-related life event. Most common AD-related life events varied across the four sites with bad shelter conditions most prevalent in Ethiopia (100%) and Gaza (32%), forced social isolation in Algeria (61%), and lack of food in Cambodia (41%). Prevalences of AD diagnoses ranged from 6% (Ethiopia) to 40% (Algeria). The highest rates of comorbidity were between AD and PTSD, followed by anxiety disorders.\nThe present study shows that the new concept of AD can be of use for psychiatric epidemiology, e.g., in migration contexts. The high-comorbidity rates could indicate that AD and PTSD are parts of a stress response spectrum."}, {"Title": "Variation in P2RX7 candidate gene (rs2230912) is not associated with bipolar I disorder and unipolar major depression in four European samples.", "Abstract": "Two recent studies reported evidence for association between genetic variation of the positional candidate gene P2RX7 on chromosome 12q24 and bipolar I disorder (BPI) [Barden et al.

Strong genetic associations have been reported at common polymorphisms within ANK3 and CACNA1C in bipolar disorder and ZNF804A in schizophrenia and a relatively specific association between common variation in GABA(A) receptor genes and cases with features of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Further, the occurrence of rare copy number variants (CNVs) has been shown to be increased in schizophrenia compared with controls. These emerging data provide a powerful resource for exploring the relationship between psychiatric phenotypes and can, and should, be used to inform conceptualization, classification, and diagnosis in psychiatry. It is already clear that, in general, genetic associations are not specific to one of the traditional diagnostic categories. For example, variation at ZNF804A is associated with risk of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and some rare CNVs are associated with risk of autism and epilepsy as well as schizophrenia. These data are not consistent with a simple dichotomous model of functional psychosis and indicate the urgent need for moves toward approaches that (a) better represent the range of phenotypic variation seen in the clinical population and (b) reflect the underlying biological variation that gives rise to the phenotypes. We consider the implications for models of psychosis and the importance of recognizing and studying illness that has prominent affective and psychotic features. We conclude that if psychiatry is to translate the opportunities offered by new research methodologies, we must finally abandon a 19th-century dichotomy and move to a classificatory approach that is worthy of the 21st century."}, {"Title": "Abnormal pitch mismatch negativity in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder.", "Abstract": "The goal of the study was to examine mismatch negativity (MMN) in schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) individuals.

For example, healthy participants perceive a hollow mask as a normal face, presumably due to the strength of constraining top-down influences, while patients with schizophrenia do not (Schneider, U., Leweke, F.M., Sternemann, U., Weber, M.M., Emrich, H.M., 1996.

However the neural mechanisms underpinning this effect remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the hollow-mask illusion in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The primary aim of this study was to use measures of effective connectivity arising from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to explain differences in both the perception of the hollow-mask illusion and associated differences in neural responses between patients with schizophrenia and controls, which we hypothesised would be associated with difference in the influences of top-down and bottom-up processes between the groups. Consistent with this explanation, we identified differences between the two groups in effective connectivity. In particular, there was a strengthening of bottom-up processes, and weakening of top-down ones, during the presentation of 'hollow' faces for the patients. In contrast, the controls exhibited a strengthening of top-down processes when perceiving the same stimuli. These findings suggest that schizophrenic patients rely on stimulus-driven processing and are less able to employ conceptually-driven top-down strategies during perception, where incoming sensory data are constrained with reference to a generative model that entails stored information from past experience."}, {"Title": "Influence of education and depressive symptoms on cognitive function in the elderly.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence that education and depression have on the performance of elderly people in neuropsychological tests.\nThe study was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo School of Medicine, Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas.

Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point."}, {"Title": "Epilepsy, psychiatry, and neurology.", "Abstract": "This article reviews the relationship between the psychiatry and neurology of epilepsy, especially in the last 100 years. Throughout most of its recorded history of 3 to 4 millennia epilepsy has been viewed as a supernatural or mental disorder. Although first suggested by Hippocrates in the 5th century B.C., the concept of epilepsy as a brain disorder only began to take root in the 17th and 18th centuries. The discipline of neurology emerged from \"nervous disorders\" or neuropsychiatry in the late 19th century, when vascular theories of epilepsy predominated. By the turn of the 19th century psychiatry and neurology were diverging and epilepsy remained to some extent in both disciplines. It was only in the middle of the 20th century with the development of electromagnetic theories of epilepsy that the concept of epilepsy per se as a neurological disorder was finally adopted in international classifications of disease. This was associated with a refined definition of the ictal, pre-, post-, and interictal psychological disorders of epilepsy, which have contributed to a renaissance of neuropsychiatry. At the beginning of the 21st century and the centenary of the ILAE psychiatry and neurology have been converging again, led in some respects by epilepsy, which has provided several useful models of mental illness and a bridge between the two disciplines."}, {"Title": "Weight effects associated with antipsychotics: a comprehensive database analysis.", "Abstract": "Available data on atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain are limited by a number of methodological factors.

In contrast, significantly greater weight gain incidence was observed for the olanzapine (57%) and risperidone (39%) groups compared to placebo. Median weight change of +0.49, -0.18, +1.50 and +0.55 lb/month was observed for haloperidol, ziprasidone, olanzapine and risperidone subjects, respectively, indicating differential weight change patterns compared to placebo (-0.32). Similar results were observed for the short-term (4-12 weeks) and 6-month treatment exposure cohorts.\nOur results confirm significant differences in long-term weight effects among atypical antipsychotics, consistent with findings from prior meta-analysis of antipsychotic-induced weight gain [Allison, D.B., Mentore, J.L., Heo, M., Chandler, L.P., Capelleri, J.C., Infante, M.C., Weiden, P.J., 1999.

At the time, CAPTN was believed to be both a highly innovative undertaking and a highly speculative one. One reviewer even suggested that CAPTN was \"unlikely to succeed, but would be a valuable learning experience for the field.\"\nTo describe valuable lessons learned in building a clinical research network in pediatric psychiatry, including innovations intended to decrease barriers to research participation.\nThe CAPTN Team has completed construction of the CAPTN network infrastructure, conducted a large, multi-center psychometric study of a novel adverse event reporting tool, and initiated a large antidepressant safety registry and linked pharmacogenomic study focused on severe adverse events. Specific challenges overcome included establishing structures for network organization and governance; recruiting over 150 active CAPTN participants and 15 child psychiatry training programs; developing and implementing procedures for site contracts, regulatory compliance, indemnification and malpractice coverage, human subjects protection training and IRB approval; and constructing an innovative electronic casa report form (eCRF) running on a web-based electronic data capture system; and, finally, establishing procedures for audit trail oversight requirements put forward by, among others, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nGiven stable funding for network construction and maintenance, our experience demonstrates that judicious use of web-based technologies for profiling investigators, investigator training, and capturing clinical trials data, when coupled to innovative approaches to network governance, data management and site management, can reduce the costs and burden and improve the feasibility of incorporating clinical research into routine clinical practice. Having successfully achieved its initial aim of constructing a network infrastructure, CAPTN is now a capable platform for large safety registries, pharmacogenetic studies, and randomized practical clinical trials in pediatric psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Cytochrome P450 2D6 genotyping: potential role in improving treatment outcomes in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The specific reaction toward a given drug varies a lot between individuals and, for many drugs, pharmacogenetic polymorphisms are known to affect biotransformation and clinical outcome. Estimation of the individual's drug-metabolizing capacity can be undertaken by genotyping drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the respective drug metabolism. Consequences that arise from genotyping may be the adjustment of dose according to genotype, choice of therapeutic strategy, or even choice of drug. One of the first fields where the clinical application of pharmacogenetics may be used is in that of antipsychotic and antidepressant drug treatment because there is a special need for individualized therapy in psychiatry. The pharmacokinetics of many TCAs, some SSRIs and other antidepressant drugs is significantly altered by polymorphisms; however, some controversy still exists as to whether therapeutic efficacy may be improved and/or adverse events can be prevented by genetically driven adjustment of drug dosage. Pharmacogenetic diagnostics may be an important factor in individualizing drug treatment according to the genetic make-up of the patients. However, routine application of pharmacogenetic dose adjustment in clinical practice requires prospective validation."}, {"Title": "Brain lesions and their implications in criminal responsibility.", "Abstract": "For over 200 years, Western courts have considered pleas of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" (NGRI) for defendants in possession of a mental defect rendering them unable to understand the wrongfulness of their act. Until recently, determining the mental state of a defendant has fallen largely upon the shoulders of court psychologists and experts in psychiatry for qualitative assessments related to NGRI pleas and mitigation at sentencing. However, advances in neuroscience--particularly neurological scanning techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), computed tomography scanning (CT), and positron emission tomography scanning (PET)--may provide additional, pertinent biological evidence as to whether an organically based mental defect exists. With increasing frequency, criminal defense attorneys are integrating neuroimaging data into hearings related to determinations of guilt and sentencing mitigation. This is of concern, since not all brain lesions and abnormalities indicate a compromised mental state that is relevant to knowing whether the act was wrong at the time of commission, and juries may be swayed by neuroscientific evidence that is not relevant to the determination of the legal question before them. This review discusses historical and modern cases involving the intersection of brain lesions and criminality, neuroscientific perspectives of how particular types of lesions may contribute to a legally relevant mental defect, and how such evidence might best be integrated into a criminal trial."}, {"Title": "Hidden in plain sight: the formal, informal, and hidden curricula of a psychiatry clerkship.", "Abstract": "To examine perceptions of the formal, informal, and hidden curricula in psychiatry as they are observed and experienced by (1) attending physicians who have teaching responsibilities for residents and medical students, (2) residents who are taught by those same physicians and who have teaching responsibilities for medical students, and (3) medical students who are taught by attendings and residents during their psychiatry rotation.\nFrom June to November 2007, the authors conducted focus groups with attendings, residents, and students in one midwestern academic setting. The sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed for themes surrounding the formal, informal, and hidden curricula.\nAll three groups offered a similar belief that the knowledge, skills, and values of the formal curriculum focused on building relationships. Similarly, all three suggested that elements of the informal and hidden curricula were expressed primarily as the values arising from attendings' role modeling, as the nature and amount of time attendings spend with patients, and as attendings' advice arising from experience and intuition versus \"textbook learning.\" Whereas students and residents offered negative values arising from the informal and hidden curricula, attendings did not, offering instead the more positive values they intended to encourage through the informal and hidden curricula.\nThe process described here has great potential in local settings across all disciplines.

Its core mission is to prevent and alleviate the distress and impairment caused by these disorders, which account for a substantial part of the global burden of illness-related disability. Psychiatry is grounded in clinical neuroscience. Its core mission, now and in the future, is best served within this context because advances in assessment, treatment, and prevention of brain disorders are likely to originate from studies of etiology and pathophysiology based in clinical and translational neuroscience. To ensure its broad public health relevance in the future, psychiatry must also bridge science and service, ensuring that those who need the benefits of its science are also its beneficiaries. To do so effectively, psychiatry as clinical neuroscience must strengthen its partnerships with the disciplines of public health (including epidemiology), community and behavioral health science, and health economics.The authors present a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis of psychiatry and identify strategies for strengthening its future and increasing its relevance to public health and the rest of medicine. These strategies encompass new approaches to strengthening the relationship between psychiatry and neurology, financing psychiatry's mission, emphasizing early and sustained multidisciplinary training (research and clinical), bolstering the academic infrastructure, and reorganizing and refinancing mental health services both for preventive intervention and cost-effective chronic disease management."}, {"Title": "The once and future psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry's traditional strengths have lain in an appreciation of the philosophy and psychology of treatment rather than in an ability to advance the public health through the mass delivery of treatment programs. Given how insecurely established treatment effects are for current interventions, and the capacity for developments in neuroscience to create markets rather than to advance understanding, it seems important to maintain traditional strengths. To have a clinical evidence base, consistent with a wider public health mission, psychiatry would need to track more rigorously the effects of the treatments it now administers before advocating for an even wider distribution of even more interventions with physical treatments than happens at present."}, {"Title": "Stigma, conscience, and science in psychiatry: past, present, and future.", "Abstract": "In his response to Reynolds and colleagues' \"The Future of Psychiatry as Clinical Neuroscience,\" the author considers three themes prominent in the history of psychiatry: stigma, conscience, and science, considering each in the past, present, and into the future. A series of conclusions follow these historical perspectives. One, unraveling the web of stigma in the future depends more on moral, educational, and political achievements than neuroscientific ones. Two, psychiatry's future depends upon the public trust, which has fluctuated over its history and into the present era, during which legacies of undue influence and failed regulation have damaged this trust. While explaining the mechanisms for mental disorders is crucial, the returns from these scientific investments are decades away, and failures of conscience today undermine the vital public trust and impede psychiatry's abilities to immediately address the plight of the mentally ill. Three, the researcher-entrepreneur in perennial search of funding has replaced the old model of the curious researcher-practitioner. This drive for funding promotes hubris and failures of conscience in psychiatric science. Moreover, the information explosion and superspecialization of contemporary academic medicine has led to an intellectual fragmentation analogous to the service fragmentation at the beginnings of psychiatry. Attention to integrative synthesis of research information, as well as conscientious moral reflection on scientific advances, will promote humility over hubris: enhancing the public trust, assuring public confidence in psychiatric science, and empowering patients."}, {"Title": "Notes on the origins of Epilepsia and the International League Against Epilepsy.", "Abstract": "The recent discovery of archival material has shed interesting light on the origins of Epilepsia and also the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The idea of an international journal devoted to epilepsy seems first to have arisen from talks between Dr. L. J. J. Muskens and Dr. W. Aldren Turner in 1905. A protracted series of subsequent letters between Muskens and a Haarlem publisher show how the idea slowly took shape. The committee of patronage, editorial board, and editorial assistants was probably first approached at the First International Congress of Psychiatry, Neurology, Psychology, and Nursing of the Insane, held in Amsterdam in 1907. At this meeting, the concept of an international organization to fight epilepsy (to become the ILAE) was also first proposed in public, again by Muskens. The concept of the ILAE was clearly modeled on another international organization-the International Commission for the Study of the Causes of Mental Diseases and Their Prophylaxis. This Commission had been first publicly proposed in 1906 by Ludwig Frank, at the Second International Congress for the Care and Treatment of the Insane. The proposed Commission and ILAE shared many features, aims, and personnel. Despite an auspicious start, the International Commission was prevented by personal and political differences from ever actually coming into being. However, the first issue of Epilepsia appeared in March 1909 and the ILAE was inaugurated in August 1909; and both have flourished and celebrate their centenaries this year."}, {"Title": "Diagnosis and management of nocturnal enuresis.", "Abstract": "To highlight recent advances in enuresis research.\nMany discoveries have distanced us from the time when bedwetting was considered a psychiatric disorder. Instead, it is now agreed that nocturnal polyuria, detrusor overactivity, and high arousal thresholds are, in various combinations, central to enuresis pathogenesis. All three mechanisms have been further elucidated during the last year. It has been found that solute diuresis, and not just free-water diuresis due to vasopressin deficiency, may be causative. Sonographical bladder wall measurements have been shown to have prognostic value in detrusor-dependent enuresis, and fascinating proof for the interplay between the bladder and the sleeping brain has been put forward. And, ironically, sleep research has caused psychiatry to make a slight comeback, as studies have indicated that enuretic children may suffer from cognitive problems due to suboptimal sleep. Less has been achieved regarding treatment, but some evidence has finally supported the experience that anticholinergics may be effective in therapy-resistant enuresis.\nDuring the last years, increased insight has been gained into the multifaceted pathogenesis of enuresis, but there is still an irritating lack of proven effective therapies."}, {"Title": "An examination of the differential effects of the experience of DSM-IV defined traumatic events and life stressors.", "Abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that individuals exposed to traumatic events report similar, if not lower, levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than individuals exposed to nontraumatic stressful life events [J.

Courts have sought to establish whether a mentally disordered offender's responsibility is reduced by asking whether his disorder caused the crime. Acceptance of this \"causation by mental disorder\" criterion has fluctuated, however. This may be because causal explanations are not the types of explanations we are accustomed to offering for the kinds of acts that bring defendants, and psychiatric witnesses, to court. More often, we offer what philosophers have called \"possibility\" explanations for these acts. The application of psychiatry to possibility explanations has not been widely explored. It offers the potential for the improved use of psychiatric evidence in criminal proceedings."}, {"Title": "Prediction of relapse in melancholic depressive patients in a 2-year follow-up study with corticotropin releasing factor test.", "Abstract": "To study the power of CRF stimulation test to predict relapse in a sample of melancholic depressive patients in depressed phase, followed-up over a two-year period from the moment they achieved complete remission of depressive symptoms.\nFifty-one outpatients diagnosed with unipolar depressive disorder with melancholic features according to DSM-IV were assessed with the CRF test.

In hospitals, such outbursts are a management problem and a diagnostic puzzle. Among 130 4- to 12-year-olds successively admitted to a child psychiatry unit, those having in-hospital outbursts were likely to be younger, have been in special education, have had a preadmission history of outbursts, and to have a longer hospital stay. Three subsets of behaviors, coded as they occurred in 109 outbursts, expressed increasing levels of anger; two other subsets expressed increasing levels of distress. Factor structure, temporal organization, and age trends indicated that outbursts are exacerbations of ordinary childhood tantrums. Diagnostically, children with outbursts were more likely to have language difficulty and a trend toward attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Outbursts of children with anxiety diagnoses showed significantly more distress relative to anger. Outbursts were not especially associated with our small sample of bipolar diagnoses."}, {"Title": "[A nationwide questionnaire survey of medical experts in mental health evaluation].", "Abstract": "A nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted to clarify the current status of medical experts in mental health evaluation and their needs (recovery rate: 66.6%). The data were simply tabulated and then statistically analyzed with respect to past experiences of serving as expert witnesses or judges as defined by the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act and past clinical experience. The results showed that 201 respondents (53.0%) had served as medical experts an average of 2.8 +/- 2.4 times, while 173 respondents (45.6%) had not served as such experts, and that 284 respondents (74.9%) had served as judges an average of 3.0 +/- 2.5 times, while 86 respondents (22.7%) had not served as judges. Although about 70% of the respondents who had served as expert witnesses felt that their experiences were burdensome, mostly due to time-related concerns, most had favorable views of the legal process. More than 70% of the respondents indicated that they would continue to serve as expert witnesses despite their sense of burden, thus suggesting a correlation between a past experience of serving as an expert witness and a willingness to do so again in the future. Furthermore, the results indicate that medical experts in mental health evaluation who have not served as expert witnesses are more hesitant, and since physicians employed at institutions for forensic psychiatric examination are more likely to serve as expert witnesses, a relatively small group of medical experts in mental health evaluation repeatedly serve as expert witnesses. On the other hand, when compared to serving as medical experts, serving as judges was psychologically more stressful for many respondents. Since physicians are not used to being judges, they may experience feelings of resistance or burden. Also, judges are somewhat bound by expert testimony, and the fact that there is no written policy for questioning testimony adds to their stress. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify the positioning of expert evidence and the decisions made by judges. What medical experts in mental health evaluation needed to improve their knowledge varied depending on the type and duration of work and clinical experience. Therefore, it is necessary to provide information matching the experience, skills, and information related to the practical aspect of the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act. Moreover, the results suggest the necessity for medical experts in mental health evaluation to acquire a wide range of expert knowledge in forensic psychiatry beyond that required for the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act."}, {"Title": "Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: does a history of trauma predict less severe suicidal attempts?", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify risk factors and possible predictors of severity of suicidal behavior of children and adolescents.\nSeventy-seven patients (15 boys and 62 girls) aged 15.5+/-1.6 years on average, hospitalized due to a suicidal attempt in the department of pediatric psychiatry, were examined. Structured interviews with patients and their parents were used to clinically assess circumstances of suicidal behavior, relevant risk factors and severity of suicidal behavior.\nThe results indicated that patients with any previous traumatic experience tended to have somatically less severe suicidal attempts (p=0.050). Intensity of suicidal intent was associated with a history of depression (p=0.014) and anxiety disorders (p=0.004), and the current stress from a mental disorder (p=0.014). Somatic severity of suicidal behavior was significantly associated with intensity of suicidal intent (p=0.014). A history of any trauma (previous traumatic experience predicted less severe suicidal behavior, p=0.053) and the current stress from sexual problems (p=0.067) were identified as predictors of somatic severity of suicidality. These two predictors showed only a trend level of significance. The only significant predictor of intensity of suicidal intent was the current stress from a mental illness (p=0.017).\nSeveral risk factors of somatic severity of suicidal behavior and intensity of suicidal intent were described.

We review the field in relation to the new antipsychotics, in particular. Other indications, including mood disorders, which are also briefly touched upon, have so far received less definitive attention, but are likely to encounter the same difficulties. We conclude that, where the results of efficacy trials are positive and an effectiveness trial is negative, one should not necessarily prefer the effectiveness trial - it may simply have failed.

A key component involves central government calculation and funding for psychotropic medication. Based on clinical ethnography of a community psychiatry program in north India, this article traces the biosocial journey of psychotropic pills from the centre to the periphery. As the pill journeys from the Ministry of Health to the clinic, its symbolic meaning transforms from an emphasis on accessibility and participation to the administration of a discrete ;treatment.' Instead of embodying participation and access, the pill achieves the opposite: silencing community voices, re-enforcing existing barriers to care, and relying on pharmacological solutions for psychosocial problems. The symbolic inscription of NMHP policies on the pill fail because they are undercut by more powerful meanings generated from local cultural contexts. An understanding of this process is critical for the development of training and policy that can more effectively address local mental health concerns in rural India."}, {"Title": "From descartes to desipramine: psychopharmacology and the self.", "Abstract": "Despite the remarkably widespread use of the new generation of antidepressants, almost everything we know about their effects comes from animal studies and clinical trials in which the sole parameter of interest is depressive symptomatology. Almost nothing is known about the effects that antidepressants have on cognition, affect, or motivation when used over a period of months or years. Nor do we understand what effects, if any, antidepressants have on what we think of as the self. In this article, we argue that neither psychiatry nor philosophy, in their current state, are well equipped to think about these issues. In order to explore this idea, we consider the neurobiology of romantic love and its relation to antidepressant neurochemistry.

In contemporary psychiatry, data of marginal significance based on rating scale measures are privileged as evidence that treatments are effective, while judgments of drug effects based on clinical practice are downgraded. The dominance of RCTs has also led to an increasing promotion of rating scales in clinical practice, described here as ;rating scale mongering.' The logical consequence of current interpretations of RCT data is that clinicians should adhere to guidelines which are based on a systematic assembly of such data, but the selective publication of trial data and ghostwriting of publications, lays the basis for guideline capture, and a corresponding capture of evidence-based clinical practice by pharmaceutical companies."}, {"Title": "Locked doors in acute inpatient psychiatry: a literature review.", "Abstract": "Many acute inpatient psychiatric wards in the UK are permanently locked, although this is contrary to the current Mental Health Act Code of Practice.

Both staff and patients reported advantages (e.g. preventing illegal substances from entering the ward and preventing patients from absconding and harming themselves or others) and disadvantages (e.g. making patients feel depressed, confined and creating extra work for staff) regarding locked doors. Locked wards were associated with increased patient aggression, poorer satisfaction with treatment and more severe symptoms.

This paper involves an examination of power in the interpersonal relationship between the mental health nurse and the consumer. Issues of power are emphasized by drawing on examples from clinical experiences, each of which is then deconstructed as an analytical means to uncover the different layers of power. This examination highlights the existence of both obscure and seldomly acknowledged invisible manifestations of power that are inherent in psychiatry and interpersonal mental health nursing. It also identifies that there is an orthodoxy of formal mental health care that perhaps is best described as 'biopsychiatry' (or 'traditional psychiatry'). Within this are numerous serious speech acts and these provide the power for mental health practitioners to act in particular ways, to exercise control. The authors challenge this convention as the only viable discourse: a potentially viable alternative to the current of formal mental health care does exist and, most importantly, this alternative is less tied to the use of invisible power."}, {"Title": "An exploratory clinical study of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder from India.", "Abstract": "Although adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well recognized in western countries, there are no reports of adult ADHD from India.

Here, we formalize controllability in terms of characteristics of prior distributions over affectively charged environments. We explore the relevance of this notion of control to reinforcement learning methods of optimising behavior in such environments and consider how apparently maladaptive beliefs can result from normative inference processes.

The aims of this study were (a) to describe the prevalence and the nature of PTSD symptoms among Indian women reporting IPV, (b) to study the relationship between symptoms of PTSD and depression, and (c) to examine the relationship between sexual coercion and PTSD symptoms. Consecutive women (n = 105) presenting to an adult psychiatry outpatient unit of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in South India were recruited. These women were assessed for IPV, sexual coercion, PTSD symptoms, and depression. Fifty-nine women (56%) reported a history of IPV, of whom 41 (70%) also reported sexual coercion. Among women reporting IPV, seven (14%) exceeded cut-off scores for PTSD and twelve (20%) exceeded cut-off scores for sub-threshold PTSD. The majority of those reporting IPV exceeded cut-off scores for a depressive disorder. Compared to women without a history of IPV, women reporting IPV had higher scores on PTSD and depression. Severity of violence and sexual coercion correlated positively (r = 0.39) with PTSD severity. The findings highlight the importance of screening women for IPV and its sequelae, in mental health settings."}, {"Title": "Awareness in nine countries: a public health approach to suicide prevention.", "Abstract": "Suicide is an important public health problem, increasing worldwide, and on a yearly basis accounting for the death of more than one million people, with estimates as high as 10-20 times that many attempting to take their own life. Because successful suicide prevention depends upon recognition of symptoms of mental ill-health, awareness of these signs is a necessary precondition. The ability and responsibility for recognizing signs and symptoms of suicide, until most recently, however, was the exclusive purview of mental health professionals. Lately, there have been efforts to screen high risk populations and to train others to effectively respond to suicidal behavior, including classic first responders, primary care providers, hot line operators, teachers, etc. But what about everyone else who may have an opportunity to prevent a suicide simply by knowing when to ask questions, what to listen for, and understanding when additional assistance is warranted? What about the suicidal person who wants to tell someone about their distress but \"knows\" that such a conversation will not help nor be well-received? Where does a person living where mental health services are lacking or are beyond one's financial means turn to for relief and assistance? Does not Public Health have something to offer in response to these pressing questions? In 2002-2005, a study was carried out in nine countries, distributed over five continents, under the auspices and support of the Presidential Commission of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP), to test the feasibility and effectiveness of raising awareness and increasing knowledge about child mental health, including suicidality, among students, teachers and parents.

Subthalamic DBS for Parkinson's disease has received the most empirical attention and may entail cognitive and psychiatric adverse events in approximately 10% of patients. This article reviews the cognitive alterations after thalamic, pallidal, and subthalamic DBS for movement disorders (including, Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia) and the possible etiology and mechanisms underlying neurobehavioral changes. Initial studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of DBS for emerging indications such as epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, Tourette's syndrome, and persistent vegetative or minimally conscious state are also reviewed. DBS for currently accepted indications appears safe from a cognitive standpoint in that the procedure is associated with typically transient, mild, and circumscribed cognitive alterations (most commonly in verbal fluency), and improved mood state and quality of life. A minority of patients experience more widespread, persistent, or serious cognitive and psychiatric sequelae, although research to date has failed to identify reliable risk factors for such adverse events."}, {"Title": "Effect sizes for growth-modeling analysis for controlled clinical trials in the same metric as for classical analysis.", "Abstract": "The use of growth-modeling analysis (GMA)--including hierarchical linear models, latent growth models, and general estimating equations--to evaluate interventions in psychology, psychiatry, and prevention science has grown rapidly over the last decade. However, an effect size associated with the difference between the trajectories of the intervention and control groups that captures the treatment effect is rarely reported. This article first reviews 2 classes of formulas for effect sizes associated with classical repeated-measures designs that use the standard deviation of either change scores or raw scores for the denominator. It then broadens the scope to subsume GMA and demonstrates that the independent groups, within-subjects, pretest-posttest control-group, and GMA designs all estimate the same effect size when the standard deviation of raw scores is uniformly used. Finally, the article shows that the correct effect size for treatment efficacy in GMA--the difference between the estimated means of the 2 groups at end of study (determined from the coefficient for the slope difference and length of study) divided by the baseline standard deviation--is not reported in clinical trials."}, {"Title": "Proteomic analysis of rat brains following exposure to electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments used in psychiatry to date. The mechanisms of ECT action, however, are the least understood and still unclear. As a tool to elucidate the mechanisms of action of ECT, we employed proteomic analysis based on the identification of differentially expressed proteins after exposure to repeated ECT in rat brains. The expression of proteins was visualized by silver stain after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Of 24 differentially expressed protein spots (p<0.05 by Student t-test), six different proteins from 7 spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight (MALDI-TOF)/mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, there were five dominantly expressed proteins in the ECT-treated rat brain tissues (p<0.05); S100 protein beta chain, 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta, similar to ubiquitin-like 1 (sentrin) activating enzyme subunit 1, suppressor of G2 allele of SKP1 homolog, and phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha.

The effects of psychopharmacotherapy result from highly complex interactions between mental health medications and the patient who takes them as well as from the context in which treatment occurs. A high level of care and caution is necessary during the whole course of psychopharmacotherapy to recognize any side effect and respond promptly and specifically.

In spite of that, forensic psychiatry has several goals shared across countries, principally: assurance of treatment for severely mentally ill people who become delinquent; giving evidence to courts in cases when the offender's mental responsibility is in question; working effectively at the interface of the law and psychiatry, and, in so doing, working well with other clinical and non-clinical professionals in the field; preventing relapse of offenders with mental disorder. In order to achieve these goals, special knowledge and skills must be developed, especially in assessment and management of violence and sexual deviance and of the risk of these behaviours, incorporating techniques developed in neighbouring disciplines. One of the greatest challenges in the development of forensic psychiatry lies in its relationship with general psychiatry. It is arguable that the specialization of psychiatry into sub-specialties has lead to loss of some skills in general psychiatry and to a 'forensification' of people who would previously have been treated as general psychiatry patients.\nIn partnership, however, general and forensic psychiatrists could potentially achieve more than either group on its own: they could better prevent people with mental illness from becoming offenders; prevent people with mental illness from becoming victims of crime; intervene in the vicious circle from victim to perpetrator; assess young people at risk for antisocial behaviour and protect them from becoming criminals. Clinical research on these topics is just beginning and this article argues for a close integration of forensic psychiatry into the wider mental health system and for a more intensive exchange of knowledge and skills from forensic psychiatry to general psychiatry and vice versa."}, {"Title": "[The role of the auxiliary ego in the care of the chronic pain patient].", "Abstract": "The management of the patient suffering from chronic pain, situated on the interface between body and psyche, necessitates a global approach and often a coordinated, stable and containing network of care.

The historical development and conceptual framework of the auxiliary ego are utilized to highlight its roles in the different aspects of care of these patients:in the medical consultation, individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy and in the interdisciplinary meetings."}, {"Title": "[Increased referral to psychiatric hospitalization: a challenge for better mental health policies].", "Abstract": "This paper aims at investigating causes and potential remedies of increased psychiatric hospitalization in this country. The data suggest that there was growing pressure on psychiatric hospitals from 1950 to 2000. This may result from inappropriate management of a new type of acute psychiatric patient rather than severed epidemiology of acute psychiatric disorders. More focus on innovative crisis intervention programs emphasizing the central role of the general hospital in contemporary psychiatry may strongly contribute to better mental care. Despite significant advances in psychotherapy and medical research such an evolution is contended from the exquisite entropy of psychiatric systems.

Evidence demonstrating that a significant number of adults with BD report symptom onset before age 19 has led to an explosion in the recognition of childhood BD over the past decade. Because children and adolescents, including preschoolers, are being diagnosed with BD in rapidly increasing numbers, the criteria for mania are being adjusted in children and adolescents to accommodate various presentations of emotional dysregulation into the paradigm of BD. Still, it has yet to be seen whether these presentations will develop in adulthood into what we have traditionally considered to be BD. This blurring of the diagnostic lines has led to significant controversy in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry.

But the cooperation of the patients necessary for the registration limits its application in the neuro-psychiatry.\nEEG difference spectra on counting (EDSC)--was developed to detect the effect of a short calculation task on the spectral EEG. The originality of the task situation is a continuous mental work in a very short period of time, while the level of task difficulty is adapted to the patient's actual mental capacity. While the rest pre-task and the post task EEG sections were compared, the results show the mental \"EEG fatigability\" caused by the short intensive cognitive activity. The first preliminary results have been demonstrated by a comparative study of two healthy and three patient (probable Alzheimer disease, post-stroke state without mental deficit and mixed type of dementia) groups.\nSimilarly to the findings of other authors, in addition to the differences of the alpha band seen on the temporo-parieto-occipital regions, the frontal localization and the beta band seem to be prominent, too. Demented patients had stronger EEG reactions than post-stroke patients without mental deficits and healthy elder persons had more extensive changes than the younger ones.\nThe test can be considered as indirect marker showing the different mental fatigability in diverse pathological conditions and during the aging process.

In 1982, they proposed the existence of aggregates of multiple receptors in the plasma membrane and coined the term receptor mosaics (RM). In this way, cell signaling becomes a branched process beginning at the level of receptor recognition at the plasma membrane where receptors can directly modify the ligand recognition and signaling capacity of the receptors within a RM. Receptor-receptor interactions in RM are classified as operating either with classical cooperativity, when consisting of homomers or heteromers of similar receptor subtypes having the same transmitter, or non-classical cooperativity, when consisting of heteromers. It has been shown that information processing within a RM depends not only on its receptor composition, but also on the topology and the order of receptor activation determined by the concentrations of the ligands and the receptor properties. The general function of RM has also been demonstrated to depend on allosteric regulators (e.g., homocysteine) of the receptor subtypes present. RM as integrative nodes for receptor-receptor interactions in conjunction with membrane associated proteins may form horizontal molecular networks in the plasma membrane coordinating the activity of multiple effector systems modulating the excitability and gene expression of the cells. The key role of electrostatic epitope-epitope interactions will be discussed for the formation of the RM. These interactions probably represent a general molecular mechanism for receptor-receptor interactions and, without a doubt, indicate a role for phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events in these interactions. The novel therapeutic aspects given by the RMs will be discussed in the frame of molecular neurology and psychiatry and combined drug therapy appears as the future way to go."}, {"Title": "'Splitters and lumpers': Samuel Johnson's tics, gesticulations and reverie revisited.", "Abstract": "Medical diagnosis, even in psychiatry, has been made principally by 'splitters' and 'lumpers': those who separate categories of explanation and those who combine them.

During the 1930s, IQ-testing and segregation of troublesome children from school became an important tool for handling children with mental or behavioural problems. With increasing public attention, child mental health activities grew from the late 1940s, and the first regular therapeutic clinic for children was established in 1947.

When such self-report is questioned, reliance on formalized testing predominates. The situation is less certain, however, when such methods and clinical \"feel\", or intuition, conflict. While many argue for the supremacy of actuarial methods, fields such as Management have increasingly emphasized the importance of intuition; Psychiatry, although with few objective tests and reliance on the clinical encounter, offers surprisingly few answers. We explore here the use of intuition in decision-making through a case example and suggest that it is not inferior to other diagnostic methods: intuition should be used to suggest, guide, and modify psychiatric diagnosis.

I focus on the role of the managerial function known as channel marketing, the task of which is to minimize friction, achieve coordination and add value in the distribution of the company's products. However, the path to achieving these objectives is challenged because members of the marketing channel, or intermediaries, may not be contractual members of the channel; in fact they may have widely divergent goals or may even be hostile to the manufacturer's efforts at control. This can be construed to be the case for physicians and others who are in the pharmaceutical manufacturer's distribution channel but not of it. Their views and actions must somehow be brought into alignment with the manufacturer's goals. This paper seeks to show part of the process from the manufacturer's strategic standpoint, in which potential dissenters are incorporated into the pharmaceutical company distribution channel. The routinization of this incorporation results in the diminishment of psychiatry's professional autonomy by means of what is-paradoxically to them, but not to a student of marketing-a competitive threat.

Originating in the molecular life sciences, it initially affected a number of biomedical research fields such as cancer genomics and clinical genetics. Now, however, a new \"wave\" of genomic bioinformation is transforming a widening array of disciplines, including those that address the social, historical and cultural dimensions of human life. Increasingly, bioinformation is affecting \"human sciences\" such as psychiatry, psychology, brain research, behavioural research (\"behavioural genomics\"), but also anthropology and archaeology (\"bioarchaeology\"). Thus, bioinformatics is having an impact on how we define and understand ourselves, how identities are formed and constituted, and, finally, on how we (on the basis of these redefined identities) assess and address some of the more concrete societal issues involved in genomics governance in various settings. This article explores how genomics and bioinformation, by influencing research agendas in the human sciences and the humanities, are affecting our self-image, our identity, the way we see ourselves. The impact of bioinformation on self-understanding will be assessed on three levels: (1) the collective level (the impact of comparative genomics on our understanding of human beings as a species), (2) the individual level (the impact of behavioural genomics on our understanding of ourselves as individuals), and (3) the genealogical level (the impact of population genomics on our understanding of human history, notably early human history). This threefold impact will be assessed from two seemingly incompatible philosophical perspectives, namely a \"humanistic\" perspective (represented in this article by Francis Fukuyama) and a \"post-humanistic\" one (represented by Peter Sloterdijk). On the basis of this analysis it will be concluded that, rather than focussing on human \"enhancement\" by adding or deleting genes, genome-oriented practices of the Self will focus on using genomics information in the context of identity-formation. Genomic bioinformation will increasingly be built into our self-images and used in order to tailor and adapt our practices of Self to our \"personalised\" genome. We will keep working on ourselves, no doubt, not by modifying our genomes, but rather by fine-tuning our behaviour. What we are experiencing is a bioinformatisation of the life-world.

Sleep problems at age 8 predicted depression at age 10 (partial regression coefficient [95% confidence intervals] = 0.10 [0.01-0.18]). The converse was not found. Stability of sleep problems across time was mainly due to genes (46% of the genetic influence on sleep at 10 was due to the same genetic influence on sleep aged 8). Stability of depression was mainly due to non-shared environmental influences (19% of the nonshared environmental influence on depression at 10 was due to the same nonshared environmental influence on depression at age 8). The cross-lagged association between sleep problems at 8 and depression at 10 years was largely due to genes, although this finding was nonsignificant.\nThis study adds to our understanding of the temporal precedence of sleep problems and depression and the risks underlying their associations.

Genetic research has also made some advances in this field, discovering some genes--i.e. monoamineoxidase A (MAOA)--related to antisocial behavior. However, the importance of environmental factors in its development must not be left behind. Recent studies have shown that individuals carrying a low transcriptional activity allele of the MAOA gene, and that also suffered severe maltreatment are more prone to antisocial behavior. This interaction is biologically relevant, as there are underlying biological mechanisms that may be able to explain the ethiopathogeny of antisocial behavior.\nAlthough the works herein presented pioneered the field, they are limited by the fact that all the reviewed variables are associated to antisocial behavior, but they lack direct causal evidence of their effects on antisocial behavior.

In a subgroup of patients prone to mood conversions, a comparison was done of depressive episodes treated with antidepressants with and without a switch to mania/hypomania as well as the frequency of mood conversions induced by particular antidepressant drugs, especially tricyclic (TCA) versus non-TCA drugs.\nAmong 333 bipolar patients hospitalized in this period, mood conversions were observed in 118 subjects, significantly more frequently in female (44%) than in male patients (25%), and in patients with depressive episode at the onset of illness (80 vs. 40%). Among mood converters, it was found that the depressive episodes with a switch to mania were less severe, shorter, and with shorter duration of antidepressant treatment. The risk of switching was higher during treatment with TCA than with non-TCA drugs (36 vs. 17%), the highest with amitriptyline (42% of treated episodes), imipramine (40%) and clomipramine (35%).\nOur results suggest that bipolar patients prone to mood conversion constitute one third of the inpatient population with this illness.

This simple fact has enormous implications for the nature and organization of psychotherapy for mentally ill children, adolescents and adults.\nThis article reviews the 'trajectory' of psychosocial interventions in pediatric psychiatry, and makes some general predictions about where this field is heading over the next several decades.\nDriven largely by scientific advances in molecular, cellular and systems neuroscience, psychotherapy in the future will focus less on personal narratives and more on the developing brain. In place of disorders as intervention targets, modularized psychosocial treatment components derived from current cognitive-behavior therapies will target corresponding central nervous system (CNS) information processes and their functional behavioral consequences. Either preventive or rehabilitative, the goal of psychotherapy will be to promote development along typical developmental trajectories. In place of guilds, psychotherapy will be organized professionally much as physical therapy is organized today. As with other forms of increasingly personalized health care, internet-based delivery of psychotherapy will become commonplace.\nInformed by the new field of translational developmental neuroscience, psychotherapy in the future will take aim at the developing brain in a service delivery model that closely resembles the place and role of psychosocial interventions in the rest of medicine.

Disciplinary isolation and a lack of meaningful interdisciplinary opportunities are persistent barriers in academic medicine. To enhance clinical practice, research, and training for the next generation, academic centers will need to take bold steps that challenge traditional departmental boundaries. Such change is not only desirable but, in fact, necessary to bring about a truly innovative and more effective approach to treating disorders of the developing brain.\nI focus on developmental disorders as a convergence point for transcending traditional academic boundaries. First, the current taxonomy of developmental disorders is described with emphasis on how current diagnostic systems inadvertently hinder research progress. Second, I describe the clinical features of autism, a phenomenologically defined condition, and Rett and fragile X syndromes, neurogenetic diseases that are risk factors for autism. Finally, I describe how the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neurology, and pediatrics now have an unprecedented opportunity to promote an interdisciplinary approach to training, research, and clinical practice and, thus, advance a deeper understanding of developmental disorders.\nResearch focused on autism is increasingly demonstrating the heterogeneity of individuals diagnosed by DSM criteria. This heterogeneity hinders the ability of investigators to replicate research results as well as progress towards more effective, etiology-specific interventions. In contrast, fragile X and Rett syndromes are 'real' diseases for which advances in research are rapidly accelerating towards more disease-specific human treatment trials.\nA major paradigm shift is required to improve our ability to diagnose and treat individuals with developmental disorders. This paradigm shift must take place at all levels - training, research and clinical activity.

Recently, methodological progress has led to a revival of interest in brain oscillations (i.e., a band of periodic neuronal frequencies with a wave-duration from milliseconds to several seconds which may code and decode information). These oscillations will nurture future information processing research during normal and pathological brain development, allowing us to investigate basic neuronal connectivity as well as interactions of brain systems and their modulation (e.g., by temporal neuronal synchronisation) as close correlates of behaviour and intermediate phenotypes from genes to behavioural variations. Especially, a systematic neurodynamic look at transitional processes from rest to stimulus-triggered goal-directed performance will aid behavioural understanding and guidance of children. Preliminary data suggest two separate oscillatory mechanisms in this respect. One is ongoing from pre- to post-stimulus processing and related to quantitative modification of behaviour, while another is merely related to qualitative effects of behaviour and reflects 'on-top' post-stimulus processing by temporal neuronal synchronisation of the oscillatory network in question. Suggested neurodynamic models may be tested in multilevel clinical experiments as well as in the framework of computational neuropsychiatry."}, {"Title": "The future of genetics in psychology and psychiatry: microarrays, genome-wide association, and non-coding RNA.", "Abstract": "Much of what we thought we knew about genetics needs to be modified in light of recent discoveries. What are the implications of these advances for identifying genes responsible for the high heritability of many behavioural disorders and dimensions in childhood?\nAlthough quantitative genetics such as twin studies will continue to yield important findings, nothing will advance the field as much as identifying the specific genes responsible for heritability. Advances in molecular genetics have been driven by technology, especially DNA microarrays the size of a postage stamp that can genotype a million DNA markers simultaneously. DNA microarrays have led to a dramatic shift in research towards genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The ultimate goal of GWA is to sequence each individual's entire genome, which has begun to happen.\nGWA studies suggest that for most complex traits and common disorders genetic effects are much smaller than previously considered: The largest effects account for only 1% of the variance of quantitative traits. This finding implies that hundreds of genes are responsible for the heritability of behavioural problems in childhood, and that it will be difficult to identify reliably these genes of small effect. Another discovery with far-reaching implications for future genetic research is the importance of non-coding RNA (DNA transcribed into RNA but not translated into amino acid sequences), which redefines what the word gene means. Non-coding RNA underlines the need for a genome-wide approach that is not limited to the 2% of DNA responsible for specifying the amino acid sequences of proteins.\nThe only safe prediction is that the fast pace of genetic discoveries will continue and will increasingly affect research in child psychology and psychiatry. DNA microarrays will make it possible to use hundreds of genes to predict genetic risk and to use these sets of genes in top-down behavioural genomic research that explores developmental change and continuity, multivariate heterogeneity and co-morbidity, and gene-environment interaction and correlation. A crucial question is whether the prediction of genetic risk will be sufficiently robust to translate into genetically based diagnoses, personalized treatments, and prevention programmes."}, {"Title": "JCPP--The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry: a history from the inside.", "Abstract": "As the JCPP marks its 50th year of publication, this paper revisits the founding philosophy and traces the journey from the first issue through to the present.

Tertiary healthcare workers could play the role of trainers on childhood autism at primary healthcare level. Assessing their baseline knowledge about childhood autism to detect areas of knowledge gap is an essential ingredient in starting off such programs that would be aimed at early diagnosis and interventions. Knowledge of the healthcare workers on availability of facilities and law that would promote the required interventions is also important. This study assessed the baseline knowledge about childhood autism and opinion among Nigerian healthcare workers on availability of facilities and law caring for the needs and rights of children with childhood autism and other developmental disorders.\nA total of one hundred and thirty four (134) consented healthcare workers working in tertiary healthcare facilities located in south east and south-south regions of Nigeria were interviewed with Socio-demographic, Knowledge about Childhood Autism among Health Workers (KCAHW) and Opinion on availability of Facilities and Law caring for the needs and rights of children with Childhood Autism and other developmental disorders (OFLCA) questionnaires.\nThe total mean score of participated healthcare workers on KCAHW questionnaire was 12.35 +/- 4.40 out of a total score of 19 possible. Knowledge gap was found to be higher in domain 3 (symptoms of obsessive and repetitive pattern of behavior), followed by domains 1 (symptoms of impairments in social interaction), 4 (type of disorder autism is and associated co-morbidity) and 2 (symptoms of communication impairments) of KCAHW respectively among the healthcare workers. Knowledge about childhood autism (KCA) as measured by scores on KCAHW questionnaire was significantly associated with age group distribution of the healthcare workers, with those age group of fourth decades and above more likely to have higher mean score (p = 0.004) and previous experience of managing children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (p = 0.000). KCA showed near significant association with area of specialty, with those healthcare workers in psychiatry compared to pediatrics having higher mean score (p = 0.071) and also with years of working experience of the healthcare workers (p = 0.056). More than half of the healthcare workers subscribed to the opinion that facilities and law caring for the needs and rights of children with childhood autism and other developmental disorders are lacking in Nigeria.\nThe correlates of KCA may help in selection of those tertiary healthcare workers that would best fit the role of trainers. It is important to update the knowledge gaps of those healthcare workers who scored low in different domains of KCAHW questionnaire. It is imperative for policy makers in Nigeria to advocate and implement multidisciplinary healthcare service system that would ensure early diagnosis and interventions.

People with mental illness are seen to represent one of the most vulnerable groups for suicide and recent British Government policy has focused on prevention and management of perceived risk. This approach to suicide prevention is constructed under a biomedical model of psychiatry, which maintains that suicidal persons suffer from some form of disease or irrational drive towards self-destruction. Many react to the idea of self-inflicted death with instinctive revulsion, which has prevented serious discussion of the concept of rational suicide, particularly in relation to those with schizophrenia. The idea that there may be circumstances in which suicide can be viewed as rational is discussed within the biomedical approach to ethics and wider literature primarily in relation to physical disease, terminal states and chronic pain. It is not deemed a viable choice for those who are considered 'non-autonomous' due to the controlling forces of mental illness. I propose that suicide is not a consequence of mental illness per se, and that it may be seen as a rational response to a realistic perspective on the course and consequences of living with schizophrenia.

However, the effect of corticothalamic feedback dynamics to neural correlates of focal and nonfocal attention and its large-scale effect reflected in AECPs is far from being understood. To address this issue, we model neural correlates of auditory selective attention reflected in AECPs by using corticothalamic feedback dynamics. In our framework, we make use of a well-known multiscale model of evoked potentials, for which we define for the first time a neurofunctional map of relevant corticothalamic loops to the hearing path. Such loops are in turn are coupled to our proposed probabilistic scheme of auditory selective attention. It is concluded that our model represents a promising approach to gain a deeper understanding of the neurodynamics of auditory attention and might be used as an efficient forward model to support hypotheses that are obtained in experimental paradigms involving AECPs."}, {"Title": "Sakel versus Meduna: different strokes, different styles of scientific discovery.", "Abstract": "It is ironic that Laszlo Meduna and Manfred Sakel made epochal discoveries in psychiatry only two years apart because in most other ways, the two men could hardly be more different. The story of their differences and similarities invites us to consider the personal preconditions for scientific discovery. What common denominators led them to develop treatments, which represent the introduction of convulsive therapy, which remains today the most powerful treatment in psychiatry? Despite the marked differences in their personalities, Sakel and Meduna shared intellectual quickness, drive, and a willingness to take risks, three qualities that, in the case of these individuals at least, came together to revolutionize the treatment of serious psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Type of presentation of dissociative disorder and frequency of co-morbid depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "To determine the frequency distribution of various types of dissociative disorders, along with existing co-morbid depression and its level of severity in patients with dissociative disorder.\nObservational, cross-sectional study.\nThe Institute of Psychiatry, Rawalpindi General Hospital from October 2004 to March 2005.\nFifty consecutive patients were included in the study through non-probable purposive sampling technique.

Clinical normative data for a large sample of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is available (Wilk, Gold, Humber, Dickerson, Fenton, & Buchanan, 2004). The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend the clinical normative data for the RBANS for use in inpatient psychiatry. Participants were 174 inpatients from a provincial psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Median performance on the RBANS was 1-2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean. Patients with more than 12 years of education performed significantly better on every index score than patients with 12 or fewer years of education. Men performed better than women on the Visuospatial/Constructional Index (Cohen's d= .47). When examining all five Index scores simultaneously, it was common for inpatients to obtain three or more frankly impaired scores (i.e., less than the 2nd percentile).

The technique has a dual function: on the one hand, it has been used to investigate the functions of various cortical regions; on the other, it has been used as an experimental treatment modality, most notably for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). With the growing utility of tDCS in psychiatry, it is important from the vantage of safety and effectiveness to understand its underlying neurobiological mechanisms. In this respect, researchers have made significant progress in recent years, highlighting changes in resting membrane potential, spontaneous neuronal firing rates, synaptic strength, cerebral blood flow and metabolism subsequent to tDCS. We briefly review tDCS clinical trials for MDD, and then consider its mechanisms of action, identifying potential avenues for future research."}, {"Title": "Candidate endophenotypes for genetic studies of suicidal behavior.", "Abstract": "Twin, adoption, and family studies have established the heritability of suicide attempts and suicide. Identifying specific suicide diathesis-related genes has proven more difficult. As with psychiatric disorders in general, methodological difficulties include complexity of the phenotype for suicidal behavior and distinguishing suicide diathesis-related genes from genes associated with mood disorders and other suicide-associated psychiatric illness. Adopting an endophenotype approach involving identification of genes associated with heritable intermediate phenotypes, including biological and/or behavioral markers more proximal to genes, is an approach being used for other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a workshop convened by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University, and the National Institute of Mental Health sought to identify potential target endophenotypes for genetic studies of suicidal behavior. The most promising endophenotypes were trait aggression/impulsivity, early-onset major depression, neurocognitive function, and cortisol social stress response. Other candidate endophenotypes requiring further investigation include serotonergic neurotransmission, second messenger systems, and borderline personality disorder traits."}, {"Title": "Perceived negative attitude of others as an early sign of psychosis.", "Abstract": "Risk of psychosis is defined by the presence of positive psychotic-like symptoms, by subtle self-perceived cognitive and perceptual deficiencies, or by decreased functioning with familial risk of psychosis.

Despite the important medicinal role for AMPH, it is more widely known for its psychostimulant and addictive properties as a drug of abuse. The primary molecular targets of AMPH are both the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) and plasma membrane monoamine-dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT)-transporters. The rewarding and addicting properties of AMPH rely on its ability to act as a substrate for these transporters and ultimately increase extracellular levels of monoamines. AMPH achieves this elevation in extracellular levels of neurotransmitter by inducing synaptic vesicle depletion, which increases intracellular monoamine levels, and also by promoting reverse transport (efflux) through plasma membrane monoamine transporters (J Biol Chem 237:2311-2317, 1962; Med Exp Int J Exp Med 6:47-53, 1962; Neuron 19:1271-1283, 1997; J Physiol 144:314-336, 1958; J Neurosci 18:1979-1986, 1998; Science 237:1219-1223, 1987; J Neurosc 15:4102-4108, 1995).

Three groups were compared from a sample of individuals admitted to inpatient psychiatry (1982 to 1987) with at least one rehospitalization within a 16-year period. Multivariate logistical regressions were used to determine associations with predictor variables. The data showed that individuals' diagnosed with a SUD after baseline hospitalization were more likely to have more medical hospitalizations and to be diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to those who were diagnosed with a SUD, including co-occurring disorders, at baseline.

To establish the extent of inter-dependence between these behavioral domains, we here undertook a systematic analysis to establish interactions between mood [assessed with the forced-swimming (FST) and sucrose consumption tests (SCT)], anxiety [elevated-plus maze (EPM) and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) tests] and cognition (spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests) in rats exposed to unpredictable chronic-mild-stress (uCMS). Expectedly, uCMS induced depressive-like behavior, a hyperanxious phenotype and cognitive impairment; with the exception of the measure of anxiety in the EPM, these effects were attenuated by antidepressants (imipramine, fluoxetine). Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas no significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated. Inter-domain analysis revealed significant correlations between mood (FST and SCT) and anxiety-like behavior (NSF, but not EPM). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance (reverse learning task) and mood (FST and SCT) and anxiety-like behavior (NSF). These results demonstrate interactions between different behavioral domains that crosscut the disciplines of psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Etiologies of delirium and their relationship to reversibility and motor subtype in cancer patients.", "Abstract": "Delirium is one of the most commonly encountered complications in patients with cancer.

This study investigated the causes of delirium and their association with reversibility and motor subtypes of delirium in cancer patients.\nThe subjects were inpatients with cancer who had been referred to our Department of Psychiatry and diagnosed with delirium by psychiatrists. The causes of delirium were determined using standard operationalized criteria. The association between delirium reversibility and each clinical factor was examined in detail and longitudinally.\nData were available from a total of 100 patients.

The efficacy of pain control, amount and frequency of menstrual loss, degree of patient's satisfaction and objective pelvic venography scores were investigated.\nIn a prospective open-labelled study, 25 consecutive women complaining of chronic pelvic pain were recruited. Pretreatment objective peruterine venography and diagnostic laparoscopy of pure PCS together with subjective pelvic pain scores, prefilled questionnaire of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), visual analogue scale (VAS), verbal rating scale (VRS) and quantified menstrual loss using the pictorial blood loss chart were documented in all cases. After identification, 23 subjects with pure PCS were randomly assigned to have either Implanon inserted subcutaneously (12 cases) or no treatment (11 cases). Patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. A symptom diary for side effects, VAS, VRS and menstrual scores were used to assess the subjective response to treatment. At the end of the study, all patients underwent repeat venography to assess the long-term objective response. After 12 months, subjects having Implanon inserted were requested to rate their overall degree of satisfaction with therapy.\nAll 25 women recruited in the study completed follow-up. Two cases were excluded from the study and referred to the psychiatry department after a negative evaluation for disease and HADS scores relevant for depression. An improvement in symptoms was observed throughout the 12 months amongst the Implanon group versus no treatment. The greatest changes in pain assessed using either the VAS or VRS were between the pretreatment scores and those after 6 months (7.7 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.6 +/- 3.0 for VAS, P < 0.001; and 25 +/- 13.8 vs. 19 +/- 18.9 for VRS, P < 0.002).

This antipsychotic drug has their origin in the research process of central analgesic molecules derived from pethidine and methadone, carried out by the Belgian company Janssen Phamaceutica. After the synthesis of phenoperidine, numerous analogues of this compound were studied, and chemists at Janssen took the decision to substitute the propiophenone group for a butyrophenone group. One of these compounds went the R-1625, a stronger agent with specifically neuroleptic properties but lacking morphine-like activity. This substance was synthesized on the 11th February 1958 and received the generic name of haloperidol because of the two halogenated substitutes incorporated into the molecule. Clinical development of haloperidol was conducted, primarily, by psychiatric research team at the University of Li\u00e8ge that confirmed its efficacy in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders such as acute and chronic paranoid psychosis, mania, or chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Under the brand name Haldol((R)), haloperidol was licensed and marketed in Belgium in October 1959. The direct and differed consequences of its introduction into the psychiatric practice have been multiple, involving different areas of socio-sanitary reality. Moreover, haloperidol has contributed substantially to the development of biological psychiatry and currently neuroscience, because it made possible the development of new experimental models for predicting the effects of antipsychotics, and allowed the postulate of the firsts biological hypotheses about the schizophrenia etiology.

Despite this rich literature, such demonstration programs have proven difficult to maintain once research funding ends. Much of the discussion regarding maintenance of integrated care has been focused on lack of reimbursement. However, provider factors may be just as important, because integrated care systems require providers to adopt a very different role and operate very differently from traditional mental health practice. There is also great variability in definition and operationalization of integrated care. Provider concerns tend to focus on several factors, including a perceived loss of autonomy, discomfort with the hierarchical nature of medical care and primary care settings, and enduring beliefs about what constitutes \"good\" treatment. Providers may view integrated care models as delivering substandard care and passively or actively resist them. Dissemination of available data regarding effectiveness of these models is essential (e.g. timeliness of treatment, client satisfaction).

Adherence is considered non-judgmental and is preferred over the term \"compliance,\" which carries negative connotations and suggests blame for the patient. A major challenge in the field of psychiatry has been to understand why patients may or may not adhere to medication and other treatment recommendations. A comprehensive review of the literature on medication adherence among patients with psychiatric illnesses was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to better understand the impact of medication nonadherence, (2) to identify risk factors for medication nonadherence, and (3) to study interventions designed to improve patient adherence. The authors initially searched the Ovid Medline electronic database using the key words \"medication adherence\" and \"compliance\" to identify all articles written in the English language published through early 2008. This produced over 2000 references. The search was then narrowed to publications specific to psychotropic medication. The ultimate goal of the review was to increase awareness of this critical issue and to discuss strategies that the psychiatric clinician can implement to address patient adherence to prescribed medications. The authors chose to include articles that were deemed to be clinically useful to the practicing clinician.Studies that have specifically investigated adherence to psychiatric medications vary in the definitions of adherence and methodology that were used, making interpretation of results across studies difficult. Psychoeducational interventions have long been the mainstay of treatment for adherence problems. However, there is growing evidence that other approaches such as cognitive-behavioral strategies and motivational interviewing may be effective. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the authors recommend the following strategies for addressing adherence problems: focus on strengthening the therapeutic alliance; devote time in treatment specifically to address medication adherence; assess patients' motivation to take prescribed medications; and identify and address potential barriers to treatment adherence."}, {"Title": "Test-retest reliability of the PRIME-MD: limitations in diagnosing mental disorders in primary care.", "Abstract": "The primary care evaluation of mental disorders (PRIME-MD) can be seen as characteristic for successive refinements of criteria and structured interview techniques for diagnosing psychiatric disorders in primary care. It is one of the most widely used instruments, but there is no evidence to support its test-retest reliability.\nWith 1-week intervals between interviews, a test-retest study of the PRIME-MD was conducted in a general practice population of 100 distressed patients (20- to 60-years old) who were on sick leave.\nAlmost everyone (89%) received one or more diagnoses at both measurements, and there was fair total agreement (kappa = 0.27). The best agreement was found for more severe threshold disorders [major depressive disorder (kappa = 0.58), dysthymia (kappa = 0.57), and generalized anxiety disorder (kappa = 0.59)], while we found indefinite results for the sub-threshold disorders [anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) (kappa =.30), minor depressive disorder (kappa = -0.03), and somatoform disorder NOS (kappa = 0.11)].\nThe PRIME-MD is one of the few instruments in primary care that actually diagnoses specific mental disorders according to the DSM criteria. However, there was a failure to adequately classify sub-threshold disorders. Mental disorders, as seen in primary care, encompass important specific symptoms and clinical syndromes that vary in duration and severity over time, but they also encompass an admixture of somatic and psychological symptoms that do not match current diagnostic systems. This most likely resulted in methodological uncertainty about the level of agreement.

It represents proven treatments for defined diagnoses. But there are major problems with this position, starting with the fact that while they are superior to placebo, evidence based treatments too often are ineffective. It cannot be assumed that classifying psychopathology diagnostically is the best way to move forward. Established diagnostic entities, are as much wish as reality. They are the result of committee decisions so tentative that DSM III and IV refuse to use the term \"diagnoses\" in the diagnostic manual. There is also a more fundamental issue, not answerable to the vote of even the most \"expert\" committee. What do diagnoses represent? Does every diagnosis in DSM IV represent an actual real illness, in the sense that polio, cancer, or a strept throat actually exist? Or can they represent the reification of an idea, taking diagnoses beyond useful limits? Evidence based medicine, it is implied, should monopolize clinical approaches. But at this stage the proper question is not should we exclusively use treatments that have proven superior to placebo? It is what is the best way to formulate treatment strategies when now, and in the foreseeable future, science cannot offer answers that we need? Conjecture, out of necessity, must play a significant role. Given mediocre treatment results, we need all the help we can get, the art of psychiatry as well as the science. Pharmacological agents can be viewed as inducing particular psychological states which, though not specifically related to diagnosis, are nonetheless the basis for their usefulness. SSRIs are efficacious in a broad range of conditions because increasing serotonin has a psychological impact that is nonspecific to the disorders. It can be used in treatment contexts when diagnosis is irrelevant (e.g. helping a picked on, thin skinned adolescent, develop thicker skin). The core issue is our approach to patients. Evidence based medicine eschews the anecdotal in the name of generalized conclusions, based on the odds that the patient's ailments are typical for their group. This is not a ridiculous consideration, but it can miss important particulars brought by the patient. Knowing a patient well can be the difference between effective and ineffective treatment. Premorbid defenses, character style, the nature of the patients' stressors, their story can guide clinicians to a particular medication, and influence dosage. While evidence based medicine has a place, especially when low cost is a consideration, it cannot lay claim to being optimal treatment.

Despite these difficult circumstances, the publication of data on the duration of untreated psychosis in Japan along with evidence that early detection determines outcome has encouraged new attempts to promote early psychiatric intervention."}, {"Title": "The prevalence of common mental disorders among outpatient Thai army personnel.", "Abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of common mental disorders among Thai army personnel who attended the outpatient clinic, Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, Phramongkutklao Hospital in 2005.\nThe authors retrospectively reviewed and analyzed all outpatient medical records in 2005 of Thai army personnel who received treatment at the outpatient clinic, Department of Psychiatry and Neurology, Phramongkutklao Hospital from January 2005 to December 2005.\nAltogether 1,729 Thai army personnel were enrolled in the present study. They were 1,546 males and 183 females. The most common age range was 41-50 years (27.8%) and most of them were married. The prevalence of the first ten rank of mental disorders among Thai army personnel were schizophrenia (30.5%), alcohol dependence (18.21%), major depressive disorder (10.75%), generalized anxiety disorder (6.88%), panic disorder (6.13%), acute stress reaction (4.22%), adjustment disorder (4.1%), dysthymia (3.12%), insomnia (3%) and bipolar disorder (2.48%), respectively.\nThe three most common prevalence of mental disorders among Thai army personnel who attended in the year 2005 were schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and major depressive disorder."}, {"Title": "Genetic linkage findings for DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal in two populations.", "Abstract": "Nicotine withdrawal (NW) is both an important contributor to difficulty quitting cigarettes and because of mood-related withdrawal symptoms a problem of particular relevance to psychiatry. Twin-studies suggest that genetic factors influence NW (heritability = 45%). Only one previous linkage study has published findings on NW [Swan et al. (2006); Am J Med Genet Part B 141B:354-360; LOD = 2.7; Chr. 6 at 159 cM]. As part of an international consortium, genome-wide scans (using over 360 autosomal microsatellite markers) and telephone diagnostic interviews were conducted on 289 Australian (AUS) and 161 Finnish (FIN, combined (COMB) N = 450 families) families ascertained from twin registries through index-cases with a lifetime history of cigarette smoking. The statistical approach used an affected-sib-pair design (at least two adult full siblings reported a history of DSM-IV NW) and conducted the linkage analyses using MERLIN. Linkage signals with LOD scores >1.5 were found on two chromosomes: 6 (FIN: LOD = 1.93 at 75 cM) and 11 at two different locations (FIN: LOD = 3.55 at 17 cM, and AUS: LOD = 1.68 with a COMB: LOD = 2.30 at 123 cM). The multipoint LOD score of 3.55 on chromosome 11p15 in FIN met genomewide significance (P = 0.013 with 1,000 simulations). At least four strong candidate genes lie within or near this peak on chromosome 11: DRD4, TPH, TH, and CHRNA10. Other studies have reported that chromosome 11 may harbor genes associated with various aspects of smoking behavior. This study adds to that literature by highlighting evidence for NW."}, {"Title": "Cigarette smoking, nicotine dependence, and motivation for smoking cessation in psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in Canada, and is disproportionately more frequent among psychiatric patients. Smoking cessation interventions can be successfully implemented with psychiatric patients, yet no Canadian studies have evaluated smoking prevalence, nicotine dependence, and motivation for smoking cessation in psychiatric inpatients. Our study did so to help plan appropriate interventions for these patients.\nAll inpatients aged 18 years or older admitted to acute-care psychiatry units at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta, during a 6-month period completed a survey involving questions from the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), the Readiness to Quit Ladder, and the Decisional Balance for Cigarette Smoking. Responses were analyzed for correlation with discharge diagnoses, age, and sex.\nAmong the total inpatients (n = 342), 211 (62%) completed the survey. Among those, 55% were current cigarette smokers and 17.5% were former smokers. Nicotine dependence (FTND > or = 6) was reported in 45.2% of smokers. Smoking prevalence and nicotine dependence severity was greatest in the substance use disorders (SUD) and psychotic disorders groups. Current smokers endorsed more negative than positive attributes of smoking. Regarding smoking cessation, 51% of patients were precontemplative, 12.7% contemplative, and 36.2% preparatory or action-oriented, despite few receiving advice to quit.\nCigarette smoking and nicotine dependence are highly prevalent in psychiatric inpatients. However, self-reported motivation for smoking cessation is noteworthy, emphasizing that cessation advice and appropriate follow-up care should be provided to psychiatric inpatients who smoke."}, {"Title": "Nosology and measurement in child and adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The last 50 years have witnessed enormous strides in the measurement and classification of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Debates about whether we should continue to depend upon a categorical nosology still continue, but we argue that, despite the absence of clear dividing lines between psychiatric disorders and normality and ubiquity of diagnostic comorbidity, the current official approach to nosology has served child and adolescent psychiatric research surprisingly well. In particular we point to the utility of non-developmental diagnostic criteria as tools for discovering developmental effects on psychopathology. We also maintain that the search for sharper boundaries between disorders is fundamentally mistaken. However, official nosologies have tended to privilege information collected in diagnostic interviews and to sideline observational and other methods that cannot easily be made to conform to the format of their criteria. We suggest that it is time to remedy this situation. The ICD-10 and DSM-IV are useless for children under the age of about two, while alternatives, such as the DC:0-3, suffer from a profound lack of empirical support. We suggest a way forward through the integration of methods from temperament and psychopathology research. Finally, we deplore the failure of standardized assessment techniques to have penetrated more deeply into everyday clinical assessment."}, {"Title": "[Adult screening for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].", "Abstract": "ADHD is a well established condition in childhood, but much less attention has been given to this diagnosis among adults.

(2002, British Journal of Psychology, 93, 465-485) and Sullivan and Ruffmann (2004, British Journal of Psychology, 95(Pt 1), 1-18) found an age-related decline. Former studies addressing the issue compared young to elderly subjects and did not investigate earlier changes in middle-aged adults. To shed light on changes in ToM skills along adulthood, the authors used the revised version of the \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test\" (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 42, 241-251) to compare four groups of people of different ages covering the whole span of adult life. The authors found aged-related decline in ToM skills as early as the fifth decade of life. Awareness of the age-related changes in adult mentalizing is important to differentiate normal aging effects from ToM impairments due to neuropsychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Current trends in psychiatry care in Finland with special focus on private practice psychiatry and psychotherapy.", "Abstract": "Several previous reforms decentralized Finnish psychiatric services to a great extent. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is outlining a proposal for Health Care Law, which makes an effort to centralize and reorganize healthcare. It is not yet possible to see what this will mean for the psychiatric services. In general, the health status of the Finnish population has improved. Although rates of suicides have declined considerably, rates of alcohol-related deaths have risen. Moreover, disability related to major depression has increased drastically, which has lead to a nationwide project called MASTO, which has the aim to improve early detection and treatment of depression. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health set up a work group, MIND 2009, to draft local working models for mental health and addiction services. To study the significance of psychotherapy in a private practice psychiatric context, the Finnish Psychiatric Association conducted a survey amongst its members.

This review discusses the nature and extent of the psychiatric problems, their management options and process to organize the psychological interventions for affected children.\nLiteratures were searched through PubMed with the words \"children, disaster, psychiatry, and mental health\" and relevant cross references were included in the review.\nProportions of children having posttraumatic symptoms or syndromal diagnoses vary in different studies depending on various factors like nature and severity of disaster, diagnostic criteria used, cultural issues regarding meaning of trauma, support available, etc. Common psychiatric manifestations among children include acute stress reactions, adjustment disorder, depression, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders specific to childhood and psychotic disorders. Comorbidities and sub-clinical syndromes are also common. Most of the post-disaster mental health interventions can be provided in the community by the local disaster workers. Supportive counselling, cognitive behavior therapy, brief trauma/grief-focused psychotherapy, and play therapy are the commonly utilized methods of psychological intervention, which can be given in groups. Information about the efficacy of medications is still emerging, while many are being used and found useful.\nFollowing disaster, systematic screening for psychological problems in children is suggested.

The questionnaire was developed by the researchers in order to assess sexually dysfunctional patients and included detailed questions about socio-demographic variables, and general medical and sexual history. All participants were also assessed using the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction.\nThe most common primary FSD in our sample was vaginismus (75.9%), followed by hypoactive sexual desire (9.2%). Regarding comorbidity, in 36 female patients with lifelong vaginismus, we found dyspareunia in 17 women (47.2%), orgasmic disorder in eight women (22.2%), and sexual desire disorder in six women (16.6%) as a second sexual dysfunction, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria.\nWith respect to FSDs within the Turkish clinical population, vaginismic patients constitute the largest group and cultural factors may play a role in the occurrence of this condition. Additionally, our data indicated that there was a strong correlation between vaginismus and dyspareunia. There was also a high frequency of hypoactive desire and orgasm disorder in vaginismic patients. These results suggest that multidimensional assessment of sexual dysfunction in female patients is of great importance."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of spinocerebellar degenerations in the Hokuriku district in Japan.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of disease subtypes of spinocerebellar degenerations (SCDs) varies between countries, and even between areas within a country.

Biochemical and biophysical measurements demonstrated the presence of elevated levels of neurotoxic copper zinc and iron in the brains of AD patients. Intracellular levels of APP holoprotein were shown to be modulated by iron by a mechanism that is similar to the translation control of the ferritin L- and H mRNAs by iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loops in their 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs). More recently a putative IRE-like sequence was hypothesized present in the Parkinsons's alpha synuclein (ASYN) transcript (see [A.L. Friedlich, R.E. Tanzi, J.T. Rogers, The 5'-untranslated region of Parkinson's disease alpha-synuclein messenger RNA contains a predicted iron responsive element, Mol. Psychiatry 12 (2007) 222-223. [6]]). Together with the demonstration of metal dependent translation of APP mRNA, the involvement of metals in the plaque of AD patients and of increased iron in striatal neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease patients have stimulated the development of metal attenuating agents and iron chelators as a major new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases. In the case of AD, metal based therapeutics may ultimately prove more cost effective than the use of an amyloid vaccine as the preferred anti-amyloid therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the cognitive decline of AD patients."}, {"Title": "Symptom diagnostics based on clinical records: a tool for scientific research in child psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Child psychiatric diagnoses are generally based on a clinical examination and not on standardized questionnaires.

By two raters 44 behavioural symptoms were scored based on the clinical records of these children. Interrater agreement on symptoms in 50 records was performed. Principal components analysis on symptom scores of all children was performed; factor scores were related with MAC-ICD-9 classifications.\nInterrater reliability for behavioural symptoms was excellent (kappa = 0.88). Many children with psychiatric problems suffer from a large number of behavioural symptoms.

We studied mother-child concordance about the quality of life of children (QoL). We hypothesized that mothers of depressed children rate lower QoL than children for themselves while mothers of non-depressed children rate better QoL; that inter-informant agreement is higher in the non-depressed sample; and finally that agreement increases with age of the child.\nQoL of depressed children (N = 248, mean age 11.45 years, SD 2.02) were compared to that of non-depressed children (N = 1695, mean age 10.34 years, SD 2.19). QoL was examined by a 7 item questionnaire (ILK).\nMothers of depressed children rated lower QoL than their children while mothers of nondepressed children rated higher QoL than their children. Agreement was low in both samples but higher in the controls. Inter-informant agreement was only influenced by depression.\nOur results show that mothers relate more serious negative effects to childhood depression than their children and rate less problems for their non-depressed children compared to self-reports. Mother-child agreement is negatively influenced by depression which further stresses the importance of obtaining reports from the child and at least one parent in order to understand the subjective experiences caused by the illness."}, {"Title": "Mood disorders in women: focus on reproductive psychiatry in the 21st century--Motherisk update 2008.", "Abstract": "The burden of mental illness in general, and depression in particular, has long been underestimated.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the reasons for the delay and the underutilization of clozapine. One hundred psychiatrists were interviewed by phone. The interview was a structured interview with questions regarding attitude to, knowledge of and experiences with clozapine. Forty-eight (48%) psychiatrists had treatment responsibility of fewer than five patients treated with clozapine and 31 of the interviewed psychiatrists (31%) had started clozapine within the last 3 months. Seven psychiatrists (7%) had never prescribed clozapine despite the fact that they had been working more than five years in general psychiatry. Sixty-four psychiatrists (64%) would rather combine two antipsychotics than use clozapine. Sixty-six psychiatrists (66%) believed that patients treated with clozapine were less satisfied with their treatment when compared with those treated with other atypical antipsychotics. Many psychiatrists are reluctant to use clozapine and this might be due to less experience and knowledge of clozapine. A reason for the low awareness of clozapine's properties might be that clozapine is now a generic drug, and therefore, the marketing and education in using the drug is sparse."}, {"Title": "Case-control association study of 59 candidate genes reveals the DRD2 SNP rs6277 (C957T) as the only susceptibility factor for schizophrenia in the Bulgarian population.", "Abstract": "The development of molecular psychiatry in the last few decades identified a number of candidate genes that could be associated with schizophrenia.

The main sources of training were local teaching (74%), personal work (61%), scientific (57%) and didactic (54%) papers. Residents seemed unable to acquire knowledge on all domains of the curriculum established at a national level, particularly for neurophysiology, neuropsychology, comatose state and sleep disorders, oncology and psychiatry.

A service evaluation was also carried out in 8 UK centres to investigate prescribing patterns.\nOverall, 59 consultants returned completed questionnaires, a response rate of 35%. Results revealed that experts rated quetiapine as the most appropriate agent for all BPSD followed by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for psychotic symptoms, benzodiazepines for agitation or aggression and trazodone for behavioural symptoms such as disinhibition. The service evaluations showed that benzodiazepines were most frequently prescribed for BPSD.\nAlthough quetiapine was judged by experts to be the most appropriate agent for BPSD, it appears that in clinical practice benzodiazepines are most often used to manage these symptoms.

These workshops bring together clinicians, researchers, scholars, and advocates with diverse perspectives and from diverse fields. Our first commentary in CAPMH, which grew out of our first workshop, explained our method and explored the controversies in general. This commentary, which grows out of our second workshop, explains why informed people can disagree about ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Based on what workshop participants said and our understanding of the literature, we make 8 points. (1) The ADHD label is based on the interpretation of a heterogeneous set of symptoms that cause impairment. (2) Because symptoms and impairments are dimensional, there is an inevitable \"zone of ambiguity,\" which reasonable people will interpret differently. (3) Many other variables, from different systems and tools of diagnosis to different parenting styles and expectations, also help explain why behaviors associated with ADHD can be interpreted differently. (4) Because people hold competing views about the proper goals of psychiatry and parenting, some people will be more, and others less, concerned about treating children in the zone of ambiguity. (5) To recognize that nature has written no bright line between impaired and unimpaired children, and that it is the responsibility of humans to choose who should receive a diagnosis, does not diminish the significance of ADHD. (6) Once ADHD is diagnosed, the facts surrounding the most effective treatment are complicated and incomplete; contrary to some popular wisdom, behavioral treatments, alone or in combination with low doses of medication, can be effective in the long-term reduction of core ADHD symptoms and at improving many aspects of overall functioning. (7) Especially when a child occupies the zone of ambiguity, different people will emphasize different values embedded in the pharmacological and behavioral approaches. (8) Truly informed decision-making requires that parents (and to the extent they are able, children) have some sense of the complicated and incomplete facts regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD."}, {"Title": "Evidence for an interaction of schizophrenia susceptibility loci on chromosome 6q23.3 and 10q24.33-q26.13 in Arab Israeli families.", "Abstract": "A genome scan for schizophrenia related loci in Arab Israeli families by Lerer et al.

A final candidate region of 19.9 Mb between markers D10S222 (105.3 Mb) and D10S587 (125.2 Mb) was found on chromosome 10 by non-parametric and parametric linkage analyses. These linkage findings are consistent with previous reports in the same chromosomal region. Two-locus multipoint linkage analysis under three complex disease inheritance models (heterogeneity, multiplicative, and additive models) yielded a best maximum LOD score of 7.45 under the multiplicative model suggesting overlapping function of the 6q23.3 and 10q24.33-q26.13 loci."}, {"Title": "Nicotine withdrawal and reward responsivity in a card-sorting task.", "Abstract": "Animal studies have demonstrated decreased reward responsivity during nicotine withdrawal (e.g., Epping-Jordan et al., Nature 393:76-79, 1998) and the Card Arranging Reward Responsivity Objective Test (CARROT) has recently been used to study the effect of nicotine withdrawal on reward responsivity in humans (e.g., Al-Adawi and Powell, Addiction 92:1773-1782, 1997; Powell et al., Biol Psychiatry 51:151-163, 2002). We investigated a suggestion that nicotine withdrawal may have additional reward-related effects apart from the reward responsivity effects already observed.\nThe objective of this study was to determine whether or not nicotine withdrawal results in slower improvements in performance on a card-sorting task over a series of trials.\nWe carried out two experiments using a modified version of the CARROT, the mCARROT, to compare the performance of human participants in nicotine withdrawal with those who were satiated.\nAlthough withdrawal produced no direct effect on the mCARROT measure of reward responsivity, the overall sorting rate was lower, and the increase in sorting rate across successive trials was slower during nicotine withdrawal than during satiation.\nThese data indicate that nicotine withdrawal impacted on task performance independently of the introduction of a performance contingent reward, suggesting a novel reward-related effect of nicotine withdrawal."}, {"Title": "Proceedings from Motherisk Update 2008. Introduction: reproductive mental health.", "Abstract": "On May 7th 2008, our annual Motherisk Update was devoted to reproductive mental health, which is a part of life for many women of child bearing age. Presentations were delivered by experts in the fields of psychiatry, maternal/fetal pharmacology and obstetrics. Our goal was to improve patient care for a population that is particularly vulnerable to misinformation and the stigma that surrounds mental illness. The topics presented, included the prevalence of depression and other psychiatric illnesses during pregnancy and postpartum, the adverse consequences of untreated psychiatric illnesses in pregnancy and postpartum and the treatment of substance abuse which is often a comorbidity in these women. We also provided information on the risk/safety of drugs used for the treatment of these conditions in pregnancy and breastfeeding,including concerns regarding neonatal withdrawal in infants who were exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy."}, {"Title": "Common genetic determinants of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Swedish families: a population-based study.", "Abstract": "Whether schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are the clinical outcomes of discrete or shared causative processes is much debated in psychiatry. We aimed to assess genetic and environmental contributions to liability for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and their comorbidity.\nWe linked the multi-generation register, which contains information about all children and their parents in Sweden, and the hospital discharge register, which includes all public psychiatric inpatient admissions in Sweden. We identified 9 009 202 unique individuals in more than 2 million nuclear families between 1973 and 2004. Risks for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and their comorbidity were assessed for biological and adoptive parents, offspring, full-siblings and half-siblings of probands with one of the diseases. We used a multivariate generalised linear mixed model for analysis of genetic and environmental contributions to liability for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and the comorbidity.\nFirst-degree relatives of probands with either schizophrenia (n=35 985) or bipolar disorder (n=40 487) were at increased risk of these disorders. Half-siblings had a significantly increased risk (schizophrenia: relative risk [RR] 3.6, 95% CI 2.3-5.5 for maternal half-siblings, and 2.7, 1.9-3.8 for paternal half-siblings; bipolar disorder: 4.5, 2.7-7.4 for maternal half-siblings, and 2.4, 1.4-4.1 for paternal half-siblings), but substantially lower than that of the full-siblings (schizophrenia: 9.0, 8.5-11.6; bipolar disorder: 7.9, 7.1-8.8). When relatives of probands with bipolar disorder were analysed, increased risks for schizophrenia existed for all relationships, including adopted children to biological parents with bipolar disorder. Heritability for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder was 64% and 59%, respectively. Shared environmental effects were small but substantial (schizophrenia: 4.5%, 4.4%-7.4%; bipolar disorder: 3.4%, 2.3%-6.2%) for both disorders. The comorbidity between disorders was mainly (63%) due to additive genetic effects common to both disorders.\nSimilar to molecular genetic studies, we showed evidence that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder partly share a common genetic cause. These results challenge the current nosological dichotomy between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and are consistent with a reappraisal of these disorders as distinct diagnostic entities."}, {"Title": "The role of melatonin in the immuno-neuro-psychology of mental disorders.", "Abstract": "Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a molecule known to be produced in multiple cells and organs. It acts at the level of the biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, to modulate their activity, thereby influencing circadian rhythms, and also sleep processes. The clinical application of melatonin in the treatment of human mental disorders is still in its infancy. Until now, melatonin only has been used in psychiatry because of its hypnotic, resynchronizing and antioxidant actions. In this review, we hypothesized that melatonin might play an important role as an adjuvant therapy, in mental disturbances, due to other properties including its anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anxiolytic, drug detoxification properties, protective actions against osteoporosis, etc. Complex interactions occur between the brain and the immune system and currently is accepted that psychological and psychiatric illness can compromise immune and hormonal functions. Altered psychological states often influence the susceptibility of an individual to illness or modify the course of the illness and its prognosis. The present review discusses on the advantages of the co-treatment with melatonin and recent patents in three major psychiatric disorders: depression, bipolar syndrome and schizophrenia. The findings suggest new vistas in both the pathophysiology and the pharmacology of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Derogatory and cynical humour directed towards patients: views of residents and attending doctors.", "Abstract": "A study of medical students' perspectives on derogatory and cynical humour was published in 2006. The current study examines residents' and attending doctors' perspectives on the same phenomenon in three clinical departments of psychiatry, internal medicine and surgery.\nTwo focus groups were conducted in each of the three clinical departments, one with residents and one with attending doctors,during the 2006-07 academic year. Seventy doctors participated, including 49 residents and 21 attendings. The same semi-structured format was used in each group. Questions focused on characterisations of derogatory and cynical humour along with motives and rules for its use.All focus groups were audiotaped and the tapes transcribed. Each transcript was read independently by each researcher as part of an inductive process to discover the categories that describe and explain the uses, motives and effects of such humour.\nThree categories that appeared in the first study with medical students - locations for humour, the humour game, and not-funny humour - emerged as virtually identical,whereas two others--objects of humour and motives for humour - were more fully elaborated.\nDiscussions of derogatory and cynical humour should occur in any department where teaching and role modelling are priorities. In addition, the tenets of appreciative inquiry and the complex responsive process,particularly as they are used at the Indiana University School of Medicine, offer medical educators valuable tools for addressing this phenomenon."}, {"Title": "[The psychiatrist in psychosocial care: between grief and liberty].", "Abstract": "Since the seventies Brazil has witnessed a diversity of new proposals in the field of mental health care. Since then, the psychology and psychiatry ambulatories, day-hospitals, therapeutical shelters and psychosocial care centers have multiplied. Transformed into a public policy, the psychosocial care centers are spread all over the country, offering outpatient care with interdisciplinary and territorial orientation. Generally established under the auspices of a great hospital, the psychiatrist who considers working from a psychosocial perspective in a small city, has to deal with the classic contradictions of the psychiatric discourse. The varied local knowledge seems to threat the psychiatric knowledge. Answers, easy to be given in the hospital, have different implications in the field and acquire a complexity for which the psychiatrist is not prepared. Thus, this work tries to demonstrate the differences between these two kinds of psychiatry: the classic one (concerned with biology and the institution) and the psychosocial one (seeking for locally constructed answers and concerned with the human being in a dimension reaching far beyond the body)."}, {"Title": "[Wide-spectrum clinical interventions in mental health: 'care' and 'subject supposed to know' in therapeutic assistance].", "Abstract": "This paper discusses the theme therapeutic assistance (TA), understood as homecare-based mental health intervention. We emphasize the importance of community interventions for dealing with psychic suffering, either through reading the symptoms based on visibility, or through a psychoanalytic approach mainly concerned with listening. Lacking an independent theoretical background to support this practice, therapeutic assistance makes use of theories coming from other related fields of knowledge. Therefore, we discuss the influence of psychoanalysis and its role among broad spectrum mental health practice through clinical interventions belonging to the field of TA, focusing on two long-range operative concepts: Lacan's subject supposed to know and Winnicott's care (or caring process). Both concepts guide the clinical action and provide answers to theoretical problems within the TA field. We conclude that TA meets some requirements of the classical management of transference by means of a complex care process developed in the daily life and environment of the patient, in which desire and subjectivity are necessarily recognized although no psychotherapic setting is intentionally settled. Therapeutic assistance performs the role of an advanced clinical sentinel in the field of community psychiatry and public health."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatric clinical trials: should they accommodate real-world practices or set standards for clinical practices?", "Abstract": "Evidence-based psychiatry seeks the best research evidence for use in patient care. Recent research suggests that problems with accuracy, precision, bias, and other sources of unreliability potentially interfere with the validity of psychiatry's evidence base. Because many negative clinical research studies go unpublished, awareness and fuller understanding of these problems are blocked by lack of access to relevant data. Based on the importance of scientific soundness of neuropsychiatric research and patient care, we argue for increased attentiveness by investigators and practitioners to how clinical trials (CTs) interdependently estimate the efficacy of treatments and the effectiveness of methods as fair tests of efficacy. Deference by CT investigators to real-world practice conditions at research sites because of the unreliability introduced into data by these practices does not ensure unbiased evaluations of treatment efficacy. We argue for more systematic attention to sources of unreliability in CT investigations and increased commitments to assure the validity of the neuropsychiatric evidence base. These recommendations aim to determine neuropsychiatric drug efficacy with greater certainty to better quantify the clinical importance of drug-associated effects and to provide CT-evidenced guidance for practitioners to most effectively use drug efficacy in patient care."}, {"Title": "\"Effectiveness'' in Finnish healthcare studies.", "Abstract": "Evaluation of effectiveness is connected with prevailing paradigms, and the breadth and perspective applied therein exhibit differences. Effectiveness refers to the extent to which a given intervention or service produces health outcomes in individuals to whom it is offered. The aim of this paper is to clarify the concept of effectiveness evaluation in health care and present the ways in which Finnish healthcare studies use the concept of effectiveness.\nThrough a systematic review of Finnish scientific journals in the healthcare research field, 25 original studies, 35 review articles, and 20 discussion papers were acquired. The inclusion criterion was that the word ;;effectiveness'' was presented in the title or abstract.\nIn this study the effects of actions were evaluated through the process (outputs) or through the outcomes (harms and benefits). The word ;;effectiveness'' is widely used in healthcare research in Finland; mostly in studies of orthopaedics, health services research, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, and psychiatry, yet the concept was explicitly defined in only three papers. Most studies used both process and outcome measures. The outcome indicators were usually disease-specific. Papers presenting only process outputs clearly showed a health service producer's perspective. Health-related quality of life as an outcome indicator was rarely used.\nIn Finnish healthcare studies, the concept of effectiveness was rarely defined and effectiveness measures were often vague or even nonexistent. The meaning of the term had to be interpreted from the study methodology, measures, and indicators."}, {"Title": "Multidisciplinary investigations recognize high prevalence of co-morbidity of psychiatric and somatic diagnoses in long-term sickness absentees.", "Abstract": "In Sweden, the Social Insurance Offices each year refer long-term sickness absentees to comprehensive investigations to clarify medical conditions. However, there is a lack of scientific knowledge about these patients and their morbidity. The aim was to characterize a population of these sickness absentees regarding prevalence of somatic and psychiatric diagnoses and possible associations with sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health characteristics.\nA cross-sectional study was made up of 635 sickness absentees below the age of 64, who the local Social Insurance Offices in Stockholm County, Sweden, referred to a special unit for multidisciplinary investigation. Data was obtained from questionnaires and medical records. The patients were examined by board certified specialists in psychiatry, orthopaedic surgery, and rehabilitation medicine. Relative risks were estimated by use of modified Poisson regression to assess the associations between characteristics and diagnose outcomes.\nAbout 80% of the patients had more than one diagnosis. The vast majority had a psychiatric diagnosis, and approximately 55% had that in combination with at least one somatic diagnosis. An increased risk for being given a psychiatric diagnosis was found for men and unemployed people. In addition, lack of social life and friends and self-reported mental health problems were associated with psychiatric diagnoses but also among those who were given somatic diagnoses in combination with psychiatric diagnoses. Increased risks for somatic diagnoses were found for women and for patients with a higher education.\nLong-term sickness absentees referred to multidisciplinary investigations display high co-morbidity of psychiatric and somatic diagnoses and are a heterogeneous group with diverse sociodemographic and medical characteristics."}, {"Title": "A prediction rule for diagnosing hypomania.", "Abstract": "Missing the diagnosis of past hypomania, and thus of bipolar II disorder, is common. Study aim was to find a 'prediction rule' for facilitating the diagnosis of past hypomania.\nIn an outpatient psychiatry private practice (non-tertiary care), a consecutive sample of 275 bipolar II disorder (BP-II) remitted patients, and consecutive, independent, sample of 138 major depressive disorder (MDD) remitted patients, had been interviewed for different study goals during follow-up visits by a senior bipolar-trained psychiatrist. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, modified and validated by Benazzi and Akiskal [Benazzi F (2007). Lancet 369: 935-945] to improve the probing for past hypomania, patients had been questioned about the most common symptoms and duration of recent threshold and subthreshold hypomanic episodes. The sample was retrospective in nature. A prediction rule was tested. This is a score resulting from the sum of the weighted scores of each hypomanic symptom which was an independent predictor of hypomania. Its cutoff score for discriminating hypomania was based on the highest figure of correctly classified hypomanias and on the most balanced combination of sensitivity and specificity. A second, independent sample of 138 BP-II and 71 MDD remitted outpatients was tested to replicate the findings.\nBy univariate logistic regression, hypomanic symptoms distinguishing BP-II and MDD included 'increase in goal-directed activity' (overactivity) (OR=28.3), 'elevated mood' (OR=14.9), 'increased talkativeness' (OR=9.2), 'inflated self-esteem', 'decreased need for sleep', 'excessive risky activities', and 'irritable mood'. By multivariable logistic regression, the independent predictors of hypomania resulted 'increase in goal-directed activity' (OR=14.9, weighted score=15), 'elevated mood' (OR=7.5, weighted score=7), 'increased talkativeness' (OR=3.6, weighted score=4); 'irritable mood', 'inflated self-esteem', 'decreased need for sleep', and 'excessive risky activities' had ORs between 2.04 and 2.39, with a weighted score=2. The prediction rule showed that the cutpoint score > or = 21 had the highest figure of correctly classified hypomanias (88%, ROC area=0.94), showing the most balanced combination of sensitivity (87%) and specificity (89%). This prediction rule, tested on the second sample, found that the same cutoff score > or =21 correctly classified the highest figure of hypomanias (94%, ROC area=0.97), showing the most balanced combination of sensitivity (93%) and specificity (95%). To cross this cutoff score, overactivity was always required (as the sum of the scores of elevated mood and of the other symptoms did not reach this cutoff). However, scores 10 to 20 correctly classified only slightly lower figures of hypomanias.\nA prediction rule for hypomania was tested. The scores of overactivity plus at least some hypomanic symptom (among elevated mood, irritability, inflated self-esteem, less sleep, talkativeness, excessive risky activities) correctly classified 88% of hypomanias. Instead, elevated mood without overactivity, plus even all the other symptoms, did not reach the best figure of correctly classified. However, lower cutoff scores, up to 10, classified slightly lower figures of hypomanias, but with less balanced combinations of sensitivity and specificity. These findings may have diagnostic utility, because BP-II versus MDD is likely to be a more severe disorder. This prediction rule, if replicated and fine-tuned in different settings, may help clinicians better probing past hypomania, thus reducing the common misdiagnosis of BP-II as MDD."}, {"Title": "Good care in ongoing dialogue. Improving the quality of care through moral deliberation and responsive evaluation.", "Abstract": "Recently, moral deliberation within care institutions is gaining more attention in medical ethics. Ongoing dialogues about ethical issues are considered as a vehicle for quality improvement of health care practices. The rise of ethical conversation methods can be understood against the broader development within medical ethics in which interaction and dialogue are seen as alternatives for both theoretical or individual reflection on ethical questions. In other disciplines, intersubjectivity is also seen as a way to handle practical problems, and methodologies have emerged to deal with dynamic processes of practice improvement. An example is responsive evaluation. In this article we investigate the relationship between moral deliberation and responsive evaluation, describe their common basis in dialogical ethics and pragmatic hermeneutics, and explore the relevance of both for improving the quality of care. The synergy between the approaches is illustrated by a case example in which both play a distinct and complementary role.

Ren\u00e9 Descartes is often held responsible for divisions that appear in our profession and in our practice. The wish for integration, though, fails to recognize the way in which such divisions might be fundamental and necessary in our profession. This paper describes the endeavour in psychiatry and in Western thought more generally to cover up such divisions. It traces the drive towards integration to the origins of contemporary thought in Plato and Aristotle, in order to examine what preceded such thought.\nThe pre-Socratic thinkers were able to articulate fundamental and radical divisions, an ability which has been lost since the writings of Plato and Aristotle. A reappraisal of the pre-Socratics can lead to a reconsideration of the ongoing attempt to cover over the necessary divisions which mark our clinical practice, in order to be able to value what is most fundamental in our profession."}, {"Title": "Cause-specific excess mortality in suicidal patients: gender differences in mortality patterns.", "Abstract": "Few studies have investigated gender-specific excess mortality in suicidal patients.

Controls showed significant correlations between body mass index and resting energy expenditure, but manic patients did not exhibit similar correlations. There was also no relation between Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale scores and resting energy expenditure values in manic patients.\nWe found significantly increased resting energy expenditure values in bipolar I disorder, manic episode patients.

The present study sought to investigate factors that are associated with longevity in outpatient psychological care for HIV-positive patients. We aimed to better understand what factors (e.g., race, gender, age, history of mental health service utilization) are associated with the length of participation in psychotherapy in our clinic. This is an archival study consisting of chart review of our clinical documentation related to the psychological services provided in our clinic from January 2005 through December 2007.

Results indicated that the presence of cohabitating social support distinguished between those who continued or terminated after the intake session, with social support being associated with continuation after intake. Furthermore, shorter distance from clinic, history of previous psychotherapy, concurrent pharmacotherapy, comorbid personality disorder diagnosis, and having an ethnic minority provider were associated with greater longevity in treatment. As a result of modest sample size relative to the number of predictor variables, analyses utilized multiple bivariate analyses and thus, results must be considered preliminary and should be replicated in a larger investigation.

A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTLPR) has been associated with several psychiatric disorders as well as anxiety-related personality traits. In search of a mechanistic understanding of the functional implications of 5-HTTLPR, the influence of this polymorphism on regional 5-HT1A receptor density has previously been examined in two positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans, yielding, however, contradictory results. In the present study, 54 control subjects were examined with [11C]WAY 100635 PET and a battery of cognitive tests. Regional binding potential (BP) of [11C]WAY 100635 to 5-HT1A receptor was calculated for the dorsal raphe nuclei, the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate, the insula, the temporal cortex and the frontal cortex. The influence of 5-HTTLPR genotype on regional 5-HT1A BP and cognitive performance was investigated. No differences in 5-HT1A receptor density between carriers and non-carriers of the S allele were found. Thus, we could not replicate any of the previously reported associations between 5-HTTLPR and 5-HT1A density. There was, however, a highly significant association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and performance in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; carriers of the S allele had a superior performance compared to the LL carriers. These observations suggest that functional implications of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism are not likely to be mediated by differences in 5-HT1A expression levels and that other biomarkers must be considered for future investigations at phenotype level."}, {"Title": "Sociology and nursing: role performance in a psychiatric setting.", "Abstract": "The role of sociology in nursing continues to cast new light on many aspects of health and illness. Over the last 20 years, nursing practice has seen sociological theory become a valuable clinical tool, both in the diagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of illnesses and long-term conditions. Nevertheless, of these, the sociological examination of mental health problems and its impact upon nursing practitioners has received little coverage, simply because, as a discipline, mental health nursing has historically been wedded to a biomedical model, one which continues to embrace psychiatry/psychology as the driving force in the diagnosis and treatment of psychopathology. Adopting a sociological approach, this paper brings to light previously unexplored insights into the way nurses interact with patients experiencing mental health problems. Drawing on social interactionist methodology, this paper considers depression and other mental health problems in relation to current psychiatric nursing practice. Specifically, the paper focuses on aspects of role performance and interpersonal care in a psychiatric setting, and the impact the individual role may have on the wider aspects of institutional and official practices.

This study sought to determine how frequently seclusion was used, the common characteristics of those secluded and not secluded, and the degree to which the Level of Service Inventory - Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R: SV) could predict seclusion. The study was retrospective, covering the first 2 years of operation of a statewide forensic psychiatry hospital in Victoria, Australia. Data were collected from individual case files, electronic databases, and paper copies of records pertaining to violent incidents and episodes of seclusion. Eighty five (44%) of the 193 patients admitted during this period were secluded. Those secluded were significantly younger and had a more established psychiatric history.

Beginning with a brief historical overview of Canada's federal medical cannabis programme, this paper examines the failure of the MMAD to meet the needs of many sick and suffering Canadians through Hunt's [Hunt, A. (1999). Governing morals: A social history of moral regulation. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press] work on moral regulation and Wodak's [Wodak, A. (2007). Ethics and drug policy.

Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press] theories of domination and oppression to examine the rise of community-base medical cannabis dispensaries as \"new social movements\". First-hand accounts by medical cannabis patients, federally funded studies, and internal Health Canada communication and documents suggest that current federal policies and practices are blocking safe access to this herbal medicine. The community-based dispensary model of medical cannabis access is a patient-centered \"new social movement\" that mitigates the stigmatization and moral regulation of their member-clients by creating opportunities for engagement, empowerment and joint knowledge creation. In light of ongoing Charter challenges and patient criticism, the survival of this federal programme will depend on the government's ability to shift away from policies based on the oppression and moral regulation, and towards consequentialist policies that balance harm reduction and benefit maximization. The effectiveness of such an approach is exemplified by the success of the community-based dispensary model which is currently producing more peer-reviewed research and supplying medical cannabis to a far greater number of patients than Health Canada's Marihuana Medical Access Division."}, {"Title": "Managing unipolar depression in pregnancy.", "Abstract": "The management of depression in pregnancy is complex, as it is based on balancing the risks with the benefits of treatment versus no treatment for both the mother and the fetus. The current literature in the field of reproductive psychiatry is difficult to navigate and at times contradictory. This article aims to review both nonpharmacological and pharmacological modalities in the treatment of perinatal depression. A literature review using PubMed and MEDLINE databases was used to collect literature from the past 2 years; however, given the relatively small amount of research in reproductive psychiatry, several salient articles from the past 5 years have also been included in this review.\nRecent US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada warnings regarding poor neonatal adaptation and adverse perinatal outcomes associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy have changed patterns of practice for prescribing physicians. Many physicians are now left with a sense of indecisiveness regarding the safety of treating their depressed, pregnant patients. Similarly, these warnings have changed patients' attitudes and their willingness to consider pharmacological treatment for depression. Although these warnings demand attention and careful consideration, research has also shown that exposure to mental illness in pregnancy has deleterious short-term and long-term effects for the exposed mother and fetus.\nThe field of reproductive psychiatry is rapidly evolving.

While this hospital used to be a symbol of hopelessness among patients and their families and an unspoken shame among Taiwan psychiatry and mental health circles it now represents an example of how an old, custodial hospital can be transformed into a very different institution. In this case study we will describe the features of this transformation, which, over the past 20 years, has aimed to help extended stay inpatients with severe mental illness to integrate into the local community of Yuli even though it is not their original home.\nUsing historical documents and oral narratives from Yuli inhabitants, workers and patients of YVH, we will offer a case study of the Yuli model.\nThere are four main components of the Yuli model: holistic medical support, vocational rehabilitation, case management, and the residential program. The four components help patients recover two essential features of their lives: vocational life and ordinary daily routines. As the process of recovery evolves, patients gradually regain inner stability, dignity, self-confidence, and a sense of control. The four components are critical to rebuild the structure and order of life of the patients and are indispensable and interdependent parts of one service package. They operate simultaneously to benefit the patients to the greatest degree possible.\nThere are many challenges to the further development and financial viability of the model of services developed at YVH. There are also important questions concerning the replicability of the Yuli model in other sociocultural and service system contexts.\nThis case study reveals the possibility of transforming a custodial mental hospital into a hospital providing high quality care. Hospital and community are not in opposition. They are part of a continuum of care for the patients. We reinterpret and redefine the boundary and function of hospital and community, and thereby create a new service model, the Yuli Model, to help patients to reintegrate into the community. The Yuli model, which particularly focuses on the needs of people with long-standing illness and prolonged hospital stay, illustrates one approach to linking hospital and community in a creative and constructive manner."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric practice for intellectual disability in the USA: challenges and advances.", "Abstract": "Individuals with intellectual disability are thought to make up at least 1% of the population, and it is estimated that approximately one-third of them have a comorbid psychiatric disorder (Harris, 2006).

In this article, we will discuss whether the neurosciences and new psychopharmacological solutions really support patients who suffer from mental illnesses. To answer this question, we will focus on the perspective of patients and their experiences with psychiatric (coercive) treatments. The analysis of one person's story shows that other issues besides appropriate medication are important for recovery from a mental illness. In daily life, issues such as coping, rehabilitation and social support are of major importance for a patient suffering from psychiatric disease. Thus, although progress in the neurosciences is a positive development for clinical practice, it does not mean that (coercive) medication alone will carry a patient into recovery. A patient's recovery is dependent, not only upon the process of finding the appropriate medication and trust between the psychiatrist and the patient, but also upon relational aspects, such as being recognised as a person, belonging, accepting responsibilities, developing friendships and trusting others. These findings lead to the conclusion that dealing with psychiatric diseases is more complex than what the biomedical model of neuroscience suggests and that one should include the social context of the patient in the recovery process."}, {"Title": "What information do general practitioners expect in letters from mental health services?", "Abstract": "Background Psychiatrists and General Practitioners (GPs) communicate mainly by letters which often do not cover the necessary information.

To challenge psychiatrists about their practice regarding patients' treatment adherence in severe mental disease, and make them discuss possible ways to improve this through their relationship with patients. Methods. A total of 423 physicians from 32 countries were assigned across 41 parallel groups during a workshop organised on adherence in severe mental diseases. Factors that influence adherence, and questions and measures to help patient-clinician interaction were discussed and rated. Results. The most important factor influencing adherence to treatment was considered to be insight. The factor over which clinicians felt they had the greatest influence was the therapeutic relationship. The question that most physicians considered the most useful for improving communication with patients was, \"Does taking medication cause any problems for you?\" Additional areas identified as important in improving adherence included addressing the positive and negative aspects of medication, patient expectations and what patients hoped to gain from seeing their physician. Intervention programmes to improve adherence included patient education, motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioural therapy. A composite toolkit based on the top-rated questions to improve communication with patients and measures to aid adherence was recommended. Conclusion.

To ascertain the degree of convergence between patients referred for chemical problems and the corresponding DSM diagnosis. 3. To compare demographic data for substance abusing patients and referrals not so classified. 4. To evaluate conditions concomitant with substance use disorders.\nConsecutive one-year referrals (524) to consultation-liaison psychiatric services were scrutinized for chemically-related problems by psychiatric consultants.\nOf the referrals, 176 met criteria for substance use disorders (SUD) (57% alcohol; 25% other drugs; 18% both alcohol and other drugs). Persons diagnosed with SUD tended to be younger, male, non-Caucasian, unmarried, and unemployed. They were more likely to be depressed, have liver and other gastrointestinal problems, and to have experienced traumatic events; they also tended to have current financial difficulties. Most were referred for SUD evaluation by personnel in general medicine and family practice. Following psychiatric consultation, SUD designated patients were referred mainly to substance abuse treatment programs. The only variable related to recommended inpatient versus outpatient services for individuals with SUD was the Global Assessment of Functioning Axis (GAF) with persons having lower estimated functioning more likely to be referred for inpatient interventions.\nThese data are similar to the results of past studies in this area. Unlike previous investigations in the domain of consultative-liaison psychiatry, financial stressors and specific consultant recommendations were included in data gathering.

A WHO Cross-national Collaborative Study); ESPAD (The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs) and \"Mokotowskie Research\", leaded by Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology."}, {"Title": "The ICF-based functioning profiles of school children in care with the neuropsychiatric community services in the Piedmont region: evidences for better caring and programming.", "Abstract": "In the Piedmont region, as in the rest of Italy, school integration of 'handicapped students' in regular classes, independently of the pathologies they are suffering from, involves almost the totality of students between the age of 3 and 14 and the majority of students between the age of 14 and 18. The responsibility to 'recognise the student as a handicapped person' is attributed to the regional public health system (Child Neuro-Psychiatry Services - CNPS). The information about the students is registered in the regional NPI.net, a Web-based application. The question was if ICF could help to develop a monitoring system about school inclusion processes better than the existing one. In fact, because all information is based on medical diagnosis embedded in narrative descriptions, it is often difficult to obtain reliable and comparable data on the disability profiles and the quality of children and adolescents school experience.\nSix CNPS, covering 50% of the Piedmont region, started a pilot study on disabled children at school. Diagnostic data of the children and a brief description of their functioning profiles using ICF were considered. Approximately 1000 school children and adolescents with disability were selected for this study.\nWe studied the extension and the severity of impairment of body functions (BF) and/or of activity (A&P) restriction, and the extension and the intensity of facilitators and barriers (EF) together with other factors such as provenience (Local Health Authorities - LHA), main health condition and age of the subjects. The analysis of variance, taking into account LHA, main health condition and age, confirmed the statistical significance of these three factors in differentiating the personal profiles in terms of BF, A&P and EF.\nThe study shows the feasibility and reliability of the use of ICF-based functioning descriptions to monitor school inclusion processes and to better investigate the differences between LHAs in diagnostic procedures, disease prevalence and characteristics of facilitators and barriers. As a direct consequence of the study, the Regional Councils for Instruction, Health and Social Politics have started a 3-year training programme for approximately 2500 school operators, 350 health operators in NPI services and 350 social operators."}, {"Title": "Caught in the psychiatric net: meanings and experiences of ADHD, pediatric bipolar disorder and mental health treatment among a diverse group of families in the United States.", "Abstract": "Based on a 13-month ethnographic meaning-centered study of the lived experience of behavioral and emotional disorders among children and families living in the United States, this article highlights the range of orientations to mental health problems and treatment among families from diverse backgrounds. Detailed case portraits of three families are presented to illustrate the various meanings that psychiatric diagnoses and mental health treatments take on within families, with medicalized perspectives holding less salience among African-American families relative to Euro-Americans in the study. The diverse orientations to problems among families in the study suggest that, despite the dominance of biochemical and neurological explanations for behavioral and emotional distress in contemporary U.S. culture, and especially U.S. psychiatry, nonpathological interpretations have not been wholly eclipsed by broad trends toward biologization and medicalization. Families' experiences are positioned to reveal the allure, as well as the limitations, of biopsychiatric approaches to behavioral and emotional problems."}, {"Title": "[Need for child welfare care after inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric treatment].", "Abstract": "New research confirms the high prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents in the setting of child welfare services. This study examines the need for child welfare care subsequent to inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric treatment.\nWe analysed the basic documentation of the patients in the years 2001 to 2005 in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, W\u00fcrzburg, with regard to the indication of need for or the implementation of child welfare services. Moreover, we examined which factors will vary the risk of need for child welfare services.\nNearly 50% of all inpatient children and adolescents had an indicated need for child welfare service; these services, however, were directly implemented for only half this number. And of those, more than every third procedure involved residential care. Early onset of the mental disorder, abnormal situation of the parents, external mental disorder, and a high rate of psychosocial risk factors increase the risk for child welfare services."}, {"Title": "[Impact factors and publication time spans of child and adolescent psychiatry journals].", "Abstract": "The impact factor (IF) of a scientific journal plays a central role in a scientist's decision where to publish his or her research results. Authors also show interest in the publication time span (time span between the submission and the online or print publication of a article). This paper presents an overview of the IF and editorial time spans of German and international child and adolescent psychiatric journals and compares them to those of journals of adult psychiatry.\nThe authors first conducted a data bank search at the Journal Citation Reports, concerning IF and IF-development for key journals of child and adolescent psychiatry from 2002-2007. They then manually analyzed pertinent child and adolescent journals regarding the time span for publications in the year 2007.\nTo date, nine child and adolescent psychiatric journals exist, whereof eight present with an impact factor. The IF ranges from 0.419 (praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie) to 4.655 (Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry). The editorial handling time ranges between 5.4 and 13.2 months.\nEven though this academic discipline is \"small\", child and adolescent psychiatry disposes of international journals presenting with competitive IFs. Both German journals show a low IF. The editorial handling times were reasonable, but could be further reduced by offering prior online publication."}, {"Title": "[Psychotropic drugs for children - a brief historical review].", "Abstract": "Already in the ancient world psychiatric disorders of children have been reported. However, only in the last decades the effectiveness of specific psychotropic drugs for the affected children have been investigated systematically. Especially in Germany there has been a controversial discussion about the application of neuroleptics in child and adolescent psychiatry. Important aspects of psychopharmacological therapy in childhood and adolescents are illustrated and discussed."}, {"Title": "Marital satisfaction, sexual problems, and the possible difficulties on sex therapy in traditional Islamic culture.", "Abstract": "We plan to investigate the level of marital satisfaction, the prevalence of sexual problems, and related issues in couples who were referred to an outpatient clinic of psychiatry for their sexual problems. All were living according to traditional Islamic culture. Twenty-five (80.64%) of the couples attended the clinic for not being able to have any sexual intercourse. Overall, 25.8% of the women, and 3.2% of the men had been married without their consent; those marriages were arranged and mediated by matchmakers. Vaginismus (58.06%) was the most common diagnosis among women and premature ejaculation (38.70%) among men. We found that marital satisfaction was affected by the mode of marriage."}, {"Title": "[Quality improvement of multiple choice examinations: in psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine, psychotherapy, and neurology].", "Abstract": "We describe a continuous improvement process in planning, performance, and evaluation of multiple choice examination questions in psychiatry, neurology, psychosomatic medicine, and psychotherapy. We analyzed 640 multiple choice questions of 1,419 students during a period of 4 years. Crucial changes concerned the abolishment of problematic question types, implementation of validated new question formats, extension of case-based questions, elongation of question stems, quantitative evaluation of item difficulty, discriminatory value, and the introduction of a peer review system. Consequences of these improvements were greater item difficulty (average 18%) and discriminatory value (average 67%) and reduced post hoc analysis times. Introduction of peer reviews resulted in longer preparation time, which was however appreciated by the peers due to a clear improvement in item quality."}, {"Title": "Can we justify eliminating coercive measures in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "The practice of coercive measures in psychiatry is controversial. Although some have suggested that it may be acceptable if patients are a danger to others or to themselves, others committed themselves to eliminate it. Ethical, legal and clinical considerations become more complex when the mental incapacity is temporary and when the coercive measures serve to restore autonomy. We discuss these issues, addressing the conflict between autonomy and beneficence/non-maleficence, human dignity, the experiences of patients and the effects of coercive measures. We argue that an appeal to respect autonomy and/or human dignity cannot be a sufficient reason to reject coercive measures. All together, these ethical aspects can be used both to support and to reject a non-seclusion approach. The total lack of controlled trials about the beneficial effects of coercive measures in different populations however, argues against the use of coercive measures."}, {"Title": "Polypharmacy prevalence rates in the treatment of unipolar depression in an outpatient clinic.", "Abstract": "Unipolar depression is a complex illness with an ever increasing number of pharmacological treatments available. As the number of available medication options increases, so does the potential for polypharmacy, a practice with possible complications. Such complications include a greater number of side effects with the initiation of additional medications and the consequences of drug-drug interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of polypharmacy on efficacy of treatment as well as whether polypharmacy is instituted after appropriate initial monotherapy trials. This study attempts to answer these questions.\nPatient names for this investigation were provided by residents in the UMass Medical School Psychiatry Residency program. The charts of these patients were analyzed to collect data regarding demographics, clinical data about the illness, medication names, types, duration of use and to access efficacy using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).\nOf 160 reviewed charts, 135 subjects were included in the final analyses (others excluded due to incomplete data or no depression diagnosis). Patients were on average on 2.0 medications (SD=0.5) with 2.1 past trials. A greater number of current antidepressant medications did not correlate with a greater improvement in CGI, implying that polypharmacy did not necessarily lead to greater efficacy. The impact of illness severity, as measured by comorbidities, substance abuse, and trauma history, were included in the analysis, and did not significantly change this outcome. Additionally, prescription patterns themselves were examined, including reasons for termination of medication trials, the impact of side-effects, and the number of patients that had complete monotherapy trials before transitioning to polypharmacy.\nSmall sample size, retrospective review, one CGI rater.\nFirst, many patients did not receive an adequate monotherapy trial, as defined by dose and duration, before progressing to polypharmacy. Secondly, the use of two or more medications concurrently did not appear to increase efficacy as measured by CGI. Due to study limitations, direct comparison of the efficacy of one and two medications was not significant; however the study did demonstrate a general correlation between polypharmacy and greater depressive symptomatology. This suggests the need for optimizing monotherapy regimens before initiating polypharmacy that may not lead to improvement in symptoms."}, {"Title": "Foucault on methadone: beyond biopower.", "Abstract": "This essay reviews four texts which critically analyse methadone maintenance therapy using Foucault as a key theoretical framework: [Friedman, J., & Alicea, M.

Disciplining addictions: The bio-politics of methadone and heroin in the United States. Culture Medicine and Psychiatry, 24, 165-195], [Bull, M. (2008). Governing the heroin trade: From treaties to treatment. Ashgate: Aldershot], and [Fraser, S., & valentine, k. (2008). Substance & substitution: Methadone subjects in liberal societies. New York: Palgrave Macmillan]. Taken together these works demonstrate one trajectory in the development of critical drug studies over the past decade. While all four view MMT as a regulatory technology which aims to create productive and obedient subjects, their understandings of the power relations of the clinic are quite distinct. The first two texts emphasise the social control of drug users, the third, issues of governmentality and liberal political practice, while the fourth engages with ontological questions about substances themselves. Thus while Foucauldian analysis has become familiar in social studies of drugs and alcohol, new uses for its conceptual tools continue to emerge."}, {"Title": "The construction of \"cultural difference\" and its therapeutic significance in immigrant mental health services in France.", "Abstract": "Since the early 1970s, the French public health system has been accorded considerable responsibility for immigrants identified by the educational, judicial or social service authorities as psychologically distressed or socially disruptive. In this paper we discuss three models of healing embedded in constructs of \"cultural difference\" and addressed at specialized mental health-care centers catering to immigrants in Paris: \"cultural mediation,\" transcultural psychiatry/ethnopsychiatry and clinical medical anthropology. Based on observations and interviews at three specialized mental health centers in Paris, we explore how these clinical approaches address migrant wellbeing and seek to resolve crises in migrant families, especially those of West African origin. We suggest that the prevalent approaches to therapy creatively blend concepts and practices of anthropology, psychiatry and psychology but, at the same time, confront challenges inherent in the use of a generic \"African\" healing modality. Cases studies demonstrate that in order for such interventions to be perceived as effective by patients, \"cultural difference\" must be acknowledged but also situated in broader social, political and economic contexts."}, {"Title": "Anatomic autoandrophilia in an adult male.", "Abstract": "Some men are sexually aroused by impersonating the individuals to whom they are sexually attracted, or by permanently changing their bodies to become facsimiles of such individuals. Blanchard (J Sex Marital Ther 17:235-251, 1991) suggested that these paraphilic sexual interests, along with fetishism, represented erotic target location errors, i.e., developmental errors in locating erotic targets in the environment. Because the desire to impersonate or become a facsimile of the kind of person to whom one is attracted can have significant implications for identity, Freund and Blanchard (Br J Psychiatry 162:558-563, 1993) coined the term erotic target identity inversion to describe this type of erotic target location error. The best-known examples of erotic target identity inversions occur in men who are sexually attracted to women and who are also sexually aroused by the idea of impersonating or becoming women; these paraphilic interests manifest as transvestic fetishism and as one type of male-to-female transsexualism. Analogous erotic target identity inversions have been described in men who are sexually attracted to children and to female amputees. In theory, erotic target identity inversions should also occur in men who are sexually attracted to men. There have been no unambiguous descriptions, however, of men who are sexually attracted to men and also sexually aroused by the idea of changing their bodies to become more sexually attractive men. This report describes such a man, whose paraphilic interest would appropriately be called anatomic autoandrophilia. The demonstration that anatomic autoandrophilia exists in men is consistent with the theory that erotic target location errors constitute an independent paraphilic dimension."}, {"Title": "The \"medication interest model\": an integrative clinical interviewing approach for improving medication adherence-part 2: implications for teaching and research.", "Abstract": "Over the past several decades, exciting advances have been made in the art and science of teaching clinical interviewing, which are supported by an ever-growing evidence base documenting their effectiveness. In this second article in a 2-part series, the training and research implications of an innovative approach to improving medication adherence based on these educational advances--the medication interest model (MIM)--are described. The objective is to provide an \"insider's view\" of how to creatively teach the MIM to case managers, as well as design state-of-the-art courses and research platforms dedicated to improving medication adherence through improved clinical interviewing skills in both nursing and medical student education.\nThe teaching and research design concepts are applicable to all primary care settings as well as specialty areas from endocrinology and cardiology to psychiatry.\nEvidence-based advances in the teaching of clinical interviewing skills such as response-mode research, facilic supervision, microtraining, and macrotraining lend a distinctive quality and integrative power to the MIM.\nThe model delineates several new platforms for training and research regarding the enhancement of medication adherence including an approach for collecting individual interviewing techniques into manageable \"learning modules\" amenable to competency evaluation and potential certification."}, {"Title": "Generalized deficit in all core components of empathy in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Empathy is a multidimensional construct composed of several components such as emotion recognition, emotional perspective taking and affective responsiveness. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in several domains of emotion processing and perspective taking, thus suggesting a dysfunctional emotional competence. We assessed empathic abilities via three paradigms measuring emotion recognition, perspective taking and affective responsiveness as well as self-report empathy questionnaires in 24 (12 females, 12 males) schizophrenia patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy volunteers. Patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, RWTH Aachen University and healthy volunteers were recruited via advertisement. Groups were matched for age, gender and parental education. Data analysis indicates a significant empathic deficit in patients, reflected in worse performance in all three domains. This deficit was only partly reflected in the self-report empathy questionnaires. Comparing the different tasks, emotional perspective taking was the most difficult task for all subjects and symptomatology worsened affective responsiveness. Schizophrenia patients not only struggle to correctly identify emotions, but also have difficulties in spontaneously simulating another person's subjective world (perspective taking) and might not be able to respond adequately in terms of their own emotional experience (affective responsiveness), which are not caused by emotion perception deficits. The results suggest that all domains of empathy are affected in schizophrenia and have to be addressed independently in behavioral therapies, thereby offering a possibility to improve socio-occupational life."}, {"Title": "Are chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome valid clinical entities across countries and health-care settings?", "Abstract": "The validity of the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and related chronic fatigue states remains controversial, particularly in psychiatry. This project utilized international epidemiological and clinical research data to test construct validity across diagnostic categories, health-care settings and countries. Relevant demographic, symptom and diagnostic data were obtained from 33 studies in 21 countries. The subjects had fatigue lasting 1-6 months (prolonged fatigue), or >6 months (chronic fatigue), or met diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.\nCommon symptom domains were derived by factor analytic techniques. Mean scores on each symptom factor were compared across diagnostic categories, health-care settings and countries.\nData were obtained on 37,724 subjects (n = 20,845 female, 57%), including from population-based studies (n = 15,749, 42%), studies in primary care (n = 19 472, 52%), and secondary or specialist tertiary referral clinics (n = 2503, 7%). The sample included 2013 subjects with chronic fatigue, and 1958 with chronic fatigue syndrome. A five-factor model of the key symptom domains was preferred ('musculoskeletal pain/fatigue', 'neurocognitive difficulties', 'inflammation', 'sleep disturbance/fatigue' and 'mood disturbance') and was comparable across subject groups and settings. Although the core symptom profiles were similar, some differences in symptoms were observed across diagnostic categories, health-care settings and between countries.\nThe construct validity of chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome is supported by an empirically derived factor structure from existing international datasets."}, {"Title": "From consultation-liaison psychiatry to integrated care for multiple and complex needs.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to review the ways in which contemporary medicine addresses physical/psychiatric multimorbidity, to review the underlying concepts and methodologies used, and to propose a novel approach that may help consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) position itself better in the health-care field. A Medline search of the terms 'consultation-liaison psychiatry', 'integrated care', 'quality assurance' and 'qualitative methodology', was complemented by study of the literature on complexity theory and by discussions with colleagues in both the health science and sociology fields. There is a growing realization that presentation with multimorbidity of both physical and psychiatric disorders is the norm. Other health-care disciplines have responded quickly to meeting the multiple and complex needs of such patients, attracting funding to an extent that CLP has been unable to achieve. Uncritical application, however, of integrated care technology based on evidence from randomized controlled trials has produced disappointing results. There is a growing realization that such quantitative methods need to be complemented by in-depth exploration using non-traditional methods including qualitative ones, and drawing on complexity theory. The Cochrane Collaboration is exploring this. As CLP and other medical and health-care disciplines face the challenge of patients with multimorbidity, they need to find acceptable answers to the question of what works for whom in what context for patients with multiple and complex needs. CLP can contribute its rich experience in the qualitative approaches that will be needed in research addressing this question, but needs help from other disciplines to refine its techniques so that its contributions are considered valid. The context for implementing effective interventions derived from such studies will in future be that of transdisciplinary teams whose mode of working is empirically based and transparent. CLP is well placed by dint of its psychodynamic and systems theory roots to provide leadership in this transformation in health-care delivery."}, {"Title": "Birth order: self-injurious and suicidal behaviour among adolescents.", "Abstract": "A sample of 2553 children and adolescents in a psychiatry clinic in Germany were assessed using a structured interview inventory that included history of self-injurious behaviour, suicidal intent and socially disruptive and threatening behaviour, and diverse socio-demographic variables (the basis documentation or 'Ba-Do'). Birth order was associated with both suicidal and self-injurious behaviour, middle children being most likely to exhibit such behaviour. Females were more than twice as likely to have self-injured than males. Comparisons of birth order groups within gender found no significant differences in suicidal behaviour between birth positions for males, however among females, middle children were much more likely to have attempted suicide. Conversely, there was no difference in self-injurious behaviour among birth positions in females, but among males, middle children were significantly more likely to have self-injured than firstborns, only children or lastborns. The number of siblings in the family was significantly correlated with both suicidal history (r = 0.12, p < 0.001) and self-injurious behaviour (r = 0.10, p < 0.001). The risk of suicidal behaviour was highest for those with four or more siblings."}, {"Title": "The impact of the CONSORT statement on reporting of randomized clinical trials in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To determine whether the CONSORT recommendations influenced the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of psychiatry, we evaluated the quality of clinical trial reports before and after the introduction of CONSORT statement. We selected seven high impact journals and retrieved the randomized, clinical trials in the field of psychiatry during the period of 1992-1996 (pre-CONSORT) and 2002-2007 (post-CONSORT). Among the total 5201 articles screened, 736 were identified and entered in our database. After critical review of the publications, 442 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The CONSORT Index (sum of 22 items of the checklist) during the post-CONSORT period was significantly higher than that during the pre-CONSORT period. However, over 40% of post-CONSORT studies did not adhere to CONSORT statement for reporting the process of randomization, and details of the process for obtaining informed consent were still insufficient. Furthermore, adherence to the CONSORT guidelines of reporting how blinding was accomplished and evaluated actually decreased after publication of the CONSORT statement. Although the overall quality of reporting on psychiatric RCTs generally improved after publication of the CONSORT statement, reporting the details of randomization, blinding, and obtaining informed consent remain insufficient."}, {"Title": "[Can concepts of neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity explain post-traumatic psychoses?].", "Abstract": "Cases of psychoses emerging after a brain injury, included in the diagnostic category \"Pychotic disorder due to traumatic brain injury,\" are not rare in psychiatry. The authors suggest hypotheses aimed at furthering the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms relating traumatic brain injuries to psychotic disorders. These hypotheses find their starting point in two concepts: neuronal plasticity and the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia. Neuroplasticity is the ability of nerve cells to alter after internal or external changes. The neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia is based on the idea that early impairments in cerebral development could later lead to a schizophrenic disorder; this theory has been integrated into the concept of vulnerability to schizophrenia. The authors hypothesize that traumatic brain injuries lead to neuronal reshaping and that this reshaping could cause impairments in subjects vulnerable to schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Chinese version of the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98: reliability and validity.", "Abstract": "Delirium is commonly seen in patients in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Assessing delirium severity is important in clinical practice. The Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) has been already established as a valid and reliable tool to achieve this goal. This study was aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the DRS-R-98 (DRS-R-98-C) in Taiwan.\nWe recruited 4 patient groups with delirium (n = 28), alcohol dependence (n = 9), dementia (n =11), and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (n = 11) and evaluated them with DRS-R-98-C and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) by 2 psychiatrists at a single assessment session.\nThe results showed that mean DRS-R-98-C total and severity scores in delirious patients were found significantly higher than those in other patient groups. Interrater reliability of the DRS-R-98-C between 2 raters was high, with intraclass correlation coefficient of .98 for severity scale and .99 for total scale. Internal consistency was high with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .85 and .86 for DRS-R-98-C severity and total scales. A significant inverse correlation was found between the DRS-R-98-C and the MMSE score (r = -0.63, P < .001) for either severity or total scale among 28 delirious patients. Area under the curve established by receiver operating characteristic analysis was .93 and .96 for severity and total scales, respectively. Optimal cutoff of total score was 15.5, with sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 96.8%.\nThe DRS-R-98-C is a valid and reliable measure of delirium severity and can be used clinically to monitor the course of illness when administered serially."}, {"Title": "Clinical significance of lifetime panic disorder in the course of bipolar disorder type I.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of lifetime panic disorder (PD) diagnosis in a sample of patients with bipolar disorder type I (BPI), evaluating clinical and demographic variables.\nNinety-five outpatients from the Bipolar Disorder Research Program at the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School were enrolled. Twenty-seven BPI patients with PD were compared to 68 BPI patients without any anxiety disorders regarding clinical and demographic variables.\nCompared to BPI patients without any anxiety disorders, patients with BPI + PD presented significantly higher number of mood episodes (18.9 +/- 13.8 vs 8.5 +/- 7.8; P < .001), depressive episodes (10.8 +/- 8.2 vs 4.6 +/- 4.8; P = .001), and manic episodes (7.4 +/- 7.3 vs 3.6 +/- 3.6; P = .008). Patients with BPI + PD had more frequently a depressive episode as their first one compared to BPI patients without anxiety disorders (94.1% vs 57.5%; P = .011). Patients with BPI + PD had more comorbidity with lifetime diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence (33.3% vs 8.8%; P = .010) and eating disorders (29.6% vs 6.0%; P = .004).\nThe higher number of mood episodes in general presented by patients with BPI + PD when compared with BPI patients without any anxiety disorders, along with the higher frequencies of drug misuse and eating disorders, indicates that PD comorbidity is associated with a poorer course and outcome of BPI. The higher frequency of depression as the onset mood episode and the higher number of manic episodes in the group with PD may have important treatment implications and should be further investigated."}, {"Title": "Nigerian medical students attitudes to unmodified electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and affordable form of treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. Historical antecedents, the media, and movies have generated myths about its continued use and relevance.\nWe explored medical students' knowledge of and attitude to ECT on completion of an 8-week clinical rotation (clerkship) in psychiatry.\nA cross-sectional survey was carried out among final-year medical students at the end of a clerkship in psychiatry using a self-administered questionnaire adapted from previously published work, to assess their attitudes to and knowledge of unmodified ECT.\nKnowledge of medicine, psychiatry, and ECT were self-rated as average by most students. Most had an interest in pursuing psychiatry as a profession and would receive ECT if judged clinically appropriate. Most students had positive attitudes toward ECT; the vast majority thought it was a relevant form of treatment and did not think that ECT was used to control violent or used by government to torture opponents. Although an overwhelming majority did not think ECT was outmoded or causes permanent brain damage, answers about pain associated with ECT and about the dangers associated with the procedure seem to be more evenly split. A minority thought that ECT was used only in the poor and should not be given to the elderly or children. A substantial majority thought that ECT was the treatment of last resort. Respondents who were likely to choose psychiatry as a profession agreed that ECT causes pain, but disagreed that it was used by governments to torture political opponents or that it causes permanent brain damage. Students with minimal knowledge of ECT showed more negative attitudes toward the myth that ECT is misused and should be a treatment of last resort.\nThe similarity of the attitudes of students exposed to unmodified ECT with attitudes of students exposed to modified ECT suggests that modification has made little impact on the attitudes of health professionals. The importance of lectures, patient follow-up while on clinical rotations has significant contributions in shaping attitudes and should be harnessed during training."}, {"Title": "Exploring gender issues in the development from conduct disorder in adolescence to criminal behaviour in adulthood.", "Abstract": "Using results from a large Norwegian follow-up study of former adolescent psychiatric in-patients we have traced the progression from mental disorders requiring hospitalisation in adolescence to registered criminal behaviour in adulthood, particularly highlighting gender differences. A nationwide representative sample of 1095 adolescent psychiatric inpatients (46% females) was followed up 15-33 years after admission to the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Oslo, Norway. In adolescence 45% fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for a disruptive behaviour disorder. At follow-up, 63% of the males and 39% of the females had a criminal record. Among females, psychoactive substance use disorder in adolescence seemed to be a sine qua non for later registered criminality, with intravenous drug use a potent risk factor for life-course-persistent criminality. The same strong association between drug use and criminality was not found in males. Factor analysis demonstrated that while the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder criteria structure was similar across genders, the prevalence of the various forms of expression was different in males and females. The differences between individuals with violent and non-violent crimes were more substantial in males than in females. There were marked gender differences in the criminal profiles observed, with the females' criminal career developing in a less serious manner than in males: females had later criminal debut, a lower number of acts on record, less diverse criminal behaviour, and an escalation in the severity of offences over time was less frequently encountered. However, secular trend analyses indicated that gender differences had diminished over the last several decades, with females \"catching up\" with their male counterparts. Overall, the results demonstrated important qualitative and quantitative gender differences in the criminal behaviour of former adolescent psychiatric in-patients. The results may be of use in prevention."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric neuroimaging has made great strides.

Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is frequent in major depression and hypercortisolemia may be a mediating factor in these relationships. The aim of this study was to assess HPA axis function measured with the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in relation to CVD and CHD mortality in a cohort of 382 inpatients with mood disorder admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000. Death certificates ascertained that 75 patients had died of cardiovascular disease and 30 patients of CHD during the mean follow-up of 18 years. DST non-suppression and higher baseline serum cortisol predicted CVD death. In male inpatients with mood disorder, the DST non-suppressor status was significantly associated with CVD death but not with CHD death. In depressed female inpatients the DST non-suppression was not associated with cardiovascular mortality. Baseline serum cortisol and post-dexamethasone serum cortisol levels at 4:00 p.m. showed a trend to be higher in female CVD/CHD victims.

The two disorders most commonly associated with offending behaviour, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy, are also less prevalent in female samples. However, developments in forensic psychiatry have often ignored gender, and the utility of constructs such as psychopathy and their assessment instruments in female samples remains unclear. This article presents a review of studies looking at rates of ASPD and psychopathy and on the reliability and validity of assessment instruments of these disorders in women. Gender differences in symptom patterns will be considered. The literature seems to suggest that DSM-IV criteria for ASPD may lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of the disorder in women due to the requirement of childhood conduct disorder symptoms. The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) is a valid and reliable instrument to identify psychopathy in women but there are gender differences in the factor structure and item loadings on this measure. Research to date seems to suggest a three-factor model may be most strongly supported in females. Preliminary evidence suggests the PCL-R may have some value in predicting future offending while the PCL:SV may be useful in predicting institutional violence.

Anthropology has taught us to pay attention to the transactions between local-level actors and those operating at the global level in the construction of this new world of medicine. This article examines the role played by the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee of Mental Health in the reform of the French mental health system during the 1950s. Rooted in the experience of practitioners and administrators participating in the process of reforming local psychiatric systems, the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee developed a new vision of regulating psychiatry, based on professionalism and an idea of a normativity of the doctor-patient relation. This article shows how, by mobilizing the WHO reports' recommendations, French administrators and doctors succeeded in creating a typically French object: \"the psychiatric sector\", founded on elaborating a new mandate for the psychiatric profession. The article thus questions the deinstitutionalization model as an explanation of transformations of the structure of the French psychiatry system in the post-war period."}, {"Title": "A review of the natural course of bipolar disorders (manic-depressive psychosis) in the pre-drug era: review of studies prior to 1950.", "Abstract": "A review of the most important original studies describing the natural course of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive psychosis) published in the pre-drug era - before 1950 - is conducted. Discrepancies among studies are detected, most of which are likely explained by methodological differences. However, some conclusions from these old studies remain perfectly valid nowadays: mania is a chronic brain disorder, inherited in most cases, decompensation being more frequent between March and August. It is more common in males, and in some cases, is secondary to other somatic problems. Mixed states are more frequent in the elderly.

Due to the clinical similarity of these dissociative states with neurological symptoms, optimal treatment is often hampered and lies on the border between psychiatric and neurologic approaches. Diagnostic work-up as well as the therapy may prove to be complex and tedious, partly due to the underlying psychopathology of these patients.

In the mammalian experimental systems investigated thus far, epigenetic mechanisms have been linked to associative fear conditioning, extinction of learned fear, and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory formation. Intriguingly, in one experimental system epigenetic marks at the level of chromatin structure (histone acetylation) have been linked to the recovery of memories that had seemed to be \"lost\" (i.e., not available for recollection). Environmental enrichment has long been known to have positive effects on memory capacity, and recent studies have suggested that these effects are at least partly due to the recruitment of epigenetic mechanisms by environmental enrichment. Finally, an uncoupling of signal transduction pathways from the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms in the nucleus has been implicated in the closure of developmental critical periods. Taken together, these eclectic findings suggest a new perspective on experience-dependent dynamic regulation of epigenetic mechanisms in the adult nervous system and their relevance to biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Alcohol Education Inventory-Revised: what every mental health professional should know about alcohol.", "Abstract": "In 1995, Miller and C'de Baca created a 50-item measure, the Alcohol Education Inventory (AEI), to assess mental health professionals' basic knowledge of alcohol and alcohol problems.

Without a track record of published research and lacking internationally recognized clinicians, it failed to impress the British Medical Research Council. To challenge leading U.S. and German departments of neuropsychiatry, Edward Mapother, the medical superintendent, looked overseas for investment in an \"institute of psychiatry.\" Intense lobbying and a modified strategy for research and training designed to meet the Rockefeller Foundation's prioritization of psychiatry and medical specialization ultimately led to a significant endowment. Alan Gregg and Daniel O'Brien at the Foundation played a pivotal role in re-defining the Maudsley's programs of research and teaching. Pressure on Mapother to attract funding was matched by that on administrators required to show that their philanthropy had yielded tangible gains in public health. While wealthy charities, like the Rockefeller, often had a vision of the direction that they wished to pull medical science, and they provided much needed income, the impact of their policy agenda was not without drawbacks. Institutions unwilling to embrace a charity's philosophy were unlikely to secure grants, while those that did might find themselves drawn into less optimal areas."}, {"Title": "The future (or lack of future) of personalized prescription in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Rapid technological advances in genetics have created conceptual chaos regarding the genetics of drug response. Terms for differing concepts are used interchangeably: pharmacogenetics with pharmacogenomics, personalized medicine with personalized prescription. Biomarker has many definitions. The author prefers the concept of personalized prescription and uses it with implications beyond pharmacogenetics by considering all scientific information valid for prescribing medication. Genetics may not be crucial for all drugs. In this comprehensive view, clinicians must consider genetic, environmental and personal variables when prescribing medication and incorporate some basic pharmacological principles: (1) safety and efficacy, (2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, (3) therapeutic window and prescriber's role, and (4) idiosyncratic and dose-related adverse drug reactions. Personalized prescription in the clinical environment can be expressed in two main ways: as personalized selection of the drug and as personalized dosing. The future, or lack of future, of personalized drug selection and of personalized dosing in psychiatry is reviewed. Currently, the author thinks that, in psychiatry, pharmacogenetic tests have some potential in two areas: (1) excluding some drugs for some unusual patients (HLA-B*1502 genotyping in Asians for carbamazepine), and (2) using pharmacokinetic genes for personalizing dosing in narrow therapeutic window drugs. In the short term, there is dubious potential for other pharmacogenetic tests and no potential for pharmacogenetic testing to ascertain the best drug for each patient. Personalized dosing has immediate application if one understands it as the use of our current scientific knowledge of genetic, environmental and personal variables to determine dosing; its sole requirement is well-trained psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "ADHD in adult psychiatry. Minimum rates and clinical presentation in general psychiatry outpatients.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and comorbidity of persisting attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult psychiatric outpatients. Consecutive patients, first visits excluded, at a general psychiatric outpatient clinic were offered a screening for childhood ADHD with the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS). One hundred and forty-one patients out of 398 (35%) completed and returned the scale. Patients above or near cut-off for ADHD (n=57) were offered an extensive clinical evaluation with psychiatric as well as neuropsychological examination. The attrition was analysed regarding age, sex and clinical diagnoses. Out of the screened sample, 40% had scores indicating possible childhood ADHD. These 57 patients were invited to the clinical part of the study, but 10 declined assessment, leaving 47 (37 women and 10 men) who were actually examined. Thirty of these (21 women and nine men) met diagnostic criteria for ADHD at the time of examination. Among the patients with ADHD, affective disorders were the most common psychiatric diagnoses. The rate of alcohol and/or substance abuse, as noted in the medical records, was also high in the ADHD group. In the WURS-screened group, 22% (30 patients assessed as part of this study and one person with ADHD previously clinically diagnosed) were shown to have persisting ADHD. Therefore, it is clearly relevant for psychiatrists working in general adult psychiatry to have ADHD in mind as a diagnostic option, either as the patient's main problem or as a functional impairment predisposing for other psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "[Developmental problems in young adults suffering from mental illness: results from an in-depth interview study].", "Abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the impact of mental illness on the general psycho-social development of young adults.\nResults from an in-depth interview study with 16 young adults (20 to 31 years old) suffering from mental illness are presented. Particularly, illness-related issues were explored from the perspective of developmental psychology.\nCoping with typical developmental tasks of early adulthood (e. g. autonomy; intimate relationships; vocational training) is impeded. At the same time, young patients wish as much normality as possible in their daily life, e. g. social contacts with not-affected peers. In many cases, young adults affected try to maintain a cautious distance to psychiatric facilities as well as to other patients.\nYoung people suffering from mental illness are in a complicated process of identity formation, as they have to integrate the illness into their self-concept and their daily life (illness-identity work). Hence, their assistance needs are different from those of older patients. It is a challenge for community based psychiatry to provide help offers which meet the specific requirements of young mentally ill people."}, {"Title": "Using longitudinal data from a clinical trial in depression to assess the reliability of its outcome scales.", "Abstract": "Longitudinal studies are permeating clinical trials in psychiatry. Additionally, in the same field, rating scales are frequently used to evaluate the status of the patients and the efficacy of new therapeutic procedures. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study the psychometric properties of these instruments within a longitudinal framework. In the area of depression, the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) is regularly used for antidepressant treatment evaluation. However, the use of HAMD has not been exempted from criticism what has lead to the development of new scales that are expected to be more sensitive for change, such as the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). In general, the reliability of these scales has been extensively studied by using classical methods for reliability estimation, developed for specifically designed reliability studies. Unfortunately, the settings customarily considered in these reliability studies are usually far from the practical conditions in which these scales are applied in clinical trials and practice. In the present paper, we assess the reliability of these instruments in a more realistic scenario thereby using longitudinal data coming from clinical studies. Nowadays, newly developed methodology based on an extended concept of reliability, allows us to use longitudinal data for reliability estimation. This new approach not only enables to avoid bias by offering a better control of disturbing factors but it also produces more precise estimates by taking advantage of the large sample taking sizes available in clinical trials. Further, it offers practical guidelines for an optimal use of a rating scale in order to achieve a particular level of reliability. The merits of this new approach are illustrated by applying it on two clinical trials in depression to assess the reliability of the three outcome scales, HAMD, MADRS, and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA)."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy in forensic psychiatry--ethical problems in daily practice.", "Abstract": "There is a widespread similarity between diagnoses in general psychiatry compared with those found in forensic psychiatry. Consequently, forensic psychiatrists face serious cases that need to undergo treatment by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Although it is a well known and valid treatment, ECT is rarely applied to forensic-psychiatric patients or prisoners as well. This might be due to the general assumption that detained individuals, either in forensic psychiatry or in prisons, will not be chosen for a therapy, which is merely looked on as an emergency treatment. Besides, informed consent might be estimated not valid in such persons. However, the use of ECT in forensic psychiatry or prisons cannot be denied anymore because diagnoses and indications for ECT parallel the situation in general psychiatry. With the numbers of schizophrenic and depressive patients considerably increasing in the past years in our forensic unit, we estimate the indication for ECT in forensic psychiatry of approximately 3% and 12.5%, respectively."}, {"Title": "Working with reactant patients: are we prescribing nonadherence?", "Abstract": "In spite of high levels of antidepressant nonadherence frequently observed among depressed samples, relatively little research has investigated psychosocial predictors of adherence. Fostering greater collaboration in depression treatment to increase adherence has been advocated, but this strategy has not been adequately studied. The aim of this study was to examine the interaction of provider collaboration and patient reactance in the prediction of antidepressant adherence during the acute treatment phase.\nFifty outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder beginning antidepressant treatment within psychiatry clinics of the VA San Diego Healthcare System comprised the study sample. Patients were administered questionnaires following their medication evaluations to measure predictor variables. Antidepressant adherence was assessed via brief telephone interviews 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation. The roles of provider collaboration, patient reactance, and their interaction in adherence were examined using multiple regression analyses.\nThe interaction between provider collaboration and patient reactance accounted for 18.3% of the variance in 3-week adherence (P<.01). Among more reactant patients, greater levels of collaboration predicted better adherence, whereas among patients lower in reactance less collaboration predicted better adherence. No relationships were observed beyond the initial 3 weeks of treatment.\nThis study demonstrates that interpersonal process variables are important in influencing antidepressant adherence and challenges the advocacy of more collaboration in antidepressant treatment as a \"blanket strategy.\" Establishing a more collaborative set with reactant patients may ensure greater early treatment adherence, a critical period during which antidepressants have typically not yet taken effect."}, {"Title": "Predicting social isolation among geriatric psychiatry patients.", "Abstract": "This exploratory study examines factors associated with isolation from informal social ties among geriatric psychiatry inpatients.

Mood disorders were also associated with a lower odds of isolation, while a history of a personality disorder and a personal biography of institutionalization were both clearly associated with an increased odds for isolation. Although significant bivariate predictors in the multivariate model, both schizophrenic and organic diagnoses failed to reach statistical significance. In addition, patients hospitalized at an earlier age and/or predicted to have a longer stay on the current admission were much less likely to have contact with informal supports. Of the study variables indexing functional status, only activities of daily living (ADLs) remained a significant predictor for isolation in the final multivariate model.\nThe analyses demonstrate the detrimental effects of an earlier life experience with mental illness. Having an earlier age of illness onset may lead to a potentially greater impairment in establishing and maintaining informal social ties throughout the life course into older age. These analyses reinforce the need for comprehensive assessment of patients on admission and over time."}, {"Title": "Glenside Hospital's role in the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery to Australian psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper records the introduction of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and psychosurgery to Australia at Parkside Mental Hospital (present day Glenside Hospital) in South Australia.\nA review of treatment provided at Glenside Hospital since its inception in 1870.\nThe desperate plight of patients and the limited array of interventions leading up to the introduction of ECT and psychosurgery are noted.

Yet, there is also a lack of clarity about the role of the concept of free will in forensic psychiatry. Recently, Morse has argued that forensic psychiatrists should not mention free will in their reports or testimonies, and, moreover, that they should not even think about free will. Starting from a discussion on Morse's claims, I will develop my own view on how forensic psychiatrists are confronted with the issue of free will and how they should deal with this concept and the confusion surrounding it. I conclude that psychiatrists should at least feel free to think about free will and that the conceptual challenges connected to the issues of free will and accountability could rather encourage than deter forensic psychiatrists to think about them."}, {"Title": "A model for self-treatment of four sub-types of symptomatic 'depression' using non-prescription agents: neuroticism (anxiety and emotional instability); malaise (fatigue and painful symptoms); demotivation (anhedonia) and seasonal affective disorder 'SAD'.", "Abstract": "This article will present a model for how 'depression' (i.e. depressive symptoms) can be divided into four self-diagnosed sub-types or causes which might then be self-treated using agents available without prescription. (Another, much rarer, cause of depressed symptoms is the classical illness of 'melancholia', which when severe cannot be self-treated and typically requires hospitalization.) A self-management option and alternative is now needed due to the an inappropriate emphasis of modern psychiatry on treatment of imprecise syndromal 'disorders' which may entail treating 'depression' at the cost of making the patient feel and function worse. By contrast, the basic theoretical stance of self-management is that depressed mood should be seen as a result of unpleasant symptoms - and it is the symptoms that require treatment, not the mood itself. Furthermore, drugs (or other interventions) need to be classified in terms of their potential therapeutic effects on these symptoms that may cause depressed mood. The four common causes of depressed mood considered here are the personality trait of Neuroticism; the state of malaise (fatigue, aching etc) which accompanies an illness with an activated immune system; demotivation due to lack of positive emotions (anhedonia); and the syndrome of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Each of the four sub-types is then 'matched' with a first-line non-prescription agent. The 'stabilizing' agents such as St John's Wort and the antihistamines chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine are used for treatment of Neuroticism; analgesics/pain killers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol/acetaminophen and the opiates are used to treat malaise; energizing agents such as caffeine and nicotine are used for the treatment of demotivation; and bright light used in the early morning to treat SAD. Self-treatments are intended to be used after research and experimentally, on a trial-and-error basis; with self-monitoring of beneficial and harmful effects, and a willingness to stop and switch treatments. The model of S-DTM (self-diagnosis, self-treatment and self-monitoring) is suggested as potentially applicable more widely within psychiatry and medicine."}, {"Title": "Interventionist causal models in psychiatry: repositioning the mind-body problem.", "Abstract": "The diversity of research methods applied to psychiatric disorders results in a confusing plethora of causal claims. To help make sense of these claims, the interventionist model (IM) of causality has several attractive features. First, it connects causation with the practical interests of psychiatry, defining causation in terms of 'what would happen under interventions', a question of key interest to those of us whose interest is ultimately in intervening to prevent and treat illness. Second, it distinguishes between predictive-correlative and true causal relationships, an essential issue cutting across many areas in psychiatric research. Third, the IM is non-reductive and agnostic to issues of mind-body problem. Fourth, the IM model cleanly separates issues of causation from questions about the underlying mechanism. Clarifying causal influences can usefully structure the search for underlying mechanisms. Fifth, it provides a sorely needed conceptual rigor to multi-level modeling, thereby avoiding a return to uncritical holistic approaches that 'everything is relevant' to psychiatric illness. Sixth, the IM provides a clear way to judge both the generality and depth of explanations. In conclusion, the IM can provide a single, clear empirical framework for the evaluation of all causal claims of relevance to psychiatry and presents psychiatry with a method of avoiding the sterile metaphysical arguments about mind and brain which have preoccupied our field but yielded little of practical benefit."}, {"Title": "The BMC ACCESS project: the development of a medically enhanced safe haven shelter.", "Abstract": "This paper describes the development and implementation of the Boston Medical Center (BMC) Advanced Clinical Capacity for Engagement, Safety, and Services Project.

Next, the first generation of five DNA pharmacogenomic tests used in the clinical practice of psychiatry is briefly reviewed. Then the possible involvement of these pharmacogenomic tests in the exploration of early clinical proof of mechanism is described by using two of the tests and one example from the pharmaceutical industry (iloperidone clinical trials). The initial attempts to use other microarray tests (measuring RNA expression) as peripheral biomarkers for CNS disorders are briefly described. Then the challenge of taking pharmacogenomic tests (compared to drugs) into clinical practice is explained by focusing on regulatory oversight, the methodological/scientific issues concerning diagnostic tests, and cost-effectiveness issues. Current information on medicine-based evidence and cost-effectiveness usually focuses on average patients and not the outliers who are most likely to benefit from personalized prescription. Finally, future research directions are suggested.

The success of this paradigm has issued from comparable cognitive skills, brain morphology, and social complexity in adult monkeys and humans. Recently, interest in biological psychiatry has focused on similar brain, social, and emotional developmental processes in monkeys. In part, this is related to evidence that early postnatal experiences in human development may have profound implications for subsequent mental health. Non-human primate studies of postnatal phenomenon have generally fallen into three basic categories: experiential manipulation (largely manipulations of rearing), pharmacological manipulation (eg drug-induced psychosis), and anatomical localization (defined by strategic surgical damage). Although these efforts have been very informative each of them has certain limitations. In this review we highlight general findings from the non-human primate postnatal developmental literature and their implications for primate models in psychiatry. We argue that primates are uniquely capable of uncovering interactions between genes, environmental challenges, and development resulting in altered risk for psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Social and emotional outcomes of child sexual abuse: a clinical sample in Turkey.", "Abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse is a traumatic life event that may cause psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.

The majority of the participants in the study reported a serious decline in their overall well being following the incident, however, only very few undertook legal steps; only in three cases did it come to a legal procedure. The assumption that sexual contacts in psychotherapy result in extremely damaging consequences to patients, which the first study already revealed, was affirmed in the follow-up examination. Despite the changed legal situation, however, therapists in Germany are still not held legally responsible more often than they were 10 years ago."}, {"Title": "The primacy of mania: a reconsideration of mood disorders.", "Abstract": "In contemporary psychiatry, depression and mania are conceived as different entities. They may occur together, as in bipolar disorder, or they may occur separately, as in unipolar depression. This view is partly based on a narrow definition of mania and a rather broad definition of depression. Generally, depression is seen as more prominent, common, and problematic; while mania appears uncommon and treatment-responsive. We suggest a reversal: mania viewed broadly, not as simply episodic euphoria plus hyperactivity, but a wide range of excitatory behaviors; and depression seen more narrowly. Further, using pharmacological and clinical evidence, and in contrast to previous theories of mania interpreted as a flight from depression, we propose the primacy of mania hypothesis (PM): depression is a consequence of the excitatory processes of mania. If correct, current treatment of depressive illness needs revision. Rather than directly lifting mood with antidepressants, the aim would be to suppress manic-like excitation, with depression being secondarily prevented. Potential objections to, and empirical tests of, the PM hypothesis are discussed."}, {"Title": "Outcome among community dwelling older adults with schizophrenia: results using five conceptual models.", "Abstract": "There have been few studies examining the outcome of schizophrenia in later life. Using five conceptual models, we test two hypotheses with respect to range of outcomes among older schizophrenia outpatients and how they compare to their age peers in the community. We operationalized five outcome measures from the following conceptual models: Remission, adapting criteria of Andreasen et al. (The American Journal of Psychiatry, 162:441-449, 2005); Recovery, adapting the criteria by Liberman et al. (International Review of Psychiatry, 14:256-272, 2002); Community Integration using the model of Wong and Solomon (Mental Health Services Research, 4:13-28, 2002); Subjective and Objective Successful Aging using the model of Rowe and Kahn (Science, 237:143-149, 1987). The schizophrenia (S) group consisted of 198 community-dwelling persons aged 55 and over who developed schizophrenia before age 45 and a community comparison (CC) group (N = 113). Remission and recovery criteria were met by 49 and 17% of the S group, respectively. There were significant differences between the S and CC groups in the distribution of community integration and successful aging scales: 41% of the CC group met at least 10 of 12 criteria versus 23% of the S group on the Community Integration Scale; 19% of the CC group met all six criteria vs. 2% of the S group on the Objective Successful Aging Scale; 27% of the CC group vs. 13% of the S group met all six criteria on the Subjective Successful Aging Scale. Correlations among the five outcome measures ranged from r = .19 to .48 (median value: r = .26 or 7% shared variance). There is wide variability in outcome in later life depending on which measure is used. Rather than one universal indicator, each measure offers a different perspective that can provide useful guidelines for researchers, clinicians, and policy makers."}, {"Title": "Why should addiction medicine be an attractive field for young physicians?", "Abstract": "The clinical practice and science of addiction are increasingly active fields, which are attracting professionals from diverse disciplines such as psychology and neurobiology. Our scientific knowledge of the pathophysiology of addiction is rapidly growing, along with the variety of effective treatments available to clinicians. Yet, we believe that the medical specialties of addiction medicine/psychiatry are not attracting the interest and enthusiasm of young physicians. What can be done?\nWe offer the opinions of two experience addiction psychiatrists.\nIn the US, there has been a decline in the number of psychiatrists seeking training or board certification in addiction psychiatry; about one-third of graduates with such training are not practicing in an addiction psychiatry setting. There is widespread neglect of addiction medicine/psychiatry among the medical profession, academia and national health authorities. This neglect is unfortunate, given the enormous societal costs of addiction (3-5% of the gross domestic product in some developed countries), the substantial unmet need for addiction treatment, and the highly favourable benefit to cost yield (at least 7:1) from treatment.\nWe believe that addiction medicine/psychiatry can be made more attractive for young physicians. Helpful steps include widening acceptance as a medical specialty or subspecialty, reducing the social stigma against people with substance use disorders, expanding insurance coverage and increasing the low rates of reimbursement for physicians. These steps would be easier to take with broader societal (and political) recognition of substance use disorders as a major cause of premature death, morbidity and economic burden."}, {"Title": "[Joint crisis plans in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "To give an overview about definitions, practice and effects of joint crisis plans in psychiatry.\nSystematic literature review.\nDifferent types of joint crisis plans have been emerging within the last decade mostly in North America and Great Britain.

Psychiatric help is sought in only a small proportion of cases, although it is probable that the psychopathological aetiology is more frequent than generally recognized. This article deals with the causes and psychological circumstances in four Turkish couples who presented with unconsummated marriage for 3 to 7 years. Vaginismus F52.5 to the ICD-10 is a sexual dysfunction characterised as: deep anxiety about coitus leading to extreme spasm of musculature making coitus impossible or extremely unpleasant and painful.\nFour Turkish couples with unconsummated marriage due to the female partners' penetration phobia were included to this study. A patient-oriented multidimensional individual treatment (combination therapy) is a cost effective, short-term (typically 10- to 12-week) treatment model for both partners. It includes some elements of cognitive behavioural therapy and systemic partner therapy which were considered not radically different from previous therapeutic strategies.\nResults were successful in all cases; the couples were extremely satisfied with having a normal sex life for the first time. This led to desired pregnancies and avoiding of possible breakdown of their families.\nThe couples did well with combination behavioural therapy. This methodology is discussed in its various aspects and with a cultural background. We also emphasise the need for physicians to be mindful of cases of vaginismus requiring psychiatric intervention rather than gynaecological treatment."}, {"Title": "A university psychotherapy training program in a psychiatric hospital: 25 years of the conversational model in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe the development, delivery and experience of a university psychotherapy training program for psychiatry trainees in a public psychiatric hospital, demonstrating that patients with severe borderline personality disorder can be treated successfully with psychodynamic psychotherapy and stressing the need for structured psychodynamic psychotherapy training in psychiatry.\nTwo of the authors (JH and JS) were part of the first group of eight trainees supervised by Professor Russell Meares and several other experienced psychiatrists.\nNinety trainees have successfully completed the course. Two hundred and forty patients have been treated by trainees in this program to date; 49 patients have dropped out.\nThe training program provided a sound psychodynamic base and an improved capacity to relate with our patients, not only in the program but also in our routine work as psychiatrists. An important public health issue and community need was addressed, which also proved to make sound economic sense as the number of patients who were treated might not have otherwise received long-term psychotherapy. An integrated process model of psychoanalytic psychotherapy--the conversational model--has evolved and continues to be offered as a 3-year part-time clinically oriented course leading to a Masters in Medicine, Psychotherapy at the University of Sydney.

Previous studies utilizing self-report questionnaires indicate that many medical students regard clinical work with psychiatric patients as unappealing, while the professionalism literature has documented a general decline in students' capacity for empathy over the course of medical school. Through in-depth interviews, this study attempts to better understand the formation of medical students' perceptions of psychiatry and the implications of that process for a more general understanding of the impact of emotionally-laden experiences on medical students' capacity for empathy. Forty-seven fourth-year medical students who had expressed interest or performed well in psychiatry were asked a series of questions to elicit their perceptions of the field of psychiatry. Interview transcripts were systematically coded using content analysis and principles of grounded theory. Stigma, stereotypes, and stressfully intense emotional reactions seemed to adversely affect the students' expected satisfaction from and willingness to care for the mentally ill, despite enjoying psychiatry's intellectual content and the opportunity to develop in-depth relationships with patients. Teaching faculty need to directly address the stigma and stereotypes that surround mental illness and actively help medical students cope with the stress that they report experiencing during their psychiatry clerkship in order to improve the recognition and treatment of psychiatric illness by newly graduating physicians. More generally, the relationships that we identify among stress, stigmatization, and stereotyping along an empathic spectrum suggest that increased attention should be paid to the stress that empathy can entail. This perspective may allow for the creation of similarly targeted interventions throughout the medical school curriculum to counteract the decline in empathy, the so-called \"hardening of the heart,\" associated with physician-training worldwide."}, {"Title": "Training in cognitive behavioral therapy in psychiatry residency: an overview for educators.", "Abstract": "In January 2001, Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education accredited general psychiatry training programs were charged with the requirement to train residents in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to a level of competence.

Effective education in CBT in general and child and adolescent psychiatry residency training can be more successful when educators understand the barriers to implementation of empirically supported therapies (ESTs).

Exhaustive Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) was employed for statistical data segmentation.\nResults indicate that the rapidly increasing adoption of electronic prescription is diminished by relatively low physician utilization. E-prescription utilization was segmented among practice size and type. There were also differences in e-prescription use by age, gender, and ethnicity/race in some subgroups. Actual use of e-prescription was very low for female physicians in surgical specialties, psychiatry, and obstetrics/gynecology, and for Hispanic physicians in pediatrics, internal medicine, and family/general practice in solo/two physician practices, medical schools, and hospitals.\nInsights from segmentation analyses could be used to identify adoption barriers and to develop targeted interventions to accelerate the implementation of e-prescription systems in physician practices."}, {"Title": "Five systems of psychiatric classification for preschool children: do differences in validity, usefulness and reliability make for competitive or complimentary constellations?", "Abstract": "DSM-IV and ICD-10 have limitations in the diagnostic classification of psychiatric disorders at preschool age (0-5 years).

As CRF expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is important in adaptation to chronic stress, we hypothesized that unrestrained synthesis of CRF in CeA would mimic the consequences of chronic stress exposure and cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increase emotionality and disrupt reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we used a lentiviral vector to increase CRF-expression site specifically in CeA of female rats. Increased synthesis of CRF in CeA amplified CRF and arginine vasopressin peptide concentration in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and decreased glucocorticoid negative feedback, both markers associated with the pathophysiology of depression. In addition, continuous expression of CRF in CeA also increased the acoustic startle response and depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. Protein levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the medial preoptic area were significantly reduced by continuous expression of CRF in CeA and this was associated with a lengthening of estrous cycles. Finally, sexual motivation but not sexual receptivity was significantly attenuated by continuous CRF synthesis in ovariectomized estradiol-progesterone-primed females. These data indicate that unrestrained CRF synthesis in CeA produces a dysregulation of the HPA axis, as well as many of the behavioral, physiological and reproductive consequences associated with stress-related disorders.Molecular Psychiatry (2009) 14, 37-50; doi:10.1038/mp.2008.91; published online 12 August 2008."}, {"Title": "[Forensic psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry is an important part of psychiatry which is especially in public view.

The present study utilizes a naturalistic, longitudinal, short-interval follow-up design to elucidate the course of anxiety disorders over 14 years in a largely middle-aged adult sample recruited from out-patient psychiatry and primary care facilities.\nThe sample consisted of 453 participants with a diagnosis of panic disorder (PD), social phobia (SP) and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Anxiety symptom ratings were tracked using weekly psychiatric status ratings (PSRs). Controlling for demographic and clinical variables, the course of PD, GAD and SP were examined using longitudinal growth models, with the most severe PSR at each follow-up point as the main outcome variable.\nPSRs significantly decreased in severity over time in each of the three disorders. In the interaction effects models, age x time had a significant effect on course for PD and GAD, but not for SP, in that older age was associated with lower PSRs over time.\nThe present findings suggest that the severity of anxiety disorders declines over time, although this decline is modest and depends on the specific disorder being assessed. Older individuals with PD and GAD have a better prognosis than their younger counterparts, as their course is characterized by a steeper decline in severity.

Edmund Forster, his psychiatrist at that time, is supposed to have suggested to Hitler that he would be ordained as Germany's redeemer in times of defeat, thus causing a profound change in his patient's personality.\nFollowing three lines of argument, this paper examines if such an assumption can be made plausible. Firstly, it takes a close look at the main historical source which is the novel THE EYEWITNESS, written in German language by the Czech-Jewish author Ernst Weiss. Then it asks if Forster is likely to have chosen hypnosis as a method of treatment. Finally, it exploits the work of the even lesser known author Alexander Moritz Frey who happened to serve close to Hitler as a medical orderly in WW I, thus trying to validate whether or not Hitler really underwent a change of personality in autumn 1918.\nAlthough the eventualities of such a hypnotic treatment or a profound change in Hitler's behaviour in that time cannot be disproved, both seem highly unlikely.\nS One should altogether abandon the notion of Hitler having suffered a permanent change of personality in 1918, be it due to psychiatric treatment or to psychological trauma itself."}, {"Title": "Practice patterns and treatment choices among psychiatrists in New Delhi, India: a qualitative and quantitative study.", "Abstract": "Several issues relevant to the care of Asian Indian patients remain poorly explored.

We used triangulated, qualitative methods from data gathered in India (ethnographic interviews with 16 Delhi psychiatrists, observation of treatment in India, and treatment of Indian patients) to design and validate a survey distributed to a sample of 34 psychiatrists in New Delhi and 34 in Baltimore, Maryland who treat Indian patients.\nDelhi psychiatrists saw more patients daily (24.3 vs. 11, P<0.001), and spent less time on new evaluations (33.3 vs. 69 min, P<0.001). Both groups had similar approaches to major disorders. But, Delhi psychiatrists were less likely to combine medication treatment with psychotherapy (P<0.05), and more likely to advise families to secretly administer medications in treatment refusal, such as in acute schizophrenia (P<0.001) or major depression (P<0.01).\nThese differences highlight the salience of local cultural context in the practice of psychiatry and in the treatment of Indian patients. Delhi psychiatrists are overwhelmed by the epidemic levels of untreated illness, spend less time with patients, and rely more heavily on medication treatment. Delhi psychiatrists employ unique approaches to handling difficult treatment issues, such as treatment refusal, intensive involvement of the family, and recommendations to the family about suitability for marriage for a patient."}, {"Title": "Brain lithium levels and effects on cognition and mood in geriatric bipolar disorder: a lithium-7 magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.", "Abstract": "The authors investigated the relationship between brain lithium, serum lithium and age in adult subjects treated with lithium.

For these older subjects elevations in brain (but not serum) lithium levels were associated with frontal lobe dysfunction and higher HDRS scores. The higher HDRS were associated with increased somatic symptoms.\nFrontal lobe dysfunction and elevated depression symptoms correlating with higher brain lithium levels supports conservative dosing recommendations in bipolar older adults.

At that time little was known about the science of addiction, so our program from the very beginning was designed to gather data about the nature of addiction and measure the effects of available treatments. In other words, the goals were always a combination of treatment and research. This combination has continued to the present day. A human laboratory for the study of addiction phenomena such as conditioned responses was also founded in 1971. The key clinician investigators in this group have remained in the Center since the 1970s with most of the research staff continuing to work together. Important new investigators have been added over the years. Treatment was empirically based with randomized, controlled clinical trials as the gold standard for determining evidence-based treatment. The patients coming to treatment do not distinguish between abuse of alcohol and other drugs, so the treatment and research programs have always focused on all drugs including ethyl alcohol and the combination of ethyl alcohol with other drugs such as cocaine and opioids. Most of the patients coming for treatment also suffered from additional psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Thus, the addiction treatment program in 1980 absorbed the rest of the VA Psychiatry Service into the Substance Abuse Program forming a new Behavioral Health Service with responsibility for over 9000 patients. The integration of substance abuse treatment with overall mental health care was the most efficient way to handle patients with complicated combinations of disorders. While this continues to be the best way to treat patients, it has proven difficult in practice. The main reason for this difficulty is that most mental health therapists whether they are psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers feel very inadequate to handle substance abuse problems. Unless they have had specialized training in addictive disorders, therapists are likely to be uncomfortable if substance abuse is one of the diagnoses while they may be quite comfortable treating other complex disorders such as schizophrenia. This lack of education of clinicians remains a major problem for our field. Some of the findings that came out of both the Penn/VA laboratory and clinical studies are now widely accepted and form the basis of standard clinical practice.

In these seminars Heidegger is highly critical of psychoanalysis, because of its causal and objectifying approach to the human being. In general, Heidegger considers it an objectification or even an elimination of the human being to approach a patient from a causal perspective. In our view Heidegger has overlooked the peculiar nature and complexity of psychotherapy and psychiatry, namely that psychiatry is not just a discipline that combines a hermeneutical approach and a natural science approach on a theoretical level, but it also deals with psychopathology in practice. We argue, also referring to Strawson and Gadamer, that in psychiatric practice causal explanation and hermeneutic understanding are no mutually exclusive approaches. We conclude that the encounter of philosophy and psychiatry in matters of causality and motivation could be particularly fruitful when the practical situation is addressed, recognizing the special character of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "On the psychometric validity of the domains of the PDSQ: an illustration of the bi-factor item response theory model.", "Abstract": "Competing item response theory (IRT) models were used to test the factor structure of the psychiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire (PDSQ; Zimmerman M, Mattia JI.

Primary dimension loadings were low to moderate; group factor loadings were moderate to high. Results support the validity of the PDSQ in identifying distinct categories of illness as defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual diagnostic groups, since preserving the 15 symptom categories (domains) provided a more accurate characterization of the observed data by the IRT models. The bi-factor model is useful in evaluating the multidimensional structure of mental health data.

First, during working seminars, consultants and postgraduate trainees were interviewed about the characteristics of the learning and working in CAP. These interviews were audio taped, transcribed and analyzed for recurrent themes to identify key issues. Descriptive results were fed back to the participants for validation.

About half (55%) of patients were psychosocially \"well\" (RIFT< or =8) during the first month post-A-CT. C-CT improved psychosocial functioning only transiently compared to the assessment control. Examined prospectively, depressive symptom level did not predict monthly changes in psychosocial functioning significantly, whereas psychosocial dysfunction level predicted monthly changes in depressive symptoms and relapse/recurrence.\nFindings may not generalize to other patient populations, treatments, and assessment methods. The cross-lagged correlational data structure allows only tentative conclusions about the causal effect of psychosocial functioning on depressive symptoms.\nThe RIFT is a valid measure of psychosocial functioning among responders to A-CT for depression. After such response, deteriorations in psychosocial functioning may signal imminent major depressive relapse/recurrence and provide targets for change during treatments focused on relapse/recurrence prevention."}, {"Title": "Association study between the PIK4CA gene and methamphetamine use disorder in a Japanese population.", "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathways have been involved in the secretion of dopamine (DA) and the regulation of DA transporter, which is a target of methamphetamine (METH). A recent large-scale gene-association study in a Dutch population demonstrated that the PIK4CA gene was closely linked to schizophrenia [Jungerius et al. (2007); Mol Psychiatry]. Here, we conducted a case (N = 232)-control (N = 233) study of the PIK4CA gene on Japanese METH abusers, which can manifest severe psychosis similar to schizophrenia. The genotype and allelic distributions of all four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not differ significantly between the METH abusers and the controls. The comparisons based on the classification of the psychosis as transient or prolonged and on the presence or absence of spontaneous relapse revealed no significant distribution of the four SNPs compared to the controls. Furthermore, haplotype analyses showed almost the same frequencies between the METH abusers and the controls. The present study suggests that the PIK4CA gene does not play a significant role in the vulnerability to METH use disorder in the Japanese population."}, {"Title": "Disrupted 'reflection' impulsivity in cannabis users but not current or former ecstasy users.", "Abstract": "Evidence for serotonin involvement in impulsivity has generated interest in the measurement of impulsivity in regular ecstasy users, who are thought to display serotonergic dysfunction. However, current findings are inconsistent. Here, we used a recently developed Information Sampling Test to measure 'reflection' impulsivity in 46 current ecstasy users, 14 subjects who used ecstasy in the past, 15 current cannabis users and 19 drug-na\u00efve controls. Despite elevated scores on the Impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy questionnaire, the current and previous ecstasy users did not differ significantly from the drug-naive controls on the Information Sampling Test. In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls. The effect in cannabis users extends our earlier observations in amphetamine- and opiate-dependent individuals (Clark, et al., 2006, Biological Psychiatry 60: 515-522), and suggests that reduced reflection may be a common cognitive style across regular users of a variety of substances. However, the lack of effects in the two ecstasy groups suggests that the relationship between serotonin function, ecstasy use and impulsivity is more complex."}, {"Title": "DNA polymorphisms as tools for spinal cord injury research.", "Abstract": "Data mining of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in gene pathways related to spinal cord injury (SCI).\nTo identify gene polymorphisms putatively implicated with neuronal damage evolution pathways, potentially useful to SCI study.\nDepartments of Psychiatry and Orthopedics, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\nGenes involved with processes related to SCI, such as apoptosis, inflammatory response, axonogenesis, peripheral nervous system development and axon ensheathment, were determined by evaluating the 'Biological Process' annotation of Gene Ontology (GO). Each gene of these pathways was mapped using MapViewer, and gene coordinates were used to identify their polymorphisms in the SNP database. As a proof of concept, the frequency of subset of SNPs, located in four genes (ALOX12, APOE, BDNF and NINJ1) was evaluated in the DNA of a group of 28 SCI patients and 38 individuals with no SC lesions.\nWe could identify a total of 95,276 SNPs in a set of 588 genes associated with the selected GO terms, including 3912 nucleotide alterations located in coding regions of genes. The five non-synonymous SNPs genotyped in our small group of patients, showed a significant frequency, reinforcing their potential use for the investigation of SCI evolution.\nDespite the importance of SNPs in many aspects of gene expression and protein activity, these gene alterations have not been explored in SCI research. Here we describe a set of potentially useful SNPs, some of which could underlie the genetic mechanisms involved in the post trauma spinal cord damage."}, {"Title": "Recurrence of major depressive disorder is predicted by inhibited startle magnitude while recovered.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder, for some, follows a chronic relapsing course. However, no reliable marker has been established that allows the identification of this sub-group of patients. Preliminary findings suggest that baseline startle magnitude may be such a marker. This study evaluated whether differences in baseline startle magnitude during remission could prospectively predict depressive symptomatology and recurrence.\nA group of previously depressed individuals (n=25), who were in full remission at the time of testing, had their startle reflex measured via surface EMG electrodes on the left orbicularis oculi muscle. These people were then followed-up 2 years later and their depressive symptomatology during the intervening period was assessed using the psychiatric ratings scale of the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE; [Keller, M.B., Lavori, P.W., Friedman, B., Nielsen, E., Endicott, J., McDonald-Scott, P., et al.

Structured clinical interview for axis 1 DSM-IV disorders. New York: New York State Psychiatric Institute]).\nIt was found that a relatively attenuated startle response at initial assessment was strongly predictive of both depressive symptomatology and those who would experience relapse.\nThis study has a relatively small sample size that limits the degree to which a thorough co-variant analysis can be conducted and also makes the analysis of gender-based difference impracticable. Additionally, as no healthy control group is included, we report a relative rather than absolute attenuation of startle to be indicative of symptom severity and recurrence proclivity.\nThese preliminary findings suggest that an attenuated startle response may have utility as an endophenotypic marker of risk for recurrence of Major Depression and residual sub-syndromal symptomatology. Such a marker may facilitate the early identification and treatment of those most at risk of recurrent Major Depression."}, {"Title": "Criteria for validating mouse models of psychiatric diseases.", "Abstract": "Animal models of human diseases are in widespread use for biomedical research. Mouse models with a mutation in a single gene or multiple genes are excellent research tools for understanding the role of a specific gene in the etiology of a human genetic disease. Ideally, the mouse phenotypes will recapitulate the human phenotypes exactly. However, exact matches are rare, particularly in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. This article summarizes the current strategies for optimizing the validity of a mouse model of a human brain dysfunction. We address the common question raised by molecular geneticists and clinical researchers in psychiatry, \"what is a 'good enough' mouse model\"?"}, {"Title": "18-Month study of intravenous immunoglobulin for treatment of mild Alzheimer disease.", "Abstract": "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proposed as a potential agent for Alzheimer's disease (AD) immunotherapy because it contains antibodies against beta-amyloid (Abeta). We carried out an open label dose-ranging study in 8 mild AD patients in which IVIg was added to approved AD therapies for 6 months, discontinued, and then resumed for another 9 months. Infusions were generally well-tolerated. Anti-Abeta antibodies in the serum from AD patients increased in proportion to IVIg dose and had a shorter half-life than anti-hepatitis antibodies and total IgG. Plasma Abeta levels increased transiently after each infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta decreased significantly at 6 months, returned to baseline after washout and decreased again after IVIg was re-administered for an additional 9 months. Mini-mental state scores increased an average of 2.5 points after 6 months, returned to baseline during washout and remained stable during subsequent IVIg treatment.

We present a case of a 37-year-old male insulin-dependent diabetic presenting with refractory hypoglycemia secondary to an intentional overdose of Lantus insulin to illustrate the varied management concerns in overdoses of long-acting insulins. The patient was managed with oral intake, intravenous dextrose bolus, peripheral 10% dextrose solution, 25% dextrose sliding scale via central line, and psychiatry evaluation for suicide attempt. Other potential treatments discussed for possible use with long-acting insulin overdoses include incision and drainage of the injection site, glucagon, and octreotide."}, {"Title": "Kraepelin's dichotomy is true: contrasting brain dysfunction at the extremes of human growth and maturation. Excitability, the fundamental property of nervous tissue, is affected.", "Abstract": "The distribution of Kraepelin's ubiquitous dichotomy varies with standard of living and pubertal age: when one rises, the other declines. The universal similar clinical picture--mortality risk, manic depressive psychosis, episodic dysfunction of brainstem control systems (sleep-wake cycle, food, mood control mechanism)--is caused by abridged pubertal pruning of excitatory synapses, which is treated with anti-epileptics, as opposed to convulsant neuroleptics in dementia praecox, where the clinical variation reflects varying degrees of excessive pruning and deficit in excitability. Localization of cortical breakdown of circuitry, silent spots and persistent dysfunction due to insufficient fill-in mechanisms, determine the clinical picture. This ranges from dementia praecox in late puberty and poor living standards, to cognitive dysfunction (mainly with higher standards of living) with earlier puberty. This variation is the most likely explanation why the acceptance of dementia praecox as a disease entity was complicated. Kraepelin's dichotomy, episodic dysfunction against a clinical deterioration, is at the extremes of brain maturation; the fundamental property of nervous tissue, excitability, is affected. To reduce the risk of psychotic episodes, omega-3 might also be given, as it normalizes excitation at all levels. The neo-Kraepelinian atheoretical quantitative scoring systems have eliminated disease entities and neglected endogeneity in psychiatry. We are back to a pre-Kraepelinian state, without his systematic observations. What is psychiatry without Kraepelin's dichotomy? Mood stability is a fundamental personality trait with a normal distribution; what is considered within or outside normal variation is arbitrary. Given the mood-stabilizing effect of anti-epileptics and omega-3, these will increasingly dominate psychiatric treatment."}]
