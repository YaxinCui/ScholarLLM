Seizures may present as mental illness. Equally, the management of psychiatric conditions has the potential to destabilise epilepsy. There is a need for structured epilepsy awareness and training amongst psychiatrists. This paper outlines key considerations around diagnosis, treatment and risk while suggesting practical recommendations."}, {"Title": "Which bioethical and bio-legal guidelines should be followed when performing pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic tests in psychiatry clinical trials in Colombia, to protect genetic data and the rights of research subjects?", "Abstract": "This paper is the result of research, from the bioethics and bio-legal perspectives, on the existing guidelines in Colombia for the handling of pharmacogenomic and pharmacogenetic tests in clinical trials. Colombian legislation on this kind of research was reviewed and then compared with international and supranational standards. It was found that Colombia lacks specific legislation in this area, a situation that puts both participants and researchers at risk, from bioethical and legal perspectives. These risks should not be underestimated, as they compromise the ethical viability of clinical and basic research in our setting. In the end, a proposal, based on principles of ethics is made, proposing a series of actions for the creation and promotion nationwide of guidelines which can be used to shape legislation to be applied to protect the genetic data and the rights of subjects participating in these types of research studies in Colombia."}, {"Title": "Validity of the Brief Child and Family Phone Interview by comparison with Longitudinal Expert All Data diagnoses in outpatients.", "Abstract": "The Brief Child and Family Phone Interview (BCFPI) is a standardized intake and follow-up interview used in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Although it has shown good validity compared with other measures using parent reports, it has not yet been compared with diagnoses derived from a Longitudinal Expert All Data (LEAD) procedure, which includes information from separate diagnostic interviews with parent(s) and child. The aim was to compare the BCFPI evaluation in an outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry setting with an evaluation derived from a LEAD procedure.\nAt four Swedish outpatient CAMHS, 267 patients were interviewed at intake with the BCFPI. Within six weeks, patients and parents were interviewed separately with the 2009 version of the semi-structured Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) and parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). LEAD diagnoses were subsequently determined by two senior clinicians based on 1.2 years of clinical records including the K-SADS-PL and ensuing information from further assessments, psychological tests, information from teachers and other informants as well as treatment outcome. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders subscales from the CBCL and the subscales from the BCFPI were compared with LEAD diagnoses. These measured symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.\nThe criterion validity for BCFPI versus LEAD diagnoses was fair for oppositional defiant disorder (area under curve, 0.73), generalized anxiety disorder (0.73) and major depressive disorder (0.78), good for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (0.81) and conduct disorder (0.83), and excellent for separation anxiety disorder (0.90). The screening properties of BCFPI and CBCL were similar.\nThe BCFPI is a concise and valid tool, performed along with the larger and more established CBCL, in screening for major psychiatric disorders. It is well suited as an intake interview in CAMHS."}, {"Title": "Trainee experience in diagnosis and management of personality disorders.", "Abstract": "The diagnosis and management of personality disorders continues to evolve and develop alongside psychiatry internationally, however, not always in a linear fashion. Trainees working in a variety of clinical areas have regular exposure to personality disorder presentations. Psychiatry training bodies continue to adapt their training structure and curriculum, however, there seems to be a lack of sufficient emphasis with regards this area. We are now embarking on a new diagnostic system for personality disorders; this may impact on our clinical practice and perspective of these patients.

Schopenhauer is known as the \"philosopher of pessimism\" and as the \"psychologist of the will\". His thinking is formally absent in the psychiatric education curricula, which could be enriched by the philosopher's work. Regarding psychiatry's theoretical foundations, Schopenhauer: a) anticipated several issues of species' origin and evolution, which are used in the contemporary understanding of disease development; b) anticipated some attributes of the psychodynamic and cognitive unconscious when referring to the irrational features of the will; c) foresaw the current concept of the embodied mind, which emphasizes the role of the body's structure and dynamics in cognition instead of that of a transcendental reason; d) proposed a simplified and heuristic model of mind, comprising the senses, understanding and reason; at a pragmatic level, particularly concerning psychotherapy, the philosopher e) stated that all human actions spring from three fundamental sources: egoism, malice and compassion; he also speculated about the role of unconscious repression in the genesis of mental illnesses; and finally, f) emphasized the ubiquity of suffering and the insatiability of desire, which unavoidably leads to egocentrism. In this regard he highly valued contemplation of art and nature as a way of dissociating knowledge from desire, and thus allowing the development of compassion and asceticism. This was considered by the philosopher to be \"denial of the will\", and a path for individual salvation and well-being. In contemporary psychiatry, this metaphysical proposal may be reformulated in terms of promoting cooperation and healthy austerity as a non-specific component of most psychotherapies and educational models. Schopenhauer's thinking may enrich psychiatric training and personal well-being."}, {"Title": "Depression and sleep disorders related to hypertension: A cross-sectional study in Medell\u00edn, Colombia.", "Abstract": "Psychosocial factors have been shown to be potentiators and triggers of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension.

Its transformation has been coloured by attributions of the influence of anti-psychiatry. This article argues that the relevance of anti-psychiatry has been over-simplified. It examines MIND's history as part of the psychiatric strategy known as mental hygiene. This movement's agenda can be understood as paradigmatic of much that anti-psychiatry renounced. However, building on the sociologist Nick Crossley's description of the interactional nature of Social Movement Organisations in the psychiatric field, this article shows that a 'discursive transformation' can be deduced in core elements of mental hygienist thinking. This transformation of discourse clearly <i>prefigured</i> important elements of anti-psychiatry, and also fed into MIND's rights approach. But it must be appreciated on its own terms. Its distinctiveness under MIND is shown in its application to people with learning disabilities."}, {"Title": "Sexual and Reproductive Health in Patients with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) have a high risk of unwanted pregnancies and abortions, due to their condition of vulnerability or hypersexuality (common in BD). This is associated with difficulty in planning their actions and lack of sex education and counselling by medical personnel, and can lead to adverse obstetric outcomes and inability to care adequately for their children.\nTo describe the characteristics in terms of sexual and reproductive health, and the use of contraception and counselling in psychiatric consultations, in a sample of patients with BD and schizophrenia in Medellin, Colombia.\nObservational cross-sectional study. We included the 160 participants from the clinical trial, \"The effects of a multimodal intervention programme in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia\", who were recruited from the mood and psychosis disorders group clinic at Hospital Universitario de San Vicente Fundaci\u00f3n in Medellin. They were contacted by phone by a third-year psychiatry resident, who applied a survey about the characteristics of their sex life, contraception and reproduction.\nAlmost all of the patients with schizophrenia were single, had no undergraduate studies and were unemployed. No significant differences were found regarding the age of starting sexual relations when comparing by diagnosis and gender. Almost all patients with schizophrenia and almost half of the patients with BD reported not having an active sexual life. Almost all of those who admitted to having an active sexual life claimed to always use contraception; in the BD group, only 48.8% of single women admitted to using contraception and a little over half of men stated that they used a condom when having sex. A quarter of the pregnancies were unplanned. Although the majority of the patients stated that they had never received information about family planning in the consultations with their psychiatrist, 57.4% of the patients with BD and 78.8% of those who had schizophrenia, considered themselves to be well informed on the subject.\nPatients with mental illness have cognitive and behavioural alterations that affect their sexual and reproductive lives. Psychiatrists should therefore address this issue, to ensure education in areas such as contraception, family planning and sexually transmitted diseases and help safeguard the safety and quality of life of their patients."}, {"Title": "[The Treatment of Infants and Toddlers with their Parents in an Outpatient Unit for Infant Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "<i>The Treatment of Infants and Toddlers with their Parents in an Outpatient Unit for Infant Psychiatry</i> This article presents an integrative treatment model for infants and toddlers between zero to three years and their parents by integrating different complementary psychotherapeutic perspectives.

There is little evidence available about whether working-age and older adults with mental health problems or their caregivers have access to these technologies or their confidence with these technologies.\nThis study aimed to ascertain the prevalence and range of devices used to access the internet in patients and caregivers attending general and older adult psychiatry outpatient services and their confidence in using these technologies.\nWe conducted an anonymous survey of 77 patients and caregivers from a general psychiatry and old age psychiatry clinic to determine rates of internet access and device ownership, and attitudes to technology-enabled care.\nWe found high levels of internet access and confidence in using the internet in working-age adults, their caregivers, and older adult caregivers but not in older adult patients. The smartphone usage predominated in working-age adults and their caregivers. Older adult caregivers were more likely to use desktop or laptop computers. In our sample, tablets were the least popular form factor.\nAccess rates and uptake of internet-based services have the potential to be high in working-age adults and their caregivers but are likely to be markedly lower among older adult patients attending psychiatry clinics. Applications designed for tablets are likely to have low uptake. All groups identified appointment reminders as likely to be beneficial."}, {"Title": "Advances in the treatment of substance use disorder in Cyprus.", "Abstract": "Addiction psychiatry is a relatively new field in Cyprus.

Australia and other wealthy nations have implemented increasingly harsh policies, justified as 'humane deterrence', and aimed at preventing asylum seekers (persons without preestablished resettlement visas) from entering their borders and gaining protection. Australian psychiatrists and other health professionals have documented the impact of these harsh policies since their inception. Their experience in identifying and challenging the effects of these policies on the mental health of asylum seekers may prove instructive to others facing similar issues. In outlining the Australian experience, we draw selectively on personal experience, research, witness account issues, reports by human rights organisations, clinical observations and commentaries. Australia's harsh response to asylum seekers, including indefinite mandatory detention and denial of permanent protection for those found to be refugees, starkly demonstrates the ineluctable intersection of mental health, human rights, ethics and social policy, a complexity that the profession is uniquely positioned to understand and hence reflect back to government and the wider society."}, {"Title": "New direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C treatment and neuropsychiatric symptoms in psychiatric risk groups.", "Abstract": "The new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have changed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment perspectives by achieving success rates in all genotypes and by reducing the associated adverse effects in comparison to pegylated interferon \u03b1 regimens.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the neuropsychiatric symptoms during HCV treatment with DAAs in standard multidisciplinary clinical practice in psychiatric risk groups and to assess the risk factors associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in this study population.\nA prospective cross-sectional study was performed of all consecutive patients with psychiatric risk and HCV infection who completed treatment with the new DAAs at the ambulatory care pharmacy. We recorded demographic and clinical data, neuropsychiatric symptoms, emergency consultations, admissions to the psychiatric unit and interventions to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms.

However, no studied risk factors for developing neuropsychiatric symptoms were found in this population.\nWe found a moderate prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the psychiatric risk group. The neuropsychiatric symptoms more frequently reported were insomnia (17%), irritability (15%) and depression (13%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with psychiatric risk can occur during treatment with DAAs but less frequently than with pegylated interferon \u03b1 regimens, and so is a safe treatment for these patients."}, {"Title": "Mental and behavioural emergencies at a tertiary healthcare centre in India: Pattern and profile.", "Abstract": "Sparse data are available on service utilization, pattern and profile of mental and behavioural emergencies in India.

TG is usually diagnosed from serological sample in which a positive test for Anti-TG immunoglobulin G (IgG) indicates TG infection (toxoplasmosis). The research was conducted to test the hypothesis that TG infection may be associated with substance abuse. Anti-TG (IgG) was screened in 444 participants (350 abusers and 94 controls) who attended the Psychiatry Department of Mansoura University Hospitals. All participants were screened for different class of abused substances (tramadol, cannabis, opiates, barbiturates and benzodiazepines) using enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique and positive cases were confirmed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Substance users were also diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria. GC-MS assays revealed that 116 cases (33.1% of users) had documented use of more than one substance. Tramadol was the most common abused substance [86 cases (24.6%)]. About 56% of the participants were sero-positive for anti-TG IgG. Toxoplasmosis sero-positivity was significantly higher among substance abusers (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.0001) irrespective of the class of substance used.

We characterized the presence of consultation liaison using four criteria: availability, frequency, continuity of participants, and continuity across care levels. We also created a dichotomous variable called \"optimal consultation liaison\" for when all four criteria were met. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to estimate the rate of hospitalization due to different psychiatric disorders, adjusting by population attributes.\nOf the primary health centers, 28.3% of them had had optimal consultation liaison during the preceding year, concentrated in the poorest and richest municipalities. Continuity of care was the criterion that was met least often (38.3%). The presence of optimal consultation liaison at the municipal level was associated with fewer psychiatric discharges, with the following incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs): schizophrenia, 0.65 (95% CI: 0.49-0.85); other psychoses, 0.68 (95% CI: 0.52-0.89); and personality disorders, 0.66 (95% CI: 0. 49-0.89). Municipalities with optimal consultation liaison showed 2.44 fewer total psychiatric discharges per 10 000 inhabitants, although without reaching statistical significance (-0.85 to 5.70).\nUsing a nationally representative sample, we found that consultation liaison in primary care was associated with having fewer psychiatric hospitalizations.

Anxiety-depressive disorders included MDD (113;56%), PD (61;30.2%), GAD (55; 27.2%) and PhD (30;14.9%). Patients with 2 to 5 and more than 5 symptoms accounted for 15.9% and 39.6% respectively (depressive disorders), and 9.5% and 62.9% (anxiety disorders). The most reported symptoms were cardiopulmonary symptoms (75%), general symptoms (73.8%) and neurological symptoms (65.8%).\nphysical symptoms associated with anxiety-depressive disorders are variable and often occur together.

We aimed to describe psychological disorders and assess quality of life in children with chronic ITP and compared their results with their healthy peers. A cross-sectional comparative study was carried out in a tertiary care university-affiliated hospital during a period from November, 2015 till April, 2018. We enrolled 119 children with chronic ITP and compared with 220 healthy peers. Relevant demographic and clinical data were collected and statistically analyzed. Quality of life for both patients and control groups was measured using pediatric quality of life inventory version 4 (Arabic one). Also psychiatric evaluation of both groups was done using Arabic version of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children (Mini-KID). Majority of patients (90.7%) exhibited mucocutaneous bleeding. Most of patients (61.3%) did not need any definitive treatment for chronic ITP while 38.6% received second line therapy. About one-third of the patients needed rescue medications to control active bleeding. The scores of all sub-scales of Peds QL 4.0 were significantly decreased among patients group when compared to their healthy peers (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). General anxiety disorder and oppositional defiant disorders were the commonest psychiatric disorders among children with chronic ITP.

In the case of psychiatry, and especially schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, a retrospective look at artistic productions (writings and drawings) makes it possible to reconstitute a whole section of this pathological context. Through four medieval and modern examples, we will see how it is possible to do a paleo-psychiatry: Opicinus de Canistris (14<sup>th</sup> c.), the Voynich manuscript (15<sup>th</sup> c.), Hieronymus Bosch (15<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> c.), and the Codex Seraphinianus (20<sup>th</sup> c.)."}, {"Title": "[The staging model (or evolutionary stages) applied to bipolar disorder].", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, clinical staging raises awareness of the need to understand disease trajectories and heterotypic continuity; it draws attention to individuals at risk of developing disorders, such as those with a family history or subsyndromal presentations; and it actively promotes greater attention to prevention strategies and interventions for individuals at ultra-high risk of developing a severe mental disorder. Staging paradigms have been increasingly applied in early intervention in psychoses, but there are issues in broadening the scope of clinical staging to the more prevalent affective disorders. For example, it is potentially more complex to devise a model that considers the varying clinical presentations of the late prodromal stage of bipolar disorder and where to locate depressive episodes that precede the first manic episode and how to describe subthreshold manic syndromes, especially hypomania. The above issues might be resolved if we had a greater understanding of the risk factors, biomarkers or endophenotypes for the onset and progression of bipolar disorder. This level of understanding is not yet available in psychiatry, but clinical staging may help us improve our knowledge of the pathophysiological correlates of disease progression and reduce our over-reliance on cross-sectional assessments of symptoms in bipolar disorders."}, {"Title": "[Not Available].", "Abstract": "Predictive prospective studies of schizophrenia date back to the late 1950s. At the turn of the Millennium, an Australian research group initiated programs of early detection of schizophrenia and early therapeutic intervention. The theoretical foundations of early schizophrenia detection usually remain unaddressed. In this paper, we focus on the issue of prediction of future schizophrenia in the general population on the basis of a symptomatic picture. Several notions used in this research program such as disease, symptom, and clinical staging derive from a medical model, which in our view is not entirely adequate for grasping the nature of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a spectrum of disorders with a shared core Gestalt comprising dis-order of selfhood and intersubjectivity. This core Gestalt has manifold manifestations, often predominantly in the existential or experiential domain. It is not feasible to apply medical concepts to this symptomatically poorly demarcated spectrum for which we do not know robust biological validators. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that the current DSM and ICD criteria of schizophrenia distort the original concept of schizophrenia and are formulated on a very high severity level. This often results in incorrect diagnoses of young help-seeking patients. In sum, it seems more appropriate to detect psychosis among already help-seeking patients than to implement detection programs in the general population. We discuss a reorientation of psychiatry towards more refined psychopathological knowledge and assessment that are needed in order to optimize the treatment of young help-seeking patients."}, {"Title": "Hominem Sine Opus Spatium: Where Do the Ideas Come from to Move the Brain, Mind, Behaviour and Neurosciences in Malaysia?", "Abstract": "People can work wonders without a room.

Previous studies indicate that wellness and health of the victims who have been subjected to mobbing at workplace were affected adversely. Recently, there has been an increase in mobbing cases in Turkey. The purpose of the present study is to identify the features of trauma and analyse the development of mental problems caused by traumatic experiences in individuals who have been subjected to mobbing at workplace, and admitted to psychiatry services.\nThree-hundred individuals included in the study who had been admitted to Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Psychiatry Department, Psychosocial Trauma Programme, through general psychiatry outpatient clinics and forensic medicine institute consultations, with the purpose of preparing forensic reports between January 2008-September 2012. Trauma Evaluation Form (TIF), Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were administered.\nMobbing was identified in 130 out of 300 patients who claimed to have been subjected to trauma at workplace (43.3%). Mobbing cases were aged between 18 and 61, 100 (76.9%) of them were women. 56 (43%) of the cases were married, 54 (41.5%) of them were single and others were divorced, widowed or separated. 110 (84.6%) of the patients were university graduates while 13 of them were high school graduates and 5 of them were elementary school graduates. 76 of the cases were government officers and 65 of them were teachers. 93 (71.5%) patients were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition-Revised (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, 9 patients (6.9%) had adjustment disorder and 102 of the patients (78.5%) were diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Mean Total IES of 122 patients was 58.4\u00b116.7. Three persons (2.3%) had not received any diagnoses and 83 individuals (63.8%) had received multiple diagnoses.\nThe fact that mobbing was identified in approximately half of cases who applied to get a forensic report points out the extensiveness of the problem. High percentage of PTSD was established in victims of mobbing. It is important to include psychologic trauma in definiton of trauma in manuals of psychiatric disorders. Preparation of a report is useful in helping these individuals to protect their legal rights as well as documenting these wrongdoings, improving the sense of justice, enabling these individuals to be examined by psychiatry experts and having them access to treatment."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Four-Year Stability of Unspecified Psychosis.", "Abstract": "Unspecified psychosis, defined with the F29 code in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10th version is commonly used if there is inadequate information to make the diagnosis of a specific psychotic disorder.

Therapeutic plasma concentrations of risperidone and its active moiety are directly influenced by genetic variations in metabolic CYP450 enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5) and transporter (ABCB1) protein and additional environmental factors. Since active metabolite 9-OH risperidone has a greater percentage of the pharmacologically active fraction and is equipotent to the parent drug risperidone, it is assumed that it contributes significantly to therapeutic and adverse effects. Unpredictable dose/concentration ratio, narrow therapeutic index, number of interactions, along with serious adverse reactions (ADR), raises the need for individualization of risperidone treatment and establishing of good therapeutic regime using TDM. A simple and reliable validated bioanalytical liquide-liquide extraction HPLC/UV method was applied for the simultaneous determination of risperidone and its active metabolite, 9-OH risperidone, in human plasma and urine of 52 hospitalized schizophrenia/bipolar disorder patients treated with risperidone as monotherapy and in polytherapy. All the patients were previously genotyped for CYP2D6 (EM=30, EM/IM=14, IM=4 IM/PM=1 and PM=3) and ABCB1 using Real-Time PCR methods with TaqMan SNP genotyping suitable assays according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, USA).The influence of CYP2D6 phenotype on metabolic ratio MR (Ris/9-OHRis) in plasma (p=0.012) and in urine (p=0.048) was confirmed. Statistically significant correlation (R2=55.53%, Rho=0.844, p<0,0001) for MR in both plasma and urine indicates that urine may be utilized as appropriate media for initial CYP2D6 phenotype identification and selection of patients on risperidone treatment with high risk for ADR."}, {"Title": "Sexual Orientation and Gender Differences in Aging Perceptions and Concerns Among Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Ageism (negative attitudes and behavior toward older adults) is a serious social issue and is of growing concern as the population of older adults continues to increase. Research demonstrates that negative aging perceptions and aging concerns are associated with poor health and well-being among older adults; yet, few studies have examined sexual orientation or gender differences in aging perceptions and concerns among older adults.\nThe current online study examined aging perceptions and concerns among a national community sample of 821 (female = 464) participants (76 lesbian, 159 gay, 88 bisexual, 498 heterosexual participants) ranging from 45 to 80 years of age (<i>M</i> = 55.56).\nOlder women reported more aging anxiety and endorsement of aging stereotypes while older sexual minority individuals reported heightened general aging concerns compared to their heterosexual peers. Among sexual minority participants, discrimination based on age and sexual orientation predicted greater sexual minority-specific aging concerns, anxiety, and depression. Experiencing sexual orientation discrimination buffered age discrimination's impact on sexual minority-specific aging concerns, suggesting that experiencing discrimination based on one stigmatized identity (sexual minority) may promote effective coping with discrimination based on another stigmatized identity (older adult). Conversely, age and sexual orientation discrimination had multiplicative effects on anxiety and depression.\nOverall, findings point to the importance of examining sexual orientation and gender differences in aging perceptions and concerns to more fully understand the experiences, health, and well-being of the growing older population.

However, translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms and new therapies has been enormously challenging because of the complexity of their interpretation. Furthermore, the heterogeneity among patients with the same diagnosis, such as schizophrenia or major depressive disorder, challenges the biological validity of existing categorical approaches in clinical nosology, which is further complicated by the pleiotropic nature of many genetic variants across multiple disorders. Therefore, in the post-GWAS era, the greatest challenge lies in integrating such enriched genetic information with functional dimensions of neurobiological measures and observable behaviors. In this integration, the causal inference from genotypes to phenotypes through intermediate biological processes is of particular importance.

The authors assessed relationships of representative biomarkers linked to disaster exposure-heart rate variability (HRV) with Interleukin-2 (IL-2, cell-medicated immunity) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6, pro-inflammatory and pro-immunologic), stratified by psychiatric diagnosis.\nParticipants were assessed for psychiatric diagnosis, IL-2, IL-6, HRV, and HR reactivity to trauma reminders.\nOutpatient university psychiatry clinics in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.\nRelocated Katrina survivors and demographically matched controls, not on psychiatric, cardiovascular, or inflammatory medications.\nSCID-IV, baseline serum IL-2 and IL-6, HRV through power spectral analysis.\nSurvivors had higher sympathetic and lower parasympathetic activity at baseline and lower parasympathetic HR reactivity than controls, with flattened parasympathetic reactivity in the presence of depression and of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Survivors' IL-2 and IL-6 did not differ from controls and did not differ in PTSD or depression. Depressed survivors' sympathetic reactivity correlated negatively with IL-2 and parasympathetic reactivity correlated positively with IL-2.\nHRV differed after hurricane exposure and with survivors& depression and/or PTSD, more sensitively capturing somatic sequelae than assessed cytokines. Higher sympathetic HR reactivity associated with lower immuno-logic IL-2 may indicate a double biological \"hit\" in depressed disaster survivors, possibly rendering them more vulnerable to cardiovascular and immunologic illness as well as depression. Associations of HRV with IL-2 may support reciprocal influences of cytokines and vagal activity. Lack of significant correlations of IL-6 with HRV measures is consistent with its pleiotropic role."}, {"Title": "Towards integrated medical and mental healthcare in the inpatient setting: what is the role of psychology?", "Abstract": "Integrated medical and psychiatric hospital units hold great promise for improving the value and quality of care for patients with severe mental illness and concomitant acute medical needs. It is important to explore the utility of providing a range of multidisciplinary inpatient services to meet patients' complex needs. Within this context, services typically provided by psychologists have received little research attention. To address this gap in the literature, this study assessed inpatient clinicians' perceptions of the need for specific behavioural services on a medical psychiatric unit, exploring their overlap with established psychological services. Results indicate the potential utility of specific psychological services, including psychological assessments, direct psychosocial interventions, and psychoeducational training. While reimbursement and billing barriers still exist for psychologists to be routinely incorporated into hospital settings, the movement towards value-based care could provide the opportunity to think about the value added. Embedding evidence-based psychological services has the potential to promote high quality, well-rounded care that aligns with the established mission of multidisciplinary teamwork on integrated medical and psychiatric inpatient units."}, {"Title": "Recurrent Depression and Borderline Personality Disorder in a Patient with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.", "Abstract": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of connective tissue disorders that most commonly causes joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Patients diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) frequently suffer from chronic pain and other comorbid conditions.

We present the case of a 25-year-old female who presented to a community hospital with frequent thoughts of suicide and major depression. She was previously diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, borderline personality disorder, and major depressive disorder. The patient was treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and gabapentin for pain associated with EDS. However, she was still suicidal and was admitted upon evaluation. Subsequently, she was\u00a0prescribed lithium in order to augment the effects of the SSRI and reduce her risk of suicide.

Morgenthaler and the Austrian H. Prinzhorn published studies on mentally ill artworks, having mainly aesthetic approach. The artworks of the mentally ill belong to the field of Art found in the international literature by the term of Art Brut. The term \"Brut\" was introduced in 1945 by J. Dubuffet to describe the production of art by authors who were not taught academic art, did not belong to any artistic movement and were indifferent to a potential identification with the viewer or the collector. This French painter and sculptor named Art Brut the founded movement, whose main field was the works of mental patients. Dubuffet was particularly affected, in terms of artistic expression, like so many other creators of expressionism and surrealism, by the art of the mentally ill. Regarding the Greek scene, the relationship between our country and this category of Art began in 1950, at the Psychiatric Hospital of Attica \"Dromokaitio\", when Professor G. Pampoukis and Dr N. Drakoulidis sent patients' works to the Exposition Internationale d' Art Psychopathologique ( International Exhibition of Psychopathological Art) held in Paris that year. By the late 1980's, only occupational therapy projects existed. The first major artist appearance with a mental disorder is that of O.K. with his participation in the 2nd Biennale of Young Artists of the Mediterranean, in 1987. The year 1994 was a very important one in terms of art production of the mentally ill, as the Cultural Communication Unit (CCU) of the Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki (P.H.T.) was founded, which aim was to produce original works that recorded the psychic reality of the patients and did not recreate other artists' projects. Regarding the promotion of this art, of great significance are the three Panhellenic Exhibitions held in 1996, 1997 and 2001, the last under the auspices of the Greek Psychiatric Association, which brought together the patient-artists' projects of various institutions of our country with the general public, receiving very positive feedback from both the press and the critics. Worth mentioning is also the honorary discrimination of two patient-artists who cooperated with the CCU, D.Z. and A.V., in EUWARD 2004 and 2007 of the German Foundation Augustinum, and also of G.M., who was awarded the first prize at the competition of \"Very Special Art\" in USA. Two other important moments of the effort of projecting the relationship between Art and Psychiatry were first in 2004 with the exhibition On The Other Bank, as part of the Cultural Olympiad, and the other in 2005 at the Christian and Byzantine Museum of Athens, where the exhibition Art against Stigma, organized by the World Psychiatric Association, the Greek Psychiatric Association and a privately held pharmaceutical company took place. Finally in 2011, again under the auspices of the Greek Psychiatric Association, works of the famous Prinzhorn Collection were exhibited both in Athens and Thessaloniki. In this way the public, once again, came into contact with works in which fears, insecurities and demons within the soul of every patientartist were imprinted, these projects serving not only as clinical evidence but also as creations of unquestionable artistic value."}, {"Title": "[Electroconvulsive therapy: 80 years of use in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the oldest among the early biological treatments introduced in psychiatry, and the only one still in use. In this paper we attempt a brief presentation of ECT usage over the last 80 years, since it was originally introduced. It is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective treatment option for major psychiatric disorders, such as mood disorders and schizophrenia, especially when there is an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms or if catatonic symptoms are prominent. ECT has also been used successfully for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, delirium, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, autism and agitation and depression in demented patients. There are no absolute contraindications. However, it is considered a high risk procedure for patients with increased intracranial pressure, recent myocardial infarction, recent cerebral hemorrhage or stroke, vascular aneurysm, retinal detachment and pheocromocytoma. Modern genetic and neuroimaging techniques have helped clarify possible mechanisms of action of ECT, but much remains unknown. Improvement of this method through a number of technical advancements has contributed in the reduction of side effects. Thus, modified ECT is currently considered as an effective and safe form of treatment even in vulnerable populations such as the geriatric patients, the adolescents and the pregnant patients. The mortality rate is very low, comparable to that of a minor anesthetic procedure. The most common adverse events are headache, nausea, myalgias and postictal delirium while the most severe are the cardiovascular side effects. Of note, the cognitive side effects especially amnesia, although transient, has been the focus of skepticism against the treatment. Major psychiatric disorders are chronic, recurring disorders. The relapse rate after a successful course of ECT without any intervention is extremely high. Pharmacotherapy or continuation ECT reduces equally the relapse rate up to 40%. Continuation and maintenance ECT, in combination with pharmacotherapy, have been successfully used in preventing relapse and recurrence. Gradual tapering off acute ECT treatments and individualized continuation and maintenance ECT treatments based on the needs of each patient seems the optimum clinical practice. Conclusively, despite impressive new developments in pharmacotherapy and in biological non pharmacological treatments ECT remains a valuable, irreplaceable treatment option for debilitating, resistant major psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Suicide Symposium: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Risk Assessment and the Emotional Aftermath of Patient Suicide.", "Abstract": "The loss of a patient to suicide is a common experience among mental health practitioners and trainees. Research suggests that younger, less experienced clinicians are often most keenly affected by the experience. Given the prevalence of patient loss to suicide and the subsequent emotional aftermath, our goal in creating a multidisciplinary suicide symposium was to provide a safe, structured environment where trainees and mental health practitioners could obtain collegial support and education to reduce the stigma surrounding patient suicide.\nMental health trainees and practitioners (including medical students, nurse practitioner students, psychiatry residents, psychology interns, and practicing psychologists and psychiatrists) were invited to a 4-hour symposium. The curriculum focused on assessment of risk and possible interventions, as well as addressing the loss of a patient to suicide. Teaching methods included a PowerPoint lecture; case-based, small-group discussion; and role-play. Attendees completed numbered, anonymous surveys looking at attitudes about loss and suicide before and after the symposium.\nOf 35 total attendees, 22 completed both pre- and postsymposium surveys.

It was designed for participants to gain knowledge about initial management of often unfamiliar situations before untoward behaviors escalate to violence.\nEight hundred thirty-eight medical students participated in this required element of the third-year psychiatry clerkship experience. Sixty first-year through fourth-year psychiatry residents participated as part of departmental orientation. Instructors provided the same seminar for both learner groups throughout the project's duration. In addition to a PowerPoint presentation, learners participated in discussion about personal safety threats in the health care setting. Evaluations were obtained, and more recent cohorts also completed a postcourse assessment of knowledge.\nResults suggested that learners from both groups viewed the session favorably, indicating the personal safety curriculum was beneficial and practical and helped increase their knowledge about this important topic. The session received a high number of positive comments from learners, reinforcing its valuable take-home message.\nGiven the growing magnitude and understanding of risk of aggression and violence in health care settings, we incorporated a required personal safety session into our psychiatry residency and medical school curricula.

The goal is for viewers to be proficient with the basic science, indications, contraindications, side effects, and treatment process for TMS in TRD. Self-assessment questions throughout the module highlight and reinforce key learning points falling under the educational objectives.\nThis SLM was deployed with PGY 1-4 training residents at the University of Minnesota during the 2016-2017 academic year as part of a study aimed at improving TMS education within our residency program. Fourteen residents participated in the study and offered feedback on the SLM's efficacy using 5-point Likert-scale surveys.

Predicting persistence of depressive symptoms could permit targeted prevention, and lessen the burden of depression. Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, and such approaches offer powerful predictive abilities. We investigated the utility of a machine learning approach to predict the persistence of depressive symptoms in older adults.\nBaseline demographic and psychometric data from 284 patients were used to predict the likelihood of older adults having persistent depressive symptoms after 12 months, using a machine learning approach ('extreme gradient boosting'). Predictive performance was compared to a conventional statistical approach (logistic regression). Data were drawn from the 'treatment-as-usual' arm of the CASPER (CollAborative care and active surveillance for Screen-Positive EldeRs with subthreshold depression) trial.\nPredictive performance was superior using machine learning compared to logistic regression (mean AUC 0.72 vs. 0.67, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Using machine learning, an average of 89% of those predicted to have PHQ-9 scores above threshold at 12 months actually did, compared to 78% using logistic regression. However, mean negative predictive values were somewhat lower for the machine learning approach (45% vs. 35%).\nA relatively small sample size potentially limited the predictive power of the algorithm.

A network approach to psychopathology may help to reveal underlying mechanisms determining patients' capacity for recovery. We used daily diary MDD symptom data and six-month follow-up data on depression to examine how dynamic associations between symptoms relate to the future course of MDD. Daily experiences of depressive symptoms of 69 participants were assessed by means of the SCL-90-R depression subscale, three days a week for a period of six weeks, as part of a larger intervention study. Multilevel vector autoregressive modelling was used to estimate networks of dynamic symptom connections. Long-term outcome was determined by the percentage change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score between pre-intervention and six-month follow-up. For patients with more persisting symptoms, the symptom 'feeling everything is an effort' most strongly predicted other symptoms. The networks of the two groups did not significantly differ in overall connectivity. Findings suggest that future research should not solely focus on the presence or intensity of individual symptoms when predicting long-term outcomes, but should also examine the role of a specific symptom in the larger network of dynamic symptom-to-symptom interactions."}, {"Title": "[Is Big Data the future of Psychiatry?].", "Abstract": "Big Data is a term that describes large volumes of high velocity, complex, and variable data that require advanced techniques and technologies to enable the capture, storage, distribution, management, and analysis of information.

Having in mind the differences between the mental disorders, can we consider that the same semiological elements are appropriate for all of them or do we need to resume an individual analysis from each of those disorders? Can we go through the sparse spectrum of neurotic disorders ignoring the market forces or the dualistic interpretation? In this context, there is still room for questioning: is there an undiscovered explanation regarding the psychiatry disorders or are we trying to find a whole rationale explanation to study non-agroupable objects, lacking of that aforementioned common nuclear logic?

In psychiatry, biomarkers are very much needed for both research and treatment, given the heterogenous populations identified by current phenomenologically based diagnostic systems. To date, however, useful and valid biomarkers have been scant owing to the inaccessibility and complexity of human brain tissue and consequent lack of insight into disease mechanisms. Genetic biomarkers are therefore especially promising for psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies of common diseases have matured over the last decade, generating the knowledge base for increasingly informative individual-level genetic risk prediction. In this review, we discuss fundamental concepts involved in computing genetic risk with current methods, strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, assessments of utility, and applications to various psychiatric disorders and related traits. Although genetic risk prediction has become increasingly straightforward to apply and common in published studies, there are important pitfalls to avoid. At present, the clinical utility of genetic risk prediction is still low; however, there is significant promise for future clinical applications as the ancestral diversity and sample sizes of genome-wide association studies increase.

The purpose of this study was to identify stigma towards mental illness among health profession students in pharmacy, nursing, and social work programs, and identify if primary psychiatric coursework in each curriculum has an impact on students' perceptions.\nPharmacy, nursing and social work students were surveyed pre- and post-primary didactic psychiatry coursework (pre-course\u202f=\u202f154 total; 95 pharmacy, 47 nursing, 12 social work; post-course\u202f=\u202f128 total; 79 pharmacy, 38 nursing, and 11 social work) using the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC). The OMS-HC contains 12-questions evaluated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 12 to 60 points, with lower scores indicating less stigma towards mental illness. Student results were compared to the large sample of healthcare student and provider responses used in validating the OMS-HC survey tool.\nStudents' pre-course mean score on the OMS-HC was 30.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.47 (pharmacy\u202f=\u202f30.9, nursing\u202f=\u202f31, social work\u202f=\u202f26.3) and post-course mean score was 31.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.82 (pharmacy\u202f=\u202f32.24, nursing\u202f=\u202f29.89, social work\u202f=\u202f26.55). These scores illustrate negative stigma among students and also are similar to existing research identifying a disparity among the healthcare professions. Coursework did not appear to improve stigma toward mental illness.\nThe current education of healthcare providers does not appear to change students' stigma, suggesting educational gaps requiring attention."}, {"Title": "[Restless legs syndrome from the perspective of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) or Willis-Ekbom Disease is an under-diagnosed chronic and progressive primary sensory-motor disorder. It can lead to severe sleep disturbances, a usual cause of consultation. It is characterized by an urgent need to move the legs in resting situations, a cardinal symptom that is usually accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in legs. These symptoms appear or aggravate at the end of the day and in resting situations and are alleviated with movement. Based on these clinical characteristics, it has been defined as a quiescegenic focal akathisia. The diagnosis is essentially clinical. As a guide, there are five cardinal diagnostic criteria. The treatment consists of non-pharmacological measures and the use of medications such as dopamine agonists. Despite the treatment, the symptoms persist in 40% of patients. Psychiatrists should be aware of the syndrome since many drugs used by them such as antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics can worsen the symptoms. Moreover, the syndrome may be associated with depressive and anxiety diseases."}, {"Title": "Functional Analysis is Dead: Long Live Functional Analysis.", "Abstract": "In this rejoinder, we discuss the commonalities and differences of the commentaries to our target article.

Functional analysis has been a guiding principle since the early days of behavior therapy, but lost its dominance with the ruse of the latent disease model of psychiatry. This model gave rise to disorder-specific treatments with limited benefit to patients and science.

Psychiatry of old age specialist training programs were subsequently established to develop a medical workforce that has the required competencies to work in this subspecialty. This article describes the psychiatry of old age specialist training programs in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. These training programs have varying durations, ranging from 1 to 3 years. Although it may not be a mandatory requirement to complete a psychiatry of old age clinical rotation, psychiatry of old age experience and competencies are expected during general psychiatry training. There is generally a lack of opportunity to learn about other clinical specialties relevant to older adults, such as geriatric medicine and neurology. Finally, much work is needed to better coordinate psychiatry of old age specialist training positions, workforce development, and service delivery to ensure there is a sufficient supply of psychiatry of old age specialists to meet the mental health needs of older adults in different countries in the coming years."}, {"Title": "Nutraceuticals for major depressive disorder- more is not merrier: An 8-week double-blind, randomised, controlled trial.", "Abstract": "One of the most pressing questions in \"Nutritional Psychiatry\" is whether using combinations of different nutraceuticals with putative antidepressant activity may provide an enhanced synergistic antidepressant effect.\nA phase II/III, Australian multi-site, 8-week, double-blind, RCT involving 158 outpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD. The intervention consisted of a nutraceutical combination: S-adenosyl methionine; Folinic acid; Omega-3 fatty acids; 5-HTP, Zinc picolinate, and relevant co-factors versus placebo. The primary outcome was change in MADRS score. Hypothesis-driven analyses of potential moderators of response involving key SNPs, and BDNF were also conducted.\nPlacebo was superior to the nutraceutical combination in reducing MADRS score (differential reduction -1.75 points), however a mixed linear model revealed a non-significant Group X Time interaction (p\u202f=\u202f0.33). Response rates were 40% for the active intervention and 51% for the placebo; remission rates were 34% and 43% for active and placebo groups, respectively. No significant differences were found between groups on any other secondary depression, anxiety, psychosocial, or sleep outcome measures. Key SNPs and BDNF did not significantly moderate response. No significant differences occurred between groups for total adverse effects, aside from more nausea in the active group.\nVery high placebo response rates suggest a placebo run-in design may have been valuable.\nThe adoption of a nutraceutical 'shotgun' approach to treating MDD was not supported, and appeared to be less effective than adding placebo to treatment as usual."}, {"Title": "Differential Genetic Effect of the Norepinephrine Transporter Promoter Polymorphisms on Attention Problems in Clinical and Non-clinical Samples.", "Abstract": "Among the monoaminergic modulatory neurotransmitters, norepinephrine is involved in task orienting, hence noradrenergic genetic variants have been studied in connection to attentional processes. The role of this catecholamine system is also highlighted by the selective norepinephrine transporter blocking atomoxetine, which has proved to be effective in the pharmacological treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In the present genetic association study three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs28386840, rs2242446, rs3785143 SNPs) were analyzed from the 5' region of the norepinephrine transporter (<i>NET</i>, <i>SLC6A2</i>) gene, which have been linked to ADHD previously. Attention problems scores of the mother-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used in separate analyses of 88 preschoolers (59.1% male, 6 years of age) recruited from the general population and 120 child psychiatry patients with ADHD diagnosis (85.8% male, age: 9.8 \u00b1 2.9). The <i>NET</i> SNPs showed associations with attention problems, but the direction was different in the two groups. Regarding the promoter variant rs28386840, which showed the most consistent association, the T-allele-carrier patients with ADHD had lower CBCL attention problems scores compared to patients with AA genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.023), whereas T-allele-carriers in the community sample had more attention problems (<i>p</i> = 0.042). Based on previous reports of lower NE levels in ADHD children and the inverted-U shape effect of NE on cognitive functions, we propose that rs28386840 (-3081) T-allele, which is associated with lower NET expression (and potentially higher synaptic NE level) would support attention processes among ADHD patients (similarly as atomoxetine increases NE levels), whereas it would hinder cortical functions in healthy children."}, {"Title": "Clinical challenges in cultural psychiatry - searching for meaning, searching for methods<sup>\u2020</sup>.", "Abstract": "Mental health services in Sweden are confronted with globalization and refugee migration from conflict- and war-torn countries.\nTo discuss how clinicians in Sweden can deal with a series of challenges in a changing globalized society, ranging from difficulties of overcoming barriers to help seeking to difficulties of identifying trauma and finding culturally adapted clinical tools.\nCase vignettes are presented to exemplify challenges.

One barrier to the broader adoption of computational methods, is that they often require advanced statistical modeling and mathematical skills. Biological and behavioral signals often show skewed or non-Gaussian distributions, and very few toolboxes and analytical platforms are capable of processing such signal categories. We developed the Computational Psychiatry Adaptive State-Space (COMPASS) toolbox, an open-source MATLAB-based software package. This toolbox is easy to use and capable of integrating signals with a variety of distributions. COMPASS has the tools to process signals with continuous-valued and binary measurements, or signals with incomplete-missing or censored-measurements, which makes it well-suited for processing those signals captured during a psychophysical task. After specifying a few parameters in a small set of user-friendly functions, COMPASS allows users to efficiently apply a wide range of computational behavioral models. The model output can be analyzed as an experimental outcome or used as a regressor for neural data and can also be tested using the goodness-of-fit measurement. Here, we demonstrate that COMPASS can replicate two computational behavioral analyses from different groups. COMPASS replicates and can slightly improve on the original modeling results. We also demonstrate the use of COMPASS application in a censored-data problem and compare its performance result with na\u00efve estimation methods.

Both groups think that the smoking rates for inpatients are between 50-100%. Most of the units is locked, with or without an external space, so that a total smoking ban is considered difficult to achieve by both groups. A very high rate of units has no specific rooms for smokers. In most cases the issue management is solved by a self-regulation, based on collecting cigarettes and lighters and granting a limited number of cigarettes per day. Anyway, an institutional intervention would be appreciated especially by nurses, who seem to be even more involved in the issue management and both of groups seem to badly judge the lack of sources to face the eventual ban: particularly the possibility to offer nicotine replacement therapy, a cognitive-behavioural support and providing more staff education would all be considered useful to implement the success rate of the ban. By the way, both of groups seem skeptical about the possibility of a total smoking-free policy in Acute Psychiatric Hospital Units. Though, a difference in the problem\u2019s perception between the two groups has been noticed.\nSmoking cessation remains a neglected area in psychiatry, in part due to misconceptions about smoking in the mentally ill, i.e. the idea that smoking cessation will exacerbate mental illness, aggression and suicide risk, even though these believes are not supported by evidence; in part due to the lack of institutional intervention and the structural deficiencies of the units."}, {"Title": "Reflective practice groups: Are they useful for liaison psychiatry nurses working within the Emergency Department?", "Abstract": "Liaison psychiatry nurses in Emergency Departments assess and plan onward treatment for individuals, often following self-harm or suicide attempts.

Test results were evaluated and compared for each group.\nThe study included a total of 60 children (30 children with LD as study group and 30 healthy children as control group) who met the inclusion criteria. When event-related potentials were taken into consideration, P2 and P300 mean amplitudes for right ears and N1 and P300 mean amplitudes for left ears were significantly lower in study group than those in the control group. Likewise, P2 and P300 mean latency in right ears and P1, N1, and P300 mean latency in left ears were prolonged in study group (p<0.05).\nPatients with LD may have disorders of the cortical auditory processing even if they have normal hearing screening tests. Pathologies in late-latency evoked potentials may have a role in the etiology of these patients."}, {"Title": "Research Domain Criteria: Cutting Edge Neuroscience or Galen's Humors Revisited?", "Abstract": "The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) scheme has guided the research agenda of the National Institute of Mental Health for the past decade. The essence of RDoC is its dimensional conception of mental illness, with the assumption that psychopathology is a manifestation of extremes along axes of neuropsychological variation. Research, it follows, should emphasize normal neuropsychological function and its associated neurocircuitry. We argue that RDoC, dressed in terms of modern neurobiology, is in fact a return to the humoral theory of Galen, a dimensional approach in which physical and mental health requires a balance of the four basic bodily humors (blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm). The RDoC/Galenic approach may be useful in understanding those conditions best understood as extremes along a continuum, such as personality disorders. However, we contend that for the most severe psychiatric disorders - categorically defined diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism - RDoC's Galenic dimensionalism is a retreat from the biomedical approach that seeks to find rational therapeutic targets by identifying etiologic factors and pathogenic pathways. Abandoning this medical model now, in the context of remarkable advances in genetics, neuroimaging, and neuroscience, is a major setback for the advancement of scientific psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Intern Passport: Orienting New Travelers to the Emergency Department.", "Abstract": "The objective of the Intern Passport (IP) curriculum was to implement a structured orientation for incoming interns that effectively defined and distinguished various personnel and assets within the emergency department (ED).

This meta-analysis examined the prevalence of falls in older psychiatric patients and its moderating factors. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were independently searched by three investigators from their inception date to Nov 31, 2017. The random effects meta-analysis was used to synthesize the prevalence of falls, while meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the moderating factors. Sixteen of the 2061 potentially relevant papers met the entry criteria for the meta-analysis. The pooled lifetime prevalence of falls was 17.25% (95% confidence interval: 13.14%-21.35%). Neither univariate and nor multivariate meta-regression analyses revealed any moderating effects of the study region, duration, sample size, and quality on the prevalence of falls (P values\u202f>\u202f0.05).

This symptomatic high concurrency suggests that both conditions are in some ways causally linked. Research is ongoing to identify distinctive neurobehavioral mechanisms and endophenotypes that predispose individuals to compulsive drug use and other mental disorders. Research is also providing new revelations about the diverse effects of substances on individuals, including differences according to sex. Today we know that the same substance may give rise to different behavioral, affective, cognitive, and sensory effects across different individuals.\nThis state-of the art review tends to address the concept of precision psychiatry and dual disorders. The PubMed database was searched for the last 15\u2009years to identify those articles that reported neurobiological perspectives on dual disorders, addiction and other mental disorders, precision medicine, and precision psychiatry.\nThere has been considerable progress made in recent years in relation to the study of addiction and dual disorders. The concept of dual disorders attempts to capture not only the persistence of substance use and substance seeking but also the evident vulnerability of specific subpopulations to switch from controlled to compulsive drug use. Precision medicine is focused on identifying this individual vulnerability to illness as much as the individual response to treatment. Psychiatry is fully committed to this goal. Regarding addiction, essential precision medicine advances will be possible if concerted efforts are made in the discovery of biological variations and environmental factors that contribute to individual vulnerability to addictive disorders and dual disorders, together with the identification of moderators of treatment response.\nHere we survey the discoveries, future research directions, and translational relevance of the concept of precision psychiatry for dual disorders. The review may offer new perspectives on this issue and highlight a new way to see and to think about dual disorders."}, {"Title": "Visual Attention Deficits in Schizophrenia Can Arise From Inhibitory Dysfunction in Thalamus or Cortex.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with diverse cognitive deficits, including disorders of attention-related oculomotor behavior. At the structural level, schizophrenia is associated with abnormal inhibitory control in the circuit linking cortex and thalamus. We developed a spiking neural network model that demonstrates how dysfunctional inhibition can degrade attentive gaze control. Our model revealed that perturbations of two functionally distinct classes of cortical inhibitory neurons, or of the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus, disrupted processing vital for sustained attention to a stimulus, leading to distractibility. Because perturbation at each circuit node led to comparable but qualitatively distinct disruptions in attentive tracking or fixation, our findings support the search for new eye movement metrics that may index distinct underlying neural defects. Moreover, because the cortico-thalamic circuit is a common motif across sensory, association, and motor systems, the model and extensions can be broadly applied to study normal function and the neural bases of other cognitive deficits in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with the use of seclusion in an inpatient psychiatric unit in Lilongwe, Malawi.", "Abstract": "Data on the use of seclusion for psychiatric inpatients in sub-Saharan Africa are extremely limited. Though seclusion is sometimes necessary for patients that pose a threat to themselves or others, adverse physical and psychological sequelae from the experience are increasingly being recognized, leading to efforts to reduce its use. The purpose of this study was to calculate the frequency of seclusion in patients hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric unit in Lilongwe, Malawi, and to identify factors associated with its use.\nRecords of 419 psychiatric inpatients hospitalized at Kamuzu Central Hospital's Bwaila Psychiatric Unit in Lilongwe, Malawi, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, were reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with the use of seclusion.\nSeclusion was used for 30.3% (127/419) of patients during the study period. Male patients had increased odds of being secluded (aOR: 2.22, p=0.02). Assaulting other patients on the unit (aOR 7.92, p<0.01) and presenting to the unit in mechanical restraints (aOR 2.33, p<0.01) were also associated with seclusion. There was no association between seclusion and age; diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, marijuana use disorder, or schizophrenia; involuntary admission; presence of extra pyramidal side effects; presence of hallucinations; suicidality; or commission of violent acts prior to admission.\nDocumentation about the rationale for the use of seclusion on the unit was minimal. Improved record keeping requirements will be essential to future efforts to study seclusion and reduce its use. Development of strategies to address patient violence on the unit could decrease the use of seclusion for aggressive patients. Patients arriving to the unit in restraints would benefit from increased efforts by staff to apply behavioural interventions or administer medications, in order to deescalate these individuals and limit the use of seclusion in their treatment."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Nurses and Hospitalized Patients about the Rights of Psychiatric Clients.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> In recent years, protecting the rights of hospitalized psychiatric clients became a key issue in relationship-building and collaborative caretaking.

This study aimed to compare the nurses and psychiatric clients' attitudes towards rights of hospitalized clients. <b>Method</b> <b>:</b> In this cross sectional descriptive study, 60 nurses, and 100 clients, who were admitted to various wards of a psychiatric hospital in Shiraz, were included. Data were collected using 2 questionnaires that were designed for nurses (22 questions) and patients (29 questions) about the rights of patients. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics. <b>Results:</b> The results revealed that most of nurses (55%) and clients (64%) agreed with active participation of the clients in healthcare decision-making. More than half of the clients agreed with the possibility of refusal/withdrawal of the proposed treatment or leaving the hospital despite medical advice. Only 38.3% of nurses agreed with those rules in some clauses (P-value < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> To protect the rights of mentally ill clients, their family, and the society, we should identify weaknesses and shortcomings of the basic rights of this group and make suggestions for their improvement.

The article continues with a discussion of commonly used means for detecting deception. Although not traditionally used to uncover malingering, new, innovative methods are emphasized that attempt to induce greater cognitive load on liars than truth tellers, some informed by theoretical accounts of deception.

The survey instrument included a brief form for demographic variables, the Attribution Questionnaire-9 (AQ-9), the Ten Items Personality Inventory (TIPI), and two questions exploring attitudes toward open-door and restraint-free policies in Psychiatry. Higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes were found in males (Pity, Blame, Help, and Avoidance) and in those (76.5%) who had never had any experience with psychiatric patients (Danger, Fear, Blame, Segregation, Help, Avoidance and Coercion). A similar trend was also found in those who don't share the policy of no seclusion/restraint, while subjects who are favorable to open-door policies reported higher Coercion scores. No correlations were found between dimensions of stigma and personality traits. A machine learning approach was then used to explore the role of demographic, academic and personality variables as predictors of stigmatizing attitudes. Agreeableness and Extraversion emerged as the most relevant predictors for blaming attitudes, while Emotional Stability and Openness appeared to be the most effective contributors to Anger. Our results confirmed that a training experience in Psychiatry might successfully reduce stigma in Psychology students.

It contrasts with the prevailing orientation in psychiatry toward the medical model of delimited diseases. Discussions of this order centered on symptom complexes gained special prominence in psychiatry between the early 20th century through Alfred Hoche and World War II through Carl Schneider. Their works, in addition to the work of other authors of that period, are considered. The late Kraepelin conceded the possibility that affective and schizophrenic manifestations do not represent disease processes but rather represent areas of human personality. Seeing mind or persons is a paradigmatic different perspective than seeing diseases. Re-emerge in this comprehensive or integrationist context the notion of unitary psychosis and philosophical questions as the mind-body problem; as background there was a process metaphysics. The possibility of human experience in a phenomenological sense is considered, and a matrix of symptom or function complexes is related to it. Examples of past unitary models of mental disorders with their neurophysiologic explanations are given, as well as an analogy to current biological aspects of the endogenous in chronobiology. The question or hypothesis arises whether mental symptom complexes are manifestations of mind constituents or functions that make human experience and mind possible. The present work is a conceptual analysis that indicates a positive answer to this question. The expectation is to emphasize the perspectives of investigation in psychopathology and sciences of mind fostered by this view of symptom complexes."}, {"Title": "IMPACT OF MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY ON PATIENTS' COMPREHENSION OF HEALTHCARE.", "Abstract": "Modern medical practice require close communication both doctors and patients. Development of medicine, especially seen in past decades, promoted changes in medical procedures and documentation, i.e. development of more accurate and valuable informed consent, which is an important part of treatment or diagnostic process. On the other hand, novel researches and achievements in medicine brought new terminology, descriptions and widened medical language, which complicated understanding of information both by practitioners (in any field, including psychiatry), and by patients. Clear understanding of information during diagnostic and treatment process by patients is considered an important factor of success, because researches show increasing of anxiety, depression and indifference, and decrease of involvement of patients in case of incomprehension or misunderstanding of medical information. At the same time, correct insight of information leads to improvement of patient-doctor relationships and is considered as a stimulus to reduction of morbidity and mortality and misuse of health care. Literature analysis have shown both various causes of this and ways to solve this existing problem. Most common ideas include lack of comprehension, low medical literacy and complexity of medical language. Some authors insist on existence of \"medical sublanguage\", due to plenty of terminology, synonymic words and constructions, which can completely replace \"normal\" language in some situations. Despite this development, cultural, geographical and historical influence still brings confusion in terminology. Variety of terms, which describe the same structure or process, variety of eponyms, which differ from country to county, frequently bring confusion, especially in patients, who are usually not conceived on what can the information be about. Moreover, in situation of high mobility, those geographical and cultural medical peculiarities are able to confuse even practitioners.

Reporting from the Norwegian Outpatient Commitment Study, this article aims to: establish the profile of the OC population in Norway; ascertain the legal justification for the use of OC and what OC involves for patients; investigate possible associations between selected patient and service characteristics and duration of OC, and; explore potential differences based on gender or rurality.\nA retrospective multi-site study, extracting data from the medical records of all patients on OC in six large regional hospitals in 2008-12, with detailed investigation over 36\u202fmonths of the subsample of patients on first ever OC-order in 2008-09. We use descriptive statistics to establish the profile of the OC population and the legal justification for and the content of OC, and logistic regression to examine factors associated with duration of OC over 36\u202fmonths.\n1414 patients were on OC over the 5\u202fyears, and 274 had their first OC in 2008-09. The sample included more men than woman, and three-quarters were diagnosed with schizophrenia. They had long service histories, including involuntary admissions. The legal justification for all OC-orders was the need for treatment, and 18% were additionally justified by dangerousness. The option to initiate OC directly from the community was not used in any of the 274 first ever OC-orders. While 98% of patients were prescribed psychotropic medication, under half had an Involuntary Treatment Order, which under the Norwegian OC regime is required in addition to the OC-order to oblige patients to accept treatment (usually medication). 60% of patients had \u22652 clinical contacts monthly. There were some gender differences in descriptive analyses with men generally being worse off, but no clear pattern in terms of rurality. Patients in the sample had been on OC between one week and 20\u202fyears. The median duration of OC over 36\u202fmonths was 365\u202fdays. Three factors contributed to longer duration: the use of the dangerousness criterion; a diagnosis of schizophrenia disorder, and; considerable problems with substance abuse.\nThe characteristics of the OC population in Norway are very similar to that reported in other jurisdictions. Medication seems to be the central focus of OC, yet additional Involuntary Treatment Orders are imposed for less than half of patients. While all OC-orders were justified by the need to ensure treatment, risk seems to be a concern for a subgroup of patients who are kept on for longer. How the 2017 amendment to the mental health act, which precludes compulsion for competent patients unless danger is present, will affect OC use, remains to be seen. Further studies should specifically focus on variation in the use of OC, including at the level of individual clinicians."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic, clinical and criminological characteristics of a sample of Italian Volterra REMS patients.", "Abstract": "In Italy the Law 9/2012 prescribed the total closure of forensic psychiatric hospitals (OPGs) and the conversion to a care model based on residential units in the community employing only clinical personnel (Residenze per l'Esecuzione delle Misure di Sicurezza - REMS) and fully integrated in public mental health services.

Psychiatric diagnoses were made by REMS psychiatrists according to the DSM-5 criteria. Criminological information was obtained from patients' criminal records.\nVolterra REMS patients' characteristics are similar to those of samples of OPGs patients (unmarried socially disadvantaged males with an average age of 40, no offsprings, low education, high rates of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders and medical comorbidity). However, the REMS model presents a very high turnover rate: during the study period 61 patients were admitted while 32 were discharged. Being assisted by public mental health services before committing the crime increased the probability of discharge. In non-EU patients long acting injectable antipsychotics were used more frequently than in community ones. Substance-Related Disorders are the main psychiatric comorbidity and resulted as being more frequent in bipolar patients than in other patients.\nDue to the high patients' turnover, we expect a progressive change in sociodemographic, clinical and criminological features of the REMS population.

The recent closure of such structures following the Prime Minister's Decree of April 1, 2008, fostered the need to create new structures. These are called \"REMS,\" and they are based in the community and led by psychiatrists and healthcare staff who may rely on the collaboration of public security staff. This act completed a course of progressive deinstitutionalization of all psychiatric patients. However, some problems remain, and persons regarded as \"partially mentally disabled\" at the time of crime perpetration must serve part of their sentence in prison and the rest in the aforementioned structures or in psychiatric rehabilitation communities, depending on their claimed \"social dangerousness.\" Psychiatric services now face the ambiguity of treating persons who are considered dangerous by court orders, while the civil law criteria for involuntary hospitalization is based only on the need of care.

Press reports of sleeping, often drunk, men acquitted as automatons of raping adults and children suggest cases are rising. The use of automatism, rather than insanity, in these cases is strong evidence of the immemorial struggle faced by legal psychiatry in appropriately construing unconscious defendants. This paper responds by drawing on well-established psychoanalytic conceptions of unconsciousness to present sexsomnia as dispositional to the defendant. Taking the Freudian concepts of eros and death instinct, it asserts that sexsomniacs are acting on repressed sadistic desires. Accordingly, those on notice of their sexsomnia, who fail to mitigate the risk of further attacks, should be guilty of rape. Reliance on (a reformed) insanity defence - being a denial of responsibility at the time of the offence - undermines the scope of the criminal law to self-responsibilise sexsomniacs against perpetrating unwanted sex."}, {"Title": "[Suicide and Suicide Prevention in Psychiatric Hospitals].", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention is a central topic of psychiatry and psychotherapy.

There were statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in the knowledge regarding anxiety and depression among the groups. The relationship between specialty and knowledge was statistically significant (p<0.05) and the effect of first language is insignificant (p>0.05).\nExpansive enlightenment programmes, continued medical education and inclusion of psychiatric posting in rotating residential internship programme during undergraduate courses are required for physicians not only to fill the gap in knowledge and attitude but also to improve their cognitive, communication and interpersonal skills."}, {"Title": "The DSM-ICD diagnostic approach as an essential bridge between the patient and the \"big data\".", "Abstract": "The use of diagnostic manuals in psychiatry is generally necessitated by the lack of tests that would corroborate psychiatric diagnosis. Criticism towards the today prevailing DSM-ICD diagnosis traditionally regards among others such problems as hyponarrativity, biologism, \"death of phenomenology\", and a questionably valid over-fragmentation of diagnosis. Lately, and especially after the appearance of the 5th edition of DSM (2013), criticism focuses at such issues as lack of validity, having failed to adopt a dimensional model, not adequately relying on genetics and neurobiology, and impeding, rather than facilitating, research into the etiology of mental disorders, the DSM becoming an \"epistemic prison\". The former problems seem to derive from the fact that the operationalist criteria are often uncritically adopted as the ultimate authority in diagnosis, instead of being merely guides, as intended originally and explicitely; the latter problems have been made more evident since the emergence of the American RDoC research initiative, which not only points to an alternative, more valid classification of mental disorders, but also aspires to signal a move of psychiatry t\u03bfwards precision medicine, having as its main dogma that mental disorders are disorders of brain circuits, which are expressed as complex syndromes. In this paper, the historical and epistemological context of the emergence of DSM is examined; its achievement in terms of diagnostic reliability as well as clinical utility is not negligible, especially taken into consideration the climate of virtual diagnostic arbitrariness which characterized the (American) psychiatry before 1980, with obvious consequences for the authority of the specialty. Then, the potential of the new era of genetics, neurobiology and analysis of the \"big data\" for generating a novel approach to psychiatric diagnosis and classification is put into consideration, while it remains unknown in what way the findings of RDoC could lead and be translated into a new classification system. Moreover, the particularity of the psychiatric object, the clinical significance of the categorical approach to diagnosis, as well as the need for a \"irreducible psychological level of explanation\" are discussed. In our view, today, the DSM-ICD diagnosis lies between two different and potentially opposing demands and tendencies: on the one hand, the demand for the individual, subjective and phenomenological particularity of the mentally ill to be taken into consideration (a demand that sometimes underestimates the need for clinical communication); on the other hand, the (largely future) vision for more and more analysis of biological data in the name of a yet to be clarified personalized therapy (the very notion of diagnosis becoming potentially redundant). Finally, considering the particularity of the psychiatric object, we conclude that matthe DSM-ICD approach, with its categorical diagnoses and its descriptive operational criteria, despite its inherent imperfections and inadequacies, continues to have a place in psychiatry as an essential bridge/interface between clinic and research data, as a common clinical language, and as an epistemic hub; and that prerequisites for diagnostic validity should be sought both in the cells of RDoC and in those theoretical approaches which examine human subjectivity as such, included phenomenology and psychoanalysis."}, {"Title": "Mental health and psychosocial factors in young refugees, immigrants and Greeks: A retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Since 1989, Greece has accepted thousands of economic immigrants and more recently, since 2010, has been transformed to a host country for refugees mainly from countries at war. Refugees experience a number of serious traumas, i.e. death of family member or a close friend, physical, emotional or sexual abuse, and at the same time have to confront poverty, hostility and racism during and after the settlement in the host country. On the other hand, economic immigrants have mainly to face adaption difficulties in a host country including racism, poverty, different culture, bureaucracy. The aim of the current retrospective study was to examine the differences in psychopathology between immigrants, refugees and natives. We examined differences in psychiatric diagnoses and factors influencing their health status between four groups: (i) 90 files of children whose families referred to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (DeCAP), University of Athens, during 2005-2009, (ii) 216 files of children whose families seek for help during 2010-2014. Immigrants who referred to the DeCAP during the first period were mainly economic immigrants, whereas immigrants of the second period were mainly refugees from countries in conflict. These data were matched with age and sex with 151 files of natives who referred to the DeCAP during the aforementioned decade: (iii) 72 Greek families who seek for help during 2005-2009, and (iv) 79 Greek families who seek for help during 2010-2014. The Greek comparison group consisted of children and adolescents whose parents were both Greek. Investigating the differences in psychiatric diagnoses (F) and factors influencing health status (Z) between the groups, young refugees received a greater number of Z compared to Greeks (2010-2014). The proportion of refugees who had at least two Z was greater than that of immigrants and Greeks 2010-20014. Regarding the psychiatric diagnoses, Greek sample after 2010 received a greater proportion of psychiatric diagnoses than refugees. These results highlight that refugee families seek for help mainly not for psychiatric reasons. This could reflect their different needs or their difficulty to have access in public health services comparing to immigrants and natives."}, {"Title": "[A brief historical approach about the concept of paranoia].", "Abstract": "From the ancient Greeks (V to III centuries BC), through Hippocrates to the Roman physician Aulo Cornelius Celso (I century), the term paranoia has been used as a manifestation of mental illness. After many centuries, Robert Burton in 1621 introduces the concept with a more modern meaning. Only with Heinroth (1818) the syndrome enters into the psychiatric nosology as a disorder of thought with unaltered perceptions. French and German psychiatry agree on the concept of paranoia as a partial psychosis with a maintained level of functioning and absence of deterioration. With this meaning the term is introduced in the modern psychiatry in Kahlbaum's work (1863). Jasper contributes with the introduction of paranoid development that can be influenced by the environment or previous experiences (1910). But to Kraepelin (1921) is owed the most precise description in a specifc essay based on his clinical experience. The German psychiatrist speaks of both a psychogenic and a more biological component. In modern psychiatric classifcations gradually the syndrome has disappeared and encompassed in the generic delusional disorder, clearly distinct from schizophrenia, and only if the delusions are understandable. The consequences of the absence of a diagnostic recognition implies that there is no specific research on this syndrome with difficulties in developing psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments."}, {"Title": "[Big Data and Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The popularity of the term \"big data\" has increased exponentially in recent years.

Hypersexuality and general disinhibition of societal and cultural norms are commonly documented in all types of dementia. However, sparse literature exists on polyembolokoilamania (insertion of foreign objects in bodily orifices) without a sexual component as a dementia-related symptom. We review an unusual case of a 94-year-old man who presented with urethral polyembolokoilamania without hypersexuality or other behavioral disinhibition. We highlight clinical considerations of managing urethral polyembolokoilamania in an elderly patient without a previous neurocognitive disorder diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team approach with input from Internal Medicine, Urology, Psychiatry, and Neurology lead to a comprehensive assessment of a patient that could have been managed solely as a surgical case. This spearheaded a formal diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder-guiding successful management, follow-up, caregiver education, and reduction of further harm."}, {"Title": "Aging and Postintensive Care Syndrome- Family: A Critical Need for Geriatric Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Postintensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F) describes the psychological symptoms that affect the family members of patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) or recently discharged from the ICU. Geriatric psychiatrists should be concerned about PICS-F for several reasons. First, ICU hospitalization in older adults is associated with higher rates of cognitive and physical impairment compared with older adults hospitalized in non-ICU settings or dwelling in the community. This confers a special burden on the caregivers of these older ICU survivors compared with other geriatric populations. Second, as caregivers themselves age, caring for this unique burden can be more challenging compared with other geriatric populations. Third, evidence for models of care centered on patients with multimorbidity and their caregivers is limited. A deeper understanding of how to care for PICS and PICS-F may inform clinical practice for other geriatric populations with multimorbidity and their caregivers. Geriatric psychiatrists may play a key role in delivering coordinated care for PICS-F by facilitating timely diagnosis and interdisciplinary collaboration, advocating for the healthcare needs of family members suffering from PICS-F, and leading efforts within healthcare systems to increase awareness and treatment of PICS-F. This clinical review will appraise the current literature about the impact of critical illness on the family members of ICU survivors and identify crucial gaps in our knowledge about PICS-F among aging patients and caregivers."}, {"Title": "A comparative analysis of National Institutes of Health research support for emergency medicine - 2008 to 2017.", "Abstract": "We sought to compare National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding received by Emergency Medicine (EM) to the specialties of Family Medicine, Neurology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics and Psychiatry over the 10-year period from 2008 to 2017.\nThe NIH database of both submitted and funded NIH applications were queried and crossed with the departmental affiliation of the principal investigator. Research Grants were defined by the following activity codes: R, P, M, S, K, U (excluding UC6), DP1, DP2, DP3, DP4, DP5, D42 and G12. Derived data were further analyzed using information from the Association of American Medical Colleges to determine the relationship between the number of awards and the size of respective teaching and research faculty.\nFrom 2008 to 2017, there were a total of 14,676 funded grants across included specialties with total monetary support of $6.002 billion. Of these funded grants, 250 (1.7%) were from EM principal investigators which corresponded to total support of $89,453,635 (1.5% of overall dollars). There was an increase in total support after 2012 in EM, however when compared to the other specialties, EM investigators submitted relatively fewer grants and awarded grants were funded by a wider distribution of NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs).\nCompared to other select specialties, EM investigators accounted for a small proportion of grants submitted and funded over the past decade.

Later I became the Managing Editor of Elsevier's Psychiatry Research. Over 50 years, I saw changes in scientific review and journal production that were at first quite slow but later rapidly accelerating. I started in an era before PCs, where authors submitted typewritten (i.e., on typewriters) paper manuscripts and editors relied on pencils for typographic instructions and copy-editing changes. Manuscript review was entirely by mail, three copies of each manuscript being sent to reviewers worldwide, and reviews likewise being returned by mail. Efficiency was enhanced with the appearance of fax machines, overnight courier services and, best of all, email communication. The ubiquity of PCs led to the submission of manuscripts on diskette and later as email attachments. Manuscript submission, review, copy editing, and transmission to the publisher were all done by email. In a parallel development, the review process and journal visibility were revolutionized by the advent of the \"electronic\" library, aiding the selection of appropriate reviewers and leading to a worldwide explosion in manuscript submissions.

These variations have been partially explained by the different legal frameworks, but also by several individual-related, system-related and area-related characteristics, identified as predictors of the use of coercive measures. This study aimed to compare the socio-demographic and clinical profile as well as the referral and hospitalisation process of people voluntarily and involuntarily hospitalized in order to identify which factors could be associated with the use of coercion.\nAll psychiatric admissions occurred between the 1st January 2015 and the 31st December 2015 were included in this retrospective study (n\u2009=\u20095027). The whole sample was split into two subgroups accordingly to the hospitalisation legal status at admission (voluntary vs involuntary) and differences between the two groups were examined. In order to identify the factors associated with coercion, all the variables reaching a p\u2009<\u2009.01 level of significance when comparing the two groups were included as independent variables into a multivariate logistic regression model.\nGlobally, 62% of the admissions were voluntary and 38% were involuntary. Compared to the voluntary group, involuntary patients were significantly older, more frequently widowed and living in one specific district, and had a main diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20-F29) or organic mental disorders (F00-F09). People affected by organic mental disorders (F00-F09), with higher levels of psychotic symptoms, aggression and problems with medication adherence, were more likely to be involuntarily admitted. Moreover, living in District 1, being referred by a general practitioner, a general hospital or a psychiatric hospital and being involuntarily admitted during the previous 12\u2009months, was associated with a higher risk of coercion.\nThis study identified several individual-related, as well as system-related factors associated with the use of coercion. These results allowed us to trace a clearer profile of high-risk patients and to provide several inputs that could help local authorities, professionals and researchers to develop better-targeted alternative interventions reducing the use of coercion."}, {"Title": "Commonwealth v. Carter and Legal Interpretations of Facilitated Suicide.", "Abstract": "In June 2017, a media frenzy ensued after Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the state of Massachusetts for facilitating the suicide of Conrad Roy. The verdict stirred controversy and cast a spotlight on facilitation of suicide, i.e., a person's act(s) done with the purpose of helping another to die by suicide. One form of facilitation, physician-assisted suicide, has been extensively debated in the existing literature. In this article, we set out to explore the legal and forensic ramifications of non-physician-assisted suicide, which we refer to as facilitated suicide. We first conducted a review of all fifty states' legislation regarding facilitated suicide: forty-four states prohibit it by statute, and three states prohibit it through common law. Thirteen states specifically outlaw verbal facilitation of suicide. We then surveyed the case law to identify legal precedent to the Commonwealth v. <i>Carter</i> verdict. <i>Final Exit Network, Inc. v. State</i> and <i>State v. Melchert-Dinkel</i> provide contrasting yet complementary perspectives on the interplay between speech and assisted suicide. Finally, we detailed the role of forensic psychiatry in investigating facilitated suicide, specifically among adolescents and youths."}, {"Title": "Humane Forensic Practice Serves Social Justice.", "Abstract": "In response to a call for revision of the current procedures for involuntary treatment in Massachusetts, this commentary explores the ethics basis for such institutional reform. In the decades since the landmark <i>Rogers v.

Building on systemic approaches by Gutheil et al. and Ciccone and Clements, Candilis and Martinez, for example, have argued that a robust professional ethic requires moving beyond the strict role theory of the adversarial system to consider broader approaches that integrate multiple perspectives: the ultimate goal is protection of vulnerable people and ideas. In this commentary, we suggest that the current system for involuntary treatment does not protect the vulnerable people it ought to serve, failing the neglected goal of social justice."}, {"Title": "Professional Identity, the Goals and Purposes of Forensic Psychiatry, and Dr. Ezra Griffith.", "Abstract": "Dr. Ezra Griffith's retirement as Editor of <i>The Journal</i> motivated this reflection on his contributions to forensic psychiatry.

In recent years, research has underlined the role of self-regulatory processes and impulsivity in the development and maintenance of SUD in adolescents. Mindfulness has gained much attention due to its capacity to influence self-regulatory processes, particularly in adult populations. Initial studies have shown the potential of mindfulness-based approaches in younger SUD patients. The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate the added treatment effect of a mindfulness-based group psychotherapy (\"Mind it!\") for adolescents with SUD in comparison to the current standard treatment.

The study is a prospective randomized controlled multi-center trial in which patients are assessed: (1) after completing a prior detoxification phase (t<sub>0</sub>), (2) at 4 weeks (t<sub>1</sub>), (3) at 8 weeks (t<sub>2</sub>), and (4) at 6 months after t<sub>2</sub> (t<sub>3</sub>). Participants in the intervention group will receive mindfulness-based group psychotherapy in addition to their existing treatment regime. The primary outcome is substance use in the past 30\u2009days at follow-up based on the Timeline Followback self-report. Secondary outcomes include craving, severity of dependence, and abstinence motivation. Mindfulness, impulsivity, and emotion regulation will be analyzed as possible mediators of treatment effects.\nThis trial is expected to provide evidence of the added effect of a novel, safe, and feasible treatment option for adolescents with SUD.\nGerman Register of Clinical Studies, DRKS00014041 .

The reason is that these skills, undoubtedly belonging to the classical education, are not standard elements of teaching professionals in the fields mentioned above. Having the expert knowledge, ability to diagnose, to conduct a therapy and to prognosticate does not indicate the ability to conduct effective arguments. This work is based on Cardijin's method (See - Judge - Act). It sometimes happens that a well-prepared expert opinion (psychiatric and psychological) is discredited for non-substantive reasons due to some eristic and rhetorical tricks. Having such experiences, some expert witnesses resign from giving opinions. To help avoid such situations, this work presents the most important definitions of logic, rhetoric and eristic. Examples of propositional calculus, selected models of reasoning, rhetorical figures and eristic tricks can be used in presenting professional expertise.

Jealousy can take a reactive, anxious or possessive forms. This paper aims to present multifactorial genesis of jealousy, which leads to aggressive behaviors, usually in a form of domestic violence, but also resulting in homicides. Factors contributing to the occurrence of aggressive behaviors include specific personality traits of perpetrators as well as external variables, often constant and growing conflicts with the environment, usually multiplied by strong negative emotions directly preceding aggressive attacks. Acts motivated by jealousy often cause juridical difficulties in forensic psychiatry, both in the scope of diagnosis, determination of sanity related to the accusation, as well as in validity of the use of security measures.

There is considerable concern that SDG3.4 may not be achieved. The WHO Best Buys for NCDs has emphasized prevention, and although crucial, it alone will not achieve the 30% reduction in NCDs by 2030. Likewise, a strengthened health system is required as all NCDs are likely to require hospital facilities and community services for optimal management. This is a major problem for low-resource countries (LRCs) -that is, low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries-as most currently have a poorly developed health system, including cancer services, in need of upgrading. This is a result of the extreme poverty of LRCs, where 40% to 80% of the population live on less than USD $1.25 per day, with the average health spending by governments in low-income countries at $110 per person per year. In this article, we outline a comprehensive national cancer services plan for LRCs. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for cancer treatment also require input from other specialties, such as anesthesia, pathology, laboratory medicine, a blood bank, and diagnostic radiology.

As pathogenic genes in the virus are completely or largely eliminated, it is safe to be widely used in multidisciplinary research fields for expressing genes, such as neuroscience, metabolism, oncology and so on. Neuroscience and psychiatry are the most closely related disciplines in either basic research or clinical research, but the application of viral vectors in neuropsychiatry has not received much attention or not been widely accepted.\nThis article will focus on the application of viral vectors in basic and clinical neuropsychiatric research.\nBy using viral vectors, scientists can perform neurological labelling, gene expression regulation and physiological manipulation for investigating phenomenon from molecular mechanisms to behaviours. At the same time, to treat mental or neurological disorders, viral vectors can be designed for gene therapy, which alter gene expression levels or repair mutated genes in the brains of patients.\nViral vectors play an important role in basic research and clinical applications. To further understand brain function and prevent mental and neurological diseases, we hypothesize that viral vectors could be used along with various advanced technologies, such as sequencing and high-throughput expression analysis in the neuroscience research field."}, {"Title": "Effects of group singing versus group music listening on hospitalized children and adolescents with mental disorders: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "There is an emerging view that music-related interventions (MuRI) may play an important role for youth with mental disorders. Here, we assessed the potential neuroendocrine (cortisol), immune (IgA) and psychological (mood state, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), well-being) efficacy of a brief program of MuRI (group singing versus group music listening) in children and adolescents with mental disorders in a clinical setting.\nWe performed this observational pilot study with 17 patients (aged 11-18; 11 female) admitted to the Department for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/PMU Salzburg, Austria between March 2015 and April 2016. Patients participated in either a singing program or a music listening program, delivered through five daily, consecutive 45-minute sessions in one week.\nSaliva samples for cortisol and IgA, and subjective measures of mood were taken daily, pre- and post-MuRI. HRQOL and well-being were measured pre- and post-5-day-program of MuRI. The program in singing led to a significantly larger mean drop in cortisol than in music listening (mean difference: -0\u00b732; 95% CI -0\u00b757 to -0\u00b707), while listening led to a significantly higher mean positive change in the dimension calmness (mean difference: -2\u00b766, 95%CI -4\u00b799 to -0\u00b733) than singing. Moreover, singing was associated with an improvement in HRQOL, and listening with an improvement in well-being.\nOur preliminary findings suggest that MuRI may provide benefits for children and adolescents with mental disorders. The differences in psychobiological responses to singing and music listening invite further investigations. A larger, suitably powered study is now needed to provide a precise estimate of the effects of MuRI for mental health promotion, both on psychological and biological experiences.

The underlying neurological dysfunctions in both processes, which are interrelated and share neuroanatomical bases, remain poorly understood. The principal objective of this study was to elucidate whether there are any brain regions that show abnormal response during timing and oddball tasks in patients with SZ. To this end, we conducted a signed differential mapping (SDM) meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies assessing abnormal responses elicited by tasks based on the oddball paradigm in patients with SZ. We conducted a similar SDM meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of timing tasks in SZ. Finally, we undertook a multimodal meta-analysis to detect the common findings of the two previous meta-analyses. We\u00a0found that SZ patients showed hypoactivation in cortical and subcortical areas related to timing. The dysfunction observed during timing tasks partially coincided with deficiencies in change-detection functions (particularly in the case of preattentional processing in the mismatch negativity response).

These conditions are seen by different medical fields, such as psychiatry in the case of ASD, and musculoskeletal disciplines and genetics in the case of hypermobility-related disorders. Thus, a link between them is rarely established in clinical setting, despite a scarce but growing body of research suggesting that both conditions co-occur more often than expected by chance. Hypermobility is a frequent sign of hereditary disorders of connective tissue (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, Marfan syndrome), in which the main characteristic is the multisystem fragility that prone to proprioceptive and motor coordination dysfunction and hence to trauma and chronic pain. Considering the high probability that pain remains disregarded and untreated in people with ASD due to communication and methodological difficulties, increasing awareness about the interconnection between ASD and hypermobility-related disorders is relevant, since it may help identify those ASD patients susceptible to chronic pain."}, {"Title": "Dissociation debates: everything you know is wrong.", "Abstract": "Controversy about dissociation and the dissociative disorders (DD) has existed since the beginning of modern psychiatry and psychology.

Skeptics counter that dissociation produces fantasies of trauma, and that DD are artefactual conditions produced by iatrogenesis and/or socio-cultural factors. Almost no research or clinical data support this view. DD are common in general and clinical populations and represent a major underserved population with a substantial risk for suicidal and self-destructive behavior.

Over time, approaches that were considered valuable by the scientific community were found to be inefficacious, while other approaches, labelled as alternative or complementary, were finally discovered to be useful in a few indications. From this observation, we propose to classify therapies as orthodox (scientifically validated) or heterodox (scientifically not validated).

We go back to the first classifications based on a scientific taxonomy in the late 18th century with Boissier de Sauvages, which were supposed to describe diseases as they really existed in nature. Emil Kraepelin successfully associated psychopathology and brain research, prefiguring the interaction between <i>DSM</i> and RDoC.

Many scientific societies and national health systems are increasingly interested in the pharmacoeconomic impact of health products. The search for efficacy of a treatment can be done in two ways: medico-economic modeling studies or observational studies i.e. randomized controlled trials or mirror studies. The models are based on theoretical models from published clinical data simulating the course and evolution of patient health conditions, which benefit from a particular therapeutic strategy. Even if the design of observational mirror studies makes it possible to get closer to the clinical reality by observing the patient before and after the initiation of the treatment, the majority of the pharmacoeconomic studies published on olanzapine pamoate are modeling works that do not reflect actual conditions of care. The Guillaume R\u00e9gnier Hospital Center in Rennes has a large cohort of patients treated with olanzapine pamoate: 121 instauration treatments are recorded from April 1, 2010 to Mars 1, 2015. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine pamoate in actual clinical practice.\nThis is a one-year cost-effectiveness retrospective observational mirror-image study of a cohort of 52 patients with schizophrenia who were treated for at least three months with olanzapine pamoate. The primary efficacy endpoint is the differential in the number of full-time hospitalizations before and after the introduction of olanzapine pamoate versus the hospital cost differential. The secondary criteria are the difference of the number of the days spent in hospital and the number of outpatient consultations between the year preceding the injection and the year following it. The results were calculated on the general cohort and within 2 subgroups: patients treated for more than one year and those receiving less than one year of treatment with olanzapine pamoate.\nFifty-two patients were included (median age=35 years, sex ratio H/F=2.7) and only 38.5% discontinued treatment. For patients who maintained long-acting treatment, they received a dosage of 25mg oral olanzapine (min=7.5mg, max=60mg), 5mg more medially than the group having stopped the olanzapine pamoate (20mg; min=10mg, max=40mg). The majority of these patients were receiving off-label authorized marketing doses of oral olanzapine, whereas 22% of them had off-label dosages of olanzapine pamoate. The main causes of discontinuation were symptom persistence, loss of vision and the occurrence of adverse effects (including weight gain and sedation). Olanzapine pamoate significantly reduced the number of hospitalizations compared to the previous management strategy (1 less hospitalization, P<0.001 in patients treated more than one year and in the general cohort). As a logical consequence the number of hospitalization days in day care increased after the establishment of this long-acting antipsychotic with hospital reserve status (18 in median; min=0, max=159). We observed a non-statistically significant tendency of decrease in the number of days of full-time hospitalization and an increase in the number of ambulatory procedures, particularly in patients who have maintained the treatment for one year. This efficiency had a non-significant additional cost of \u20ac3361 per year. There was an average multiplication by 8,5 of the drug cost a year later in the general cohort (5.5 in the group of patients treated less than one year and 10.4 in the group of patients who maintained it a year). There was a 23,2% average increase in the cost of hospitalization in the general cohort (3.75\u00a0% in patients who maintained treatment compared to 48.9% in patients who discontinued treatment).\nBy its mirror design, the study was placed in real conditions of care of the patient with schizophrenia. A total of 61.5% of patients maintained treatment with olanzapine pamoate for a minimum of one year. This APAP is more effective without significantly increasing the cost compared to the previous therapeutic strategy (including oral olanzapine). The additional cost is partly due to the administration restriction in a hospital setting in relation to risk of Post-Injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrom (PDSS). There is currently no acceptable efficiency limit. The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis cannot be extrapolated to the other long-acting antipsychotics since it is the only one with hospital reserve status. The current limitations of medico-economics in psychiatry derive from the heterogeneity of clinical forms and the management of mental pathologies."}, {"Title": "Oromandibular Dystonia Related to Sertraline Treatment in a Child.", "Abstract": "In children, similar to adults, the agents that cause movement disorders are most commonly dopaminergic and antidopaminergic drugs.

Such conduct endangers the wellbeing of patients, undermines the health regulatory system and can have both criminal and disciplinary consequences. In spite of a general tightening of checking of asserted qualifications, persons determined to fake their credentials and to create fictional professional lives continue to make their way through the regulatory net. This article seeks to understand better the phenomenon of impostor health practitioners, to consider how the criminal and disciplinary law should respond to their conduct, and to emphasise the importance of regulatory processes that will reduce the prospects of success for persons minded to engage in such dangerous misrepresentations."}, {"Title": "Reducing weight gain in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and first episode psychosis: describing the process of developing the STructured lifestyle Education for People With SchizophrEnia (STEPWISE) intervention.", "Abstract": "Obesity is twice as common in people with schizophrenia as the general population and associated with significantly worsened psychiatric and physical health. Despite National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of psychosis recommending that mental health services offer lifestyle programmes to people with schizophrenia to improve physical health, this is not currently occurring. The aim of the STEPWISE research programme was to develop a lifestyle intervention addressing obesity and preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or first episode psychosis taking antipsychotic medication, through an approach and fundamental principles drawn from existing diabetes and diabetes prevention interventions. This paper describes the often under-reported process of developing such an intervention from first principles.\nFollowing an extensive literature review, an iterative cycle of development with input from people with schizophrenia, mental healthcare professionals, facilitators, and other stakeholders, a new weight management intervention for the target group was developed. A set of four core weekly sessions was piloted in Sheffield, followed at 3-monthly intervals by three booster sessions and telephone support contact once every 2\u00a0weeks, to form an intervention lasting 12\u2009months. Facilitators were provided with a 4-day training package to support delivery of the intervention.\nThis paper reports the process of development, including challenges and how these were addressed. It describes how user input influenced the structure, topics, and approach of the intervention. The outcome of this process was a feasible and acceptable lifestyle intervention to support people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or first episode psychosis to manage their weight. This pilot provided opportunities for refinement of the intervention and facilitator training prior to testing in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Key findings from the pilot were linked to accessibility, focus, uptake, and retention, which influenced session length, travel arrangements, refreshment, breaks, and supporting tools to incentivise participants.\nThe STEPWISE intervention has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial in 10 mental health trusts in England, and the results will be published in the British Journal of Psychiatry and the NIHR Journals Library.\nISRCTN19447796.

Three metabolic pathways of ethanol were describe in human - alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS, CYP2E1) and catalase. Ethanol directly bounds to different molecules (e.g. etylglucuronid) and ethanol per se and its metabolites have toxic effect on biological stuctures. Alcohol abuse is well known for its liver diseases e.g. cirrhosis (the most frequent cause in Europe and US) and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic alcohol comsumption leads to cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, cardiomyopathy), pancreas damage, myopathies, osteoporosis, neurological and psychiatry diseases including fetal alcohol syndrome and addiction. Alcohol consumption may lead to cancer via several mechanisms, per se (solvent for carcinogens) and its metabolites. Acetaldehyde, a cancerogen, has mutagenic effect on DNA, oxidation of ethanol produces the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with different effects e.g. cell transformation, DNA, protein and lipid damage. The changes of folate metabolism, altered methylation of DNA, reduction of retionic acid influences on cancer development. The high rate of alcohol consumption has become a great social-health problem. Consumption of alcohol is still increasing in many countries, but in some countries is stable or decreasing (e.g. Mediterranean region). The data across Europe shows that 10% of all cancers in men and 3% of all cancers in women can be attributed to alcohol consumption.

The 17 semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcriptions were uploaded into MAXQDA, and a Grounded Theory method based on Corbin and Strauss was used to analyse the data.\nWe provide a process model with 5 interacting phases: trauma experience, emotional ignorance, overcompensation, paroxysm, and perspectives. Each phase is specified with subcategories.\nThe participants did not recognise their symptoms as such and were unaware of their diagnosis for many years. Nevertheless, they used various resources and were able to develop skills and techniques to deal with their symptoms and to function on a day-to-day basis. Overall, the process of symptom management was extremely exhausting for the participants and they felt left alone with it. The participants were eager to gain support from healthcare professionals and, when necessary, financial support from the government. Thus, these results indicate an essential need to develop support and tailored interventions for the symptom management of persons with a CPTSD.\nEthical approval was obtained from the Swiss Cantonal Ethic Commission (Nr 201,500,096).

These have most commonly been done by using barbiturates and benzodiazepines that have given favourable results for a long time. However, they carry the risk of respiratory depression and difficulty in maintaining the plane of sedation where the patient is amenable to interviewing. In our experience of drug-assisted interviews with two patients we used intravenous dexmedetomidine, which is being used in anaesthesia practice for conscious sedation or sedation in the intensive care unit. We found dexmedetomidine to be superior to thiopentone in achieving a level of conscious sedation where the patients were amenable for an interview, with no significant adverse events and faster post-anaesthetic recovery."}, {"Title": "Catatonia due to alprazolam withdrawal.", "Abstract": "A 50-year-old man with multiple psychiatric comorbidities including major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder presented to the emergency room (ER) with altered mental status, immobility and mutism.

Patients were excluded if they were in an intensive care unit or isolation unit or if they were on specialized wards for psychiatry, neurology, or geriatric medicine. The findings are derived from patient interviews, neuropsychological testing, standardized rating scales, questioning of nursing staff, and the patients' medical records.\n1469 patients on 172 inpatient wards of 33 hospitals were studied. 40.0% of them (95% confidence interval, [36.2; 43.7]) had at least mild cognitive impairment. The point-prevalence of dementing illnesses was 18.4% [16.3; 20.7]. Delirium, most often on the basis of dementia, was present in 5.1% [3.9; 6.7]. 60.0% had no cognitive impairment. Dementia was more common among patients of very advanced age, those who were dependent on nursing care, those who lived in old-age or nursing homes, and those with a low level of education. Among patients with dementia, only 36.7% had a documented diagnosis of dementia in the medical record. Patients with dementia were treated more often for dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, urinary tract infections, contusions, and bone fractures, as well as for symptoms and findings of an unknown nature, and much less often for cancer or musculoskeletal diseases.\nTwo out of five elderly patients in general hospitals suffer from a cognitive disturbance. Patients with severe impairments such as dementia or delirium often need special care. Guidelines and model projects offer approaches by which the inpatient care of patients with comorbid dementia can be improved."}, {"Title": "Profiling Mentally Ill Offenders in Hong Kong: a 5-year Retrospective Review Study.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine the prevalence of mental illness in offenders referred to psychiatrists from January 2011 to March 2016 and any associations between crime and mental illness in these offenders.\nCase notes of offenders referred to psychiatrists at the Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre from 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2016 were reviewed. Data on sex, age on admission, educational level, principal psychiatric diagnosis, index offence, source and reason of referral, and outcome were collected.\nCase notes were reviewed for 4492 offenders (75% males) aged 14 to 93 (mean, 40.6) years. Of these, 68% were referred by the courts for psychiatric report and 32% were referred by correctional institutions for psychiatric assessment and treatment. Approximately 73% of them had a diagnosable mental disorder. The most common principal psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia and related disorders (25%), mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use (20%), and mood disorders (9%). The most common index offences were theft and related offences (22%), acts intended to cause injury (20%), and illicit drug offences (11%). Offences involving violence were more prevalent in males than in females (p < 0.001). In terms of the three most common principal psychiatric diagnoses, 'acts intended to cause injury' was most prevalent in those with 'schizophrenia and other related disorders' than in those with the other two diagnoses (31% vs 19% vs 17%, p < 0.001). 'Theft and related offences' was most prevalent in those with mood disorders than in those with other two diagnoses (38% vs 20% vs 18%, p < 0.001).

This study aimed to investigate a possible association between leptin, adiponectin and dimensional measures of depressive symptoms in young adults with and without psychiatric illness. Total plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were measured in 194 young adults seeking psychiatric ambulatory care and 57 healthy controls. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Self-Rating Scale (MADRS-S). Analysis was performed on men and women separately. P-leptin levels were significantly elevated in patients compared with controls and correlated with total MADRS-S scores in the women. Women with P-leptin in the highest quartile reached a significantly higher MADRS-S score than women in the lowest quartile, but this difference disappeared after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and antidepressant use. MADRS-S score was associated with P-leptin in female patients without antidepressant use, independently of BMI. There was no association between P-leptin levels and current major depression. P-adiponectin levels were not associated with depressive symptoms or current major depression. The findings indicate that P-leptin levels are associated with depressive symptom severity in young women; however, the association is linked to other factors, which challenges its usefulness as a biomarker for depression in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Where are the breaks in translation from theory to clinical practice (and back) in addressing depression?

We examine the extent to which the gap between science and practice is associated with the level of integration in how depression is considered in research and stakeholder-relevant documents.\nWe used a network-science perspective to analyze similar uses of depression relevant terms in the Google News corpus (approximately 1 billion words) and the Web of Science database (120 000 documents).\nThese analyses yielded consistent pictures of insular modules associated with: (1) patient/providers, (2) academics, and (3) industry. Within academia insular modules associated with psychology, general medical, and psychiatry/neuroscience/biology were also detected.\nThese analyses suggest that the domain of depression is fragmented, and that advancements of relevance to one stakeholder group (academics, industry, or patients) may not translate to the others. We consider potential causes and associated responses to this fragmentation that could help to unify and advance translation from research on depression to the clinic, largely involving harmonizing employed language, bridging conceptual domains, and increasing communication across stakeholder groups."}, {"Title": "Healing Architecture for Sick Kids.", "Abstract": "Scientific data are sparse on hospital design in child and adolescent psychiatry.

Most residents (81%) indicated they were knowledgeable and/or comfortable in managing medical conditions with supervision/consultation from a primary care provider. Residents also indicated that they would \"like to\" (48%) and/or \"should\" be able to (71%) manage the general medical conditions of their patients in the future with supervision/consultation from a primary care provider.

Only very few data exist concerning hospital architecture in psychiatry/child and adolescent psychiatry. Previous data suggest that architectural improvements do reduce the application of coercive measures as well as reducing aggressive behavior, endangerment of self and others, and provoking changes in the kind and frequency of medication. In order to improve the overall hospital environment of inpatient treatment, the Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Clienia Littenheid AG developed a spatial and communication concept named \"Lino Castle.\" In cooperation with patients, their parents as well as members of the multidisciplinary team, we implemented a concept that serves to ameliorate the recovery process of the children and adolescents. \"Lino Castle\" is deeply rooted in the history of the local village and aims to allow patients to feel at ease for the duration of their stay. It hosts seven characters that serve as guardians and protectors of the individual wards and represent various types of disorders and emotional states. The respective architectural concept grew out of the storyline of \"Lino Castle\" and combines colors, forms, materials, graphics, and furniture to ensure an environment conducive to healing and reduced anxiety. With the implementation of \"Lino Castle,\" we observed that the number of admissions and hospital occupancy increased significantly, whereas the length of stay and the ratio of involuntary admissions in closed wards decreased.

Interest in smaller specialties such as CP remained secondary, leaving only the option of an additional qualification. Switzerland, on the other hand, had already early on introduced a separate CP specialization. In many other industrialized nations, CP was expanding to deal better with the difficulties posed by \"difficult children\" and their sequelae. Because of \"cleansing\" and the enforced synchronization of social and health care systems during the Nazi regime as well as the effects of the war, the development of CP in West Germany was subject to exceptional conditions.

The principles guiding service transformation and objectives are identical across all sites but the method to achieve them varies depending on prevailing resources, culture, geography and the population to be served and how each community can best utilize the extra resources for transformation.\nEach site is engaged in community mapping of services followed by training, active stakeholder engagement with youth and families, early case identification initiatives, providing rapid access (within 72 hours) to an assessment of the presenting problems, facilitating connection to an appropriate service within 30 days (if required) with no transition based on age within the 11 to 25 age group and a structured evaluation to track outcomes over the period of the study.\nService transformation that is likely to achieve substantial change involves very detailed and carefully orchestrated processes guided by a set of values, principles, clear objectives, training and evaluation.

At the moment there are some models that are contributing to precision psychiatry through the concept of staging. While staging was initially presented as a way to categorize patients according to clinical presentation, course, and illness severity, current staging models integrate multiple levels of information that can help to define each patient's characteristics, severity, and prognosis in a more precise and individualized way. Moreover, staging might serve as the foundation to create a clinical decision-making algorithm on the basis of the patient's stage. In this review we will summarize the evolution of the bipolar disorder staging model in relation to the new discoveries on the neurobiology of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, we will discuss how the latest and future progress in psychiatry might transform current staging models into precision staging models."}, {"Title": "Subdural hematoma and electroconvulsive therapy: A case report and review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a common therapeutic procedure in psychiatry associated with a low rate of complications.

Although callous traits have been found to be associated with structural and functional brain alterations, evidence to date has been almost exclusively limited to small, high-risk samples of boys. We characterized gray and white matter brain correlates of callous traits in over 2000 children from the general population.\nData on mother-reported callous traits and brain imaging were collected at age 10 years from participants of the Generation R Study. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain morphology using volumetric indices and whole-brain analyses (n\u00a0= 2146); diffusion tensor imaging was used to assess global and specific white matter microstructure (n\u00a0= 2059).\nCallous traits were associated with lower global brain (e.g., total brain) volumes as well as decreased cortical surface area in frontal and temporal regions. Global mean diffusivity was negatively associated with callous traits, suggesting higher white matter microstructural integrity in children with elevated callous traits. Multiple individual tracts, including the uncinate and cingulum, contributed to this global association. Whereas no gender differences were observed for global volumetric indices, white matter associations were present only in girls.\nThis is the first study to provide a systematic characterization of the structural neural profile of callous traits in the general pediatric population. These findings extend previous work based on selected samples by demonstrating that childhood callous traits in the general population are characterized by widespread macrostructural and microstructural differences across the brain."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepine Use and Misuse Among Adults in the United States.", "Abstract": "Goals were to determine the prevalence of benzodiazepine use (as prescribed and misuse), characterize misuse, and examine variation by age.\nA cross-sectional analysis was conducted of 2015 and 2016 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data limited to adults \u226518 (N=86,186) and data from those respondents reporting benzodiazepine use (N=10,290).

The FAM-SOTC intervention was offered over 4 months, during which time the focus was on establishing the therapeutic relationship and identification of the family relationships. The five key elements of the FAM-SOTC intervention are (a) drawing forward illness stories; (b) asking therapeutic questions; (c) identifying strength, resiliency, and resources; (d) offering evidence-based information and recommendations; and (e) strengthening helpful beliefs and challenging hindering beliefs. These elements provided the foundation for the study.\nSignificantly higher family support and illness beliefs were reported after five sessions of the FAM-SOTC intervention and again after 3 follow-up booster sessions. The FAM-SOTC intervention demonstrated a positive benefit for participants.\nThe FAM-SOTC intervention was found to benefit families, both in the short and long term, in psychiatry settings.

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to 5 Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic acid in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic acid with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.5%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic acid. There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Impacts of a brief contact intervention in suicide prevention on medical care consumptions].", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention is a major objective in public health.

For many injections, the intramuscular route is favoured over the subcutaneous route due to the increased vascularity of muscle tissue and the corresponding increase in the bioavailability of drugs when administered intramuscularly. This paper is a review of the variables that affect the success of intramuscular injections and the implications that these success rates have in psychiatry and general medicine. Studies have shown that the success rates of intended intramuscular injections vary between 32 and 52%, with the rest potentially resulting in inadvertent subcutaneous drug deposition. These rates are found to be even lower for certain at-risk populations, such as obese patients and those on antipsychotic medications. The variables associated with an increased risk of injection failure include female sex, obesity, site of injection, and subcutaneous fat depth. New guidelines and methods are needed in order to address this challenge and ensure that patients receive optimum care.

The opportunities seem of particular promise in psychiatry where diagnoses often rely on retrospective and subjective recall of mood states. However, deriving clinically meaningful information from the complex time series data these technologies present is challenging, and the current implications for patient care are uncertain. In this study, 130 participants with bipolar disorder (n\u2009=\u200948) or borderline personality disorder (n\u2009=\u200931) and healthy volunteers (n\u2009=\u200951) completed daily mood ratings using a bespoke smartphone app for up to 1 year. A signature-based learning method was used to capture the evolving interrelationships between the different elements of mood and exploit this information to classify participants' diagnosis and to predict subsequent mood. The three participant groups could be distinguished from one another on the basis of self-reported mood using the signature methodology. The methodology classified 75% of participants into the correct diagnostic group compared with 54% using standard approaches. Subsequent mood ratings were correctly predicted with >70% accuracy. Prediction of mood was most accurate in healthy volunteers (89-98%) compared to bipolar disorder (82-90%) and borderline personality disorder (70-78%). The signature method provided an effective approach to the analysis of mood data both in terms of diagnostic classification and prediction of future mood.

Anhedonia is a transdiagnostic (e.g. Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatic diseases), yet specific, and clinically relevant symptom dimension subserved by well-characterized neurobiological and neurophysiological substrates of the positive valence systems (PVS). Brain circuits, nodes, and networks, as well as cellular and molecular pathways (e.g. dopaminergic transmission; excitotoxicity; synaptic plasticity), subserving anhedonia are preferentially affected by inflammatory processes. To our knowledge, no published randomized, controlled clinical trial in populations with mood disorders has, to date, primarily sought to determine the effects of an anti-inflammatory agent on PVS functions or pathophysiology. Three ongoing clinical trials aim to investigate the effects of anti-TNF-alpha biologic infliximab on measures of anhedonia [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02363738], motivational behavior and circuitry [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03006393], and glutamatergic changes in the basal ganglia [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03004443] in clinical populations with unipolar or bipolar depression. Positive results would further instantiate the relevance of inflammatory processes and the immune system in the pathophysiology of mood disorders and provide the impetus to develop scalable treatments targeting inflammation and the immune system to mitigate transdiagnostic, dimensional disturbances in brain-based disorders."}, {"Title": "Association between ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and emergency department visits for psychiatric emergency diseases.", "Abstract": "Whether or not short-term exposure to particulate matter <2.5\u202f\u03bcm in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) increases the risk of psychiatric emergency diseases is unclear.\nThe study was performed in a metropolis from January 2015 to December 2016.

In Germany, departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are responsible for the treatment of young people with acute suicidal tendencies. Therefore, it is important to consider means of preventing suicide already during the construction and business operations of these institutions. Approaches to structural suicide prevention can be divided into restrictive and atmospheric-therapeutic measures. The latter includes ways to create an antisuicidal environment and to establish a setting amenable to close support and care by mental-health professionals. Restrictive measures comprise security measures and means of avoiding potential hazards, for example, through life-threatening jumps (e. g., staircases) or intentional strangulation (e. g., employing materials with predetermined breaking points). In addition to security issues, architectural and creative aspects must be incorporated to enable a suicide-preventive atmosphere, that is, satisfying protective needs, creating positive distractions (panoramic views, activities, occupational therapy opportunities), and using positive physiological and natural influences (such as colors and light). Secure access to a pleasant and protected external area as well as exercise spaces is also essential. Architects and construction managers should work closely with the institution's health personnel (e. g., doctors, therapists, and psychiatric nursing staff) during the planning stages for Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in order to come up with solutions that comprise appropriate, practical, and functional requirements and safety-restrictive measures. Thus, an inviting and atmospherically pleasant space can be created that simultaneously provides suicide prevention and protection, where adolescents with psychiatric disorders can be treated by mental-health professionals."}, {"Title": "Practice in forensic psychiatry: A proposed interdisciplinary model.", "Abstract": "Although professional practice in forensic psychiatric environments is, in our opinion, extremely complex and requires the input of different disciplines, conceptual or theoretical models guiding this practice remain rare or poorly adapted.

Next, I turn to the work of the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty and his discussion of the phenomenon of the 'phantom limb' to argue that the body, rather than simply being a physical object is, instead, primarily an experiencing subject; the body is fundamentally our way of having a world. Furthermore, illness, rather than being conceived of as either a physical or mental disorder, should instead be understood in terms of a person's being-in-the-world with others.

We aimed to understand which specialties have stable student interest from matriculation to residency match in an effort to highlight which fields may be reasonable to consider for such accelerated programs.\nMedical students at one school of medicine who matriculated in the years 2009-2013 were surveyed upon entry regarding the medical specialty they were most interested in pursuing. Six hundred fifty-four students were eligible for inclusion and 535 of the records met all requirements.

With a view on that, the law has been changed in order to strengthen patients' autonomy and personal rights and also to reduce coercion and violence. Nowadays, medical and therapeutic actions have to take place within stricter and narrower boundaries and the balance between therapists' provision of care and patients' rights of autonomy had to be renegotiated. In the present paper organisational, structural and legal factors which foster the emergence of coercion and violence in psychiatric treatment will be reported along with factors lying within therapists themselves. Individual factors of therapists that foster the emergence of coercion and violence are amongst other factors suggested by partly tremendous differences in prevalence rates of coercion and violence between hospitals and regions. Aggression coming from therapists can be frequently observed in clinical practice and are also reported in the literature. However, this issue nevertheless is a kind of taboo amongst therapists. Aggression, coercion and violence coming from therapists can be explained by their personality, attitudes, level of training and knowledge and also by their individual biography and involvement in cultures and traditions of clinical teams and hospitals. Despite changes in law the prevalence of coercion and violence in psychiatry is still too high. Amongst other factors, also individual factors of therapists can be made responsible for this situation."}, {"Title": "Family structure, birth order, and aggressive behaviors among school-aged boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).", "Abstract": "To evaluate the associations between family structure, birth order, and aggressive behaviors among school-aged boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nWe conducted a matched case-control study.

While this is a worthwhile goal, it has yielded little progress in improved therapeutics in the last several decades in the field of mood disorders. Recent advancements in our understanding of pathophysiology suggests that an impairment of neuroplasticity may be a critical part of the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interventions that enhance or modulate neuroplasticity often reduce depressive symptoms when applied as stand-alone treatments. Unfortunately, when treatments are discontinued, the disease state often returns as patients relapse. However, treatments that enhance or modulate plasticity not only reduce symptom burden, but also may provide an opportune window wherein cognitive or behavioral interventions could be introduced to harness a state of enhanced neuroplasticity and lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Here, we review the potential of synergistically combining plasticity-enhancing and behavioral therapies to develop novel translational treatment approaches for depression. After reviewing relevant neuroplasticity deficits in depression, we survey biological treatments that appear to reverse such deficits in humans, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (ketamine, D-cycloserine), electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial brain stimulation. We then review evidence that either directly or indirectly supports the hypothesis that a robust enhancement of neuroplasticity through these methods might promote the uptake of cognitive and behavioral interventions to enhance longer-term treatment outcomes through a synergistic effect. We identify key missing pieces of evidence and discuss future directions to enhance this emerging line of research."}, {"Title": "Use of virtual games for interactive learning in a pharmacy curriculum.", "Abstract": "To evaluate student pharmacists' attitudes and satisfaction toward playing educational virtual games in the classroom.\nVirtual games were played in the classroom setting. First year student pharmacists participated in two Mimycx quests in the Healthcare Communication and the Psychiatry/Neurology courses. Students were randomly assigned into teams and worked together to complete the assigned quest games. Completion of the pre- and post-quest questionnaires via Qualtrics was voluntary.\nA total of 79 student pharmacists played the Mimycx quests. Only 66 students completed both pre- and post-quest questionnaires. Students indicated their familiarity with game concepts related to the virtual environment and avatars used in the study. The change in their attitudes and satisfaction about the Mimycx virtual learning experience was significant between the two learning time points.\nThe use of virtual gaming technology could enhance student pharmacists' learning and engagement in the classroom. Students benefitted from increased familiarity with virtual, educational gaming concepts in their experiences with Mimycx, although no statistically significant differences were found regarding their attitudes toward communication and teamwork."}, {"Title": "Mental health first aid training among pharmacy and other university students and its impact on stigma toward mental illness.", "Abstract": "Information on effective and replicable methods employed in pharmacy and other college students to combat stigmatizing beliefs toward those with mental illness is limited. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) is an international, standardized, eight-hour course focused on helping members of the general public triage a mental health crisis. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of MHFA training on stigmatizing attitudes toward those with mental illness among pharmacy and non-pharmacy students.\nPharmacy and non-pharmacy students were invited to voluntarily participate in one of two MHFA sessions. A survey utilizing the Social Distance Scale (SDS) and Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire (AMIQ) was given to participants before and after the MHFA session to assess change in stigmatizing behavior.\nThirty-four pharmacy students and 21 non-pharmacy students participated in the study. Overall, stigma toward depression and schizophrenia decreased. For the SDS schizophrenia vignette, a statistically significant improvement (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was seen on six of the seven responses for pharmacy students and on four responses in non-pharmacy students. Both pharmacy and non-pharmacy students improved on one item in the SDS depression vignette. For the AMIQ, pharmacy students demonstrated statistically significant improvement on four items in the schizophrenia vignette and five items in the depression vignette. Non-pharmacy students showed improvement on two items for both the AMIQ schizophrenia and depression vignettes.\nMHFA was effective in decreasing stigmatizing beliefs among pharmacy and non-pharmacy students. These findings support the utilization of teaching methods that emphasize the patient experience and humanize mental illness."}, {"Title": "Safety and Efficacy of Accelerated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Protocol in Elderly Depressed Unipolar and Bipolar Patients.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent condition in older adults. Although antidepressant drugs are commonly prescribed, efficacy is variable, and older patients are more prone to side effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an alternative therapy used increasingly in the treatment of MDD. Even though recent studies have shown efficacy of rTMS in elderly depressed patients, the safety and efficacy of accelerated rTMS has not been studied in this population.\nData were retrospectively analyzed for adults with treatment-resistant depression (N\u202f=\u202f73, n\u202f=\u202f19 \u226560years, n\u202f=\u202f54 <60 years) who underwent an accelerated protocol of 30 sessions (2 sessions per day) of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS.\nThere were statistically significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms from baseline to post-treatment in both age groups, but those 60years and older showed statistically greater improvement in depression and anxiety symptom scores (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) than those less than 60. There were significantly more responders (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and remitters (p\u202f=\u202f0.023) in the older group. The age groups did not differ significantly in clinical and demographic characteristics or severity of current depressive episode, although baseline anxiety was less severe in those 60years and older.

The estimations were based on the number of medical waste bags that were collected from hospitals and healthcare institutions and then transferred to either a medical waste incinerator or to an autoclave sterilization facility in Istanbul during the last 18\u202fyears. Hospitals were divided into 5 categories; dialysis, specialty, educational state university and state hospitals, non-educational state and non-educational private hospitals. Specialty hospitals were psychiatry, physical therapy, eye, dermatology, women care, child care, occupational diseases and lung hospitals. Results from this study indicate that the yearly total estimated medical waste amounts from hospitals have increased from approximately 5307 tonnes in 2000 to 22,755 tonnes in 2017. The yearly averages of daily unit medical waste amounts per hospitals bed have increased from 0.43\u202fkg/bed-day in 2000 to 1.68\u202fkg/bed-day in 2017. The other goal of this work was to propose and show a new (novel) relationship between the yearly estimated medical waste amounts and daily generation rates and yearly populations for the estimation of future medical waste amounts. Simple statistical evaluations of the estimated data were done and equations of the approximated linear lines were obtained. These evaluations indicated strong matches with the points of estimations. High degree of coefficients of determinations also showed strong relationships between variances.

This study analyzed characteristics of malingering and patient disposition in a 24/7-staffed comprehensive psychiatric emergency program (CPEP) and created predictive models to understand malingering and its effect on physician decision making.\nAttending psychiatrists completed questionnaires after comprehensive assessments of 405 patients presenting to the CPEP during the 1-month study, recording suspicion of malingering, symptoms malingered, associated secondary gains, demographic characteristics, and initial disposition decision. Analyses examined characteristics associated with degree of malingering suspicion and disposition.\nMalingering was suspected among one-third of patients, and 20% were strongly or definitely suspected of malingering. High suspicion was associated with malingering of multiple symptoms and was likely to result in immediate discharge. Lower suspicion was associated with being held for further observation. Among patients for whom suspicion of malingering was high, malingering was most frequent for suicidal ideation (58%) and depression (39%); malingering was often used to seek hospital admission (54%) and to stay in the CPEP (35%); malingering was sometimes used to seek multiple secondary gains (25%); and malingering often involved multiple symptoms (44%). Patients for whom suspicion was high had an admission rate of 4%. Among patients suspected of malingering, three variables each independently increased the likelihood of hospital admission: seeking social work or housing services, seeking admission, and malingering of suicidal ideation.\nMalingering was prevalent in the psychiatric emergency department, and suspicion of malingering was associated with disposition differences.

A primary care intervention addressing organizational and individual factors was developed to improve the management of common mental health conditions.\nTwenty-nine practices participated in a statewide learning collaborative over 18 months. On-site training was used to teach communication and brief intervention skills and develop an organizational context supportive of mental health. Clinician confidence was measured pre- and postintervention. Medicaid claims data were used to estimate the intervention's effects on identification of mental health conditions and prescribing practices.\nMean clinician confidence scores increased by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]=15% to 25%), from 2.92 at baseline to 3.55 postintervention. In the first month of the preintervention year, 6.65% of patients with an office visit had at least one visit for a mental health condition, rising to 9% postintervention; this trend was driven by detection and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Rates of prescribing ADHD medication to patients with visits for ADHD increased by 0.12 percentage points per month (CI=0.02 to 0.22, p=0.022). Rates of prescribing second-generation antipsychotics to all patients with office visits decreased by 0.014 percentage points per month (CI=-.03 to -.00, p=0.028), relative to preintervention trends.\nThis study suggests that a multicomponent intervention addressing individual staff and organizational factors together can promote identification and treatment of child mental health conditions in primary care.

Classic psychedelics have been administered as sacraments since ancient times. They were of prominent interest within psychiatry and neuroscience in the 1950s to 1960s, and during this time contributed to the emergence of the field of molecular neuroscience. Promising results were reported for treatment of both end-of-life psychological distress and addiction, and classic psychedelics served as tools for studying the neurobiological bases of psychological disorders. Moreover, classic psychedelics were shown to occasion mystical experiences, which are subjective experiences reported throughout different cultures and religions involving a strong sense of unity, among other characteristics. However, the recreational use of classic psychedelics and their association with the counterculture prompted an end to human research with classic psychedelics in the early 1970s. We provide the most comprehensive review of epidemiological studies of classic psychedelics to date. Notable among these are a number of studies that have suggested the possibility that nonmedical naturalistic (non-laboratory) use of classic psychedelics is associated with positive mental health and prosocial outcomes, although it is clear that some individuals are harmed by classic psychedelics in non-supervised settings. We then review recent therapeutic studies suggesting efficacy in treating psychological distress associated with life-threatening diseases, treating depression, and treating nicotine and alcohol addictions. We also describe the construct of mystical experience, and provide a comprehensive review of modern studies investigating classic psychedelic-occasioned mystical experiences and their consequences. These studies have shown classic psychedelics to fairly reliably occasion mystical experiences. Moreover, classic-psychedelic-occasioned mystical experiences are associated with improved psychological outcomes in both healthy volunteer and patient populations. Finally, we review neuroimaging studies that suggest neurobiological mechanisms of classic psychedelics. These studies have also broadened our understanding of the brain, the serotonin system, and the neurobiological basis of consciousness. Overall, these various lines of research suggest that classic psychedelics might hold strong potential as therapeutics, and as tools for experimentally investigating mystical experiences and behavioral-brain function more generally."}, {"Title": "Predicting posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms among adolescents in the extended postpartum period.", "Abstract": "Adolescent childbirth continues as a public health concern, and investigation of postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depression is important to inform future research and practice. Longitudinal studies exploring PTSS alone or in combination with depression are non-existent for postpartum adolescent populations. This study aimed to identify stress/PTSS and depression symptoms at 72 hours and three, six, and nine months postpartum, and determine if symptoms at each time point predicted later symptoms.\nA convenience sample of 303 adolescents 13-19 years of age were recruited from two postpartum units of one, large, public hospital. The Impact of Event Scale and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Inventory provided a screen of symptoms for stress/PTSS and depression at all time points. A lagged autoregressive model was developed to assess the predictive power of symptoms at each time point to the next across the extended postpartum period.\nAbout 30% of adolescents displayed early symptoms; 20% showed symptoms at the final time point. Early symptoms did not predict symptoms at 3 months; yet, symptoms at 3 months predicted symptoms at 6-9 months.\nAttrition at final time points necessitated pooled data. Adolescents were primarily older, Hispanics, and recruited from one public hospital decreasing demographic representation. Use of screening tools prevented diagnostic outcomes. Unknown stressors occurring before and after pregnancy or birth may have influenced final outcomes.\nEarly symptoms were common and 3 month symptoms predicted later symptoms.

The development and validation of risk prediction models (RPMs) is the norm within different fields of medicine but still underused in psychiatry, despite the global impact of mental disorders. In particular, there is a lack of RPMs to assess the risk of developing depression, the first worldwide cause of disability and harbinger of functional decline in old age. We present the depression risk assessment tool DRAT-up, the first prospective RPM to identify late-life depression among community-dwelling subjects aged 60-75. The development of DRAT-up was based on appraisal of relevant literature, extraction of robust risk estimates, and integration into model parameters. A unique feature is the ability to estimate risk even in the presence of missing values. To assess the properties of DRAT-up, a validation study was conducted on three European cohorts, namely, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, the Invecchiare nel Chianti, and the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, with 20\u2009206, 1359, and 3124 eligible samples, respectively. The model yielded accurate risk estimation in the three datasets from a small number of predictors. The Brier scores were 0.054, 0.133, and 0.041, respectively, while the values of area under the curve (AUC) were 0.761, 0.736, and 0.768, respectively. Sensitivity analyses suggest robustness to missing values: setting any individual feature to unknown caused the Brier scores to increase by 0.004 and the AUCs to decrease by 0.045 in the worst cases.

This indication has yet to receive official recognition in France. The objective of this study is to evaluate the production cost of tDCS for the treatment of depression in hospitals, under realistic conditions.\nThe methodology adopted is based on cost accounting and was validated by a multidisciplinary working group. It includes equipment, staff, and structural costs to obtain the most realistic estimate possible.

Concurrent with this demographic change is the growing number of adults living with chronic conditions that increase risk of vascular disease, including hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. We address how these conditions contribute to age-related cerebrovascular changes and lead to subsequent effects on mood and cognitive function, with an emphasis on the role of \u201cvascular depression\u201d as a focus of treatment. The case of an elderly gentleman with vascular disease associated with psychiatric symptoms and cognitive changes is presented. We discuss vascular depression in the context of suicide in late life and provide perspectives on treatment that focus not merely on pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic management of depressive symptoms but also emphasize the importance of sleep and health maintenance strategies.

The ECS modulates the rewarding effects of environmental stimuli, influencing synaptic transmission in the dopaminergic projections to the limbic system, and mediates the neurophysiological and behavioral consequences of stress. Notably, the individual psychosocial context is another key element modulating the activity of the ECS. Finally, inflammation represents an additional factor that could alter the cannabinoid signaling in the CNS inducing a \"sickness behavior,\" characterized by anxiety, anhedonia, and depressive symptoms. The complex influences of the ECS on both the environmental and internal stimuli processing, make the cannabinoid-based drugs an appealing option to treat different psychiatric conditions. Although ample experimental evidence shows beneficial effects of ECS modulation on mood, scarce clinical indication limits the use of cannabis-based treatments. To better define the possible clinical indications of cannabinoid-based drugs in psychiatry, a number of issues should be better addressed, including genetic variability and psychosocial factors possibly affecting the individual response. In particular, better knowledge of the multifaceted effects of cannabinoids could help to understand how to boost their therapeutic use in anxiety and depression treatment."}, {"Title": "Recognition of, and attitudes towards, people with depression and psychosis with/without alcohol and other drug problems: results from a national survey of Australian paramedics.", "Abstract": "Continuing stigma towards mental health problems means that many individuals-especially men-will first present in crisis, with emergency services often the first point of call. Given this situation, the aims of this paper were to assess paramedics' ability to recognise, and their attitudes towards, males with clinically defined depression and psychosis with and without comorbid alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems.\nA cross-sectional national online survey of 1230 paramedics throughout Australia. The survey was based on four vignettes: depression with suicidal thoughts, depression with suicidal thoughts and comorbid alcohol problems, and psychosis with and without comorbid AOD problems.\nJust under half of respondents recognised depression, but this decreased markedly to one-fifth when comorbid AOD problems were added to the vignette. In contrast, almost 90% recognised psychosis, but this decreased to just under 60% when comorbid AOD problems were added. Respondents were more likely to hold stigmatising attitudes towards people in the vignettes with depression and psychosis when comorbid AOD problems were present. Respondents endorsed questionnaire items assessing perceived social stigma more strongly than personal stigma. Desire for social distance was greater in vignettes focusing on psychosis with and without comorbid AOD problems than depression with and without comorbid AOD problems.\nParamedics need a well-crafted multicomponent response which involves cultural change within their organisations and more education to improve their recognition of, and attitudes towards, clients with mental health and AOD problems. Education should focus on the recognition and care of people with specific mental disorders rather than on mental disorders in general. It is essential that education also focuses on understanding and caring for people with AOD problems. Educational interventions should focus on aligning beliefs about public perceptions with personal beliefs about people with mental disorders and AOD problems."}, {"Title": "Current appeal system for those detained in England and Wales under the Mental Health Act needs reform.", "Abstract": "The approach to managing the involuntary detention of people suffering from psychiatric conditions can be divided into those with clinicians at the forefront of decision-making and those who rely heavily on the judiciary. The system in England and Wales takes a clinical approach where doctors have widespread powers to detain and treat patients involuntarily. A protection in this system is the right of the individual to challenge a decision to deprive them of their liberty or treat them against their will. This protection is provided by the First-tier Tribunal; however, the number of successful appeals is low. In this paper, the system of appeal in England and Wales is outlined. This is followed by a discussion of why so few patients successfully appeal their detention with the conclusion that the current system is flawed.

Of the 625 without dementia, 518 (83%) were followed over a 2.4-years period, and the incidence of dementia was determined. Cytokine [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1] levels were measured at baseline and follow-up. The individual and combined effects of cytokine levels on dementia were evaluated after adjusting for potential covariates (lifestyle factors, demographics, disability, cognitive function, and presence of the APOE e4 allele) and a Bonferroni correction. <b>Results:</b> Incident dementia was associated with increased serum cytokine levels after 2 years; the association remained significant for TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations even after applying a Bonferroni correction. The analysis of the combined effects of the five cytokines showed independent associations between increases in the summed number of higher cytokine levels, between baseline and follow-up.

The current diagnostic taxonomy of mental disorders by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases relies on presenting signs and symptoms, but does not reflect evidence from neurobiological and behavioral systems. However, in the last decades, the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying mental disorders has grown and can be used for the development of precision medicine, that is, to deliver a patient-tailored individual treatment. Precision medicine may incorporate genetic variants contributing to the mental disorder and the response to pharmacotherapies, but also consider gene <b>\u00a5</b> environment interactions, blood-based markers, neuropsychological tests, data from electronic health records, early life adversity, stressful life events, and very proximal factors such as lifestyle, nutrition, and sport.

Concurrently, a client would ideally adhere to their prescribed methadone-dosing regimen, until a client is stabilised allowing them to function optimally. At this point, a client should transfer to the GP community setting. Unfortunately, this fails to occur. To date, very few studies have specifically investigated the reasons why a cohort of clients remain 'trapped' in the high risk, specialist clinical setting.\nQualitative detailed semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 17 clients of one of Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) Drug and Alcohol Services, entitled 'HSE Mid-West Limerick Drug and Alcohol Service'. Each client had a severe Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and clients had spent on average 7.5\u2009years engaging with the MMTP.\nParticipants' life journey prior to an OUD included Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and early exposure to illicit drug use. Shared life events resulting in their initiating and sustaining an OUD involved continuous hardship into adulthood, mental illness and concurrent benzodiazepine use disorder, often resulting in harrowing accounts of participants' loneliness and lack of life purpose. Their living environments, an erroneous understanding of their illness and poor communication with allied health professionals further perpetuated their OUD. Positive factors influencing periods of abstinence were familial incentives and a belief in the efficacy of methadone. Clients own suggestions for improving their journeys included employing a multi-sectorial approach to managing OUD and educating themselves and others on opioid agonist treatments. If clients were not progressing appropriately, they themselves suggested enforcing a 'time-limit' on clients to engage with the programme or indeed for their treatment to be postponed.\nTo optimise the functioning of the MMTP, three tasks need to be fulfilled: 1) Reduce the incidences of ACEs, 2) Diagnose and treat clients with a dual diagnosis 3) Educate clients, their families, the public and allied health care professionals on all aspects of OUD.

The term polypharmacy was more common in psychiatry literature while epilepsy literature favored the term polytherapy.\nTwo or more concurrent medications, without duration, for \u22651 day, \u226531 days, or sequentially for one year were the most common definitions of pediatric polypharmacy. We recommend that pediatric polypharmacy studies specify the number of medications or therapeutic classes, if they are concurrent or sequential, and the duration of medications.

This systematic scoping review explores how ARFID as a diagnostic entity is conceptualized in the research literature and evaluates the diagnostic validity according to the Feighner criteria.\nA systematic scoping review of papers on ARFID in PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science was undertaken, following PRISMA and Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines.\nFifty-one original research publications, 23 reviews and commentaries, and 20 case reports were identified. The use of ARFID as a conceptual category varies significantly within this literature. At this time, the ARFID diagnosis does not fulfil the Feighner criteria for evaluating the validity of diagnostic constructs, the most urgent problem being the demarcation toward other disorders. A three-dimensional model-lack of interest in food, selectivity based on sensory sensitivity, and fear of aversive consequences-is gaining support in the research literature.\nThe introduction of the ARFID diagnosis has undoubtedly increased the recognition of a previously largely neglected group of patients. However, this article points to an inability of the current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria to ensure optimal diagnostic validity, which risks making them less useful in clinical practice and in epidemiological research. To increase the conceptual validity of the ARFID construct, several possible alterations to the current diagnostic criteria are suggested, including a stronger emphasis of the three identified subdomains and further clarifying the boundaries of ARFID."}, {"Title": "Delusion, possession and religion<sup>\u2020</sup>.", "Abstract": "Religion and psychiatry may be both considered to be two different ways of explaining the unknown, of responding to questions about the meaning of life, and of bringing healing.\nTo discuss the border between religion and psychiatry.\nThis lecture explores the interface between religion and psychiatry and discusses the border between soul and mind.\nReligious beliefs may affect behaviours and may been seen on a psychopathological continuum with overvalued ideas and delusions.

Following a brief description of Moore's life, this article develops his psychiatric theory, beginning with its grounding in Thomistic philosophical thought. The relationship between reason and faith, the place of the soul in psychological theory, and a central role for Catholic moral teaching were three Thomistic principles vital to Moore's thinking. Defining psychology as the science of personality, and the study of personality as central to psychiatry, Moore articulated a theory and practice of psychotherapy that he contended was scientifically sound. Although his clinical work did not impose religious teachings on patients, if such teachings were meaningful to them, he did discuss them in sessions; moreover, Catholic moral teaching was a compass in his treatment of patients.

The <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</i> 4-factor model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has demonstrated adequate fit in several confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) studies. Although several alternative measurement models have demonstrated better fit, there is no consensus yet on the best model, and newly proposed models lack sufficient construct validation. Notably, these studies have relied exclusively on questionnaire data, and thus their findings may be attributable to a method effect. This study examined the factor structure of <i>DSM-5</i> PTSD symptoms using both questionnaire and interview data to determine the impact of assessment method on factor structure and construct validity of alternative model symptom clusters. Participants (<i>N</i> = 380) were veterans who completed the PTSD Checklist for <i>DSM-5</i> (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for <i>DSM-5</i> (CAPS-5; Weathers et al., 2013). Fit was similar across models. However, the seven-factor Hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) fit best. Limited evidence of a method effect was observed. Results of construct validity analyses were mixed; some of the newly proposed symptom clusters demonstrated hypothesized differential associations with external correlates, but others did not. These findings suggest that results of previous <i>DSM-5</i> PTSD CFAs supporting the Hybrid model are not attributable to a method effect. However, observed limited difference in model fit and mixed construct validity evidence raise concerns regarding the value of parsing <i>DSM-5</i> symptom clusters. Constructs implied by the new factors in the more complex measurement models of PTSD require greater explication and construct validation.

The prevalence of neurological involvement varies geographically and can include psychiatric manifestations. Current evidence for a causal association between Beh\u00e7et's disease and bipolar disorder is limited to a small number of case reports. We report a case of a patient with a recent diagnosis of bipolar disorder who was subsequently diagnosed with Beh\u00e7et's disease. The 38-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of right eye visual blurring, 5-month history of mouth ulcers and 3 months of genital ulceration. His inflammatory markers were raised. An MRI of the brain was conducted in the absence of any focal neurological signs or symptoms owing to his past psychiatric history. The MRI showed changes in the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe highly suspicious of neuro-Beh\u00e7et's disease. His inpatient care was coordinated with neurology, rheumatology, ophthalmology and psychiatry teams, and he was later discharged with outpatient follow up owing to a clinical improvement on high-dose steroids. This case shows that, although widely unrecognised, neuro-Beh\u00e7et's can occur in the absence of focal neurology. Additionally, neuro-Beh\u00e7et's should be considered in patients with bipolar disorder presenting with symptoms suggestive of Beh\u00e7et's disease.

While early examples of the architecture of psychiatric hospitals copied prison construction and were adapted to control the mentally ill (e.g., the Viennese \"Narrenturm\"), later plans, such as linear and separate (pavilion), sought to simultaneously increase control effectiveness, act therapeutically and respond to some practical needs of the more crowded institutes.

This commentary presents two case studies of existing transition worker programs in the Greater Toronto Area that link hospital and community mental health sectors for youth ages 12-18. We discuss program characteristics, the transition worker role, recommendations to organizations considering creating a similar service, and areas for future research. The goal of this commentary is to contribute to knowledge exchange and ultimately strengthen the evidence base for the transition worker role in child and adolescent mental health services."}, {"Title": "Exploratory comparison of auditory verbal hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms among youth with borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "This study explored phenomenological aspects of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) and other psychotic symptoms among youth with borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nSixty-eight outpatients, aged 15 to 25\u2009years, were categorized into three groups according to their primary Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis and AVH symptom profile; BPD\u2009+\u2009AVH (n\u2009=\u200923), schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SZ)\u2009+\u2009AVH (n\u2009=\u200922) and BPD with no AVH (n\u2009=\u200923).\nNo differences in AVH were found between BPD\u2009+\u2009AVH and SZ\u2009+\u2009AVH. Compared with SZ\u2009+\u2009AVH, BPD\u2009+\u2009AVH scored lower on delusions and difficulty in abstract thinking and higher on hostility. BPD\u2009+\u2009AVH reported more severe self-harm, paranoid ideation, dissociation, anxiety and stress than BPD no AVH.\nThis study replicates, in a sample of youth, the finding from studies of adults that AVH in BPD are indistinguishable from those in SZ, when assessed with the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). Clinicians should specifically enquire about AVH among youth with BPD. When present, AVH appear to be an indicator of a more severe form of BPD."}, {"Title": "Is Psychiatry Cool Again?

This may have a negative influence on the therapeutic relationship and diagnostic processes.<br /> AIM: To explore the role of brua in the illness perception of psychiatric patients in the Netherlands who were originally from the abc islands.<br /> METHOD: A random sample of patients under treatment at Parnassia Psychiatric Institute in The Hague were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire.<br /> RESULTS: Of the 18 psychiatric patients interviewed, 10 (56%) believed in brua, and 3 (17%) considered it the cause of their disease. Although none of the interviewees admitted to an active involvement in brua, 8 (44%) had been in touch with a traditional healer and 9 (50%) possessed artifacts meant to provide protection against evil. Regarding the usefulness of discussing brua with health professionals, opinions were divided.<br /> CONCLUSION: Psychiatric patients in the Netherlands native to the abc islands are all knowledgeable of brua, with more than half of them believing in it. Despite the fear and shame that people often experience, making brua fit for discussion in clinical practice would improve the relationship between health professional and patient, yielding further opportunities for diagnosis and treatment."}, {"Title": "[Towards personalized child and adolescent psychiatry care by using routinely registered data from everyday clinical practice].", "Abstract": "Studying differences in the course and treatment effects of psychiatric disorders between subgroups of patients can provide suggestions to improve everyday clinical practice.<br/> AIM: To illustrate how routinely registered data from child and adolescent psychiatry can be used to gain insight into differences in the development of patient groups.<br/> METHOD: Multilevel analyses in four subgroups of youths with an autism spectrum disorder (asd; n = 1681; boys/girls, with/without comorbid psychiatric disorder) to investigate differences in the development of quality of life during the first six months of treatment.<br/> RESULTS: Subgroups of youths with asd showed differences in development of quality of life, which can provide suggestions to establish personalized care.<br/> CONCLUSION: Multicenter research in large samples is needed to investigate the robustness of our findings.

A Mixed Methods Analysis Among Community Dwelling Regular Exercisers.", "Abstract": "Individuals with schizophrenia have reduced rates of physical activity, yet substantial proportions do engage in independent and regular exercise. Previous studies have shown improvement in symptoms and cognitive function in response to supervised exercise programs in people with schizophrenia. There is little data on motivations of individuals who exercise independently, or their chosen type, duration, or setting of exercise. This study explores motivational parameters and subjective experiences associated with sustained, independent exercise in outpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants completed a semi-structured interview and then were given a prospective survey containing visual analog scales of symptom severity and the Subjective Exercise Experiences Scales to complete immediately before and after three sessions of exercise. Results from the semi-structured interview were analyzed by modified content analysis. The most important reason for exercise was self-image, followed closely by psychological and physical health. Among psychological effects, participants reported exercise was most helpful for mood and cognitive symptoms. The prospective ratings demonstrated 10-15% average improvements in global well-being, energy, and negative, cognitive and mood symptoms, with almost no change in psychosis, after individual exercise sessions. This suggests that non-psychotic parameters are more susceptible to inter-session decay of exercise effects, which may reinforce continued exercise participation."}, {"Title": "Sleep Disorders are a Prevalent and Serious Comorbidity in Dry Eye.", "Abstract": "Sleep is an essential life habit and closely associated with lifespan, diabetes, hypertension, and mental health. Sleep disorders are a prominent, but overlooked problem in patients with dry eye disease (DED), characterized by a poor sleep index, short sleep duration, long sleep latency, and poor subjective sleep. DED and sleep disorders are more prevalent in women than men. Moreover, sleep quality in DED is worse than in other eye diseases, including glaucoma, retinal diseases, cataract, and allergic and chronic conjunctivitis.\nWe reviewed the literature for studies investigating sleep and health, eyes and sleep, and DED and sleep, in terms of systemic and eye health, especially in women.\nTwo studies reported that approximately half of patients with DED suffer from poor sleep. The severity of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, is correlated strongly with sleep disorders in DED, and the symptoms and signs of DED, especially pain, also are correlated with sleep quality. Sleep disorders are documented in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and an association with sleep apnea and depression is suggested. Primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome includes arthritis and other rheumatic disease causing pain and fatigue; however, how sicca contributes to sleep disorders is not known.\nPossible explanations for sleep disorders in DED may be depression, pain, and eye exposure at night. Reciprocal effects may be expected and consultation-liaison psychiatry is recommended for the management of sleep disorders in DED. Topical medication and lid heating also may be advantageous for sleep quality in DED."}, {"Title": "Recruiting under-represented populations into psychiatric research: Results from the help for hoarding study.", "Abstract": "This study compares the effectiveness of approaches used to recruit a diverse sample for a randomized clinical trial for Hoarding Disorder (HD) in the San Francisco Bay Area.

However, empirical data of its impact on emotion modulation processes and personality dimensions are still sparce. An interesting concept is the use of music for emotion modulation in everyday life. The purpose of this interim study was to assess the interplay of personality dimensions and emotion modulation strategies in patients treated with music therapy versus patients without music therapy.\nA cross-sectional design was used.\nThe study was conducted during the course of inpatient treatment in a general psychiatric hospital. Data from n\u202f=\u202f137 patients was included in the analysis.\nAccording to the mediator model a regression analysis was performed using personality variables as potential predictors and emotion modulation variables as outcome criteria.\nIn the music therapy group, insecurity predicted the use of music for both cognitive problem solving and positive stimulation in everyday life. In the non-music therapy group, cooperation and insouciance predicted the use of music for reduction of negative activation.\nSpecific personality dimensions predict greater targeted emotion modulation strategies if music therapy is applied than without it. That is, music therapy helps patients acquire more conscious (i.e. cognitive-related strategies) emotion modulation techniques by means of including their individual personality, whereas patients without music therapy simply \"vent\" their negative emotions (i.e. non-cognitive strategies). Conversely, the data suggest that music therapy can contribute to modify personality dimensions through the development of these emotion modulation strategies. This could be a plausible explanation for beneficial long-term effects of music therapy."}, {"Title": "Patient and public involvement in the design, administration and evaluation of patient feedback tools, an example in psychiatry: a systematic review and critical interpretative synthesis.", "Abstract": "Patient feedback is considered integral to healthcare design, delivery and reform.

Early descriptions of thought disorders date back to the XIX century with Esquirol, but it was in the first half of the XX century that several authors introduced the main features of the actual concept of Formal Thought Disorders. Emil Kraepelin described <i>akataphasia</i> (inability to find the appropriate expression for a thought) in patients with <i>dementia praecox</i> (a term that some years later was replaced by schizophrenia). Bleuler and Kretschmer also identified in schizophrenic patients a generalized \"loosening of associations\" and Carl Schneider described several Formal Thought Disorders such as derailment, fusion, omission, suspension and driveling. At the end of the XX century Nancy Andreasen studied the classical descriptions regarding Formal Thought Disorders, reclassified them and also introduced a scale to assess them. Although the specificity of these symptoms in schizophrenia and psychosis has been a source of controversy among the different authors, the importance given to their presence in these mental disorders is universal. We defend that it is crucial that these historical and conceptual elements are grasped in order to assess Formal Thought Disorders for clinical and research purposes."}, {"Title": "[History and current challenges of paediatric psychiatry in maternity units].", "Abstract": "The legal framework of mother-baby care has\u00a0evolved over the last thirty years driven by innovative programmes put in place by hospital health professionals.

Although it is widely used as a tranquillizer in psychiatry, anesthesiology, pediatrics, and in general medical practice, there is a gap in knowledge regarding its occurrence and fate in the environment. Therefore, we provide for the first-time data on the environmental fate and ecotoxicity of CPTX and its potential photo-transformations products (PTPs). Firstly, two standardized biodegradation tests (Closed Bottle test (CBT) and Manometric Respiratory test (MRT)) were performed to assess CPTX's environmental biodegradability. Then, its photodegradability was studied using Xenon and UV lamps. Effects of different conditions (initial drug concentration, pH, and temperature) were applied during UV-photodegradation. Subsequently, the time courses of CPTX and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were monitored throughout the photodegradation tests. After that, high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to elucidate the structures of the formed photo-transformation products (PTPs). In addition, biodegradation tests were performed for the photolytic mixtures to assess the biodegradability of the PTPs. Finally, the (eco)toxicity assessment for CPTX and its photolytic mixtures was predicted using different (quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR) software. CPTX was found to be not readily biodegradable in CBT and MRT. CPTX was not eliminated by irradiation with the Xenon lamp, however primarily eliminated using the UV-lamp. The CPTX elimination during UV-irradiation was faster at lower concentrations. CPTX UV-photodegradation was affected by pH value, while not affected by the temperature of the irradiated solution. 13 PTPs were detected in UV-photolysis mixtures. One additional product was detected in CPTX standard solution, and it was degraded simultaneously with CPTX during UV-irradiation. On one hand, Biodegradation assays revealed that UV-photolytic mixtures of CPTX, containing its PTPs, were not better biodegradable than CPTX itself. On the other hand, LC-MS analysis showed some PTPs which were eliminated after the biodegradation tests indicating possible biodegradability of these PTPs. This because those PTPs are present in low concentrations in the photolysis mixture and their effect can be hindered by the effect of CPTX and other non-biodegradable PTPs. QSAR analysis revealed that CPTX and some of its PTPs may have some human and/or eco-toxic properties. In conclusion, the release of CPTX into aquatic environments could be harmful. Therefore, further research focusing on CPTX and its PTPs are strongly recommended."}, {"Title": "Course, outcome and diagnosis stability of early-onset schizophrenia in Yunnan Province, China-a three years follow-up study.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe diagnostic stability and psychosocial outcomes of subjects with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS).

In this framework, attention is thought to gate the influence of sensory information on perception. In contrast to exteroception, there is limited evidence for purely attentional effects on interoception. Here, we empirically tested if attentional focus modulates cortical processing of single heartbeats, using a newly-developed experimental paradigm to probe purely attentional differences between exteroceptive and interoceptive conditions in the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) using EEG recordings. We found that the HEP is significantly higher during interoceptive compared to exteroceptive attention, in a time window of 524-620\u202fms after the R-peak. Furthermore, this effect predicted self-report measures of autonomic system reactivity. Our study thus provides direct evidence that the HEP is modulated by pure attention and suggests that this effect may provide a clinically relevant readout for assessing interoception."}, {"Title": "Awareness, attitudes, skills and training needs of psychiatrists working with adults with intellectual disability in managing epilepsy.", "Abstract": "Comorbid epilepsy is found in 22.5% of people with intellectual disability (ID).

Across many psychiatric illnesses, ranging from major depressive disorder to schizophrenia, symptom severity assessments are subjective and do not include biological measures, making predictability in eventual treatment outcomes a challenge. Using data from the Mayo Clinic PGRN-AMPS SSRI trial as a case study, this work demonstrates a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy for antidepressant treatment outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder from 35% to 80% individualized by patient, compared to using only a physician's assessment as the predictors. This improvement is achieved through an iterative overlay of biological measures, starting with metabolites (blood measures modulated by drug action) associated with symptom severity, and then adding in genes associated with metabolomic concentrations. Hence, therapeutic efficacy for a new patient can be assessed prior to treatment, using prediction models that take as inputs, selected biological measures and physician's assessments of depression severity. Of broader significance extending beyond psychiatry, the approach presented in this work can potentially be applied to predicting treatment outcomes for other medical conditions, such as migraine headaches or rheumatoid arthritis, for which patients are treated according to subject-reported assessments of symptom severity."}, {"Title": "Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder 2018 (KMAP-BP 2018): Fourth Revision.", "Abstract": "The Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Bipolar Disorder (KMAP-BP) was first published in 2002 through an expert consensus of opinion, and updated in 2006, 2010, and 2014. This study constitutes the fourth revision of the KMAP-BP.\nA 50-item questionnaire was used to obtain the consensus of experts regarding pharmacological treatment strategies for various phases of adult bipolar disorder and six items for pediatric bipolar disorder. The review committee included 84 Korean psychiatrists and 43 child and adolescent psychiatry experts.\nThe preferred first-step strategies for acute mania were the combination of a mood stabilizer (MS) and an atypical antipsychotic (AAP), MS monotherapy, and AAP monotherapy. A combination of a MS and an AAP, and AAP monotherapy were preferred for psychotic mania. The first-step strategies for mild to moderate bipolar depression were monotherapy with MS, AAP, or lamotrigine (LMT), and the combination of a MS and an AAP or LMT, or a combination of an AAP and LMT. The combination of two among a MS, AAP, and LMT were preferred for non-psychotic severe depression. A combination of a MS and an AAP or the combination of an AAP with an antidepressant or LMT were the first-line options for psychotic severe depression.\nThe recommendations of the KMAP-BP 2018 have changed from the previous version by reflecting recent developments in pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder.

Etiology is still unclear although it is thought to develop with interaction of genes and environmental factors. Oxytocin has extensive effects on intrauterine brain development. Vitamin D, affects neural development and differentiation and contributes to the regulation of around 900 genes including oxytocin receptor gene. In the present study, the contribution of D vitamin receptor and oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms in the development of ASD in Turkish community was investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining these two associated genes together in the literature.\nEighty-five patients diagnosed with ASD according to DSM-5 who were referred to outpatient clinics of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of Ba\u015fkent University and Mersin University and 52 healthy, age and gender-matched controls were included in the present study. Vitamin D receptor gene rs731236 (Taq1), rs2228570 (Fok1), rs1544410 (Bsm1), rs7975232 (Apa1) polymorphisms and oxytocin receptor gene rs1042778 and rs2268493 polymorphisms were investigated using real time polymerase chain reaction method.\nNo significant difference between groups in terms of distribution of genotype and alleles in each of polymorphisms for these genes could be found.\nKnowledge of genes and polymorphisms associated with the development of ASD may be beneficial for early diagnosis and future treatment. Further studies with larger populations are required to demonstrate molecular pathways which may play part in the development of ASD in Turkey."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric symptoms in men with hypospadias - preliminary results of a cross-sectional cohort study.", "Abstract": "Population studies have shown an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in males born with the congenital condition hypospadias, where the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis.

Telephone monitoring is effective in specialty substance use disorder treatment settings in increasing continuing care and 12-step program utilization and improving substance use outcomes. This study examined the effectiveness of telephone monitoring among psychiatry inpatients with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. Methods This randomized controlled trial (n\u2009=\u2009406) compared usual care to usual care plus telephone monitoring (one in-person session during the inpatient stay, followed by weekly telephone contact for three months post-discharge). Follow-ups were conducted at end-of-intervention (three months post-baseline) and nine and 15 months post-baseline (73% followed). Primary outcomes were number of days out of the past 30 of drinking alcohol, using drugs, and experiencing psychological problems. Secondary outcomes were outpatient substance use treatment, and 12-step group, utilization. Results Longitudinal modeling found that patients in both conditions improved over time on each primary outcome. Improvement was comparable between conditions on alcohol and drug use and psychological problems. Receipt of outpatient treatment decreased over the follow-up period and was not related to condition. Likelihood of attending 12-step group meetings did not change over follow-ups, and was not related to condition. Conclusions Improvement over time was evident regardless of condition assignment. Patients maintained attendance at 12-step groups from pre- to post-discharge. Short-term telephone monitoring in addition to usual care for patients with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders may not be sufficiently intensive to achieve additional improvements on outcomes."}, {"Title": "Hypomania Symptoms Across Psychiatric Disorders: Screening Use of the Hypomania Check-List 32 at Admission to an Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic.", "Abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Hypomania symptoms are best described as a continuum, ranging beyond Bipolar Spectrum Disorders (BSD). Other nosological entities, such as major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or borderline personality disorder, may also share symptoms with BSD, raising challenges for differential diagnosis. While the Hypomania Checklist-32 is one of the most widely used tools for screening hypomania, there is limited evidence describing its use in a real-world outpatient psychiatric clinical setting. <b>Methods:</b> Here we tested the psychometric properties of a European Portuguese adaptation of the HCL-32, establishing its factor structure, reliability and construct validity. Furthermore, we analyzed differences in hypomanic symptoms among several clinical groups and in a non-clinical sample. Data was obtained retrospectively in an ecological setting from a clinical sample of an outpatient psychiatry and psychology clinic, comprising 463 Portuguese individuals, 326 of whom had a psychiatric diagnosis, namely BSD (<i>n</i> = 66), major depressive disorder (<i>n</i> = 116), or other psychiatric disorders (<i>n</i> = 144). A separate non-clinical sample was also collected among healthy volunteers (<i>n</i> = 62). A battery of self-report measures of affective symptoms was applied, and in a subset of patients, diagnosis was established using a structured diagnostic interview. <b>Results:</b> Psychometric properties of the HCL-32 were adequate, with good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.86) and test-retest stability (ICC = 0.86), and two subscores (\"active/elated\" and \"risk-taking/irritable\") defined by Principal Component Analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the test score discriminated moderately between patients with BSD and other clinical samples as well as healthy volunteers, with a cut-off score of 17 for the total score of the HCL-32 rendering the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. When compared to the HCL-32 total score, the risk-taking/irritable subscore seems to provide additional benefit in discriminating between different clinical groups, namely regarding specificity in the discrimination from patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder that was low for the full scale and the alternate subscale. <b>Conclusions:</b> HCL-32 can be used as a screening tool for BSD among adult patients presenting in an outpatient psychiatric clinical setting."}, {"Title": "Factors influencing the quality of life perceptions of cognitively impaired older adults in a nursing home and their informal and professional caregivers: a mixed methods study.", "Abstract": "Identifying the objective and subjective aspects of the quality of life (QoL) of institutionalized cognitively impaired older adults (CIOAs) is a challenge. However, it can reveal which aspects of their care require improvement.\nThe aim of this study was to identify the core aspects of the QoL of CIOAs living in a nursing home (NH) by involving informal and professional caregivers (PCs).\nOur sequential, mixed methods study exploring the QoL of CIOAs was based on Lodgson et al's (2002) quantitative quality of life-Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD) questionnaire. Subsequently, a qualitative phase study analyzed perceptions and impressions of QoL using interviews of CIOAs and their most significant informal caregivers (SICs) and PCs.\nFifteen CIOAs, 12 SICs, and 2 PCs were recruited. Two-thirds of the older adults were females, overall average age was 86 years (SD=6.1), and all had a severe clinical dementia rating (CDR=3). A high level of comorbidity (measured using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics) was significantly associated with a lower QoL-AD score (<i>P</i>=0.046). Higher numbers of visits by SICs or family members had a positive effect on QoL-AD scores (<i>P</i>=0.036). No significant differences were found in overall QoL-AD scores as rated by CIOAs, SICs, and PCs (<i>P</i>=0.080). Combining quantitative and qualitative data analyses revealed four significant themes influencing the QoL of CIOAs: 1) human dignity and acceptance; 2) development and existence; 3) functionality and health; and 4) recognizability and safety.\nSequentially using mixed methods proved an appropriate way to examine the QoL of severe CIOAs living in an NH, and these results were compared with the perceptions of informal and PCs. The factors optimizing overall health were visits by SICs and family members, and the major aspect that increases the QoL was freedom of movement inside and outside the NH."}, {"Title": "Drawing the line on physician-assisted death.", "Abstract": "Drawing the line on physician assistance in physician-assisted death (PAD) continues to be a contentious issue in many legal jurisdictions across the USA, Canada and Europe. PAD is a medical practice that occurs when physicians either prescribe or administer lethal medication to their patients. As more legal jurisdictions establish PAD for at least some class of patients, the question of the proper scope of this practice has become pressing. This paper presents an argument for restricting PAD to the terminally ill that can be accepted by defenders as well as critics of PAD for the terminally ill. The argument appeals to fairness-based paternalism and the social meaning of medical practice. These two considerations interact in various ways, as the paper explains. The right way to think about the social meaning of medical practice bears on fair paternalism as it relates to PAD and vice versa. The paper contends that these considerations have substantial force when directed against proposals to extend PAD to non-terminally ill patients, but considerably less force when directed against PAD for the terminally ill. The paper pays special attention to the case of non-terminally ill patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression, as these patients present a potentially strong case for extending PAD beyond the terminally ill."}, {"Title": "The Italian autism network (ITAN): a resource for molecular genetics and biomarker investigations.", "Abstract": "A substantial genetic component accounts for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) aetiology, with some rare and common genetic risk factors recently identified.

Certified staff was specifically trained at each site for the overall study conduct, for clinical protocol administration and handling of biological material. A centralized database was developed to collect clinical assessment and medical records from each recruiting site. Children were eligible for recruitment based on the following inclusion criteria: age 4-18\u00a0years, at least one parent or legal guardian giving voluntary written consent, meeting DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder or Asperger's Disorder or Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS. Affected individuals were assessed by full psychiatric, neurological and physical examination, evaluation with ADI-R and ADOS scales, cognitive assessment with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children or Preschool and Primary, Leiter International Performance Scale or Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale. Additional evaluations included language assessment, the Krug Asperger's Disorder Index, and instrumental examination such as EEG and structural MRI.

The aim of this study is to investigate attitudes towards psychosocial and psychiatric problems by non-psychiatrist consultants in an academic hospital.\u00a0Data were collected by anonymous, self- administered questionnaires which were\u00a0provided to all consultants during morning reports and by email.\u00a0Of 431 eligible participants, 187(43%) completed the questionnaire: 64% during morning reports, and 36% by email. Almost all consultants report generally positive attitudes towards mental health problems. However, we identified several obstacles towards management. First, there was a discrepancy between positive attitude and the willingness to take on management responsibility. Reported reasons for this discrepancy were time constraints and lack of skills. We also found that consultants feel little responsibility for the management of depression and chronic drinking. Physicians have generally more positive attitudes than surgeons. Finally, all consultants are less likely to refer patients with dementia and treatment non-compliance to psychiatry, for reasons of perceived ineffectiveness and fear of stigmatizing patients. We conclude targeted education on the management of these problems for hospital consultants is still warranted."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacology: From serendipitous discoveries to rationale design, but what next?", "Abstract": "Psychopharmacology really developed as a discipline from the mid-20th century with the discovery of a number of new classes of psychoactive drugs which could modify behaviour.

These serendipitous discoveries were the start of an era of drug development which has led to the antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilisers used today. Subsequent research focused on understanding why these drugs were effective, and used this information to develop a second generation of drugs that were more selective for their therapeutic targets, and therefore had reduced side effects and improved safety and tolerability.

Here, we attempt to discern whether genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, or use of pharmacological treatments (i.e., antidepressants), predict shorter telomere length and risk for aging-related disease in a United Kingdom population sample. <b>Methods:</b> DNA samples from blood were available from 351 participants who were recruited as part of the South East London Community Health (SELCoH) Study, and for which whole-genome genotype data was available. Leukocyte telomere length was characterized using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Individualized polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) were calculated using Psychiatric Genomics Consortium summary statistics. We subsequently performed linear models, to discern the impact polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders (an etiological risk factor) and antidepressant use (common pharmacological treatment) have on telomere length, whilst accounting for other lifestyle/health factors (e.g., BMI, smoking). <b>Results:</b> There were no significant associations between polygenic risk for any of the psychiatric disorders tested and telomere length (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Antidepressant use was significantly associated with shorter telomere length and this was independent from a depression diagnosis or current depression severity (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.01). Antidepressant use was also associated with a significantly higher risk of aging-related disease, which was independent from depression diagnosis (<i>p</i> \u2264 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Genetic risk for psychiatric disorders is not associated with shorter telomere length. Further studies are now needed to prospectively characterize if antidepressant use increases risk for aging-related disease and telomere shortening, or whether people who age faster and have aging-related diseases are just more likely to be prescribed antidepressants."}, {"Title": "The Implementation of China's Mental Health Law-Defined Risk Criteria for Involuntary Admission: A National Cross-Sectional Study of Involuntarily Hospitalized Patients.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Involuntary admission is one of the most controversial issues in psychiatry in China.

We included all involuntarily admitted psychiatric inpatients who were discharged from December 25 to 27, 2017. Patients' demographic and clinical data and reasons for admission were retrieved. Hospitals' information was also collected.

Rates of risk criteria implementation ranged from 7.9 to 88.5% in these hospitals. Only 369 inpatients (45.3%) met the MHL-defined risk criteria. Overall, between 62.2 and 78.5% of the variance in risk criteria implementation was at the patient level, and between 21.5 and 37.8% of the variance was at the hospital level. Patients with higher Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores at admission were less likely to meet the risk criteria (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03). No statistically significant association was found between risk criteria implementation and other patient level or hospital level factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings show the implementation rate of the MHL's risk criteria overall was low, with only 45.3% of involuntary admissions meeting the MHL-defined criteria.

These two effective educational therapies have the common purpose of improving disorder-related morbidity, compliance with treatment and patients' quality of life. While they have different methods of application, both teach patients to play an active role in their own care. However, it is still critical to combine them for care of patients with psychiatric and addiction disorders in a manner that allows for specificity. To do this, the differences between psychoeducation and therapeutic patient education must be considered, and their potential for the management of patients with psychiatric and addiction disorders must be determined.\nIn our article, we review the literature concerning therapeutic education programs for patients and discuss the literature based on the experiences of psychiatrists trained in these therapies.\nDespite rather nonrestrictive guidelines, and after reviewing numerous studies, we found that psychoeducation seems to be rarely used in psychiatry. The use of therapeutic patient education programs for psychiatric patients has doubled in four years but still accounts for less than 4% of validated programs in France. Only 154 programs were developed in 1175 public psychiatric facilities in 2016. Therapeutic patient education has a legal framework and recommendations, which make it suitable for inclusion in care and in the training of care providers. The rigor in the development of therapeutic patient education programs and the requirement for training and financial support reinforce the need for their establishment in healthcare institutions. As such, they could help to modify professional practices and the culture of care in mental health fields.\nThere is a place for therapeutic patient education in psychiatry as it provides a real benefit for patients.

Reaction time data will be collated for the computation of baseline attentional biases and to determine whether there is a reduction of attentional bias across the interventions. Feasibility will be determined by the number of participants recruited and participants' adherence to the planned interventions up until the completion of their rehabilitation program and by the ability of the app in detecting baseline biases and changes in biases.

This study examined exposure to and patterns of engagement with the show and the show's perceived impact in a sample of youths presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (ED) with suicide-related concerns in the year after the series' premiere.\nParticipants were 87 parent-youth dyads (youths' mean\u00b1SD age=14.6\u00b11.8; 71% of youths were female, 26% male, and 2% gender nonconforming) who completed a battery of questionnaires during their ED visit.\nHalf (49%) of the sample viewed at least one episode of 13 Reasons Why, season 1. Most youths (84%) viewed the show alone and were more likely to discuss their reactions with peers (80%) than with a parent (34%). Over half of youth viewers (51%) believed the series increased their suicide risk to a nonzero degree; having a stronger identification with the lead female character was significantly related to this belief (r=.63, df=41, p<0.001). Youths with more depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation were more likely to identify with the lead characters and report negative affect while viewing.\nTo date, this is the first published study examining viewing patterns and reactions to 13 Reasons Why in a high-risk sample. Although further research is needed, the findings suggest a particular vulnerability to the show's themes among youths at risk of suicide and the importance of prevention strategies to ameliorate risk among these viewers."}, {"Title": "The Learning Curve After Implementation of Collaborative Care in a State Mental Health Integration Program.", "Abstract": "This study examined organizational variability of process-of-care and depression outcomes at eight community health centers (CHCs) in the years following implementation of collaborative care (CC) for depression.\nThe authors used 8 years of observational data for 13,362 unique patients at eight CHCs that participated in Washington State's Mental Health Integration Program. Organization-level changes in depression and process-of-care outcomes over time were studied.\nOn average, depression outcomes improved for the first 2 years before improvement slowed, peaking at year 5. Significant organization-level variation was noted in outcomes. Improvements in depression outcomes tended to follow process-of-care measures.\nFindings suggest that it may take 2 years after implementation of CC to fully observe depression outcome improvement at an organization level. Substantial variation between organizations in depression outcomes over time suggests that sustained attention to processes of care may be necessary to maintain initially achieved gains."}, {"Title": "Updated European Consensus Statement on diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD.", "Abstract": "Background Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood that often persists into adulthood and old age. Yet ADHD is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated in many European countries, leading to chronicity of symptoms and impairment, due to lack of, or ineffective treatment, and higher costs of illness. Methods The European Network Adult ADHD and the Section for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Across the Lifespan (NDAL) of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA), aim to increase awareness and knowledge of adult ADHD in and outside Europe. This Updated European Consensus Statement aims to support clinicians with research evidence and clinical experience from 63 experts of European and other countries in which ADHD in adults is recognized and treated. Results Besides reviewing the latest research on prevalence, persistence, genetics and neurobiology of ADHD, three major questions are addressed: (1) What is the clinical picture of ADHD in adults? (2) How should ADHD be properly diagnosed in adults? (3) How should adult ADHDbe effectively treated? Conclusions ADHD often presents as a lifelong impairing condition. The stigma surrounding ADHD, mainly due to lack of knowledge, increases the suffering of patients. Education on the lifespan perspective, diagnostic assessment, and treatment of ADHD must increase for students of general and mental health, and for psychiatry professionals. Instruments for screening and diagnosis of ADHD in adults are available, as are effective evidence-based treatments for ADHD and its negative outcomes. More research is needed on gender differences, and in older adults with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Online comments about psychiatric neurosurgery and psychopharmacological interventions: Public perceptions and concerns.", "Abstract": "The field of biological psychiatry is controversial, with both academics and members of the public questioning the validity and the responsible use of psychiatric technological interventions. The field of neuroethics provides insight into these controversies by examining key themes that characterize specific topics, attitudes, and reasoning tools that people use to evaluate interventions in the brain and mind. This study offers new empirical neuroethical insights into how the public responds to the use and development of psychiatric technological interventions by comparing how the public evaluates pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions, in the context of online comments on news media articles about these topics. We analyzed 1142 comments from 108 articles dealing with psychopharmacological and psychiatric neurosurgery interventions on websites of major circulation USA newspapers and magazines published between 2005 and 2015. Personal anecdote, medical professional issues, medicalization, social issues, disadvantages, scientific issues and cautionary realism were among the main themes raised by commenters. The insights derived from the comments can contribute to improving communication between professionals and the public as well as to incorporating the public's views in policy decisions about psychiatric interventions."}, {"Title": "Incremental clinical utility of continuous performance tests in childhood ADHD - an evidence-based assessment approach.", "Abstract": "Despite extensive research on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there are still uncertainties regarding the clinical utility of different ADHD assessment methods. This study aimed to examine the incremental clinical utility of Conners' continuous performance test (CPT) II and QbTest in diagnostic assessments and treatment monitoring of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Retrospective data from child and adolescent psychiatric records of two populations were studied. The diagnostic clinical utility of Conners' CPT II and QbTest was analysed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and post-test probability in 80 children with and 38 without ADHD. Dose titrations of central stimulants in 56 children with ADHD were evaluated using QbTest and the Swanson, Nolan, Pelham, version IV (SNAP-IV) scale. Conners' CPT II, but not QbTest, had incremental clinical utility in diagnostic assessment of children with ADHD when teacher and parent ratings were inconclusive. QbTest proved useful in titration of central stimulant treatment when parent ratings were inconclusive. Continuous performance tests were found to be clinically useful when rating scales were inconclusive."}, {"Title": "Biomarkers for bipolar disorder: current status and challenges ahead.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder marked by clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity.

RESULTS: The median length of admission increased from 167 days in 1985 to 580 days in 2012, though not in the intervening cohorts. There have been changes in the discharge destination of patients, away from independent accommodation in the community towards further care or supported accommodation.Clinical implicationsThe results suggest a change in the delivery of care. Further studies should be performed to assess whether the same trends exist at other sites.

This study investigates whether these characteristics separately are independent predictors of health outcomes of acute psychiatric hospitalization.<b>Methods:</b> Observational study in a prospectively sampled cohort of older patients, consecutively admitted to a psychiatric hospital. On admission we assessed frailty (Frailty Index and walking speed); multimorbidity (Cumulative Index Rating Scale Geriatrics (CIRS-G)) and functional status (Barthel Index). We used the Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement scale (CGI-I) as the psychiatric outcome measure, and dichotomized discharge destination as overall outcome measure: favourable (able to return home or previous care level) or adverse (death, or move to higher level of residential care).<b>Results:</b> We included 120 patients, 74.6\u2009years (\u00b17.8). 52.5% of the patients was frail (FI \u22650.25). The mean level of the CIRS-G was 13.5 (5.4). Mean CGI-I at discharge was 2.8 (\u00b1 1.0), indicating moderate improvement in the psychiatric outcome. Neither FI, CIRS-G, nor Barthel scores were, independent of age, sex and diagnosis, associated with the CGI-I. FI was predictive for adverse discharge destination (OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.09-3.37 per 0.1), as were higher CIRS-G (OR 1.19 95%CI 1.06-1.34, per point) and lower walking speed (OR 1.35 95%CI 1.06-1.72 per 0.1\u2009m/s).<b>Conclusions:</b> Half of our patients were frail and had a high level of multimorbidity.

Psychosis risk symptoms were assessed with the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ) at the beginning of the treatment. We assessed the power of the overall PQ as well as its positive, negative, general, and disorganized psychosis risk symptom factors in predicting prolonged service use. Baseline psychiatric diagnoses (grouped into 7 categories) were controlled for. Based on both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment after baseline, adolescents were divided into three groups of brief, intermittent, and persistent service use.\nStronger symptoms on any PQ factor as well as the presence of a mood disorder predicted prolonged service use. All of the PQ factors remained significant predictors when adjusted for baseline mood disorder and multimorbidity.\nIn a prospective follow-up of a large sample using comprehensive mental health records, our findings indicate that assessing psychosis risk symptoms in clinical adolescent settings at the beginning of treatment could predict long-term need for care beyond diagnostic information. Our findings replicate the previous findings that positive psychosis risk symptoms are unspecific markers of severity of psychopathology.

This study assessed whether differences in clinic setting may influence the use of mental health apps and which factors influence patient perception of apps.\nThe objective of this study was to gain an understanding of how individuals with mental illness use their mobile phones by exploring their access to mobile phones and their use of mental health apps.\nA single time point survey study was conducted over a 2-week period in February 2018 at two nearby outpatient psychiatry clinics: one serving largely mood and anxiety disorder patients with private insurance staffed by both faculty and residents and the other serving largely psychotic disorder patients in a state Department of Mental Health (DMH) setting. A total of 25 patients at the state DMH clinic also consented for a single time point observation of apps currently installed on their personal mobile phone.\nA total of 113 patients at the private insurance clinic and 73 at the state DMH clinic completed the survey. Those in the private insurance clinic were more likely to download a mental health app compared to the state DMH clinic, but actual rates of reported current app usage were comparable at each clinic, approximately 10%. Verifying current apps on patients' mobile phones at the state DMH clinic confirmed that approximately 10% had mental health apps installed. Patients at both clinics were most concerned about privacy of mental health apps, although those at the state DMH clinic viewed cost savings as the greatest benefit while those at the private clinic reported time as the greatest benefit.\nHigh interest in mental health apps does not automatically translate into high use. Our results of low but similar rates of mental health app use at diverse clinics suggests DMH patients with largely psychotic disorders are as interested and engaged with apps as those in a private insurance clinic treating largely mood and anxiety disorders. Results from our study also highlight the importance of understanding how actual patients are using apps instead of relying on internet-based samples, which often yield higher results due to their likelihood of being selected."}, {"Title": "Parental Infections Before, During, and After Pregnancy as Risk Factors for Mental Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Nationwide Danish Study.", "Abstract": "Previous studies have shown associations between maternal infections during pregnancy and increased risks of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder in the offspring.

Exposure included all maternal and paternal infections treated with anti-infective agents or hospital contacts before, during, or after pregnancy. The main outcome was a diagnosis of any mental disorder in the child. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression analysis.\nMaternal infections during pregnancy treated with anti-infective agents (n\u00a0= 567,016) increased the risk of mental disorders (n\u00a0= 70,037) in the offspring (HR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.12), which was more elevated (p < .001) than after paternal infections (n\u00a0= 350,835; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.03).

The aim of this integrative review is therefore to identify and synthesise existing evidence on the barriers and enablers to accessing mental health services in Ghana.\nA search of the published literature was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The search was limited to papers published in English and within 2000-2018. Using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved papers. A data extraction form and a Critical Appraisal Checklist were used to extract and appraise data, respectively. The integrative review incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data into a single synthesis.\nOut of 42 papers that met the inclusion criteria, 50% used qualitative methods, 33.3% used mixed methods and 16.7% used quantitative methods alone. The potential barriers in accessing mental health services were attitudinal, knowledge about services, treatment cost, transportation and geographical proximity, as well as perceived efficacy of medication. Similarly, the health systems factors contributing to barriers were low priority, limited funding sources, irregular medicine supply, limited services for marginalised groups and poor state of psychiatric facilities, together with poor management of mental health cadres. The potential enablers for service users involved increased decentralisation and integration, task-shifting and existing support services.\nThe existing evidence on mental health in Ghana is skewed towards weaknesses in the systems and stigma, with rationally little, or no, evidence or emphasis on the effectiveness, or quality of mental health services.

This study focuses on the use of SNSs by adolescent psychiatric patients and the potential use of SNS-generated data to help medical practitioners diagnose and treat patients' mental health. Our objective is to understand and measure the psychiatric and individual conditions in which symptom-sharing occurs on SNSs and the frequency of these conditions. Based on literature, we hypothesized that the perceived value of social network sites positively affects adolescents' sharing of symptoms on these sites.\nAn empirical test of this hypothesis was conducted with a survey of 224 adolescents admitted to a psychiatry clinic in Turkey. The hypothesis was tested using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis.\nThe perceived value of SNSs explained an additional 37.8% of variation in symptom sharing on SNSs above and beyond the control variables, which are gender, age, type of disorder, and amount of internet and SNS use. The findings suggested that adolescents share symptoms on SNSs only if they attribute value to the SNSs that they use. We also found that 72% of adolescents in our sample shared their symptoms on SNSs.\nThere is an attractive opportunity for information technology companies to develop, together with health professionals; data analytics that are able to detect symptoms to support psychiatric diagnoses and pave the way for big-data enabled personalized medicine."}, {"Title": "Job Stressors and Slow Medicine in Health Care: A Scoping Review.", "Abstract": "This paper provides a framework for addressing the stressors in modern medical health care, especially those that relate to psychology and psychiatry.

Completely isolated from the rest of the world, the territory remained a prohibited area for scholars, and local authors due to censorship or self-censorship, offered very scarce information. The general feeling of the public was that of a denial of psychic disorders in total, combined with the fear that this kind of disorders has ever since provoked. Nevertheless, insanity defence was a formulation encountered with a certain frequency in Albanian judicial procedures, although forensic psychiatry was a peripheral part of an already neglected medical specialty. The entire system of psychiatric care was mainly hospital based, and shock therapies (electroconvulsive therapy, pyretotherapy, insulin coma) were normal part of the therapeutic armamentarium along with antipsychotics and social isolation. Some recently unclassified documents and some archival papers, whose exhaustive consultation needs further study, might shed light to the problems of a psychiatry, that are not substantially different from the ones encountered in the Eastern communist Europe of the same period of time."}, {"Title": "Identifying key targets for interventions to improve psychological wellbeing: replicable results from four UK cohorts.", "Abstract": "An increasing importance is being placed on mental health and wellbeing at individual and population levels. While there are several interventions that have been proposed to improve wellbeing, more evidence is needed to understand which aspects of wellbeing are most influential. This study aimed to identify key items that signal improvement of mental health and wellbeing.\nUsing network analysis, we identified the most central items in the graph network estimated from the well-established Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Results were compared across four major UK cohorts comprising a total of 47,578 individuals: the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network, the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey, the Northern Ireland Health Survey, and the National Child Development Study.\nRegardless of gender, the three items most central in the network were related to positive self-perception and mood: 'I have been feeling good about myself'; 'I have been feeling confident'; and 'I have been feeling cheerful'. Results were consistent across all four cohorts.\nPositive self-perception and positive mood are central to psychological wellbeing. Psychotherapeutic and public mental health interventions might best promote psychological wellbeing by prioritising the improvement of self-esteem, self-confidence and cheerfulness.

The aim of this narrative review is to review the phenomenological similarities and dissimilarities and the shared pathways between GAD and mood disorders. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for articles published in English from 1980 to present. GAD and mood disorders, either MDD or BD, show some phenomenological overlaps and a high degree of comorbidity, especially between GAD and MDD. Both GAD and mood disorders are also frequently comorbid with other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and medical conditions, including cardio- vascular disorder (CVD). Mood disorders have a worse prognosis when GAD is present. GAD and mood disorders are associated with female sex and may partly share genetic variants of risk. Moreover, both GAD and mood disorders frequently share similar environmental risks factors including Early Life Time Trauma (ELT) and Psychological Stressors in Adulthood (PSA). Increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation coupled to lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses are evident in GAD, MDD and type I bipolar patients. Patients with comorbid GAD and MDD show significantly higher nitro- oxidative biomarkers as compared with patients presenting with either GAD or MDD as well as patients with BD with or without co-occurring GAD. Activated immune-inflammatory processes characterized by increased levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines are other shared pathways that underpin GAD and mood disorders. Moreover, these pathways may explain comorbidities with medical disorders including CVD. Aberrations in HPA-axis, GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, NMDA and mu opioid-receptors and neuroimaging fields have yielded more inconsistent findings. In conclusion, here we propose a new model explaining GAD and the comorbidity between GAD and mood disorders. Common triggers such as ELT/PSA may underpin GAD and its comorbidity with mood disorders via activated neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative and neuro-immune pathways."}, {"Title": "LGBT-Specific Education in General Psychiatry Residency Programs: a Survey of Program Directors.", "Abstract": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and other sexual minority individuals are at higher risk than non-LGBT individuals for multiple psychiatric conditions and suicide.

Although the clinical response equals the standard treatment algorithms, the effect sizes on the beneficial outcome remain rather modest. Over the last couple of years, to improve the efficacy in resistant depression, two new avenues have been developed: personalization and intensifying rTMS treatment. For the latter, we retrospectively compared accelerated high-frequency rTMS (arTMS) with accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) in the refractory depressed state. Although the clinical efficacy was not significantly different between both protocols, our observations substantiate the potential of the accelerated stimulation to shorten the treatment duration from the depressed state to the response state.

The paper assesses the relative merits and significance of each, before turning its attention to the nature of gender and its relevance to psychiatry.

The concept of treatment alliance in psychiatry has its origins in psychotherapy, but has also been influenced by several other constructs such as patient-centred care (PCC) and shared decision-making (SDM). Similarly, there has been a shift in conceptualization of treatment-adherence in psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder (BD) from illness-centred and clinician-centred approaches to patient-centred ones. Moreover, the traditional compliance based models are being replaced by those based on concordance between clinicians and patients. Newer theories of adherence in BD place considerable emphasis on patient related factors and the clinician patient alliance is considered to be one of the principal determinants of treatment-adherence in BD. Likewise, current notions of treatment alliance in BD also stress the importance of equal and collaborative relationships, sensitivity to patients' viewpoints, sharing of knowledge, and mutual responsibility and agreement regarding decisions related to treatment. Accumulated evidence from quantitative research, descriptive accounts, qualitative studies and trials of psychosocial interventions indicates that efficacious treatment alliances have a positive influence on adherence in BD. Then again, research on the alliance-adherence link in BD lags behind the existing literature on the subject in other medical and psychiatric conditions in terms of the size and quality of the evidence, the consistency of its findings and clarity about underlying processes mediating this link. Nevertheless, the elements of an effective alliance which could have a positive impact on adherence in BD are reasonably clear and include PCC, collaborative relationships, SDM, open communication, trust, support, and stability and continuity of the relationship. Therefore, clinicians involved in the care of BD would do well to follow these principles and improve their interpersonal and communication skills in order to build productive alliances with their patients. This could go a long way in confronting the ubiquitous problem of non-adherence in BD. The role of future research in firmly establishing the alliance-adherence connection and uncovering the processes underlying this association will also be vital in devising effective ways to manage non-adherence in BD."}, {"Title": "Coprophagy in nineteenth-century psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper shows how Austrian psychiatrists of the 1870s developed the first pathological accounts of institutional coprophagia, examining how they related the behaviour to mental illness and dementia.

Logistic regression was carried out to determine risk factors and between-drug differences. CADRs were relatively more prevalent in patients treated with clomipramine, maprotiline, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, acamprosate, clomethiazole and disulfiram as well as with antidepressants and anticonvulsants as drug classes (p\u202f<\u202f0.01).

Women were more vulnerable to CADRs (67% in cases and 56% in non-cases, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). The significantly higher rate of CADRs in women was mainly observed under age of 50 years, i.e. during female reproductive years. In a multivariate logistic regression, female sex, the diagnostic group ICD F1 (substance abuse), maprotiline, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and clomethiazole were identified as risk factors of CADRs. The case/non-case approach allowed to identify risk factors based on empirical data rather than experts' evaluations. The new findings of substance abuse and clomethiazole as risk factors for CADRs have to be confirmed in further studies. Since CADRs can be life-threatening, it is important to be aware of risk factors, especially women during their reproductive period and with lamotrigine treatment."}, {"Title": "[Behavior disorders in the childhood and adolescence of schizophrenic patients: A retrospective study].", "Abstract": "Usually Schizophrenia starts in late adolescence or early adulthood.

A more clinically and patient-oriented role of the community pharmacist in primary care makes the dispensation of medication an adequate situation for an effective, rapid, easy, and reproducible screening of MCI. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted with 728 non-institutionalized participants older than 65. A total of 167 variables were collected such as age, gender, educational attainment, daily sleep duration, reading frequency, subjective memory complaint, and medication. Two screening tests were used to detect possible MCI: Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants classified as positive were referred to clinical diagnosis. A decision tree and predictive models are presented as a result of applying techniques of machine learning for a more efficient enrollment. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and twenty-eight participants (17.4%) scored positive on MCI tests. A recursive partitioning algorithm with the most significant variables determined that the most relevant for the decision tree are: female sex, sleeping more than 9 h daily, age higher than 79 years as risk factors, and reading frequency. Moreover, psychoanaleptics, nootropics, and antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory drugs achieve a high score of importance according to the predictive algorithms. Furthermore, results obtained from these algorithms agree with the current research on MCI. <b>Conclusion:</b> Lifestyle-related factors such as sleep duration and the lack of reading habits are associated with the presence of positive in MCI test. Moreover, we have depicted how machine learning provides a sound methodology to produce tools for early detection of MCI in community pharmacy. <b>Impact of findings on practice:</b> The community of pharmacists provided with adequate tools could develop a crucial task in the early detection of MCI to redirect them immediately to the specialists in neurology or psychiatry.

At the outpatient pain clinic of Magdeburg University Hospital, all patients, without exception, are subject to permanent psychiatric care delivered by a consultation-liaison psychiatrist. In CRPS, psychological stabilization and treatment of the neuropathic aspects are equally important. The aim of this single-center retrospective study was to determine mental/psychiatric defects impairing pain processing at the time of investigation and show the effects of treating mental disorders and neuropathic pain with the same psychotropic drugs.\nOn admission, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist examined the mental state of every patient in a semistructured interview according to AMDP (working group for methods and documentation in psychiatry). Due to the model of the Department of Anaesthesiology, we are able to compare the group of CRPS patients with all other outpatients treated for pain.\nThe medical treatment of psychiatric dysfunction leads to an analgesic effect. Only every second CRPS patient had an additional psychiatric diagnosis, and 15.6% were diagnosed with depressive mood disorders and show a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than the general population and exceed the mean for all patients treated in our pain clinic.\nIn neuropathies, treatment of the neuropathic pain has a modulating effect on mental disorders. As CRPS patients are frequently affected by depressions, and owing to the connection between depression and suicidal tendencies, patients should be seen by a consultation-liaison psychiatrist, and nonpsychiatrists should pay special attention to this patient group."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepine and z-hypnotic prescribing from acute psychiatric inpatient discharge to long-term care in the community.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepine and z-hypnotic prescribing has slowly decreased over the past 20 years, however long-term chronic prescribing still occurs and is at odds with prescribing guidance.\nTo identify the pattern of benzodiazepine and z-hypnotic prescribing in psychiatric inpatients at discharge and 12 months post-discharge.\nRetrospective observational longitudinal cohort study of patients admitted to two adult psychiatric wards between June and November 2012 (inclusive) who were discharged with a prescription for a benzodiazepine or z-hypnotic drug.

We also discuss the different roles of hazardous versus self-generated environmental factors and how these types of factors may differentially engage with an individual's genetic background in predicting a resulting phenotype. Then, we present examplar studies that highlight the role of G\u00d7E in predicting atypical developmental trajectories as well as provide insight regarding treatment outcomes. Supported by these examples, we explore the need to move beyond merely examining statistical interactions between genes and the environment, and the motivation to investigate specific genetic susceptibility and environmental contexts that drive developmental disorders. We propose that further parsing of genetic and environmental components is required to fully understand the unique contribution of each factor to the etiology of developmental disorders. Finally, with a greater appreciation of the complexities of G\u00d7E interaction, this discussion will converge upon the potential implications for clinical and translational research."}, {"Title": "The Moral Obligation to Prioritize Research Into Deep Brain Stimulation Over Brain Lesioning Procedures for Severe Enduring Anorexia Nervosa.", "Abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation is currently being investigated as an experimental treatment for patients suffering from treatment-refractory AN, with an increasing number of case reports and small-scale trials published. Although still at an exploratory and experimental stage, initial results have been promising. Despite the risks associated with an invasive neurosurgical procedure and the long-term implantation of a foreign body, DBS has a number of advantageous features for patients with SE-AN. Stimulation can be fine-tuned to the specific needs of the particular patient, is relatively reversible, and the technique also allows for the crucial issue of investigating and comparing the effects of different neural targets. However, at a time when DBS is emerging as a promising investigational treatment modality for AN, lesioning procedures in psychiatry are having a renaissance. Of concern it has been argued that the two kinds of interventions should instead be understood as rivaling, yet \"mutually enriching paradigms\" despite the fact that lesioning the brain is irreversible and there is no evidence base for an effective target in AN. We argue that lesioning procedures in AN are unethical at this stage of knowledge and seriously problematic for this patient group, for whom self-control is particularly central to wellbeing.

Especially the colonial bid to prove its legitimacy as a civilizing mission led to representation of European medicine as morally superior to the eastern practices resulting in a biased history. Though in reality, the history of psychiatry is heterogeneous and consists of many different scientific and cultural traditions which vary between populations. hence the Indian concept of \"unmada\" can't be compared or conformed to \"schizophrenia\" without addressing its cultural and historical contexts.

Next, we discuss neurodevelopmental models of psychopathology, and provide selected examples. We emphasize differential neuromaturation of subcortical and cortical neural networks and connectivity, and how both acute and protracted environmental insults can compromise neural structure and function. To date, developmental psychopathology has placed greater emphasis than psychiatry on neuromaturational models of mental illness. However, this gap is closing rapidly as advances in technology render etiopathophysiologies of psychopathology more interrogable.

Formerly dominant stress-related aetiological models have been increasingly challenged, in part due to cases without any history of past or recent trauma. In this perspective article, we review current evidence for such models, and how research into the role of traumatic stress in other disorders and the neurobiology of the stress response can inform our mechanistic understanding of FND. First, we discuss the association between stress and the onset or exacerbation of a variety of physical and mental health problems. Second, we review the role of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in the neurobiology of ill-health, alongside evidence for similar mechanisms in FND. Third, we advocate a stress-diathesis model, in which biological susceptibility interacts with early life adversity, where FND can be precipitated by traumatic events later in life and maintained by psychological responses. We hypothesise that greater biological susceptibility to FND is associated with less severe remote and recent stress, and that FND precipitated by more severe stress is associated with lower biological vulnerability. This would explain clinical experience of variable exposure to historical and recent traumatic stress among people with FND and requires empirical investigation. A testable, evidence-based stress-diathesis model can inform nuanced understanding of how biological and psychological factors interact at the individual level, with potential to inform personalised treatment pathways.

These were to be integrated with five validated dimensional psychological constructs such as negative and positive valence systems. Four years later, the NIMH stated that the ultimate goal of RDoC is precision medicine for psychiatry, with the assumption that precision medications will normalize dysfunctional neural circuits. How this could be accomplished is not obvious, given that neural circuits are widely distributed, have unclear boundaries, and exhibit a significant degree of neuroplasticity, with multiple circuits present in any given disorder. Moreover, the early focus on neural circuitry has been criticized for its reductionism and neglect of the more recent RDoC emphasis on the integration and equivalence of biological and psychological phenomena. Yet this seems inconsistent with the priorities of the NIMH director, an advocate of the central role of neural circuitry and projects such as the Brain Initiative and the Human Connectome Project.

A review of contemporary issues in medical ethics.", "Abstract": "This extended essay seeks to unpack some of the key aspects of philosophy which are applicable to medical thought and practice. It proceeds via an analytical discussion of the contemporary debate in three key areas of medical ethics: euthanasia, concepts of health & disease and psychiatry.The main claims are as follows: 1. The case for legalising euthanasia is strong on philosophical grounds but there are numerous practical obstacles. 2. Elements from the normative and naturalistic definitions of disease are necessary for a thorough definition that dodges common objections to either. 3. Mental health cannot be subsumed under a purely physicalist model of health rendering it distinctly different from other fields in Medicine. Through a detailed discussion of three salient issues in the philosophy of medicine, it is argued that the application of profound philosophical thought to medicine and its practices reveals a depth that necessitates exploration before simply following the aims of curing all.

He wrote between 35 and 38 plays, six lyric works and 154 sonnets (approximately) where finding little more than 700 references to medicine of those days is possible. For this reason, different scholars have analyzed the medical concepts within the Shakespearean literature; some agree that these may be the result of studies of his own, while others suggest that Shakespeare repeated the medical knowledge of some \"men of wisdom\" of his time. It should be mentioned that the author's contemporary London society lived in an overpopulated, nauseating, sexually promiscuous city that was plagued by pests and waste and continually besieged by epidemics whose treatments many times caused greater evil than benefit (for example, lead-based make-up). Some biographers credit syphilis, alcohol, and depression as the source of Shakespeare's creative production. Despite the myriad of authors who have analyzed the insinuations about medicine in Shakespeare's dramatic accounts, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is perhaps the most important; throughout his career he carried out a substantial analysis of the English playwright's works owing to his passion for literature and for this author."}, {"Title": "C957T-mediated Variation in Ligand Affinity Affects the Association between <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride Binding Potential and Cognition.", "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) system plays an important role in cognition. Accordingly, normal variation in DA genes has been found to predict individual differences in cognitive performance. However, little is known of the impact of genetic differences on the link between empirical indicators of the DA system and cognition in humans. The present work used PET with <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride to assess DA D2-receptor binding potential (BP) and links to episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed in 179 healthy adults aged 64-68 years. Previously, the T-allele of a DA D2-receptor single-nucleotide polymorphism, C957T, was associated with increased apparent affinity of <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride, giving rise to higher BP values despite similar receptor density values between allelic groups. Consequently, we hypothesized that <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride BP measures inflated by affinity rather than D2-receptor density in T-allele carriers would not be predictive of DA integrity and therefore prevent finding an association between <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride BP and cognitive performance. In accordance with previous findings, we show that <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride BP was increased in T-homozygotes. Importantly, <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride BP was only associated with cognitive performance in groups with low or average ligand affinity (C-allele carriers of C957T, n = 124), but not in the high-affinity group (T-homozygotes, n = 55). The strongest <sup>11</sup>C-raclopride BP-cognition associations and the highest level of performance were found in C-homozygotes.

Gut microbiota composition and function are influenced both by genetics, age, sex, diet, life experiences, and many other factors of psychiatric and bodily disorders and thus may act as potential biomarkers of the gut-brain axis that could be used in psychiatry and co-morbid conditions. There is a particular need in major depressive disorder and other mental illness to identify biomarkers that can stratify patients into more homogeneous groups to provide better treatment and for development of new therapeutic approaches. Peripheral outcome measures of host-microbe bidirectional communication have significant translational value as biomarkers. Enabling stratification of clinical populations, based on individual biological differences, to predict treatment response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Here we consider the links between co-morbid metabolic syndrome and depression, focusing on biomarkers including leptin and ghrelin in combination with assessing gut microbiota composition, as a potential tool to help identify individual differences in depressed population."}, {"Title": "Understanding and Predicting Antidepressant Response: Using Animal Models to Move Toward Precision Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There are two important gaps of knowledge in depression treatment, namely the lack of biomarkers predicting response to antidepressants and the limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinical improvement. However, individually tailored treatment strategies and individualized prescription are greatly needed given the huge socio-economic burden of depression, the latency until clinical improvement can be observed and the response variability to a particular compound. Still, individual patient-level antidepressant treatment outcomes are highly unpredictable. In contrast to other therapeutic areas and despite tremendous efforts during the past years, the genomics era so far has failed to provide biological or genetic predictors of clinical utility for routine use in depression treatment. Specifically, we suggest to (1) shift the focus from the group patterns to individual outcomes, (2) use dimensional classifications such as Research Domain Criteria, and (3) envision better planning and improved connections between pre-clinical and clinical studies within translational research units. In contrast to studies in patients, animal models enable both searches for peripheral biosignatures predicting treatment response and in depth-analyses of the neurobiological pathways shaping individual antidepressant response in the brain. While there is a considerable number of animal models available aiming at mimicking disease-like conditions such as those seen in depressive disorder, only a limited number of preclinical or truly translational investigations is dedicated to the issue of heterogeneity seen in response to antidepressant treatment. In this mini-review, we provide an overview on the current state of knowledge and propose a framework for successful translational studies into antidepressant treatment response."}, {"Title": "Psychopathology and coping mechanisms in parents of children with intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Raising a child with intellectual disability (ID) can add to parenting stress significantly. This stress can manifest into psychopathologies such as anxiety and depression. The aims of the study were to assess psychopathology and coping mechanisms in parents of children with ID.\nA total of 100 consecutive consenting parents of children with ID were interviewed from child psychiatry outpatient department of a municipal-run tertiary care teaching hospital. A semi-structured pro forma, symptom checklist 90 revised (SCL90R) and Mechanism of Coping Scale (MOCS) were used for assessment.\nMean age for the parents was 37.02 (\u00b17.35) years, and for the children, it was 8.29 (\u00b13.11) years. There were 60 mothers and 61 parents of a male child among sample. Eighty-five of parents considered their child's ID to be a major concern in their life. Depression had highest mean among psychopathologies. Mothers had higher score for depression and Interpersonal-sensitivity. Parental psychopathology did not differ significantly with severity of ID of child. Global severity index of SCL90R correlated negatively with age of parents (<i>P</i> = 0.015) and positively with fatalism (<i>P</i> = 0.004), expressive-action (<i>P</i> < 0.000) and passivity (<i>P</i> = 0.001) coping mechanisms.\nDepression is the most common psychopathology especially among mothers of child with ID. Psychopathology is independent of severity of ID and worsens with coping mechanisms like fatalism, expressive-action, and escape-avoidance. A child with ID should be seen and treated as a family unit giving enough attention to parent's psychological needs as well."}, {"Title": "Consultation-liaison psychiatry services: A survey of medical institutes in India.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and services in India.\nAn online survey was conducted involving at least one faculty member from the department of psychiatry working in various institutes providing postgraduate training in psychiatry.\nA total of 90 faculty members from different postgraduate institutes across the country participated in the online survey. In three-fourth of the institutes, the CLP services were provided in the form of on-call services with a three-tier system (i.e., CLP team comprising of faculty member, a senior resident, and a junior resident) existing in only about one-third of the institutes. In majority (60%) of the institutes, junior resident was the first-line person responding to the call of other specialists. On an average, CLP teams receive 7.33 calls per day from various clinical departments with a range of 0-20. Among the three most common psychiatric syndromes seen in CLP setting, delirium figured as one of the three most common diagnoses among 79 (87.8%) institutes, and this was followed by substance use disorders (70%), self-harm (60%), and depression (38.9%). Specific CLP posting for junior and senior residents exists only in 28.9% and 12.2% of the institutes, respectively. Joint academic activities with other departments are conducted in 42.2% of the institutes. Regarding research, very few research projects are carried out in the area of CLP. Majority of the participants felt that CLP should be given equal importance or more importance than other subspecialties such as child psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, and geriatric psychiatry in postgraduate training programs. Almost all the participants felt that having good knowledge of CLP helps in managing psychiatric patients in better way. All the participants reported that improving focus on CLP psychiatry will help in reducing stigma attached to mental illnesses and improve the training of postgraduates and the undergraduates.\nThere is a need to improve the CLP services, training program, and research in various medical institutes to provide good mental healthcare to medically ill patients."}, {"Title": "DARK Classics in Chemical Neuroscience: Opium, a Friend or Foe.", "Abstract": "Opium has found great use medicinally for its analgesic properties and has been witnessed as one of the most popular medications used in psychiatry.

The proportion of the study sample with comorbid opioid use disorder having received opioid replacement therapy prior to their forensic psychiatric treatment was compared to the available information of opioid dependent patients in general. The data were collected from forensic examination statements, patient files and other medical registers retrospectively.\nOf the study sample, 15.6% (23/148) had a history of opioid use disorder, of whom 8.7% (2/23) had received opioid replacement treatment (95% confidence interval (Cl): 1.1-28.0), even though opioid use disorder had been diagnosed in the treatment system. According the available information the corresponding proportion among patients with opioid use disorder and using substance use disorder services was 30.4% (565/1860, 95% Cl: 28.3-32.5). The fraction of patients receiving opioid replacement therapy was significantly lower among patients with schizophrenia (p\u00a0=\u20090.022).\nOpioid replacement therapy was seldom used among schizophrenia patients who were later ordered to involuntary forensic psychiatric treatment.

Autistic individuals with alexithymia could therefore represent a specific subgroup of autism who may benefit from tailored interventions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the nature and prevalence of alexithymia in autism using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS).\nOnline scientific databases were searched systematically for studies on ASD popu lations using the TAS. Meta-analyses were performed to evaluate differences in scores between the ASD and neurotypical groups, and to determine the prevalence of alexithymia in these populations.\n15 articles comparing autistic and neurotypical (NT) groups were identified. Autistic people scored significantly higher on all scores compared to the NT group. There was also a higher prevalence of alexithymia in the ASD group (49.93% compared to 4.89%), with a significantly increased risk of alexithymia in autistic participants.\nThis review highlights that alexithymia is common, rather than universal, in ASD, supporting a growing body of evidence that co-occurring autism and alexithymia represents a specific subgroup in the ASD population that may have specific clinical needs.

Because psychiatric interventions affect characteristics that seem central to who we are, they raise issues regarding identity, autonomy, and personal responsibility for one's own well-being. Our study addresses two questions: (1) Do the public and academic researchers understand the philosophical stakes of these technologies in the same way?

This study compares how ethical issues regarding neurosurgical and pharmaceutical psychiatric interventions are discussed among the public and in the professional community of academic medicine and bioethics.\nWe analyzed (1) online public comments and (2) the medical and bioethics literature, comparing the discussions of pharmacological and neurosurgical interventions in psychiatry in each source.\nOverall, the public discussed philosophical issues less frequently than academics. For the two types of psychiatric interventions, we found differences between the academic literature and public comments among all themes, except for personal responsibility.\nThese findings reveal some of the similarities and discrepancies in how philosophical issues associated with psychiatric treatments are discussed in professional circles and among the public.

With a noted black-box warning, rates of clozapine-induced myocarditis are reportedly as high as 3%. Since the first case of clozapine-induced myocarditis was documented in 1994, more than 250 cases have been described in literature with an approximate 33% case-fatality rate. We report 2 cases of patients with primary psychotic disorders treated with clozapine, who developed signs and symptoms of myocarditis. The first was a 35-year-old white male patient with a primary diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type) who was initiated on clozapine after nonresponse to several therapies. On day 26, the patient was admitted to the emergency department for chest pain presenting with eosinophilia and notable elevations in several biomarkers, including troponin and C-reactive protein. The second patient was a 45-year-old black male who was initiated on clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. On day 13, the patient reported cardiac-related concerns (tachycardia) and flu-like symptoms resulting in hospitalization. Similarly, this patient demonstrated elevated biomarkers (troponin and creatine kinase). Both patients experienced resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of clozapine. Clozapine was not rechallenged for either patient. Review of literature further elucidates the relationship between clozapine and myocarditis, including potential risk factors, pathophysiology, and symptom presentation. Due to the potentially fatal nature of this condition, clinical vigilance and awareness is warranted upon initiation of clozapine through monitoring of symptoms along with cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers as indicated."}, {"Title": "The use of pharmacogenetic testing in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetic testing may assist in identifying an individual's risk of developing a mental illness as well as predict an individual's response to treatment.

Genetic mapping has revealed genomic regions or, in a few cases, specific genes explaining part of this variation [Bendesky and Bargmann (2011) <i>Nat Rev Gen</i> 12:809-820]. However, the genetic basis of behavioral evolution remains unclear. Here we investigate the evolution of an innate extended phenotype, bower building, among cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi. Males build bowers of two types, pits or castles, to attract females for mating. We performed comparative genome-wide analyses of 20 bower-building species and found that these phenotypes have evolved multiple times with thousands of genetic variants strongly associated with this behavior, suggesting a polygenic architecture. Remarkably, F<sub>1</sub> hybrids of a pit-digging and a castle-building species perform sequential construction of first a pit and then a castle bower. Analysis of brain gene expression in these hybrids showed that genes near behavior-associated variants display behavior-dependent allele-specific expression with preferential expression of the pit-digging species allele during pit digging and of the castle-building species allele during castle building. These genes are highly enriched for functions related to neurodevelopment and neural plasticity. Our results suggest that natural behaviors are associated with complex genetic architectures that alter behavior via <i>cis</i>-regulatory differences whose effects on gene expression are specific to the behavior itself."}, {"Title": "\"Relaxed\" natural kinds and psychiatric classification.", "Abstract": "This paper starts out highlighting a particular criticism that psychiatry faces and continues by investigating approaches to classification in psychiatry that operate with a \"relaxed\" (non-essentialist) notion of natural kind.

The aim of this review is to demonstrate how <i>CYP2C19</i> mutations influence everyday patient treatment, leading to adverse drug reactions or therapy failure in many common diseases. <i>Methods</i>: A PubMed literature search was performed on clinical publications evaluating the impact of <i>CYP2C19</i> on pharmacotherapy outcome. Main fields of medicine with strong outcome dependency on the <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype were selected. We also focused on clinical recommendations for the use of drugs referring to <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism. <i>Results:</i> The fields of medicine where clinical outcome particularly depends on <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism are gastroenterology, cardiology, psychiatry, mycology and oncology. CYP2C19 is involved in proton pump inhibitors metabolism, thus it can influence reflux therapy, ulcer prevention and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication treatment. The CYP2C19 enzyme plays also a vital role in the two bioactivation steps of clopidogrel leading to lower (<i>CYP2C19*17</i> carriers) or higher (<i>CYP2C19*2</i> carriers) risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. It affects the antidepressant treatment and methadone replacement therapy as well as voriconazole prophylaxis. The presence of a *2 allele is associated with longer relapse-free time or better survival, and the *17 allele with more favorable outcomes in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. <i>Conclusions</i>: Knowledge of the <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism could positively affect individual treatment and lead to better patient outcomes in many cases.

The demand has been triggered by rising health costs and the economization of the field. The Internet has also made a considerable contribution to the demand for patient-initiated second opinions. Given these developments, it is surprising that second opinions have not become more important in the field of psychiatry. This article highlights the special situation of second opinions in psychiatry, discusses possible barriers to the adoption of second opinions in psychiatry, and the potential for greater use of second opinions in this field.\nIn psychiatry, second opinions have been neglected by the typical drivers of innovations in health care, including insurers and other commercial drivers as well as psychiatrists and patients themselves. This review identifies current barriers to widespread adoption of second opinions in psychiatric practice, discusses the benefits of second opinions that have been demonstrated in other disciplines, and outlines the potential gains to be realized through use of second opinions in psychiatry.\nLiterature in the area was reviewed through a search of the main medical databases. This literature review was supported by in-depth interviews with health care personnel and insurers.\nSecond opinions are rarely obtained in psychiatry and there is little literature on this subject. The stigmatization of psychiatric disorders and patients and the uniqueness of the patient-doctor relationship in psychiatry, especially in psychotherapeutic care, may pose considerable obstacles to the use of second opinions in this field. In addition, more stakeholders, such as social workers, government agencies and regulators, health care and disability insurers, and social security agencies, are involved in the mental health compared with the somatic health sector, which may make it more difficult to achieve a coordinated approach in psychiatric care. However, we have found no convincingly good reason why second opinions have not been at least discussed in psychiatry.

The authors examined how frequently the same drugs appeared in these different bins in 19 patients. They found that of the 22 antidepressants evaluated, 2 were virtually always (>90%) in the green bin: desvenlafaxine and levomilnacipran; and 8 were almost never (\u226410.5%) in the green bin: citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Of the 16 antipsychotics evaluated, they found that 4 were virtually always (>90%) in the green bin: asenapine, lurasidone, paliperidone, and ziprasidone; and 2 were almost never (\u226410.5%) in the green bin: chlorpromazine and thioridazine. What was common among those drugs almost always in the green bin versus those almost never in the green bin were newer versus older marketed drugs and those not dependent versus dependent on oxidative metabolism for their clearance.

However, empirical evidence describing the scope of unsafe experiences is limited. While evidence-based inpatient psychiatry requires care to be trauma-informed, market failures and a lack of payment alignment with patient-centered care leave patients vulnerable to harm. Existing regulatory mechanisms attempt to provide accountability; however, these mechanisms are imperfect. Furthermore, research is sparse. Few health services researchers study inpatient psychiatry, the issue has not been a priority among research funders, and data on inpatient psychiatry is excluded from national surveys of quality.

The first section describes early attempts to purposefully integrate music into Viennese psychiatry and highlights the groundbreaking work of Bruno Goergen (1777-1842), who around the year 1820 deliberately incorporated music into psychiatric institutions based on his dedication to the ideals of \"moral treatment\" and \"no-restraint\" psychiatry. Shortly thereafter, the first medical dissertations on the therapeutic effect of music began to be published in Vienna. Around 1850, the emergence of an \"active\" form of \"music therapy\" (in the broadest sense) is recognizable; during the same time period, physicians began taking their patients' musical preferences, education, and disposition into account. However, as university medicine became firmly rooted in the standards of experimental science, physicians increasingly lost their interest in music. The second section gives an overview of several cultural movements that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century and inspired the pioneers of music therapy in Vienna, paving the way for the foundation of modern Viennese music therapy in 1958. Among these were the life reform movement, the curative rhythm and dance movement, and anthroposophy, as well as psychotherapy and progressive music-educational concepts.

Studies have demonstrated that perceptual biases towards noticing these phenomena plays a role, but the way one thinks about one's experience (metacognition) may also be relevant. While poor metacognitive function has been theoretically associated with anomalous experiences, this relationship is currently unclear. However, metacognition may work along a continuum with various metacognitive levels, many of which have been demonstrated as impaired in psychosis. These metacognitive components may interact via processes that maintain poor metacognition across levels, and that potentially impact both what people do in their everyday lives (functional outcome) and how people feel about their everyday lives (subjective recovery outcome) in young people with psychosis compared with healthy control participants.\nThis study will investigate the association and contribution of metacognition to anomalous experiences and outcome measures cross-sectionally and longitudinally in a 36-month follow-up. First, young people with psychosis will be compared with healthy control participants on selected measures of anomalous experience, metacognition, and function, using analysis of covariance to identify group differences. Next, the relationship between metacognitive components and processes will be explored, including processes connecting the different components, using regression analyses. Finally, mediation analyses will be used to assess the predictive value of metacognitive measures on outcome measures, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally at 36\u2009months, while controlling for symptoms and cognition.\nEthical and Health Research Authority approval has been obtained through Camberwell St. Giles Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 17/LO/0055).

Some CRSD are particularly frequent such as sleep delayed phase syndrome in adolescents. Overall, CRSD are probably under-diagnosed. CRSD generate insomnia and excessive daytime somnolence. A biological clock dysfunction has to be evoked in case of insomnia or sleepiness. Furthermore, as CRSD can overlap with other sleep disorders, their diagnosis and treatment are essential. CRSD cause significant mental, physical or socio-professional sufferings. They are frequently associated with comorbidities, mainly neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Regarding neurodevelopmental comorbidities, therapy using a chronobiological approach is complementary to the usual clinical care. It helps to limit the significant impact of CRSD on quality of live, daytime functioning, social interactions and neurocognitive difficulties in the children. In psychiatry, sleep disorders and circadian rhythms sleep-wake disorders are a factor of vulnerability, of suicidal risk, of relapse and pharmacoresistance. Thus, diagnosis of CRSD associated with a psychiatric disorder is of major importance. Treatment using a chronobiological approach reinforcing the entrainment of the sleep-wake cycle is complementary to usual treatments. Sleep disorders and circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders can be a preclinical sign of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the elderly, a beginning neurodegenerative disorder can be associated with a CRSD and complaints of sleepiness, nocturnal awakenings and/or irregular sleep-wake cycles. Patients affected by neurogenerative disorders are particularly vulnerable for having CRSD. Data from different studies suggest that CRSD participate in pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Even though treatment of CRSD associated with neurodegenerative disorders is entirely part of the treatment strategy, it remains uncertain to which extend this treatment may impact disease progression."}, {"Title": "The effect of patients' feedback on treatment outcome in a child and adolescent psychiatric sample: a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "The systematic use of feedback from patients on treatment progress and treatment satisfaction is a promising method to increase treatment effectiveness. The extent to which this also applies to the treatment of children with severe psychiatric problems is not clear. We conducted a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to study the effect of adding Feedback Informed Treatment (FIT) to care as usual in a child psychiatric sample. Quality of Life (QoL) was used as the primary outcome measure and symptom severity as the second. Fifty-one therapists from eight Autism Care Teams in a multi-center facility for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Karakter) participated and were cluster randomized to the FIT condition (n\u2009=\u20094 teams) or the Care as Usual (CAU) condition (n\u2009=\u20094 teams). Children aged 6-18\u00a0years, mainly with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and treated in one of the Autism Care Teams were allocated to the FIT condition (n\u2009=\u200986) or the CAU condition (n\u2009=\u200980).

No additional effects were observed for symptom severity decrease [F (2,158)\u2009=\u20090.19, p\u2009=\u20090.825]. No interaction with time was found for QoL nor symptom severity. Adding FIT in a child psychiatric setting may increase QoL, but does not appear to decrease symptom severity as compared with CAU. It is suggested that FIT positively changes parents' expectations.

When evidence was limited, expert consensus was used. A standardized, iterative approach was utilized to create clinical pathways. Stakeholders reviewed initial drafts. Feedback was incorporated into the final pathway.\nClinical pathways were created for suicide risk screening in pediatric EDs and inpatient medical/surgical units. The pathway outlines a 3-tiered screening process utilizing the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions for initial screening, followed by a brief suicide safety assessment to determine if a full suicide risk assessment is warranted. This essential step helps conserve resources and decide upon appropriate interventions for each patient who screens positive.

In order to find generic patterns in huge neurobiological data sets and by exploring formal brain models, <i>non-linear science</i> offers many examples of fruitful insights into the complex dynamics of neuronal information processing. However, it should be minded that neurobiology neither can bridge the explanatory gap between brain and mind nor can substitute psychological and psychiatric categories and knowledge. For instance, volition is impaired in many mental disorders. In experimental setups, a \"preactional\" <i>brain potential</i> was discovered that occurs 0.5\u2009s <i>before a consciously evoked motor action</i>. Neglecting the specific experimental conditions, this finding was over-interpreted as the empirical falsification of the philosophical (!) concept of \"free volition/will.\" In contrast, the psychology of volition works with models that are composed of several stage-related hierarchically nested mental process cycles that were never tested in obviously \"theory-free\" neurobiology. As currently neurobiology shows a <i>network turn</i> (or systemic turn), this is one good reason to enhance systemic approaches in <i>theoretical psychology</i>, independently from neurobiology that still lacks \"theory.\" Cybernetic control loop models and system models should be integrated and elaborated and in turn could give new impulses to neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry that conceptually can more easily connect to a network-oriented neurobiology.

However, whereas in depression mood is low, mainly anticipatory anhedonia can be found in negative symptoms. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) show greater expressive deficits than those with Major Depressive Episode (MDE). We investigated if measures of depressive and negative symptoms differentiate SCZ subjects, subjects with MDE, and healthy controls (HC). 21 SCZ, 22 MDE, and 25 HC subjects were examined with a rater assessment and a self-rating for negative symptoms (Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS); Motivation and Pleasure - Self-Report (MAP-SR)) and depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17); Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)). All measures differentiated the psychiatric samples from HC (all p's < 0.01). The ratings of depressive symptoms (HAMD-17, BDI) and rater assessment of negative symptoms (CAINS) - specifically its sub scale measuring expressive deficits - managed to discriminate between subjects with schizophrenia and those with MDE (SCZ\u2009>\u2009MDE > HC for negative, MDE\u2009>\u2009SCZ > HC for depressive symptoms, all p's < 0.05). The self-rating of negative symptoms (MAP-SR) did not. To differentiate negative symptoms and depression clinicians might look for (self-)reported low mood and observer-rated reduction in speech as well as in gestures and facial expression. Reduced expression and moderate levels of depression point towards a negative syndrome, whereas mostly unimpaired expression and high scores of self-reported depressive symptoms are more likely to indicate a depressive syndrome."}, {"Title": "A cross-sectional comparative study of perceived stigma between patients with epilepsy and patients living with HIV/AIDS in Accra, Ghana.", "Abstract": "Health-related stigma is a great challenge to the treatment of diseases. In epilepsy like other conditions, it causes affected individuals to conceal their illness. In this study, we described stigma perceived by patients with epilepsy at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), a tertiary referral facility, and the Accra Psychiatry Hospital in Ghana (APH). We then compared the perception of stigma in patients with epilepsy to stigma perceived by persons living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (PLWHA), a chronic communicable disease stigmatized in Ghana.\nA total of 351 patients with epilepsy were recruited from both sites by systematic random sampling and interviewed. The Kilifi Stigma Scale for Epilepsy was used to determine individual patient's stigma score. Statistical analysis was done using multiple logistic regression analysis to control for the effect of measured independent variables that were significant on univariate analysis: age, gender, marital status, income, type of epilepsy, and the frequency of seizures, on the outcome variable. Comparative analysis of the mean stigma score in patients with epilepsy and persons living with HIV/AIDS was done using the Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank sum test).\nThe presence of perceived stigma using the Kilifi Stigma Score Estimation was 32.02% (62), 33.33% (49), and 28.88% (54) among respondents from KBTH, APH, and PLWHA respectively.

Medications should always be used as an adjunct to behavioural and environmental modification.\nMany psychoactive medications cannot be used in the face of certain physical illnesses or concurrently with other medications. Some medications may also have side effects, not be effective at the recommended dose or have a paradoxical effect. Furthermore, success is reliant on the owner being able to administer the medication.\nThis article aims to guide practitioners by discussing questions such as how to choose the appropriate medication, how to dose it and how long to use it. The psychoactive medications most commonly used in feline medicine are reviewed, as well as some that are newer or less common.\nData for the use of medications in cats is limited, with just a small number of clinical-, species- and problem-directed studies available, and a few more case series and case reports. Where feline-specific research is not available, the authors have drawn upon research published in other species, such as humans, dogs and rats, as well as anecdotal reports and expert opinions."}, {"Title": "Voter participation among people attending mental health services in Ireland.", "Abstract": "People with mental illness experience social and political exclusion but there is limited understanding of voting behaviour in this population.\nThis study assessed voter participation and attitudes towards voting among people attending mental health services in Dublin, Ireland.\nPsychiatry outpatients and inpatients were studied over2\u00a0months following Ireland's 2016 general election (n\u2009=\u2009117).

Forty-one percent had insufficient information about voting: the most common information deficits related to voting rights (31.6%) and voting in hospital (18.8%). Inpatients (20.0%) were substantially less likely to vote than outpatients (63.2%). Majorities endorsed the importance of people with mental illness voting. The most common reasons for not voting were being in hospital (32.1%) and not being registered (30.4%).\nPoliticians should note that a majority of people with mental illness are outpatients and a significant proportion vote.

We here report a case of self-induced bullous lesions on the shoulder in an adolescent with major depression and suicidal ideations. The study involved a 22-year old man, who was a chronic smoker, an occasional user of cannabis and alchool with no particular past medical history, with divorced parents, in conflict with his father. He presented with bullous eruption on the left shoulder made of bubbles, post-bullous skin erosions and scabs on a healthy skin. The monomorphic appearance of lesions, their accessibility (on the left shoulder in a right-handed patient), patient's history and his psychiatric problems have immediately suggested the investigation of self-induced dermatosis or factitious disorder. The patient admitted that he had taken psychotropic drugs and that the self-induced lesions had been caused by cigarette burns. This first psichologic evaluation also showed that the patient had suicidal ideations and a self-and hetero-aggressive behavior. The patient was treated with emollients and healing creams and referred to the Department of Psychiatry for complementary therapies."}, {"Title": "Lipidomics in Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Omic sciences coupled with novel computational approaches such as machine intelligence offer completely new approaches to major depressive disorder (MDD) research.

Lipidomics, as a late-comer among other omic fields, is increasingly being recognized in psychiatric research because it has allowed the investigation of global lipid perturbations in patients suffering from MDD and indicated a crucial role of specific patterns of lipid alterations in the development and progression of MDD. Combinatorial lipid-markers with high classification power are being developed in order to assist MDD diagnosis, while rodent models of depression reveal lipidome changes and thereby unveil novel treatment targets for depression.

The Enqu\u00eate Commission \"Psychiatry\" of the Federal Government, followed by the Model Program \"Psychiatry\", the Staff Regulations for Psychiatry, the Agreement on the Social Psychiatry and the Psychotherapy Act have had significant impact on the care for psychiatrically ill children and adolescents and their families. This led to an institutional anchoring of new structures, covering three of the four leading principles of the Model Program, namely integration into medicine, community-based and appropriate care. Equality of psychiatric patients with other patient groups has, nevertheless, not yet been achieved and is still to be claimed. Current and future challenges are: (1) The realistic evaluation of new research methods and epochal trends and elimination of opposites, (2) the establishment of future-oriented research initiatives, (3) the intensive promotion of clinical and scientific staff members, and (4) a renewed attention for the subjective perspective of the illness. \ufeffConclusions:\ufeff The implementation of an independent specialty \"child and adolescent psychiatry\" was an important stimulus for the further development of the discipline. Essential demands for the future will be: the integration of CAP into the curriculum for medical students and the promotion of young researchers within the scope of regional and supra-regional projects."}, {"Title": "Renaming schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The movement towards renaming of schizophrenia in Japan started in 1993 upon receipt of a letter by The National Federation of Families with Mentally Ill in Japan addressed to the board of Japanese Society of Psychiatry of Neurology (JSPN), requesting to rename schizophrenia as the then-official term for the condition, Seishin-Bunretsu-Byo, or 'mind-splitting disease', was humiliating.

The survey addressed psychiatrists' experiences of and attitudes toward different types of advance statements, including psychiatric advance statements written by patients without any specific assistance, and joint crisis plans ( 'Behandlungsvereinbarungen'), where involvement of the clinical team is required. A total of 396 responded.\nResults suggest that generally speaking, respondents held favorable views on joint crisis plans for mental health care. In all, 80.7% of participants agreed that more frequent use of joint crisis plans in clinical practice would be desirable. However, clinicians' attitudes differ largely depending on the type of advance statement.

We arrange three major parameter estimation methods in a two-dimensional bias parameter space (prior and likelihood), of the biased Bayesian inference. Then, we discuss a neural implementation of the biased Bayesian inference on the basis of changes in weights in neural connections, which we regarded as a combination of leaky/unstable neural integrator and probabilistic population coding.

Training to become a psychiatrist involves considerable exposure to medicolegal matters, and psychiatry residents frequently participate in high-stakes legal hearings concerning their patients. Although psychiatry residents are physicians, residents are also trainees who may lack full medical licensure, board certification, or basic preparation to testify in legal settings. Legal hearings are important educational experiences for psychiatrists-in-training, but these proceedings can upend traditional patient-doctor relationships and pose ethics challenges to trainees. In this article, I examine ways in which residency programs can prepare budding psychiatrists for legal testimony.

Forensic clinical experiences during psychiatry residency are important for preparing future general psychiatrists for practice with justice-involved patients, generating interest in forensic psychiatry, and easing the transition from \"healer to evaluator\" for future fellows. Unfortunately, residency programs interested in expanding their forensic training may face many challenges because of current regulatory frameworks, the nature of forensic practice, and competing demands within residency training programs.

Low self-efficacy has been examined as a risk indicator for suicidal behaviors. The Self-Efficacy to Avoid Suicidal Action (SEASA) scale assesses self-efficacy to resist suicidal urges and was originally evaluated in a sample of adults receiving treatment for substance use disorders. The goal of this study was to explore the link between suicide ideation and self-efficacy to avoid suicidal action among a high-risk group of psychiatric inpatients. Military personnel psychiatrically hospitalized following a suicide-related event (N\u202f=\u202f139) completed a modified version of the SEASA and provided a full history of suicidal behaviors. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. Severity of worst time point suicide ideation, endorsement of any current suicide ideation, and history of multiple lifetime suicide attempts were associated with lower self-efficacy to avoid suicidal action. Self-efficacy to avoid engagement in suicidal action is a belief that can be strengthened and practiced within evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavior therapy for suicide prevention. Thus, providers are encouraged to target this type of self-efficacy in case conceptualization and treatment planning.

Outcome measures were heterogeneous, and frequently did not use standardised metrics assessing agitation level to measure effectiveness. The single small Randomized Controlled Trial (RTC) does not find a difference between placebo and medication, and outcomes of other studies do not control for potential placebo effect of the intervention itself as opposed to the medication. There is insufficient evidence to support the common practice of PRN medications for the management of acute agitation, and no data with which to inform clinical practice, such as which medicines and doses are helpful for specific populations or situations.

Gamification has been considered for cognitive bias modification, mainly to address the core issues of diminishing motivation to train over time, as bias modification intervention tasks tend to be highly repetitive. While a prior review has suggested how gamification strategies could be applied to such tasks, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of gamified cognitive bias modification interventions in the literature.\nThe objective of this review is to understand the overall effectiveness of a gamified approach for cognitive bias modification and inform future research that seeks to integrate gamification technologies into existing conventional bias modification interventions.\nTo identify the relevant articles for our review, the following search terminologies were used: (\"cognitive bias\" OR \"attention bias\" OR \"interpret* bias\" OR \"approach bias\" OR \"avoidance bias\") AND (\"training\" OR \"modification\" OR \"practice\" OR \"therapy\") AND (\"gamification\" OR \"game elements\" OR \"game\" OR \"gaming\" OR \"game mechanics\").

Articles were included if they described a gamified cognitive bias modification task and included participants with underlying psychopathological symptoms. Data were systematically extracted from the identified articles, and a qualitative synthesis was performed.\nFour studies evaluated gamified cognitive bias modification interventions. Two studies included participants with anxiety symptoms, one with affective symptoms, and one with alcohol problems. The conventional visual probe task paradigm was used in 3 studies, and the attentional visual search task paradigm was used in the last study. We found gaming elements incorporated to include that of animations, sounds, feedback, and a point-scoring system for response time and difficulty. Of the 4 identified studies, only 2 reported their gamified interventions to be effective.\nOur review is the first to systematically synthesize the evidence for gamified cognitive bias modification interventions.

Although a diagnosis is often indicated, it is difficult to confirm and treatment is complicated. Dermatitis artefacta is the somatic expression of an often serious psychiatric disorder consciously created by patients on their own cutaneous-mucosal surfaces but the motivation is unconscious and no secondary benefits are sought (in contrast to simulation). Pathomimicry represent a specific entity: the provocation of outbreaks of a known disease, triggered by voluntary exposure to a causative agent. Herein we report on a case of pathomimicry in a context of hidradenitis suppurativa.\nA teenage girl whose main previous medical history consisted of grade-2 obesity and an episode of pubic abscess was seen at our clinic for axillary lesions. She presented in a state of negligence, was suspicious and aggressive, and refused to undress. After gaining her trust, clinical examination revealed prominent ulcerations (each with a granulated base) at a distance from the folds in the axillary areas, as well as typical hidradenitis lesions of Hurley Grade 2 with purulent openings and rope-like scars from the inguinal folds. Hospitalization was recommended and a positive outcome was achieved under antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, topical alginate and hydrocellular dressings. A psychiatric evaluation concluded that the patient was presenting dysmorphophobic narcissistic weakness, probably in reaction to recurrent harassment at school since childhood. Once she developed trust with us, which was difficult to establish, the patient admitted to having caused the lesions herself. Given the history and clinical data, as well as the negative laboratory tests, a diagnosis of pathomimicry was made.\nSeveral cases of dermatological pathomimicry (sustainment by the patient of an ulcer with a known cause, contact with an allergen found in eczema, or renewed use of a medication implicated in toxiderma) or systemic disease (insulin injection in a diabetic patient) have been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of pathomimicry associated with hidradenitis suppurativa. Regarding therapy, aftercare should be multidisciplinary. Confessions should not be forced and confrontations, which risk serious psychiatric collapse, should be avoided. A reassuring attitude enables psychiatry to be applied once trust has been sustainably established, hence the crucial role of the dermatologist."}, {"Title": "Health concerns of veterans with high-level lower extremity amputations.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to identify health concerns of veterans with high-level lower extremity amputations.\nThrough a cross-sectional study, general practitioners, an orthopedic specialist, psychologists, psychiatrists, physiotherapist and prosthetists examined 100 veterans using a short-form health-related quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) that assessed their ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and life satisfaction (SWLS) after hip disarticulation or hemi-pelvectomy amputations.

Analysis was by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and interaction analysis. In the intervention the components of the enhanced communication were a) weekly meetings between care managers (CMs) and GPs and b) group supervision of GPs by a psychiatrist. This study showed that the meetings between CMs and GPs were enacted very differently across clinics, with communication ranging from monological 'giving report'-style to more dialogical 'peer-discussion'-style with development of new shared knowledge. The type of communication depended on the GP's professional style. The supervision element was not perceived as being meaningful and GPs reacted by non-attendance and non-response.

The first time AD medication purchases of 7,093 cancer patients aged 0-34 years at diagnosis and a sibling cohort (N = 26,882) were retrieved from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) since 1.1.1993. Cancer patients diagnosed between 1.1.1994 and 31.12.2004 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry and sibling controls via the Population Registry Centre. Statistical analyses were performed via the Cox regression model, and the hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted for age and gender. Increased hazard ratios for AD purchases were found in the younger (0-19 years at cancer diagnosis) [HR 5.2, 95%CI (3.7-7.2)] and older (age 20-34 years at cancer diagnosis) [HR 4.5, 95%CI (3.9-5.2)] cancer patient groups compared to siblings.

Pearson's chi-square test and independent sample <i>t</i>-test were used for categorical and continuous data, respectively.\nMDD prevalence rate was highest in lung cancer (11.5%), followed by breast (10.3%), colorectal (8.1%), and prostate cancer (4.9%). Within colorectal and lung cancer groups, patients with MDD were significantly older (>80 years, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than non-MDD patients. Breast, lung, and colorectal cancer showed a higher proportion of female and Caucasian in the MDD group. Severe morbidity was seen in a greater proportion of the MDD group in all cancer types.

Further studies of each cancer type are needed to expand our understanding of the different risk factors for depression as a higher proportion of patients had severe morbidity."}, {"Title": "Jaspers' Phenomenology.", "Abstract": "Karl Jaspers published the first edition of 'General Psychopathology' in 1913. Now, coinciding with its 100th anniversary whose importance was consecrated through multiple congresses, we see a parallelism and a return to the dilemma of the 'Methodenstreit', which led Karl Jaspers to introduce the phenomenological method for psychopathology to understand the subjective manifestations of the mind. Phenomenology is part of the research and clinical methods in psychiatry and psychology as a way to capture the subjective in psychopathology. However, phenomenology is nowadays wrongly used. In this article, we attempt to rediscover and present in a clear way the origins and meaning of Jaspers' phenomenology, whose bases, although forgotten, remain current. This will be done by revising its fundamental concepts such as objective and subjective manifestations, understanding and its four types, causal explanation, empathy, intuition, presuppositions and preconceptions, phenomenological description and comprehensive 'seeing'."}, {"Title": "Ultra-high-risk paradigm: lessons learnt and new directions.", "Abstract": "Within the embryonic early psychosis field in the early 1990s, the conceptualisation and definition of an at-risk or ultra-high-risk (UHR) mental state for psychosis was a breakthrough which transformed the clinical and research landscape in psychiatry. Twenty-five years later, we have a new evidence base that has illuminated the neurobiology of the onset phase of psychotic disorder, delivered Cochrane level 1 evidence showing that the onset of full-threshold sustained psychotic disorder can be at least delayed, and is paving the way to a new generation of transdiagnostic research. Here, we document the contribution of the UHR approach to understanding the underlying mechanisms of psychosis onset as well as the long-term outcomes. Particularly, we highlight that psychosis onset can be delayed in those meeting UHR criteria and that these criteria have a higher valence for subsequent psychotic disorders and some valence for persistent non-psychotic syndromes. Critiques have helped to identify some of the limitations of this paradigm, which are acknowledged. These include evidence that psychotic disorders can emerge more acutely and from other, as yet undefined, precursor states. Rather than defending, or alternatively questioning the value of, the UHR approach, we propose a broader, transdiagnostic staging model that is consistent with the pluripotent and variably comorbid trajectories for mental disorders. This approach moves beyond psychosis to capture a wider range of subthreshold symptoms and full-threshold disorders, thus enhancing prediction for the emergence and progression of a range of mental disorders, as well as providing new avenues for early intervention and prevention."}, {"Title": "The pursuit of the magic pill: the overuse of psychotropic medications in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the USA.", "Abstract": "Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are likely to receive high-risk prescribing practices, such as polypharmacy, long-term use of psychotropic medications, and overuse of antipsychotics.

A co-produced mixed methods online survey.", "Abstract": "Utility scores are integral to health economics decision-making. Typically, utility scores have not been scored or developed with mental health service users. The aims of this study were to i) collaborate with service users to develop descriptions of five mental health states (psychosis, depression, eating disorder, medication side effects and self-harm); ii) explore feasibility and acceptability of using scenario-based health states in an e-survey; iii) evaluate which utility measures (standard gamble (SG), time trade off (TTO) and rating scale (RS)) are preferred; and iv) determine how different participant groups discriminate between the health scenarios and rank them.\nThis was a co-produced mixed methods cross-sectional online survey. Utility scores were generated using the SG, TTO and RS methods; difficulty of the completing each method, markers of acceptability and participants' preference were also assessed.\nA total of 119 participants (58%) fully completed the survey. For any given health state, SG consistently generated higher utility scores compared to RS and for some health states higher also than TTO (i.e. SG produces inflated utility scores relative to RS and TTO). Results suggest that different utility measures produce different evaluations of described health states. The TTO was preferred by all participant groups over the SG. The three participant groups scored four (of five) health scenarios comparably. Psychosis scored as the worst health state to live with while medication side-effects were viewed more positively than other scenarios (depression, eating disorders, self-harm) by all participant groups. However, there was a difference in how the depression scenario was scored, with service users giving depression a lower utility score compared to other groups.\nMental health state scenarios used to generate utility scores can be co-produced and are well received by a broad range of participants. Utility valuations using SG, TTO and RS were feasible for use with service users, carers, healthcare professionals and members of the general public. Future studies of utility scores in psychiatry should aim to include mental health service users as both co-investigators and respondents."}, {"Title": "Patient-centered Approach in Closed Psychiatric Wards: The Curative Power of Relaxing Music Chosen by Patients.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is changing as medicine adopts a patient-centered approach. This model of care places greater emphasis on the patients' involvement in determining the goals of their treatment and the nature of their care. This study offers a non-verbal patient-centered intervention by using relaxing music chosen by patients in a closed psychiatric ward to achieve reduction in levels of stress and psychomotor agitation.\nParticipants, patients in closed wards, entered a seclusion room whenever they showed psychomotor agitation, overwhelming stress or physical and verbal aggression. While in the seclusion room, participants in the research group (n=24) were exposed to relaxing music of their choice whereas the comparative group (n=28) did not receive any sensory stimulation. The participants filled out the Visual Analogue Scale to measure their emotional state before and after this experience while the staff filled out the Behavioral Activity Rating Scale.\nResults show significantly higher emotional calm and prominent reduction in psychomotor agitation among the research group in comparison with the comparative group.\nRelaxing music chosen by patients has a positive effect on their emotional state and behavioral activity and may therefore serve as an alternative sensory intervention before patients reach violent situations that require restraint."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' Media Involvement: A Survey of Attitudes.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists may face challenging core medical ethics questions since the media encourages their assistance and participation at various levels.

Moreover, the attitudes of different parts of mental health staff still need to be explored. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards ECT of mental health staff in different disciplines.\nA multi-group comparative study used questionnaires translated from several similar studies; 120 questionnaires were distributed equally to four groups of professionals in mental health centers in Beer Yaakov - Ness Ziona Complex: psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and social workers. The questionnaires aimed to measure knowledge and attitude towards ECT treatment.\nThe questionnaires showed significant differences in knowledge, subjective knowledge and, respectively, attitudes. Psychiatrists and nursing staff demonstrated higher knowledge and more positive approaches compared with social workers and psychologists. No significant differences were found between the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatrists, psychiatry residents and nursing staff.\nThe mental health sector can serve as an indicator of the level of knowledge and attitude towards ECT treatment. It is necessary to recognize the differences between various sectors and to deepen our knowledge regarding this treatment to all sectors, especially social workers and psychologists."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with long length of stay in an inpatient psychiatric unit in Lilongwe, Malawi.", "Abstract": "Studies of factors affecting length of stay during psychiatric hospitalization in sub-Saharan Africa are sparse. A better understanding of such factors may lead to interventions resulting in quicker patient stabilization and discharge, freeing up needed psychiatric beds and reducing health care system expenditures. Therefore, we sought to identify factors associated with long length of stay in Malawi.\nWe reviewed the charts of 417 patients hospitalized at Kamuzu Central Hospital's Bwaila Psychiatric Unit in Lilongwe, Malawi from January 1 to December 31, 2011. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to test for associations between patient factors and long length of stay (defined as more than 28 days).\nMean length of stay was 22.08\u2009\u00b1\u200927.70 days (range 0-243). 21.82% (91/417) of patients stayed longer than 28 days. Long length of stay was associated with living outside of Lilongwe district [aOR: 3.65 (1.66-8.01), p\u2009=\u20090.001] and treatment for antipsychotic extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) during hospitalization [aOR: 3.45 (1.32-9.03), p\u2009=\u20090.012].

This is unfortunate since emotion and affect are fundamental components of many psychiatric conditions. Rectifying this lack of interdisciplinary integration could thus be a potential avenue for improving psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. In this contribution, we propose and discuss an ontological framework for explicitly capturing the complex interrelations between affective entities and psychiatric disorders, in order to facilitate mapping and integration between affective science and psychiatric diagnostics. We build on and enhance the categorisation of emotion, affect and mood within the previously developed Emotion Ontology, and that of psychiatric disorders in the Mental Disease Ontology. This effort further draws on developments in formal ontology regarding the distinction between normal and abnormal in order to formalize the interconnections. This operational semantic framework is relevant for applications including clarifying psychiatric diagnostic categories, clinical information systems, and the integration and translation of research results across disciplines."}, {"Title": "Internalized stigma and its correlates among patients with severe mental illness.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the perceived level of internalized stigma among patients with severe mental illnesses and its relationship with demographic and clinical variables in Poland.\nA study sample (n=114, mean age=42.46\u00b114.1 years; 55% of females) consisting of patients with nonorganic psychotic disorders as well as unipolar and bipolar affective disorders was evaluated (58% of outpatients and 39% of inpatients). All patients filled in the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale (maximum severity=4). The demographic and clinical data were collected.\nThe study population demonstrated a mild level of internalized stigma (2.23\u00b10.5). The highest score was observed in the alienation domain (2.63\u00b10.8) and reflected moderate severity. The lowest score was noted in the stereotype endorsement domain (2.08\u00b10.6). Moreover, the highest degree of internalized stigma was present in participants with unipolar affective disorder and was of moderate severity (2.46\u00b10.6), while the level was moderate in the alienation domain (2.85\u00b10.8). The level of vocational training education was the only variable associated with higher internalized stigma (<i>P</i>=0.02). There were no associations between gender, employment, and marital status and internalized stigma. The duration of the disease was the only clinical factor showing a significant positive correlation with stigma internalization (<i>r</i>=0.23; <i>P</i>=0.01). The number of hospital admissions and suicide attempts was not significantly correlated with internalized stigma.\nPeople with severe mental illnesses in Poland experience a mild level of self-reported internalized stigma. Internalized stigmatization was most strongly associated with alienation, which indicates the need for stigma assessment procedures followed by stigma intervention programs in daily clinical practice. This is in accordance with the trend of environmental \"open door\" psychiatry, which could be the first step to decrease the level of stigma and internalized stigma in psychiatric patients in Poland."}, {"Title": "Postseizure aphasia in Wernicke's encephalopathy: a case report and review of literature.", "Abstract": "This case discusses the course of a woman with a history of epilepsy, alcohol use disorder, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, and Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) who presented with altered mental status following approximately 48 hours of vomiting. After experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure in the emergency department, she developed a fluent aphasia. Aphasias are ordinarily attributed to structural changes in the brain parenchyma, often from stroke, neoplasm, or infection. When the magnetic resonance imaging of brain failed to show changes that could explain her fluent aphasia, the neurology team consulted psychiatry to workup psychogenic aphasia. During an admission 9 months earlier, she had been diagnosed with HSV encephalitis and possible WE. There was a high degree of suspicion for recurrent HSV infection, intermittent focal seizure activity, postictal psychosis, pseudobulbar affect, or a vascular cause of her fluent aphasia. After 3 days of treatment with levetiracetam, high-dose intravenous thiamine, and aripiprazole, the patient's fluent aphasia reversed. The authors conclude that the patient's reversible fluent aphasia was not psychiatric in etiology but likely caused by her seizures, the result of subtherapeutic phenytoin levels; her electroencephalogram showed focal seizure activity in the temporal lobes, possibly affecting her language centers. Language-related neurological conditions, or aphasias, can mimic psychiatric conditions such as conversion disorder or psychosis. In patients with substance use disorders, the line between psychiatric and neurological conditions becomes even more difficult to distinguish. The paper also discusses how unique aspects of her medications - levetiracetam conferring neuron membrane fluidity; aripiprazole, a drug shown to halt brain atrophy in mouse models; and parenteral thiamine to address her deficiency and WE - have aided in the reversal of the fluent aphasia. Levetiracetam should be considered in WE and the rare occurrence of aphasia after seizures."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and circadian rhythms].", "Abstract": "Circadian and seasonal rhythm disturbances are prominent in patients with psychiatric disorders.

Studies show that implementing an assessment tool could potentially prevent or decrease the number of episodes of mechanical restraint. This study aims to examine the association between use of the Danish assessment tool for psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with mania (MAS-M) and mechanical restraint to highlight if number, type, and duration of restraint could be prevented or reduced by this procedure.\nThis historical cohort study included psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and hospitalized with symptoms of mania at the departments of affective disorders during the years 2012-2015. Logistic regression was used in the statistical analyses.\nA total of 218 patients were included, 74 of whom were scored with MAS-M. Thirty-five episodes of mechanical restraint were recorded. A crude OR of 1.58 (95% CI: 0.75-3.30) of the association was estimated. The study showed a tendency toward patients scored with MAS-M being more frequently restrained with both belt and straps, however, in shorter duration, compared to the control group.\nThis study reported relevant clinical information concerning staff's use of MAS-M, however, did not show a significant association between the use of MAS-M and mechanical restraint.

Sociodemographic and background variables, illness and symptom severity, insight, social anhedonia, self-esteem, perceived social support, and satisfaction with quality of life were collected.\nAlthough the participants generally expressed satisfaction with the inpatient services, they indicated that the weakest aspects of the service were in the domains of 'personal experience', 'information' and 'activity'. Women were significantly more dissatisfied than men with 'staff', 'care', and by general satisfaction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that satisfaction with hospital health care was associated with five indicators: insight, satisfaction with physical health, self-efficacy, family support, and social anhedonia.\nPersonality related factors rather than psychopathological symptoms were associated with a satisfaction with care of admitted patients with severe mental illness. These factors could be targets for interventions aimed to improve treatment and hospital services."}, {"Title": "The Science of Prognosis in Psychiatry: A Review.", "Abstract": "Prognosis is a venerable component of medical knowledge introduced by Hippocrates (460-377 BC). This educational review presents a contemporary evidence-based approach for how to incorporate clinical risk prediction models in modern psychiatry. The article is organized around key methodological themes most relevant for the science of prognosis in psychiatry. Within each theme, the article highlights key challenges and makes pragmatic recommendations to improve scientific understanding of prognosis in psychiatry.\nThe initial step to building clinical risk prediction models that can affect psychiatric care involves designing the model: preparation of the protocol and definition of the outcomes and of the statistical methods (theme 1). Further initial steps involve carefully selecting the predictors, preparing the data, and developing the model in these data. A subsequent step is the validation of the model to accurately test its generalizability (theme 2). The next consideration is that the accuracy of the clinical prediction model is affected by the incidence of the psychiatric condition under investigation (theme 3). Eventually, clinical prediction models need to be implemented in real-world clinical routine, and this is usually the most challenging step (theme 4). Advanced methods such as machine learning approaches can overcome some problems that undermine the previous steps (theme 5). The relevance of each of these themes to current clinical risk prediction modeling in psychiatry is discussed and recommendations are given.\nTogether, these perspectives intend to contribute to an integrative, evidence-based science of prognosis in psychiatry. By focusing on the outcome of the individuals, rather than on the disease, clinical risk prediction modeling can become the cornerstone for a scientific and personalized psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.", "Abstract": "Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).\nTen patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation.\nRapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks.\nThis study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD.

It is the contrast, and more precisely the paradox, between the high intellectual potential of these children and their scholastic difficulties (including school failure), and the psychic suffering expressed by some of them, which led us to question, challenge and propose therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children. It is in this context that we created in December 2005 the CNAHP (National Center for Assistance to High Potential children and adolescents) which is a public centre integrated into the hospital-university department of child and adolescent psychiatry at Rennes. It is noteworthy that not all children with HIP have difficulties, and children with school failure or behavioral problems are not always children with HIP. However, it is necessary not to minimize the problem raised by children with HIP with difficulties by ignoring its frequency or by considering that these children are \"intelligent\" enough to manage by themselves and do not need to be helped, whereas some of them can show school failure and even be de-scholarized. Indeed, based on the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) of an intellectual Quotient (IQ) above 130 (level corresponding to a statistical threshold), the frequency of children with HIP represents 2.3% of the population of schoolchildren aged 6 to 16. The frequency is therefore not so rare. However, it remains to be determined by French epidemiological studies what is the actual frequency of children with difficulties within a population of children with HIP. The analysis of the CNAHP research data from a clinical population (children with HIP consulting for difficulties) highlights that children with HIP can show major school problems (including school failure, defined here as having or foreseeing repetition of a grade), which corresponds to 7.5% of 611 children with HIP consulting at the CNAHP) and socioemotional problems (emotional regulation disorders) in relation to their high intellectual potential. In particular, anxiety disorders were the most frequent psychiatric disorders observed in this population (40.5%) and were significantly associated with high verbal potential. This significant association requires further studies to avoid establishing a simplistic unidirectional and reductive linear cause-effect relationships. Indeed, a high verbal potential can elicit and/or reinforce anxiety-producing representations, but anxiety disorders may also lead to a defensive over investment of verbal language. The results are discussed in this article and suggest that scholastic and/or psychological difficulties encountered by some children with HIP can be related to their high intellectual potential. It is necessary to develop therapeutic and educational care adapted to these children from a better understanding, based on research results, of their possible difficulties but also cognitive abilities. Even when children with HIP have scholastic and/or psychological difficulties, some of their cognitive skills can be preserved contrary to appearances, with for example, as seen in the CNAHP results, excellent attentional capacities shown by cognitive tests contrasting with behavioral attention deficit reported by parents. These skills are important to identify as they are resources which support the therapeutic and educational project. It is probably through an articulation among professionals from national education, health and research, in alliance with the family (parents, child, and siblings), that advances will be made. In the same way that professionals have been interested in children with intellectual disabilities, it is important to be concerned by children with HIP and difficulties located at the other end of the continuum. It is a question of ethics which concerns both caregivers and teachers. It is also a societal issue that concerns all of us given that the expression of high intellectual and creative potential in children may be essential to the societal development of innovative strategies and each nation's future. Finally, the discussion can be extended to all children, independent of their potential. What we learn from children with HIP and difficulties can be applied to each child: it is important at family, school and societal levels to facilitate the expression of the potential of children, to value their skills, and to help them to remove possible inhibitions of their potential based on individualized projects. The acceptance of singularity and differences in children can contribute to tolerance and the development of creativity, in the interest of the subject and of society."}, {"Title": "Polygenic risk scoring and prediction of mental health outcomes.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric conditions are highly polygenic, meaning that genetic risk arises from many hundreds or thousands of genetic variants.

Summit participants specifically examined questions of who should be screened for cognitive impairment and how they should be screened in medical settings. This is important in the context of an acute illness given that the presence of cognitive impairment can have significant implications for care and for the management of concomitant diseases as well as pose a major risk factor for dementia. Participants arrived at general principles to guide future screening approaches in medical populations and identified knowledge gaps to direct future research. Key learning points of the summit included: recognizing the importance of educating patients and healthcare providers about the value of assessing current and baseline cognition; emphasizing that any screening tool must be appropriately normalized and validated in the population in which it is used to obtain accurate information, including considerations of language, cultural factors, and education; and recognizing the great potential, with appropriate caveats, of electronic health records to augment cognitive screening and tracking of changes in cognitive health over time. <b>Summit Participants</b> Deb Adler<sup>1</sup>, Christopher Alban, MD, MBA<sup>2</sup>, Mark Bondi, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Michelle Braun, PhD<sup>4</sup>, Xavier Cagigas, PhD<sup>5</sup>, Morgan Daven<sup>6</sup>, Robert L.

The psychiatric and pedagogical discussion of non-physical effects on the spirit (esprit) of human subjects and patients essentially dealt with the question: could people have been liberated by the shocking surge of the Revolution from the demeaning and dependent habits of the Old Regime (ancien r\u00e9gime), or could this violent revolution have had a\u00a0pathological effect? This article shows that, after 1800, the latter interpretation became accepted. A\u00a0professional self-image of psychiatric and pedagogical expertise formed in the relationship between physician and patient or teacher and student. This expertise justified employing shocks in professionally controlled settings, while the healing power of the revolutionary was negated. This article thereby distinguishes between four different perspectives on the pathological or healing effect of what was perceived as a\u00a0\"revolutionary shock\": firstly, a\u00a0positive perspective that interprets the shock of the Revolution as healthy, stimulating the vital forces of the people languishing in inactivity; secondly, a\u00a0cautious perspective that emphasizes the necessity of curbing and controlling the passions of the people; thirdly, a\u00a0perspective that recognizes in the outburst of passions an aberration from the natural state, and fourthly, a\u00a0therapeutic perspective that recommends the use of passions by experts in very controlled spaces. Based on published texts and material from the Archives nationales as well as the Institut national de jeunes sourds, this article provides a\u00a0political history of the development of moral shocks and argues that the development of epistemological and therapeutic technologies in the human sciences were essentially the result of a\u00a0demarcation from revolutionary violence as well as the desire in the human sciences for a\u00a0stable government."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant and pro-motivational effects of repeated lamotrigine treatment in a rat model of depressive symptoms.", "Abstract": "The antiepileptic lamotrigine is approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and augmentation therapy in treatment-resistant depression. Previous preclinical investigations showed lamotrigine antidepressant-like effects without addressing its possible activity on motivational aspects of anhedonia, a symptom clinically associated with poor treatment response and with blunted mesolimbic dopaminergic responsiveness to salient stimuli in preclinical models. Thus, in rats expressing a depressive-like phenotype we studied whether repeated lamotrigine administration restored behavioral responses to aversive and positive stimuli and the dopaminergic response to sucrose in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS), all disrupted by stress exposure.\nDepressive-like phenotype was induced in non-food-deprived adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by exposure to a chronic protocol of alternating unavoidable tail-shocks or restraint periods. We examined whether lamotrigine administration (7.5 mg/kg twice a day, i.p.) for 14-21 days restored a) the competence to escape aversive stimuli; b) the motivation to operate in sucrose self-administration protocols; c) the dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption, evaluated measuring phosphorylation levels of cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) in the NAcS, by immunoblotting.\nLamotrigine administration restored the response to aversive stimuli and the motivation to operate for sucrose. Moreover, it reinstated NAcS DARPP-32 phosphorylation changes in response to sucrose consumption.\nThe pro-motivational effects of lamotrigine that we report may not completely transpose to clinical use, since anhedonia is a multidimensional construct and the motivational aspects, although relevant, are not the only components.\nThis study shows antidepressant-like and pro-motivational effects of repeated lamotrigine administration in a rat model of depressive symptoms."}, {"Title": "Contributory injustice in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "I explain the notion of contributory injustice, a kind of epistemic injustice, and argue that it occurs within psychiatric services, affecting (at least) those who hear voices. I argue that individual effort on the part of clinicians to avoid perpetrating this injustice is an insufficient response to the problem; mitigating the injustice will require open and meaningful dialogue between clinicians and service user organisations, as well as individuals. I suggest that clinicians must become familiar with and take seriously concepts and frameworks for understanding mental distress developed in service user communities, such as Hearing Voices Network, and by individual service users. This is especially necessary when these concepts and frameworks explicitly conflict with medical or technical understandings of users' experiences. I defend this proposal against three objections."}, {"Title": "Ultra-short term heart rate variability as a tool to assess changes in valence.", "Abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is an index that has been extensively used in fields such as clinical cardiology, psychiatry, and psychology to assess affective experiences. Although traditionally The European Society of Cardiology and The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology recommended to use either a recording length of 24-h (long-term) or five minutes (short-term), recent advances in the field have suggested the use of ultra-short term (<5\u00a0min) HRV measurements. In this study, we investigated whether ultra-short term HRV measurements can be used to investigate the temporal dynamics of experimentally induced emotions using pictures from the International Affective Picture System. We took electrocardiogram recordings from thirty-nine participants, and analyzed the root mean square of the successive differences of the R-R interval using a thirty-second moving window. No significant differences in HRV during positive and negative emotion induction were found. These results call into question the use of ultra-short term HRV as a tool for psychologists to measure changes in valence in affective studies."}, {"Title": "Impulsivity and its association with childhood trauma experiences across bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and borderline personality disorder.", "Abstract": "Impulsivity is a core feature of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is one of the DSM-V diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Impulsivity is also present in bipolar disorder (BD). Impulsivity has been linked to adverse behavior (suicidality,\u2026) and to traumatic childhood experiences. Our study explored impulsivity in BPD, BD, ADHD and healthy controls (CTRL) and investigated the impact of early trauma on impulsivity.\n744 patients with BD (n\u202f=\u202f276), BPD (n\u202f=\u202f168), ADHD (n\u202f=\u202f173) or a combination (BPD_BD, n\u202f=\u202f29; BPD_ADHD, n\u202f=\u202f94, BD_BPD_ADHD n\u202f=\u202f13) and 47 controls were included. All subjects were completed the Baratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).\nBD reported the same levels of impulsiveness as CTRL. When BPD and BD are co-morbid, impulsivity increased to reach the level of BPD. Impulsiveness was significantly associated to traumatic childhood event for BD and CTRL, not for BPD and AHDH.\nImpulsivity was assessed on the basis of a self-report questionnaire and not by the mean of an objective measure such as a neuropsychological test. Moreover, we don't know what treatment our pathological subjects were receiving. But, ADHD and BPD, despite the probable treatment, were more impulsive than healthy CTRLs who did not take medications.\nImpulsivity is probably not a feature of BD but is associated with the presence of traumatic childhood experiences, especially for euthymic patients, unlike BPD and ADHD. So, it seems essential to assess the presence of early trauma to reduce the impulsivity and improve the evolution of BD."}, {"Title": "[Genetics and epigenetics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].", "Abstract": "Molecular genetic studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have demonstrated the involvement of multiple genes in the etiology of ADHD. A polygenic hypothesis of the etiopathogenesis was formulated without clear knowledge of common mechanisms of ADHD development. Twin, family and adoption studies have established the heritability of 70-80% for ADHD. Association studies have shown the relationship between ADHD and genes of dopaminergic (DRD4, DRD5, SLC6A3), serotoninergic (HTR1B, 5-HTTLPR), glutamatergic (mGluR, NDRG2) systems, metabolic pathways (SLC2A3, SLC6A4, CDH13, CFOD1, GFOD1), membrane proteins (KChIP1, ITGA1, SNAP-25) as well as tumour-suppressor (NDRG2, NF1) and cytokine genes. The marked comorbidity of ADHD with other psychiatric disorders and shared genetic risk factors were determined. Studies of a role of copy number variations (CNVs) provided more promising evidence that suggested the possible involvement of retroelements as the unifying factors of disease etiopathogenesis. Transposons, which are sensitive to stress, may cause CNVs and are key regulators of brain development and functioning. The dysregulation of transposons is thought to be important in changes in tuning of gene regulatory pathways and epigenetic regulation of neurons in ADHD that may be a common principle underlying the heterogeneous nature of ADHD. Research on noncoding RNAs will help to confirm the hypothesis and develop diagnostic algorithms of examination of ADHD patients as an important step in the implementation of personalized medicine in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Renaming schizophrenia: 5 \u00d7 5.", "Abstract": "There had been a long way to go before we felt comfortable about even discussing the issues revolving around the concept of 'schizophrenia', let alone reckoning on mere semantic revision. In this editorial, we aim to extend our discussion on the reasons behind the slow death of the concept of 'schizophrenia' and the benefits of changing the name and embracing a spectrum approach with an umbrella psychosis spectrum disorder (PSD) category (similar to autism spectrum disorder) that goes further than a mere semantic revision. We attempted to cover the topic of the renaming by providing five most pertinent points categorised under five domains: reasons, signals, challenges, promises and steps for the change. Admittedly, even a modest revision, such as classifying all psychotic disorder categories under an umbrella category of PSD, and abolishing the term schizophrenia requires careful deliberation and some effort in the beginning, but the revision is well worth the effort considering the benefits in the long run. Renaming a particular form of mental suffering should be accompanied by a broader debate of the entire diagnosis-evidence-based-practice (EBP)-symptom-reduction model as the normative factor driving the content and organisation of mental health services that may be detached from patients' needs and reality, overlooks the trans-syndromal structure of mental difficulties, appraises the significance of the technical features over the relational and ritual components of care, and underestimates the lack of EBP group-to-individual generalisability. Individuals may make great strides in attaining well-being by accommodating to living with mental vulnerabilities through building resilience in the social and existential domains. Changing the name and the concept of 'schizophrenia', which goes beyond a mere semantic revision, may become the first step that allows catalysation of the process of modernising psychiatric science and services worldwide."}, {"Title": "Fits, feet and HIV: lessons from a case of coexisting epilepsy and neuropathy in a patient with perinatally acquired HIV-1 infection.", "Abstract": "An 18-year-old black African man with well-controlled perinatally acquired HIV-1 was diagnosed in late adolescence with the unrelated diagnoses of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A), epilepsy due to polymicrogyria and subsequently developed severe depression.

Given the richness of historical clinical phenomenology, what can account for the recent ascendancy of relatively impoverished descriptions of psychosis? One possible explanation is provided by Hacking's notion of dynamic nominalism, where human categories change over time in tandem with those who they classify. But although dynamic nominalism makes sense of changes in behaviour, it fails to account for change at the level of subjective experience. In this paper, psychotic symptoms are addressed in the light of the indeterminacy of subjective mental content. A na\u00efve-introspectionist approach to mental symptoms assumes that, notwithstanding practical difficulties, such symptoms are reliably describable in principle. Contemporary philosophy of mind challenges this assumption.

Here we present our results of alpha wave profile analysis based on a sample larger than most of those in the field, performed using a robust processing pipeline. <b>Methods:</b> We compared the alpha waves profiles at rest in children with ASD to those of age-, sex-, and IQ-matched control individuals. We used linear regression and non-parametric normative models using age as covariate forparsing the clinical heterogeneity. We explored the correlation between EEG profiles and the patient's brain volumes, obtained from structural MRI. We automatized the detection of the alpha peak and visually quality controled our MRI measurements. We assessed the robustness of our results by running the EEG preprocessing with two different versions of Matlab as well as Python. <b>Results:</b> A simple linear regression between peak power or frequency of the alpha waves and the status or age of the participants did not allow to identify any statistically significant relationship. The non-parametric normative model (which took account the non-linear effect of age on the alpha profiles) suggested that participants with ASD displayed more variability than control participants for both frequency and amplitude of the alpha peak (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Independent of the status of the individual, we also observed weak associations (uncorrected <i>p</i> < 0.05) between the alpha frequency, and the volumes of several cortical and subcortical structures (in particular the striatum), but which did not survive correction for multiple testing and changed between analysis pelines. <b>Discussions:</b> Our study did not find evidence for abnormal alpha wave profiles in ASD.

The debate regarding diagnosing children with BPD based on severe irritability and aggression is mostly resolved. The current data support utilising the diagnostic criteria based on episodic changes of mood polarity. Therefore, longitudinal course of illness should be explored in detail when diagnosing BPD.

Recently, the frontiers of phenomenological psychopathology have expanded to the productive development of therapeutic strategies that target the whole of existence in their actions. In this article, we present an overview of the current state of this discipline, summing up some of its key concepts, and highlighting its importance to clinical psychiatry today. Phenomenological psychopathology understands mental disorders as modifications of the main dimensions of the life-world: lived time, lived space, lived body, intersubjectivity, and selfhood. Psychopathological symptoms are the expression of a dialectical modification of the proportions of certain domains of the life-world or of the lived experience. The far-reaching relevance of the concepts of proportion and dialectics for the clinical agenda is explored. The article presents two contemporary models for clinical practice based on phenomenological psychopathology: Dialectical-proportional oriented approach and Person-centered dialectic approach (P.H.D. method). The main characteristics of these approaches are considered, as well as the new perspectives they bring to the challenges of psychiatric care in the twentieth-first century."}, {"Title": "Novel Quantitative PET Techniques for Clinical Decision Support in Oncology.", "Abstract": "Quantitative image analysis has deep roots in the usage of positron emission tomography (PET) in clinical and research settings to address a wide variety of diseases. It has been extensively employed to assess molecular and physiological biomarkers in vivo in healthy and disease states, in oncology, cardiology, neurology, and psychiatry. Quantitative PET allows relating the time-varying activity concentration in tissues/organs of interest and the basic functional parameters governing the biological processes being studied. Yet, quantitative PET is challenged by a number of degrading physical factors related to the physics of PET imaging, the limitations of the instrumentation used, and the physiological status of the patient. Moreover, there is no consensus on the most reliable and robust image-derived PET metric(s) that can be used with confidence in clinical oncology owing to the discrepancies between the conclusions reported in the literature. There is also increasing interest in the use of artificial intelligence based techniques, particularly machine learning and deep learning techniques in a variety of applications to extract quantitative features (radiomics) from PET including image segmentation and outcome prediction in clinical oncology. These novel techniques are revolutionizing clinical practice and are now offering unique capabilities to the clinical molecular imaging community and biomedical researchers at large. In this report, we summarize recent developments and future tendencies in quantitative PET imaging and present example applications in clinical decision support to illustrate its potential in the context of clinical oncology."}, {"Title": "[Importance of Psychiatric Outpatient Clinics in Primary Care of Somatic Disorders].", "Abstract": "General practitioners are mainly responsible for primary health care. Patients with mental disorders, in particular patients with complex or multiple needs, use these services infrequently in case of somatic complaints. Psychiatric outpatient clinics have to deal with these patients and have perhaps an additional role in diagnosing and treating somatic co-morbidities. This should be evaluated.\nPhysicians in outpatient clinics of the Centre of Psychiatry Suedwuerttemberg were asked about their attitude towards somatic co-morbidities, somatic co-treatment and prescribing somatic drugs. In addition, data of the outpatient clinic documentation were evaluated with respect to the treatment by general practitioners and somatic diagnosis.\n72% of all patients said that they have a general practitioner. Physicians in outpatient clinics said that they had a high responsibility for somatic co-treatment especially for those patients who did not have a general practitioner. The frequency and type of a somatic co-morbidity was different in patients from general psychiatric, geriatric psychiatry and addiction outpatient clinics.\nOur results demonstrate that psychiatric outpatient clinics play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating somatic disorders. Their extent depends on the type of the psychiatric and the somatic disorder but also on the financing of the outpatient clinic."}, {"Title": "[Short-term and long-term effects of cannabis use].", "Abstract": "Cannabis is used worldwide.

However, the role of individual differences, as well as genetic and environmental factors, in human psychiatric disorders remains poorly understood. Animal experimental models are a valuable tool to improve our understanding of disease pathophysiology and its molecular mechanisms. Due to high reproduction capability, fully sequenced genome, easy gene editing, and high genetic and physiological homology with humans, zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a novel powerful model in biomedicine. Mounting evidence supports zebrafish as a useful model organism in CNS research. Robustly expressed in these fish, individual, strain, and sex differences shape their CNS responses to genetic, environmental, and pharmacological manipulations. Here, we discuss zebrafish as a promising complementary translational tool to further advance patient-centered personalized psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Determining Pro-Oxidant Antioxidant Balance (PAB) and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) in Patients with Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Schizophrenia is a disease with unknown etiology. There is evidence suggesting that oxidative damage occurs in schizophrenia. Oxidative damage may arouse from imbalance between oxidant and anti-oxidant factors in cellular and tissue environment. Although it may not be the primary cause, it can worsen the disease and may be a reason of poor response to therapy in these patients. The present study aimed at evaluating the pro-oxidant antioxidant balance (PAB) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in serum of schizophrenia patients. PAB is an assay to determine the pro-oxidant load and antioxidant capacity in a single measurement. <b>Method</b> <b>:</b> In this cross- sectional study, patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, who referred to a psychiatry university hospital (Ibn-e-Sina Hospital) affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, were enrolled. Patients' demographic characteristics and laboratory data were recorded from patients' files. Serum PAB and TAC were measured using a special PAB assay and commercial kit, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16. <b>Results:</b> A total of 84 individuals (42 schizophrenia cases and 42 healthy controls) participated in this study. Controls were age and sex-matched with the patients' group. The mean TAC in the patient and control groups was 0.49\u00b10.04 and 0.51\u00b10.04 nmol/L, respectively (p = 0.16). PAB was higher in patients' group than in controls (127.36\u00b136.44 vs. 118.93\u00b152.34 HK), however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). The change was correlated with the chronicity of the disease. <b>Conclusion:</b> Pro-oxidant antioxidant balance was elevated in serum of patients with schizophrenia. These data suggested the occurrence of oxidative stress during the progression of the disease. Lower antioxidant capacity might suggest that patients with schizophrenia could be more susceptible to oxidative stress damage."}, {"Title": "Online Survey of Medical and Psychological Professionals on Structured Instruments for the Assessment of Work Ability in Psychiatric Patients.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate perceived needs and difficulties related to instruments for assessing work ability in individuals with mental disorders. <b>Method:</b> We conducted an online survey of 104 German-speaking medico-legal experts (forensic psychiatric and psychology experts, insurance physicians) and therapists. <b>Results:</b> The large majority of respondents reported they would welcome a standardized, structured instrument for the assessment of work ability. High predictiveness, inter-rater agreement, comprehensibility for laymen, and symptom validity were desired in roughly equal measure as the main characteristic of such an instrument. More women than men, and more medico-legal experts than therapists, considered symptom validation as always necessary.

Much convergent evidence from the human literature associates inflammation during pregnancy with later neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring. Preclinical models of prenatal inflammation have been developed to examine the causal maternal physiological and offspring neural mechanisms underlying these findings. Here we review the strengths and limitations of preclinical models used for these purposes and describe selected studies that have shown maternal immune impacts on the brain and behavior of offspring. Maternal immune activation in mice, rats, nonhuman primates, and other mammalian model species have demonstrated convergent outcomes across methodologies. These outcomes include shifts and/or disruptions in the normal developmental trajectory of molecular and cellular processes in the offspring brain. Prenatal developmental origins are critical to a mechanistic understanding of maternal immune activation-induced alterations to microglia and immune molecules, brain growth and development, synaptic morphology and physiology, and anxiety- and depression-like, sensorimotor, and social behaviors. These phenotypes are relevant to brain functioning across domains and to anxiety and mood disorders, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder, in which they have been identified. By turning a neurodevelopmental lens on this body of work, we emphasize the importance of acute changes to the prenatal offspring brain in fostering a better understanding of potential mechanisms for intervention. Collectively, overlapping results across maternal immune activation studies also highlight the need to examine preclinical offspring neurodevelopment alterations in terms of a multifactorial immune milieu, or immunome, to determine potential mechanisms of psychiatric risk."}, {"Title": "Ethical Considerations for Mental Health Clinicians Working with Adolescents in the Digital Age.", "Abstract": "Adolescents' use of digital technologies is constantly changing and significantly influences and reflects their mental health and development. Technology has entered the clinical space and raises new ethical dilemmas for mental health clinicians. After an update on this shifting landscape, including a brief review of important literature since 2014, this article will demonstrate how core ethical principles may be applied to clinical situations with patients, using vignettes for illustration.\nThe vast majority of adolescents (95%) across all demographic groups can access smartphones (Anderson et al. 2018\u2022). Technology use in mental health is also expanding, including a proliferation of \"apps.\" While qualitative data from technology experts reports overall positive effects of technology (Anderson and Rainie 2018), concern about its potential negative impact on youth mental health remains high, and an association between technology use and depression is strong. Internet addiction, online sexual exploitation, and accessing illicit substances through the \"dark net\" pose additional clinical and legal concerns. In this context, clinicians have an ethical responsibility to engage in education and advocacy, to explore technology use with teen patients and to be sensitive to ethical issues that may arise clinically, including confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence/nonmaleficence, and legal considerations such as mandated reporting. New media and digital technologies pose unique ethical challenges to mental health clinicians working with adolescents. Clinicians need to stay abreast of current trends and controversies about technology and their potential impact on youth and engage in advocacy and psychoeducation appropriately. With individual patients, clinicians should watch for potential ethical dilemmas stemming from technology use and think them through, with consultation as needed, by applying longstanding core ethical principles."}, {"Title": "Medical Screening of Mental Health Patients in the Emergency Department: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with psychiatric complaints often require medical screening to evaluate for a medical cause of their symptoms.\nWe sought to evaluate the existing literature on the medical screening of psychiatric patients and establish recommendations for ideal screening practices in Western-style EDs.\nPubMed, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for clinical studies examining the medical screening of adult psychiatric patients in the ED or inappropriate referrals to psychiatry. Articles were graded using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) grading tool and sorted into topics. A 3-level grading algorithm used by other emergency medicine organizations was used to evaluate the strength of the evidence for each recommendation.\nSixty articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most published literature on medical screening consisted of nonrandomized studies with a high risk of bias. Some screening procedures, such as history and physical examination, were extensively recommended. Other screening procedures received mixed recommendations.\nBased on available literature, physician experts developed 7 recommendations. For a patient with known psychiatric disease presenting with symptom exacerbation, medical screening should include a full medical and psychiatric history, a targeted physical examination, and a mental status examination. Urine toxicology screening and nonurine drug screen laboratory testing should not be routinely performed. Additional screening tests may be valuable for patients with new-onset psychiatric symptoms who are \u226565\u00a0years of age, are immunosuppressed, or have concomitant medical disease.

This evaluation of a community psychiatry residency rotation compared a DBT training program to a standard care training program to determine the levels of confidence in treating patients with BPD, willingness to treat patients with BPD, and attitudes towards this patient population.\nParticipants were 57 psychiatry residents who completed a 3-month community psychiatry rotation in a DBT clinic (N\u2009=\u200933), or standard care clinic (N\u2009=\u200924) based in a partial hospitalization program in a community mental health center. A mixed method design was used to collect qualitative and quantitative data on participants' experiences working with BPD and patients at high-risk for suicide. Participants were asked several open-ended questions to determine what aspect of their community psychiatry rotation influenced their level of confidence in treating, and willingness to treat BPD, non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, and suicidal behaviors.\nCompared to training in the standard care condition, the DBT condition demonstrated significantly higher rates of willingness to treat, and confidence in treating patients with BPD, and confidence in treating non-suicidal self-injury. There were no significant differences between the two conditions in the level of confidence in treating suicidal patients. Four themes emerged from a qualitative content analysis examining the benefits of the training program, including (1) exposure to high-risk patients, (2) team-based treatment structure, (3) formal didactic training, and (4) individual or group supervision.\nParticipants receiving DBT training had more willingness to treat and confidence in treating patients with BPD compared to participants receiving training in the standard care clinic. Team-based structure of DBT and exposure to high-risk patients were two themes from the training that impacted these variables across both study arms, according to participant self-report. Internal validity of the study was limited by the lack of randomization and pre-post design.

Twenty-six clinics entered the sustainability phase and six opted out, providing an opportunity to examine factors predicting continued CC participation and fidelity.\nWe used descriptive statistics to assess implementation metrics in sustaining vs. opt-out clinics and trends in implementation fidelity 1 and 2\u00a0years into the sustainability phase among sustaining clinics. To characterize barriers and facilitators, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with psychiatrists, clinic administrators, primary care physicians, and depression care managers (24 at sustaining, 7 at opt-out clinics).\nAt the end of the implementation phase, clinics opting to continue the program had significantly higher care manager full-time equivalents (FTEs) and achieved greater clinical improvement rates (46% vs. 7.5%, p\u2009=\u20090.004) than opt-out clinics. At 1 and 2\u00a0years into sustainability, the 26 sustaining clinics had steady rates of depression screening, staffing FTEs and treatment titration rates, significantly higher contacts/patient and improvement rates and fewer enrolled patients/FTE. During the sustainability phase, opt-out sites reported lower patient caseloads/FTE, psychiatry and care manager FTEs, and physician/psychiatrist CC involvement compared to sustaining clinics. Key barriers to sustainability noted by respondents included time/resources/personnel (71% of respondents from sustaining clinics vs. 86% from opt-out), patient engagement (67% vs. 43%), and staff/provider engagement (50% vs. 43%). Fewer respondents mentioned early implementation barriers such as leadership support, training, finance, and screening/referral logistics. Facilitators included engaging patients (e.g., warm handoffs) (79% vs. 86%) and staff/providers (71% vs. 100%), and hiring personnel (75% vs. 57%), particularly paraprofessionals for administrative tasks (67% vs. 0%).\nClinics that saw early clinical improvement and who invested in staffing FTEs were more likely to elect to enter the sustainability phase. Structural rules (e.g., payment reform) both encouraged participation in the sustainability phase and boosted long-term outcomes. While limited to settings with academic affiliations, these results demonstrate that patient and provider engagement and care manager resources are critical factors to ensuring sustainability."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in Psychiatric Disorders: A Bibliometric Analysis of the 100 Most Highly Cited Articles.", "Abstract": "Extensive research has been conducted to find neuroimaging biomarkers for psychiatric disorders.

However, some machine learning models have been criticized for requiring a large number of cases in each experimental group, and for resembling a \"black box\" that provides little or no insight into the nature of the data. In this article, we propose an alternative conceptual and practical approach for investigating brain-based disorders which aim to overcome these limitations. We used an artificial neural network known as \"deep autoencoder\" to create a normative model using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,113 healthy people. We then used this model to estimate total and regional neuroanatomical deviation in individual patients with schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder using two independent data sets (n =\u2009263). We report that the model was able to generate different values of total neuroanatomical deviation for each disease under investigation relative to their control group (p <\u2009.005). Furthermore, the model revealed distinct patterns of neuroanatomical deviations for the two diseases, consistent with the existing neuroimaging literature. We conclude that the deep autoencoder provides a flexible and promising framework for assessing total and regional neuroanatomical deviations in neuropsychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "When Societal Structural Issues Become Patient Problems: The Role of Clinical Ethics Consultation.", "Abstract": "The debate about health insurance coverage and the related issue of unequal access to health care turn on fundamental questions of justice, but for an individual patient like DM, the abstract question about who is deserving of health insurance becomes a very concrete problem that has a profound impact on care and livelihood. DM's circumstances left him stuck in the hospital. A satisfactory discharge plan remained elusive; his insurance coverage severely limited the number and type of facilities that would accept him; and his inadequate engagement in his own rehabilitation process limited discharge options even further. Despite extensive involvement with the psychiatry, social work, physical therapy, and occupational therapy teams, DM consistently made \"bad\" decisions. He repeatedly refused antibiotics and did not consistently work with rehab services to improve his strength and mobility. Although the clinicians wanted to provide him with the best care possible, he often seemed unwilling to do the things necessary to achieve this care-or perhaps his depression rendered him unable to do so. He also tended to take out his frustration on staff members caring for him. All of this was, in turn, very frustrating for the staff. It may be easy, however, to make too much of DM's role, to see his choices as more important than his circumstances. A major goal of the ethics consultants was to reframe DM's predicament for the staff members involved in his care."}, {"Title": "Smoking Ban in Psychiatric Inpatient Unit: An Iranian Study on the Views and Attitudes of the Mental Health Staff and Psychiatric Patients.", "Abstract": "Although the move to smoke-free mental health inpatient settings is an internationally common and popular trend, these policies are neither implemented nor supported by any national program in Iran.

One hundred and twenty participants of this cross-sectional study consist of 30 mental health staff and 90 psychiatric patients. An eight-item questionnaire was used for collecting information. Both staff and patients expressed a positive attitude towards smoking cessation. Patients favoured the implementation of these policies and expressed a more positive attitude towards the feasibility. Sixty-three percent of patients and 57% of staff were opposed to smoking in the units. Seventy percent of patients reported the smoke-free ban as a feasible policy compared to 45% of staff who did the same.

Despite this change, physicians continue to use the term \"organic causes\" to refer to medical and neurological causes of psychiatric symptoms, and it remains part of the ICD-10 classification. In the context of increasing integration of psychiatric disorders within a medical and neuroscientific framework, the reasons behind the ongoing use of this term (reminiscent of mind-body dualism) have to be clarified. The authors conducted a survey of 391 Canadian psychiatrists and psychiatric residents to understand attitudes and beliefs related to this terminology and then applied qualitative and quantitative analyses. Results showed that the terminology is used by the majority (55.9%) of psychiatrists and residents for two main reasons: out of a habit that begins in residency training and because of the belief that other specialties do not fully understand alternative terminology. The authors found that some psychiatrists are concerned that their patients will not receive adequate investigation unless it is made clear through use of the \"organic cause\" term that other medical causes of psychiatric symptoms are suspected. Use of the \"organic cause\" term was predicted by being of younger age, performing emergency department calls, and finding alternative terminology difficult to use. These findings highlight the importance of reflecting on and discussing the effect of this terminology used in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Mapping the Heterogeneous Phenotype of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Using Normative Models.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. However, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual's treatment response and outcome.\nTo investigate the degree to which case-control analyses disguise interindividual differences in brain structure among patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and to map the brain alterations linked to these disorders at the level of individual patients.\nThis study used cross-sectional, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from participants recruited for the Thematically Organized Psychosis study from October 27, 2004, to October 17, 2012. Data were reanalyzed in 2017 and 2018.

Voxel-based morphometry maps were computed, which were used for normative modeling to map the range of interindividual differences in brain structure.\nThis study included 218 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (mean [SD] age, 30 [9.3] years; 126 [57.8%] male), of whom 163 had schizophrenia (mean [SD] age, 31 [8.7] years; 105 [64.4%] male) and 190 had bipolar disorder (mean [SD] age, 34 [11.3] years; 79 [41.6%] male), and 256 healthy individuals (mean [SD] age, 34\u2009[9.5] years; 140 [54.7%] male). At the level of the individual, deviations from the normative model were frequent in both disorders but highly heterogeneous. Overlap of more than 2% among patients was observed in only a few loci, primarily in frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions. The proportion of alterations was associated with diagnosis and cognitive and clinical characteristics within clinical groups. Patients with schizophrenia, on average, had significantly reduced gray matter in frontal regions, cerebellum, and temporal cortex. In patients with bipolar disorder, mean deviations were primarily present in cerebellar regions.\nThis study found that group-level differences disguised biological heterogeneity and interindividual differences among patients with the same diagnosis. This finding suggests that the idea of the average patient is a noninformative construct in psychiatry that falls apart when mapping abnormalities at the level of the individual patient.

Coverage of specialized centers for psychosocial attention (Centros de Aten\u00e7\u00e3o Psicossocial [CAPS]) and psychologists did not show any protective effects. Young, male patients and those residing outside the capital had greater risk of early readmission. Compared to other psychotic disorders, mood disorders and neurotic disorders were seen as protective factors for readmission.\nRegionalized attention offered by the CAPS did not result in reduced readmission risks."}, {"Title": "Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in Psychiatry: Pros, Cons, and Suggestions.", "Abstract": "For a number of mental health disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), there are not many available treatment options. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the potential of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to restore function for patients with these disorders. The primary hypothesis is that MDMA, via prosocial effects, increases the ability of patients to address the underlying psychopathology of the disorder. However, the use of MDMA poses potential problems of neurotoxicity, in addition to its own potential for misuse.\nIn this article, the proposed potential of MDMA as an adjunct to psychotherapy for PTSD is evaluated. The rationale for the use of MDMA and the positive results of studies that have administered MDMA in the treatment of PTSD are provided (pros). A description of potential adverse effects of treatment is also presented (cons). An overview of MDMA pharmacology and pharmacokinetics and a description of potential adverse effects of treatments are also presented. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-produced oxytocin release and decreased expression of fear conditioning as well as one of the MDMA enantiomers (the n R- entaniomer) are suggested as potential mechanisms for the beneficial effects of MDMA in PTSD (suggestions).\nThere is some evidence that MDMA facilitates recovery of PTSD. However, the significant adverse effects of MDMA raise concern for its adoption as a pharmacotherapy. Alternative potential treatments with less adverse effects and that are based on the ubiquitous pharmacology of MDMA are presented.\nWe suggest that additional research investigating the basis for the putative beneficial effects of MDMA might reveal an effective treatment with fewer adverse effects. Suggestions of alternative treatments based on the behavioral pharmacology and toxicology of MDMA and its enantiomers are presented."}, {"Title": "Fluoxetine overdose in a teenager resulting in serotonin syndrome, seizure and delayed onset rhabdomyolysis.", "Abstract": "A 14-year-old young adult took an overdose of 1.2 g of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that he had been prescribed for depression. He had a generalised tonic/clonic seizure at 6\u2009hours postingestion.After the seizure, he developed signs consistent with serotonin syndrome: fine tremor, agitation, sweating and hyperreflexia. This was followed by severe muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with peak creatine kinase (CK) of 33\u2009941 at 74\u2009hours. He was managed with intravenous fluids and analgesia and discharged after 4 days, having avoided renal injury. The use of SSRI's such as fluoxetine in teenagers has increased in recent years. While it is generally considered benign in overdose, this report illustrates the severe consequences of overdose at high quantities and discusses appropriate management in these cases.

Participants also completed the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ).\nOf 3,363 surveyed psychiatrists, 2,715 (81%) responded, and 2,602 (77%) completed the survey. Among completers, 58% were women, and 83% were ages 30-49. Significant differences were found in actual and expected monthly income between male and female psychiatrists and across various regions. The mean\u00b1SD MSQ score was 71.6\u00b114.3, suggesting moderate job satisfaction. The top three reasons for dissatisfaction were low pay, contentious doctor-patient relationships, and a heavy workload. One-fifth (20%) of participants reported an intention to quit their jobs. MSQ score was significantly associated with younger age, shorter working hours, higher monthly pay, and a smaller gap between expected and actual pay. Being in an administrative position, having medical liability insurance, and not having experienced medical disputes appeared to have a positive impact on job satisfaction.\nCompared with their international counterparts, psychiatrists in China have a low level of the job satisfaction, especially those in West China. Given China's increasing demand for psychiatric services, policy makers in China urgently need to find ways to improve the job satisfaction of working psychiatrists and should consider enhancements in financial compensation, the working environment, and malpractice insurance coverage."}, {"Title": "On the Margins of Death: A Scoping Review on Palliative Care and Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious chronic mental illness that results in marginalization and stigma for sufferers. It is the seventh leading cause for disability worldwide. The symptoms of the illness, including hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior, may also introduce barriers to accessing treatment, education, housing, and employment. Little is known about end-of-life care for individuals with schizophrenia. To address this gap, a scoping review was conducted to enhance understanding of hospice and palliative care for patients with schizophrenia. From this scoping review, 342 unique titles and abstracts were identified through a search of 20 databases, including 11 social science databases, 6 medical databases, and 3 gray literature databases. A total of 32 articles met the inclusion criteria and the following 4 themes were identified: Stigma affecting quality of care and access to care; Issues related to consent and capacity for the patient's end-of-life care decisions and to appoint substitute decision makers; Best practices for psychosocial interventions, pharmacology, family and health-care collaborations, goals of care, setting, and smoking; and Barriers to care, including setting, communication, provider education, and access to care. The review suggests the importance of mandatory interdisciplinary training practices and policy standards outlining cooperative communication across health-care providers.

In mammals, these circuits involve amygdalar and hypothalamic subnuclei and midbrain circuits. The increased interest in teleost fishes as model organisms in neuroscience created a demand to understand which brain circuits are involved in defensive behavior. Telencephalic and habenular circuits represent a \"forebrain circuit\" for threat processing and organization of responses, being important to mounting appropriate coping responses. Specific hypothalamic circuits organize neuroendocrine and neurovegetative outputs, but are the less well-studied in fish. A \"midbrain circuit\" is represented by projections to interneurons in the optic tectum which mediate fast escape responses via projections to the central gray and/or the brainstem escape network. Threatening stimuli (especially visual stimuli) can bypass the \"high road\" and directly activate this system, initiating escape responses. Increased attention to these circuits in an evolutionary framework is still needed."}, {"Title": "Risperidone But Not Quetiapine Treatment Is Associated With Increased Appetite But Not Satiety Hormones in Children During An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: A Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are commonly used to treat children with mental health conditions (MHCs) but are associated with adverse effects including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these complications are unknown, but it has been suggested that SGAs increase appetite leading to weight gain. The present objective was to perform a pilot study to investigate appetite and satiety hormones in SGA-treated (risperidone or quetiapine) and SGA-naive children with similar mental health conditions.\nOral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted in SGA-naive (n = 18), risperidone-treated (n = 20), and quetiapine-treated (n = 16) children recruited from the British Columbia Children's Hospital Psychiatry Department. Over 5 time-points during the OGTT, appetite questionnaires using a visual analogue scale were administered, and blood was collected to measure ghrelin, peptide YY, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like protein 1, leptin, and adiponectin. Mixed model analyses were conducted to examine between-group differences.\nThe children were similar in age, psychiatric diagnosis, and global assessment of functioning scores. Body mass index z-scores were also similar between groups. Appetite was increased during the OGTT in the risperidone-treated compared with the SGA-naive group for 2 questions (\"How strong is your desire to eat\"; P = 0.003 and \"How much food do you think you can eat\"; P = 0.028). No differences in satiety hormones were observed between the 3 groups.\nRisperidone treatment in youth is associated with elevated appetite during an OGTT, with no differences in gut peptides or adipocytokines to explain risperidone's effect on appetite. Further research is needed to explore other mediators of weight gain and metabolic dysfunction in SGA-treated youth."}, {"Title": "Trends in Publications on Medical Cannabis from the Year 2000.", "Abstract": "Widespread use of cannabis as a drug and passage of legislation on its use should lead to an increase in the number of scientific publications on cannabis. The aim of this study was to compare trends in scientific publication for papers on medical cannabis, papers on cannabis in general, and all papers between the years 2000 and 2017. A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted. The overall number of scientific publications in PubMed increased 2.5-fold. In contrast, the number of publications on cannabis increased 4.5-fold and the number of publications on medical cannabis increased almost 9-fold. The number of publications on medical cannabis in Web of science increased even more (10-fold). The most significant number of publications was in the field of psychiatry. In the fields of neurology and cancer treatment there was a significant increase in the years 2011-2013. There was a rise in the number of publications on children and the elderly after 2013. The specific indications with the largest number of publications were HIV (261), chronic pain (179), multiple sclerosis (118), nausea and vomiting (102), and epilepsy (88). More than half of the publications on medical cannabis originated from the United States, followed by Canada. More than 66% of the publications were original studies. The spike in the number of scientific publications on medical cannabis since 2013 is encouraging. In light of this trend the authors expect an even greater increase in the number of publications in this area in coming years."}, {"Title": "Survey of Australian psychiatrists' and psychiatry trainees' knowledge about and attitudes towards medicinal cannabinoids.", "Abstract": "To assess Australian psychiatrists' and psychiatry trainees' knowledge about and attitudes towards medicinal cannabinoids, given the recent relaxation of cannabinoid-prescribing laws in Australia.\nAll Australian members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists were invited to participate in an anonymous, 64-item online questionnaire, through Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists' newsletters. The questionnaire ran for a 10-week period from March to May 2017.

Diagnosing SM and monitoring treatment response can be quite complex, due in part to changing definitions of and scarcity of research about the disorder. Subjective self-reports and parent/teacher interviews can complicate SM diagnosis and therapy, given that similar speech problems of etiologically heterogeneous origin can be attributed to SM. The present perspective discusses the potential for passive audio capture to help overcome psychiatry's current lack of objective and quantifiable assessments in the context of SM. We present supportive evidence from two pilot studies indicating the feasibility of using a digital wearable device to quantify child vocalization features affected by SM. We also highlight comparative analyses of passive audio capture and its potential to enhance diagnostic characterizations for SM, as well as possible limitations of such technologies."}, {"Title": "In Cocaine Dependence, Neural Prediction Errors During Loss Avoidance Are Increased With Cocaine Deprivation and Predict Drug Use.", "Abstract": "In substance-dependent individuals, drug deprivation and drug use trigger divergent behavioral responses to environmental cues. These divergent responses are consonant with data showing that short- and long-term adaptations in dopamine signaling are similarly sensitive to state of drug use. The literature suggests a drug state-dependent role of learning in maintaining substance use; evidence linking dopamine to both reinforcement learning and addiction provides a framework to test this possibility.\nIn a randomized crossover design, 22 participants with current cocaine use disorder completed a probabilistic loss-learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging while on and off cocaine (44 sessions). Another 54 participants without Axis I psychopathology served as a secondary reference group. Within-drug state and paired-subjects' learning effects were assessed with computational model-derived individual learning parameters. Model-based neuroimaging analyses evaluated effects of drug use state on neural learning signals. Relationships among model-derived behavioral learning rates (\u03b1+, \u03b1-), neural prediction error signals (\u03b4+, \u03b4-), cocaine use, and desire to use were assessed.\nDuring cocaine deprivation, cocaine-dependent individuals exhibited heightened positive learning rates (\u03b1+), heightened neural positive prediction error (\u03b4+) responses, and heightened association of \u03b1+ with neural \u03b4+ responses. The deprivation-enhanced neural learning signals were specific to successful loss avoidance, comparable to participants without psychiatric conditions, and mediated a relationship between chronicity of drug use and desire to use cocaine.\nNeurocomputational learning signals are sensitive to drug use status and suggest that heightened reinforcement by successful avoidance of negative outcomes may contribute to drug seeking during deprivation. More generally, attention to drug use state is important for delineating substrates of addiction."}, {"Title": "Identifying value-based quality indicators for general hospital psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To define generic quality indicators for general hospital psychiatry from the perspectives of patients, professionals (physicians, nurses, and managers), and payers (health insurance companies).\nQuality variables were identified by reviewing the relevant literature.

These criteria yielded 2 samples for each sex (ACE survey item frequencies and values in collapsed and multiple-admission groups). Data were analyzed employing tetrachoric correlation, hierarchical regression, and polychoric factor analysis.\nHierarchical regression analysis identified that ICD-10 diagnostic categories, except for substance disorders, were not consistently related to ACE total score and tended to reduce the magnitude of the ACE total score in the multiple-admission group. Tetrachoric correlation revealed very low (< 0.4) positive and negative correlations between ICD-10 categories and ACE items in both multiple-admission and collapsed sample groups. Polychoric factor analysis indicated that the ACE survey items and the ICD-10 categories for both sexes were independent, with only the diagnostic ICD-10 category substance disorders being marginally associated with the ACE items factor for females.\nThe nominal relationship between ACE items and ICD-10 diagnostic categories indicates the need to include ACE assessment in advance of differential diagnosis and implementation of conventional mental health interventions for children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "Assessing the methodological quality of the Canadian Psychiatric Association's anxiety and depression clinical practice guidelines.", "Abstract": "Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) endeavour to incorporate the best available research evidence together with the clinically informed opinions of leading experts in order to guide clinical practice when dealing with a given condition.

However, patients suffering from depression benefit less from these health-promoting effects. Moreover, relationship quality and even partners' health has been found to be negatively affected by depressive symptomatology, which may result in overall impairments in social functioning of a romantic couple. Psychobiological research indicates that these impairments may be accompanied by a maladaptive regulation of the patient's neuroendocrine response to external stressors. Concerning the improvement of social functioning, first studies showed promising results of \"Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT\u00ae)\". However, randomised trials are still scarce. Previous programmes did not involve participation of the patient's romantic partner. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate whether a CBCT\u00ae programme adapted for couples (CBCT\u00ae-fC) can improve depressive symptoms, distress, social interaction skills and the neurobiological regulation of stress.\nCouples with the female partner suffering from depression will be invited to participate in a pre-to-post intervention assessment on two consecutive days, respectively, involving a standardised PSI task, eye-tracking, ECG recordings, saliva-sampling, blood-sampling and questionnaire data. After baseline assessment, participating couples will be randomised to either a 10\u2009week CBCT\u00ae-fC or to a treatment as usual control condition. The primary endpoint is the reduction of depressive symptoms measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

The numerous members of the tachykinin peptide family are involved in a multitude of neuronal signaling pathways, mediating sensations and emotional responses (Steinhoff et al. in Physiol Rev 94:265-301, 2014). In contrast to receptors for classical transmitters, such as glutamate (Parsons et al. in Handb Exp Pharmacol 249-303, 2005), only a minority of neurons in certain brain areas express neurokinin receptors (NKRs) (Mantyh in J Clin Psychiatry 63:6-10, 2002). SP is also expressed by a variety of non-neuronal cell types such as microglia, as well as immune cells (Mashaghi et al. in Cell Mol Life Sci 73:4249-4264, 2016). SP is an 11-amino acid neuropeptide that preferentially activates the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R). It transmits nociceptive signals via primary afferent fibers to spinal and brainstem second-order neurons (Cao et al. in Nature 392:390-394, 1998). Compounds that inhibit SP's action are being investigated as potential drugs to relieve pain. More recently, SP and NKR have gained attention for their role in complex psychiatric processes. It is a key goal in the field of pain research to understand mechanisms involved in the transition between acute pain and chronic pain. The influence of emotional and cognitive inputs and feedbacks from different brain areas makes pain not only a perception but an experience (Zieglg\u00e4nsberger et al. in CNS Spectr 10:298-308, 2005; Trenkwaldner et al.

Mainly descriptive-classificatory taxonomies like DSM dominate the field. New taxonomies such as Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) aim to collect scientific knowledge regarding \"systems\" for \"processes\" of the brain. These terms have a supradisciplinary\" meaning if they are considered in context of Systems Science. This field emerges as a platform of theories like general systems theory, catastrophe theory, synergetics, chaos theory, etc. It provides a lot of abstract concepts, constructs, methods and models. We assume that these tools also enable theoretical integration in the diversified field of clinical practice in the sciences of the mind. Additionally, systems thinking in clinical psychology improves conceptual links to currently network-oriented neurobiology. However, clear definitions of systemic terms are necessary to emerge from their mainly metaphorical use. Here we revise mainly terms like \"structure\", \"process\" and \"dynamics\" as they are used already in psychology, psychoanalysis, psychopathology and psychiatry in an ill-defined way. For instance, affective-cognitive structures like \"life space\" or \"object representations\" can be seen as products of mental processing. These structures, in turn, modulate dynamics of mental processes. Additionally, we suggest a coupled network concept of emotions and motivations as the main subsystem that modulates mental dynamics that results in a qualitative systemic model of the mind.

In the wake of the immense technical advances, however, psychopathology has been increasingly marginalized by neurobiological, genetic, and neuropsychological research. This ongoing erosion of psychiatric phenomenology is further fostered by clinical casualness as well as pressured health care and research systems. The skill to precisely and carefully assess psychopathology in a qualified manner used to be a core attribute of mental health professionals, but today's curricula pay increasingly less attention to its training, thus blurring the border between pathology and variants of the \"normal\" further. Despite all prophecies that psychopathology was doomed, and with neurobiological parameters having yet to show their differential-diagnostic superiority and value for differential indication, psychiatric diagnosis continues to rely exclusively on psychopathology in DSM-5 and ICD-11. Their categorical systematic, however, is equally challenged, and, supported by advances in machine learning, a personalized symptom-based approach to precision psychiatry is increasingly advocated. The current paper reviews the objectives of psychopathology and the recent debate on the role of psychopathology in future precision psychiatry-from guiding neurobiological research by relating neurobiological changes to patients' experiences to giving a framework to the psychiatric encounter. It concludes that contemporary research and clinic in psychiatry do not need less but rather more differentiated psychopathologic approaches in order to develop approaches that integrate professional knowledge and patients' experience."}, {"Title": "Need for evidence-based early intervention programmes: a public health perspective.", "Abstract": "This paper attempts to discuss why the early intervention agenda based on the current convention of 'ultra-high risk' (UHR) or 'clinical high risk' (CHR) for 'transition' to psychosis framework has been destined to fall short of generating a measurable and economically feasible public health impact. To summarise: (1) the primary determinant of the 'transition' rate is not the predictive value of the UHR/CHR but the degree of the risk-enrichment; (2) even with a significant pre-test risk enrichment, the prognostic accuracy of the assessment tools in help-seeking population is mediocre, failing to meet the bare minimum thresholds; (3) therapeutic interventions arguably prolong the time-to-onset of psychotic symptoms instead of preventing 'transition', given that the UHR/CHR and 'transition' lie on the same unidimensional scale of positive psychotic symptoms; (4) meta-analytical evidence confirms that specific effective treatment for preventing 'transition' (the goal-primary outcome-of the UHR/CHR framework) is not available; (5) the UHR/CHR-'transition' is a precarious target for research given the unpredictability driven by the sampling strategies and the natural ebb and flow of psychotic symptoms within and between individuals, leading to false positives; (6) only a negligible portion of those who develop psychosis benefits from UHR/CHR services (see <i>prevention paradox</i>); (7) limited data on the cost-effectiveness of these services exist. Given the pitfalls of the narrow focus of the UHR/CHR framework, a broader prevention strategy embracing pluripotency of early psychopathology seems to serve as a better alternative.

Although extensive studies have been conducted, the progress in developing effective therapies for these diseases has still been slow. The current dilemma reminds us that the human being is a superorganism. Only when we take the human self and its partner microbiota into consideration at the same time, can we better understand these diseases. Over the last few centuries, the partner microbiota has experienced tremendous change, much more than human genes, because of the modern transformations in diet, lifestyle, medical care, and so on, parallel to the modern epidemiological transition. Existing research indicates that gut microbiota plays an important role in this transition. According to gut-brain psychology, the gut microbiota is a crucial part of the gut-brain network, and it communicates with the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota almost develops synchronously with the gut-brain, brain, and mind. The gut microbiota influences various normal mental processes and mental phenomena, and is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous mental and neurological diseases. Targeting the microbiota in therapy for these diseases is a promising approach that is supported by three theories: the gut microbiota hypothesis, the \"old friend\" hypothesis, and the leaky gut theory. The effects of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior are fulfilled by the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which is mainly composed of the nervous pathway, endocrine pathway, and immune pathway. Undoubtedly, gut-brain psychology will bring great enhancement to psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Various microbiota-improving methods including fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, a healthy diet, and healthy lifestyle have shown the capability to promote the function of the gut-brain, microbiota-gut-brain axis, and brain.

With aging, comorbidities are more the rule, than an exception and may significantly influence on the final treatment outcome. Epigenetic modulation, resilience and life style are key determinants of the health and very important issues for understanding therapeutic mechanisms and responses. There is a hope that epigenetic profiling before treatment could be used in near future to increase the likelihood of good treatment response by selecting the appropriate medication. The aim of this paper is to offer an overview of the main aspects of epigenetic modulation, resilience and comorbidities and their role in developing the concept of personalized medicine. While waiting for more precise and reliable treatment guidelines it is possible to increase treatment effectiveness in psychiatry and neurology by enhancing individual resilience of patients and managing comorbidities properly."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the Impact of an Innovative Public Speaking Competition to Promote Psychiatry as a Career Option for Ghanaian Medical Students.", "Abstract": "The psychiatrist workforce has been identified as an area in need of development, especially in low- to middle-income countries. The purpose of this project is to assess the perceptions of Ghanaian medical students of a novel mental health inter-medical school speaking competition on career interest in psychiatry and mental health education and advocacy.\nThe study employed quantitative and qualitative methods in a cross-sectional design. A paper-based survey was administered to medical students from four schools in Ghana, and focus groups were conducted.\nA 52% response rate (545/1041 fifth- and sixth-year medical students from the four public medical schools in Ghana) was achieved. The competition was successful in stimulating interest in psychiatry as a subject (25%) and as a career (14%) and was viewed as serving an important public health and mental health advocacy function (65% and 66% respectively). The competition stimulated interest in students who were undecided or had previously ruled out psychiatry specialization, in both those who had and had not already completed a psychiatry clerkship (23% and 13% before and after completing a clinical rotation in psychiatry, respectively). Overall, 29% of respondents who participated in at least one competition-related activity reported that the competition stimulated their interest in psychiatry, compared to 4% who did not participate in any competition-related activity (\u04fc<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200980, p\u2009=\u20090.0).

However, many mental disorders are persistent and negatively affect quality of life as well as life expectancy. This tension between treatment goals and the actual illness trajectory has evoked a growing academic interest in 'palliative psychiatry', namely the application of a palliative care approach in patients with severe persistent mental illness. Recently, Trachsel <i>et al</i> presented a working definition of palliative psychiatry. This first official attempt to capture the concept is based on WHO's widely accepted definition of palliative care but modified and limited to include only severe persistent psychiatric illness. While this is a welcome step in the discussion on palliative care approaches in psychiatry, it also opens up for new questions. One of the most evident is whether psychiatry actually needs its own definition of palliative care or, put differently, whether there is something about mental disorders that differs so radically from other medical conditions that it calls for a separate definition. We acknowledge the need to discuss the goals of psychiatric care in patients with severe persistent psychiatric illness. However, we question whether a separate definition of palliative care exclusive to psychiatry is the right way to go. In this paper, we discuss why."}, {"Title": "Community Screening for Psychiatric Morbidity in Four Remote Valleys of Hindu Kush and Karakoram Regions of Pakistan.", "Abstract": "To find out the frequency of psychiatric morbidity in patients reporting to general medical camps in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges of Pakistan.\nA cross-sectional study.\nFour different valleys of the region, with the Psychiatry Department, Combined Military Hospital, Gilgit as the base, from August 2015 to December 2016.\nConsenting adults of either gender, reporting to medical camps for various health related issues were administered Bradford Somatic Inventory 21 (BSI 21) and Self Report Questionnaire (SRQ).

We here report the case of a patient who developed metformin-associated lactic acidosis without organ manifestations, due to the simultaneous ingestion of an overdose of metformin and alcohol, and who recovered with high-flow high-volume intermittent hemodiafiltration.\nA 44-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes attempted suicide by ingesting 10 tablets of metformin 500\u00a0mg and drinking approximately 600\u00a0mL of Japanese sake containing 15% alcohol. She was transferred to our emergency department because of disturbed consciousness. Continuous intravenous administration of noradrenalin (0.13\u00a0\u03bcg/kg per minute) was given because she was in shock. Laboratory findings included a lactate level of 119\u00a0mg/dL (13.2\u00a0mmol/L), bicarbonate of 14.5\u00a0mmol/L, and serum metformin concentration of 1138\u00a0ng/mL.

The second objective was to examine the perceived importance of aspects of professionalism and compare these descriptively among the various health practitioners and patients.\nParticipants completed the Professionalism Mini-Evaluation Exercise Questionnaire in evaluating the professionalism of the registrar. The number of questionnaires completed by patients, allied health practitioners, consultant psychiatrists and psychiatry registrars were, respectively, 100, 50, 25 and 20; thus, 195 in total. This previously validated questionnaire consists of 21 items that enquire about doctor-patient relationship skills, reflective skills, time management and interprofessional relationship skills. Participants also ranked the three items of the questionnaire that they considered most important.\nHighly statistically significant differences among four groups emerged for both the total and all four subscale scores, with patients generally rating the professionalism of registrars as lower, and not meeting with expectations. All four groups ranked 'listened actively to patient' and 'showed interest in patient as person' highly. Patients and allied health practitioners ranked the attribute 'was on time' highly, while consultants and registrars did not.\nImproving professionalism requires that the attributes 'listening actively to patient' and 'recognising and meeting patient needs' are taken seriously. Doing so requires that patients also evaluate the professionalism of registrars, rather than relying merely on the evaluation by consultants as being sufficient."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatric assessment process and outcome in state patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.", "Abstract": "Individuals who were charged with a serious offence may be referred by courts for forensic psychiatric assessment.

Many neuropsychiatric diseases including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders arise from an inability to weaken and/or strengthen pathologic and beneficial circuits, respectively, ultimately leading to maladaptive behavioral responses. Thus, compounds capable of facilitating the structural and functional reorganization of neural circuits to produce positive behavioral effects have broad therapeutic potential. Several known drugs and experimental therapeutics have been shown to promote plasticity, but most rely on indirect mechanisms and are slow-acting. Here, I describe psychoplastogens-a relatively new class of fast-acting therapeutics, capable of <i>rapidly</i> promoting structural and functional neural plasticity. Psychoplastogenic compounds include psychedelics, ketamine, and several other recently discovered fast-acting antidepressants. Their use in psychiatry represents a paradigm shift in our approach to treating brain disorders as we focus less on rectifying \"chemical imbalances\" and place more emphasis on achieving selective modulation of neural circuits."}, {"Title": "Fetishism in ADHD: an impulsive behaviour or a paraphilic disorder?", "Abstract": "A boy with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) presented with a fetish for and the subsequent stealing of female undergarments.

Respondents included psychiatric ward directors (13.1%), senior psychiatrists and psychologists (40.5%), and psychiatry and clinical psychology residents (36%).\nFifty-three percent of respondents reported encountering instances where a schizophrenia diagnosis was assigned even though clinical presentation did not match diagnostic criteria. Seventy-three percent of senior psychiatrists in a position to determine a diagnosis declared assigning schizophrenia even when controversial among clinical staff, and 15% of them declared doing so frequently. The likelihood of frequently assigning a schizophrenia diagnosis even when clearly controversial was predicted by the perception that an inaccurate diagnosis is assigned due to the presence of negative symptoms (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.04-4.66, p\u2009=\u20090.039) and due to patient-related factors, such as the need to facilitate rehabilitation (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.07-2.90, p\u2009=\u20090.024).\nAlthough a schizophrenia diagnosis is considered relatively stable and clear, our study indicates that, in clinical practice, the assignment of this diagnosis is frequently controversial.

Modifications to treatment included using non-verbal actions (e.g., \"high fives\" as praises), sign language and using only one-step basic commands, which greatly improved compliance. In a matter of weeks, the patient demonstrated remarkable improvement in her disruptive behavior as evidenced by parent/daycare report and clinical observation. Surprisingly her vocabulary more than doubled and her ability of self-expression also increased; she was able to point to things and ask for them.

Predicting patients at risk and leveraging accelerated interventions can reduce the rates of early readmission, a negative clinical outcome (i.e., a treatment failure) that affects the quality of life of patient. To implement individualized interventions, it is necessary to predict those individuals at highest risk for 30-day readmission. In this study, our aim was to conduct a data-driven investigation to find the pharmacological factors influencing 30-day all-cause, intra- and interdepartmental readmissions after an index psychiatric admission, using the compendium of prescription data (prescriptome) from electronic medical records (EMR).\nThe data scientists in the project received a deidentified database from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse, which was used to perform all analyses. Data was stored in a secured MySQL database, normalized and indexed using a unique hexadecimal identifier associated with the data for psychiatric illness visits. We used Bayesian logistic regression models to evaluate the association of prescription data with 30-day readmission risk. We constructed individual models and compiled results after adjusting for covariates, including drug exposure, age, and gender. We also performed digital comorbidity survey using EMR data combined with the estimation of shared genetic architecture using genomic annotations to disease phenotypes.\nUsing an automated, data-driven approach, we identified prescription medications, side effects (primary side effects), and drug-drug interaction-induced side effects (secondary side effects) associated with readmission risk in a cohort of 1275 patients using prescriptome analytics. In our study, we identified 28 drugs associated with risk for readmission among psychiatric patients. Based on prescription data, Pravastatin had the highest risk of readmission (OR\u2009=\u200913.10; 95% CI (2.82, 60.8)).

Converging digital health data from EMRs and systems biology investigations reveal a subset of patient populations that have significant comorbidities with cardiovascular diseases are more likely to be readmitted. Further, the genetic architecture of psychiatric illness also suggests overlap with cardiovascular diseases. In summary, assessment of medications, side effects, and drug-drug interactions in a clinical setting as well as genomic information using a data mining approach could help to find factors that could help to lower readmission rates in patients with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Acute fluoxetine differently affects aggressive display in zebrafish phenotypes.", "Abstract": "Zebrafish have been introduced as a model organism in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry, increasing the breadth of findings using fish to study the neurobiology of aggression. Phenotypic differences between leopard and longfin zebrafish were exploited in order to elucidate the role of phasic serotonin in aggressive displays on this species. The present study, revealed differences in aggressive display between leopard and longfin zebrafish, and a discrepant effect of acute fluoxetine in both populations. In mirror-induced aggression, leopard animals showed higher display latencies than longfin, as well as lower display duration and frequency (Experiment 1). Moreover, 2.5\u2009mg/kg fluoxetine decreased the duration and frequency of display in longfin, but not leopard; and 5\u2009mg/kg fluoxetine increased display frequency in leopard, but not longfin (Experiment 2). It is suggested that zebrafish from the longfin phenotype show more aggressive motivation and readiness in the mirror-induced aggression test than leopard, and that acute fluoxetine increases aggression in leopard and decreased it in longfin zebrafish."}, {"Title": "Annual Research Review: Developmental computational psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Most psychiatric disorders emerge during childhood and adolescence. This is also a period that coincides with the brain undergoing substantial growth and reorganisation. However, it remains unclear how a heightened vulnerability to psychiatric disorder relates to this brain maturation. Here, we propose 'developmental computational psychiatry' as a framework for linking brain maturation to cognitive development. We argue that through modelling some of the brain's fundamental cognitive computations, and relating them to brain development, we can bridge the gap between brain and cognitive development. This in turn can lead to a richer understanding of the ontogeny of psychiatric disorders. We illustrate this perspective with examples from reinforcement learning and dopamine function. Specifically, we show how computational modelling deepens an understanding of how cognitive processes, such as reward learning, effort learning, and social learning might go awry in psychiatric disorders. Finally, we sketch the promises and limitations of a developmental computational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Examining the 'psychopharmacology revolution' (1950-1980) through the advertising of psychoactive drugs in the British Medical Journal.", "Abstract": "Many modern pharmaceutical products were launched during 1950-1980, as reflected in advertisements in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ). One of the first therapeutic areas to benefit from novel effective medications was psychiatry.\nWe examined BMJ advertising material between 1950 and 1980, including every other issue over six-month periods (October-March) in 1950/1951, 1955/1956, 1957/1958, 1960/1961, 1962/1963, 1965/1966, 1967/1968, 1970/1971, 1972/1973, 1975/1976, 1980/1981. We recorded numbers of adverts for all pharmaceutical products and for psychiatric drugs; we also recorded trade names, generic names and marketing company.\nAdvertising in BMJ peaked in the 1960s and declined markedly in the 1970s. Adverts for psychiatric drugs as a percentage of total pharmaceutical product advertising was broadly similar during 1955-1980, but with peaks in 1960/1961, 1970/1971 and 1975/1976, reflecting the entry of several novel compounds into the market. The peak marketing of antipsychotic drugs, sedatives and anxiolytic drugs was in 1960 and of antidepressants 1970. The time course of the rise of tricyclics and the switch from barbiturates to benzodiazepines can be seen. Drugs for psychiatry rose from ninth (1955/1956) to fourth (1975/1976) in terms of the number of products in the top 10 therapeutic areas. There is no evidence that they were advertised more aggressively (number of adverts/number of products).\nThe birth of modern psychopharmacology is reflected in th e advertising of psychiatric drugs in BMJ. Many drugs currently used, or their closely related successors, were launched in the early to mid-1960s. This rise in modern pharmaceuticals preceded several other major therapeutic areas."}, {"Title": "Religious delusions in older adults: Diagnoses, combinations, and delusional characteristics.", "Abstract": "Religious delusions (RDs) tend to occur relatively often in patients with affective or non-affective psychosis. Few studies exist about RDs in later life. The current study explores (1) the distribution of RDs across diagnosis, (2) how RDs relate to other types of delusions, and (3) how RDs relate to several dimensions or characteristics of delusions.\nInpatients and outpatients in a Geriatric Psychiatry Department in the Netherlands (N\u00a0=\u00a0155; mean age 76.5\u00a0years), and who were diagnosed with an affective or non-affective psychotic disorder, participated in semi structured diagnostic interviews, using the Schedules for Clinical Assessement in Neuropsychiatry 2.1.\nReligious delusions were most common among patients with psychotic depression (47%) and schizophrenia (32%). The RDs frequently co-occurred with other types of delusions. When combined with delusions of grandeur, RDs were more often classified as bizarre and were accompanied by higher levels of positive psychotic symptoms. When combined with delusions of guilt, RDs were associated with higher levels of distress and a shorter disease duration. The delusional characteristics bizarreness, frequency of psychotic symptoms, and degree of distress were more prevalent for RDs than for any other type of delusion.\nThe current study suggests that the prevalence of RDs in older adults is particularly high in late life psychotic depression. Also, in later life, RDs can be perceived of as independent marker of complex psychotic states, and as a denominator of severe arousal with respect to existential concerns."}, {"Title": "Dr Eveleen O'Brien (1901-1981).", "Abstract": "Dr Eveleen O'Brien (1901-1981) was a leading figure in Irish asylum medicine, with a particular interest in the care of patients suffering from epilepsy and the crossover between neurology and psychiatry.

Women had BD without psychotropic exposure (BD-NP, n\u202f=\u202f38), BD with psychotropic treatment (BD-P, n\u202f=\u202f49), or neither psychotropic exposure nor major mood disorder (Comp, n\u202f=\u202f87). Maternal characteristics were completed at 20 weeks gestation and evaluated for associations with delivery and birth outcomes. We performed multiple regressions on infant outcomes with adjustment for maternal age, race, employment status, use of illicit drugs and pre-pregnancy BMI.\nThe BP-P, BP-NP and Comp groups varied significantly on sociodemographic characteristics. Women with BD were more likely to be less educated, unemployed, single, and use tobacco and illicit drugs than women in the Comp group. Compared to women with BD-NP, women with BD-P were more likely to be older and educated. Approximately 10% of all infants were delivered preterm. No significant differences in outcome occurred for APGAR scores\u202f<\u202f8, NICU admissions, sex or infant length. Infants of mothers with BD-NP had significantly smaller head circumferences (HC) than the other groups, adjustment for confounding variables mitigated this association.\nThe overall pregnancy outcomes for women with BD were similar to those in the Comp group. The reduced HC in women with untreated BD appears due to factors related to disadvantaged sociodemographic status, a higher proportion of female births, and/or a protective effect of medication in the BD-P group."}, {"Title": "Showers: from a violent treatment to an agent of cleansing.", "Abstract": "In the early nineteenth century, physicians designed the first manufactured showers for the purpose of curing the insane.

This study aims to understand the religious landscape in Brazil and to investigate the feasibility of carrying out a representative nation-wide survey without interviewers, comparing it with other representative face-to-face surveys. We conducted a nationwide online survey representing all regions in Brazil. These results were compared with five other Brazilian representative surveys. A total of 1169 individuals completed the online questionnaires. The percentage of participants according to the gender and in relation to the Brazilian region was quite similar for all surveys. However, the online survey had the higher level of education among all surveys. In relation to the religious characteristics, the percentage of each variable varied from survey to survey. Those surveys originally designed to assess religion tended to yield more religious affiliations and less ceiling effects. The online survey was able to identify more diverse religious affiliations and more balanced responses in the religious attendance and importance of religion in life. The present study found that, even in nation-wide representative surveys, there are important differences in the results obtained while investigating religion. These differences could be associated with the type of data collection (face-to-face and online), the design of the study (originally designed to investigate religion or not) and options and the type of the questions used."}, {"Title": "The relationship between problematic smartphone use and psychiatric symptoms among adolescents who applied to psychiatry clinics.", "Abstract": "Problematic mobile phone use is an important problem which has increasing prevalence among adolescents.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of problematic smartphone use among adolescents who were referred to clinics, its relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric symptoms and emotion regulation problems. We included 150 adolescents aged 12-18 years who own smartphones. All participants filled out the Sociodemographic Information Form, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and Problematic Mobile Phone Use Scale (PMPUS). Problematic smart phone use was detected in 50.6% of the sample. Adolescents with problematic use were found to be older than the others, with lower levels of maternal education and self-achievement. Regression analysis revealed that the factors predicting the risk of problematic smartphone use are somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and hostility symptoms. According to our results, we suggest psychiatrists consider the high prevalence of problematic smartphone use, address the relationship between hostility, somatic symptoms and interpersonal sensitivity (susceptibility) and the effects of this current problem on social-academic functioning while evaluating and treating adolescents."}, {"Title": "Pharmacological interventions in social cognition deficits: A systematic mapping review.", "Abstract": "Social cognition is an important research field in psychiatry due to its relevance in the functioning and quality of life of patients. The objective of this work is to conduct a systematic mapping review of pharmacological strategies for improving social cognition deficits. Publications from 2006 to 2016 were reviewed in Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase. From the initial 1059 publications obtained, a final number of 110 were selected. The results show an increasing interest in pharmacological approaches in different medical fields (especially psychiatry, pharmacology, and endocrinology, with schizophrenia and autism as the most studied disorders), as can be observed in the progressive increase in the number of publications, the high degree of scientific evidence, and the high impact factor of publications. However, it is also observed that most studies were conducted with oxytocin, psychostimulants, and antipsychotics (mainly risperidone and olanzapine), with few studies using other drugs. In the different social cognition domains, the majority of publications were focused on emotional processing or theory of mind, with few studies in other domains.

There is compelling evidence to suggest that cognitive impairment contributes directly to functional disability and reduced quality of like across these disorders. As current treatments focus heavily on \"primary\" symptoms of mood and psychosis, the standard of care typically leaves cognitive deficits unmanaged. With this in mind, the field has recently begun to consider intervening directly on this important symptom domain, with several ongoing trials in schizophrenia. Fewer studies have targeted cognition in bipolar disorder and still fewer in MDD. With progress toward considering this domain as a target for treatment comes the need for consensus guidelines and methodological recommendations on cognitive trial design. In this manuscript, we first summarize the work conducted to date in this area for schizophrenia and for bipolar disorder.

The advantages and efficiency of the device are supported by multiple clinical trials and outcome studies, leading to its popularity among cardiologists. Implantation of the device is not without adverse outcomes. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement has been found to lead to negative psychological and psychosocial sequelae such as apprehension to engage in physical activity, chronic anxiety, decreased physical and social functioning, a nagging fear of being shocked by the device, and the development of \"phantom shocks.\" Defined as patient-reported shocks in the absence of evidence that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device has discharged, phantom shocks could impact the mental health of those affected. This article reviews the case of Mr. L, a 47-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy who was seen by the psychiatry consultation team while under cardiologic care because he reported that his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device had been shocking him despite no objective evidence after interrogating the device.

As secondary aims, the study confirmed the effects in subjects with minimal benefit from standard treatments and in subjects with anxious distress. Despite some reported side effects such as akathisia, restlessness, and increased weight, the treatment was well tolerated. Expert opinion: The unique pharmacodynamic profile of brexpiprazole, in terms of reduced dopamine intrinsic stimulation and a range of other more anxiolytic receptor effects, suggests that brexpiprazole should be preferred in specific subpopulations, particularly where a more sedative profile is needed.

Current Updates.", "Abstract": "Specialists in addiction medicine continue to debate whether baclofen is still indicated to treat alcohol use disorders in view of conflicting results as to its efficacy. This review summarizes current knowledge on self-poisoning with baclofen focusing of alcohol-use disorder in order to provide an overview of the reliable scientific knowledge on management of such an intoxication. Moreover, as alcohol-dependent patients experience many psychiatric co-morbidities, the risk in suicide attempt using baclofen seems real. Numerous studies have suggested that patients given daily-doses of baclofen higher than 80 mg/day are more likely to attempt suicides than others. Following an ingestion of a large amount of baclofen, central nervous system depression is usually observed. Seizures require the patient to be admitted in intensive care unit and should be treated like other toxicological seizures. Cardiac complications include prolonged QTc interval, degree heart block, premature atrial contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia, hypotension and bradycardia. In cases of intoxication, the elimination half-life of baclofen may last between 12 and 36 h post-overdose and renal failure is known to delay its clearance. Rarely measured in clinical practice, the toxic level of baclofen blood level ranges from 1.1 to 3.5 mg/l, and coma or fatal intoxication are observed from 6 to 9.6 mg/l. Baclofen withdrawal has been observed but making the diagnosis of withdrawal in case of suspected self-poisoning is difficult as baclofen intoxication and baclofen withdrawal share many clinical signs. Admission to hospital to manage of suicide attempt with baclofen is mandatory and should not be limited to baclofen alone. It needs to include other aspects of the overall care of patients with alcohol disorders (psychological and psychosocial interventions, management of comorbid mental conditions and physical complications)."}, {"Title": "Trajectories of callous-unemotional traits from childhood to adolescence in referred youth with a disruptive behavior disorder who received intensive multimodal therapy in childhood.", "Abstract": "Our aims were to explore the developmental trajectories of callous-unemotional (CU) traits using a growth curve analysis in Italian children with disruptive behavior disorders treated with a multimodal intervention, and to test both predictors and distal outcomes of CU traits trajectories.\nOne hundred and sixty-eight children were enrolled, of whom 24 were lost in the follow-up and 144 were followed up from ages 8-9 to 14-15 years with four assessment points. Patients included 128 males (88.9%) with a mean age of 8.7 years, 96 with oppositional defiant disorder (66.7%) and 48 with conduct disorder (CD) (33.3%). The developmental trajectories of CU traits were assessed with the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (ICU).\nOur findings revealed that CU features were likely to fit a quadratic model from childhood to adolescence. The CU traits tended to decrease during childhood, with stabilization in adolescence and a significant variability in the growth curves. Pretreatment CD and higher levels of externalizing behavioral problems were associated with higher level of CU traits at baseline, whereas positive parenting was associated with lower levels. No significant effects were found for all the other predictors (socioeconomic status, negative parenting, combined pharmacotherapy). Regarding outcomes into adolescence, both higher levels of CU traits at the baseline and a lower decrease of CU traits across time points predicted a higher risk of CD diagnosis, and higher rate of referrals to mental health services and of substance use. Furthermore, pretreatment CD and negative parenting predicted a higher risk of substance use into adolescence.\nOur findings suggest that a close monitoring of CU traits in referred children with disruptive behavior disorders may help to detect the patients at higher risk of poor outcome."}, {"Title": "Ernst Tr\u00f6mner: beyond the reflex hammer.", "Abstract": "Ernst Tr\u00f6mner (1868-1930) was a German neurologist and psychiatrist at the St. Georg Hospital in Hamburg.

The study aims to assess the opinions and values of relevant stakeholders with regard to the requirements for implementing open wards in psychiatric hospitals.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 psychiatrists, 15 psychiatric nurses and 15 patients, and were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.\nThe interviewees identified conceptual, personnel and spatial requirements necessary for an open door policy. Observation and door watch concepts are judged to be essential for open wards, and patients appreciate the therapeutic value they hold. However, nurses find the door watch problematic. All groups suggest seclusion or small locked divisions as a possible way of handling agitated patients. All stakeholders agree that such concepts can only succeed if sufficient, qualified staff is available. They also agree that freedom of movement is a key element in the management of acutely ill patients, which can be achieved with an open door policy. Finally, the interviewees suggested removing the door from direct view to prevent absconding.\nFor psychiatric institutions seeking to implement (partially) open wards, the present results may have high practical relevance.

This study explored subjective and objective patterns of sleep disturbance and contributory environmental factors. Participants were recruited from mental health acute admission wards and had a range of subjective and objective assessments of sleep. Light intensity and noise levels were measured to characterise potential environmental causes for poor sleep.\nWe recruited 20 patients; 15% were high risk for obstructive sleep apnoea. Nineteen participants reported poor sleep quality on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 90% had significant sleep fragmentation with objective measures. Inside light levels were low (day <200 lux and night <10 lux). Night sound levels were 40-90 db.Clinical implicationsSleep disturbance was highly prevalent. Increased awareness of sleep disorders is needed. Modifiable environmental factors on the ward were implicated, therefore increased awareness and a change of approach to sleep disturbance in in-patient psychiatry is recommended.Declaration of interestNone."}, {"Title": "Prevalence rates of arthritis among US older adults with varying degrees of depression: Findings from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.", "Abstract": "Arthritis and depressive symptoms often interact and negatively influence one another to worsen mental and physical health outcomes.

We have previously demonstrated the ability of an objective cognitive battery, the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP), to differentiate adult ADHD patients from healthy controls in five cognitive domains. Here, we further characterize these subtle cognitive deficits by conducting additional univariate analyses on our ADHD dataset to assess the contributions of various demographic characteristics on SCIP performance and to determine correlations between SCIP scores and scores on other measures evaluating illness severity, perceived cognitive deficits, and overall functioning. Age and years of education were moderately associated with performance on the SCIP and/or its subscales in our ADHD cohort. The SCIP global index score was moderately correlated with clinician-rated measures of illness severity and weakly associated with clinician-rated overall functional status. Intriguingly, overall SCIP performance was only weakly associated with patient self-reported measures of cognitive functioning. Of practical importance, small-to-moderate associations were consistently observed between performances on two subscales of the SCIP and the other measures evaluating illness severity, overall functioning, and patient self-reported cognitive functioning (the working memory and visuomotor tracking subscales). Thus, these data demonstrate that the SCIP, particularly the working memory and visuomotor tracking subscales, is sensitive enough to detect cognitive deficits in adult patients with ADHD, and that these deficits are correlated with functional impairments. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of integrating both objective and subjective evaluations of cognition in adult ADHD."}, {"Title": "DSM-5 Level 2 Sleep Disorders Scale Validity and Reliability of Turkish Form (Form for Children Aged 11-17 Years and Parent Form for Children Aged 6-17 Years).", "Abstract": "This study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of Turkish version of DSM-5 Level 2 Sleep Disorders Scale.\nThe scale was prepared by translation and back translation of DSM-5 Level 2 Sleep Disorders Scale.

Despite targeted psychopharmacological strategies and complementary psychotherapeutic procedures only moderate effects are obtained, and the risk of relapse is high in many patients. Worldwide, psychiatric diseases such as depression are continuously increasing, challenging the personal life of the affected as well as their families, but also whole societies by increasing disability, early retirement and hospitalization. According to current scientific knowledge psychiatric disorders are caused by a multifactorial pathogenesis, including genetics, inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalance; furthermore, also lifestyle-associated factors gain rising importance. In line with this, there is growing evidence that the gut microbiota and nutrition have an impact on the onset and course of psychiatric disorders.\nThis narrative review highlights the important role of nutrition in psychiatric care and underlines the significance of nutritional advice in the multifactorial, biopsychosocial treatment of patients. It focuses on current dietary interventions such as the Mediterranean diet, dietary supplements and modifications of the gut microbiota with pre-, pro- and postbiotics.\nRecent studies support the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties and the support of neurogenesis. Dietary coaching to improve mental health seems to be an additional, cost-effective, practical, nonpharmacological intervention for individuals with psychiatric disorders.\nThe use of nutritional interventions in psychiatry equips therapists with a promising tool for both the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders.

Maternal infectious pathogens and inflammation are plausible risk factors for these outcomes and have been associated with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and bipolar disorder. Concurrent with epidemiologic research are animal models of prenatal immune activation, which have documented behavioral, neurochemical, neuroanatomic, and neurophysiologic disruptions that mirror phenotypes observed in these neuropsychiatric disorders. Epidemiologic studies of maternal immune activation offer the advantage of directly evaluating human populations but are limited in their ability to uncover pathogenic mechanisms. Animal models, on the other hand, are limited in their generalizability to psychiatric disorders but have made significant strides toward discovering causal relationships and biological pathways between maternal immune activation and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Incorporating these risk factors in reverse translational animal models of maternal immune activation has yielded a wealth of data supporting the predictive potential of epidemiologic studies. To further enhance the translatability between epidemiology and basic science, the authors propose a complementary approach that includes deconstructing neuropsychiatric outcomes of maternal immune activation into key pathophysiologically defined phenotypes that are identifiable in humans and animals and that evaluate the interspecies concordance regarding interactions between maternal immune activation and genetic and epigenetic factors, including processes involving intergenerational disease transmission.

However, the natural course of CHD is complicated by noncardiac medical problems. Aim of the study was to evaluate noncardiac comorbidities in a contemporary cohort of adults with CHD (ACHD).\nIn a tertiary care center for ACHD, 821 consecutive patients, admitted to the outpatient clinic, were evaluated for clinically relevant noncardiac comorbidities.\nThe consecutively included patients (age: range, 15-80 years; 56% female) represent all types and severity grades of acyanotic and cyanotic CHD. A considerable proportion of ACHD had significant noncardiac comorbidities, which have the potential to profoundly influence the natural course of the underlying disease. In 95.5%, relevant non-cardiac comorbidities were apparent, that could be related to 16 special medical fields as endocrinologic/metabolic disease, gastroenterology/hepatology, gynecology/obstetrics, angiology, orthopedics, neurology/psychiatry and others. Most frequently seen comorbidities were endocrine and metabolic disorders (43.97%).\nNon-cardiac comorbidities are increasingly common in ACHD. The data revealed non-cardiac comorbidities as they were presented in the cohort of ACHD seen in a tertiary center. The study proves that ACHD with significant non-cardiac comorbidities need multidisciplinary care by medical organ specialists, aside the congenital cardiologist, with a deep knowledge about congenital heart defects, the special effects of the organ disease on the particular heart defect and, how the heart defect may affect the course of the particular organ disease. The study may create the basis for the development of screening programs for comorbidities in ACHD as well as a multidisciplinary concept for diagnosis and treatment of concomitant disorders or for disease prevention. Particularly disease prevention may improve quality of life as well as the further fate of the affected patients."}, {"Title": "Reliability and validity of the Chinese version of Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties for Chinese children or adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a cross-sectional survey.", "Abstract": "The Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties (QCD) has been developed and used to evaluate daily-life problems in children during specified periods of the day. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the QCD for Chinese children or adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nOutpatients with ADHD aged 6-18 years who visited psychiatry clinics were enrolled at four study centers in China. Patients with severe psychiatric disorders were excluded. Parents of all enrolled patients were given the QCD, the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham IV (SNAP-IV), and the Weiss Functional Impairment Scale-Parent (WFIRS-P) questionnaires and were asked to complete all three questionnaires. The reliability of the QCD was examined by Cronbach's alpha, which assessed the internal consistency of the questionnaire. Concurrent criterion validity of QCD scores was examined by Spearman's correlation of QCD with SNAP-IV and WFIRS-P scores.\nA total of 200 Chinese patients were analyzed (average age, 10.4\u00b12.66 years). The majority of patients were male (77.5%), and 49.0% had the combined ADHD subtype. Cronbach's alpha for QCD was 0.88. Correlation coefficients of the QCD total score with SNAP-IV total score and WFIRS-P average score were -0.47 and -0.57, respectively. Correlations for the QCD with SNAP-IV and WFIRS-P were statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.01). The area under the curve for sensitivity and specificity of the QCD compared with the SNAP-IV and WFIRS-P was 0.70 and 0.71, respectively.

This project was established with the aim of storing brain tissue samples to enable research on the etiologies and mechanisms of psychiatric diseases, which would eventually improve standards of clinical treatment for these diseases. Japanese researchers in the field of biological psychiatry have historically depended on Western brain banks, particularly from Europe and the United States, which is regrettable. To remedy this situation and improve the Japanese research standards, attempts for establishing an autonomous Japanese brain bank are ongoing. Reviews of the previous attempts on elucidating the etiopathology of neuropsychiatric diseases reveal that rapid advances result from studies on tissue samples from diseased brains. For example, in the Kraepelin era, i.e. in 1900 years before and after, long-term, resolute research on diseased brain specimens ultimately led to the discoveries of entities such as Alzheimer disease and Lewy body disease. The recent advances in techniques of neuroimaging and molecular biology have resulted in a shift of interest from brain tissue analysis. However, the integration of findings of all these techniques is recommended going forward, with a shift in focus back to brain tissue analysis. The JAPAN Brain Bank Network project was launched under this setting. The success of this project largely depends on the will of patients and family members (for donating samples) as well as cooperation among many clinicians. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the history of biological psychiatric research and related perspectives, which will hopefully encourage further studies that will help bridge the gap between clinical and biological research on psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of cognitive, developmental, and behavioural interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorder in preschool-aged children: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by significant impairment in social communication and the presence of restrictive and repetitive behaviour or interest. Intervention during early childhood could decrease ASD symptoms. We aimed to identify the most effective intervention based on cognitive, developmental, and behavioural approaches and the factors that impact the effectiveness of the intervention.\nWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing interventions for ASD in preschool-aged children. Electronic databases were searched for related articles with randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs published between 2001 to 2015. Outcome measures were communication, behavioural and cognitive skills, reported as standardised mean differences (SMD) compared to a control group. A Random-effects model was utilised to calculate the pooled estimate effect. Between-study variability was also assessed. The registering number of this study is CRD42017035354.\nOut of the initial 5174 studies that were identified, there were 14 RCTs (746 children) that were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimate effect provided by random-effects model was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.08-0.37]) with no between-study heterogeneity (<i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.00%, p = 0.0018).

The HAMD-7 scale was translated into Arabic using forward and backward translation methods. A total of 153 Arabic speakers were recruited to test the translated scale, including 57 medical students and 96 members of the general public.

This retrospective study compares completed suicide events within these two high-risk populations in state institutions over a time period of 5 years from 2000 to 2004. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Data was collected through a nationwide survey: all forensic psychiatric hospitals within Germany were contacted via postal mail and received a questionnaire concerning the suicide events from 2000 to 2004. All federal lands of Germany were similarly assessed by a survey endorsed by the respective federal ministries of justice. All prison institutions (100%) participated in the survey, while 84% (53 units) of the forensic psychiatric hospitals nationwide contributed. A comparative statistical analysis was conducted using Fisher's exact test or the Mann-Whitney U-test (age). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to assess adjusted effects. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the months until suicide were analyzed followed by a Cox-regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> There was no statistically significant difference between the mean suicide rate in forensic psychiatric hospitals (123/100.000, 95% confidence interval: [0.00103, 0.00147]) and in the prison system (130/100.000, 95% confidence interval: [0.00109, 0.00154]). Patients who committed suicide in the forensic hospitals were, in comparison to the prison system, more likely to have committed a violent offense and have had a prior history of suicide attempts. The duration from admission into the institution to the suicide event was significantly shorter in the prison group. Also, younger people commited suicide earlier during their stay in a forensic psychiatric hospital or prison. <b>Conclusions:</b> While the results suggest a necessity to optimize data collection in the prison system (prior suicide events and history of mental disorder), it is important to discuss the current discharge arrangements within the forensic hospitals."}, {"Title": "The Effects of Hand Massage on Stress and Agitation Among People with Dementia in a Hospital Setting: A Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "Agitation in people with dementia is a growing concern as it causes distress for both patients and their nurses and may contribute to relational disorders. Previous studies involving patients with dementia living in long-term care facilities have reported decreased agitation following massage. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of hand massage on agitation and biological markers of stress in patients with dementia hospitalized in an acute geriatric psychiatry service. In this randomized controlled trial we included 40 agitated patients with dementia with an intervention group and a control group. The study is designed to test the effect of seven hand massages over three continuous weeks on agitation and levels of salivary cortisol (sC) and alpha-amylase (sAA). Compared to the control group, the intervention group exhibited larger increases in sC and sAA at week 1 from before to after the massage, but larger decreases at week 2 and 3, with a significant group effect for sAA at week 2. Agitation scores were not significantly different between the groups but tended to decrease more in the intervention group than the control group. This study provides first encouraging results suggesting that hand massage might have beneficial effects on stress and agitation in hospitalized patients with dementia. It also highlights the challenges associated with conducting such studies with this complex patient population.

Heterogeneity between migrant groups based on the region of origin, minority status and other socioeconomic factors may provide clues as to the underlying aetiological mechanisms explaining this risk, as well as informing our general understanding of psychotic disorders. Nonetheless, disentangling the mechanisms underlying this association has been the focus of more speculation and theory to date than empirical research. Now more than ever, we need to move beyond studies which demonstrate excess rates in migrant and ethnic minority groups to novel population-based studies which identify the determinants and mechanisms through which this risk is shaped. In this paper, we review the main hypotheses proposed to explain these disparities and the current level of support for them. We then highlight recent evidence from epidemiology and neuroscience which provides important new clues in our understanding of the aetiology of psychotic disorders.

Critics cite numerous examples of apparently effective treatments in mouse models that failed in human clinical trials, raising the possibility that the two species' neurobiological differences could explain the high translational failure rate in psychiatry and neurology (neuropsychiatry). However, every stage of translation is plagued by complex problems unrelated to neurobiological conservation. Therefore, although these case studies are intriguing, they cannot alone determine whether these differences observed account for translation failures. Our analysis of the literature indicates that most neuropsychiatric treatments used in humans are at least partially effective in mouse models, suggesting that neurobiological differences are unlikely to be the main cause of neuropsychiatric translation failures."}, {"Title": "Persistence of anxiety symptoms after elective caesarean delivery.", "Abstract": "In the UK, 11.8% of expectant mothers undergo an elective caesarean section (ELCS) representing 92 000 births per annum.

It is unclear what mechanisms contribute to this relationship. The type and severity of aggression might be of importance in the association between client aggression and burnout symptoms, but also the personality characteristics and emotional intelligence of nursing staff. It is unknown whether wearable devices that measure arousal can be used to detect chronic stress and burnout symptoms. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Especially, physical aggression as experienced by nursing staff is associated with staff's burnout symptoms (e.g., emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). Further research on the aggression questionnaire is necessary. The stress management skill of nursing staff is an important factor to consider in the association between burnout symptoms and client aggression. The wearable device was not useful for detecting burnout symptoms. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Nursing staff who experience (physical) aggression should be carefully monitored and should receive social support from their management to aid their well-being. Contrary to intuition, nurses who reported a higher number of stress management skills might have to be monitored more closely if necessary.\nIntroduction Aggressive behaviour of forensic clients is associated with burnout symptoms in nursing staff. The role of staff characteristics as moderators is unclear. Aim We explored the association between type and severity of aggressive behaviour as experienced by nursing staff and staff's burnout symptoms. In addition, the moderating roles of personality characteristics and emotional intelligence (EI) were studied. Moreover, the usefulness of ambulatory skin conductance assessments in detecting arousal related to burnout symptoms was studied. Method A total of 114 forensic nursing staff members filled out questionnaires and wore an ambulatory device. Results Experiencing physical aggression was positively associated with staff's burnout symptoms. Stress management skills, a subscale of EI, but not personality, moderated this relationship. Skin conductance was not associated with burnout symptoms. Remarkably, the association between aggression and burnout symptoms was highest for staff reporting a higher number of stress management skills. Discussion Longitudinal research is necessary to establish causality between client aggression and staff burnout symptoms. In addition, further research is necessary on the validity of the aggression measure used in the current study. Implication for practice Nursing staff who experience physical aggression frequently should receive social support for this, and staff who report high stress management skills should be monitored more carefully after having been confronted with aggression."}, {"Title": "Teaching Psychotherapy to Psychiatry Residents.", "Abstract": "The rationale, content, and teaching techniques used for a psychiatry residency psychodynamic therapy course based on Psychodynamic Therapy: A Guide to Evidence-Based Practice (Summers & Barber, 2009) are presented in the context of their evolution over the last two decades and the challenges of teaching this topic in the current environment.

Patient progress was evaluated using the DUNDRUM-3, a measure of patient ability to participate and benefit from multi-modal psychosocial programs and the HCR-20 dynamic items, a measure of violence proneness. We report reliable change index (RCI) and reliable and clinically meaningful change (RMC). We assessed patients' cognition using the MCCB, psychopathology using the PANSS. The effect of cognition and psychopathology on change in DUNDRUM-3 was examined using hierarchical multiple regression with age, gender, and baseline DUNDRUM-3 scores.\nThe DUNDRUM-3 changed significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.004, d\u2009=\u20090.367, RCI 32% of 69 cases, RMC 23%) and HCR-20-C (p\u2009<\u20090.003, d\u2009=\u20090.377, RCI 10%). Both cognition and psychopathology accounted for significant variance in DUNDRUM-3 at follow up. Those hospitalized for less than five years at baseline changed more than longer stay patients. Mediation analysis demonstrated that the relationship between cognition and change in violence proneness (HCR-20-C) was both directly affected and indirectly mediated by change in DUNDRUM-3.\nChange in response to multi-modal psychosocial programs (DUNDRUM-3) reduced a measure of violence proneness over four years. Forensic in-patients' ability to benefit from psychosocial treatment appears to be a function of the outcome measure used, unit of measurement employed, degree of cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and length of stay. Lower risk of re-offending may be partially attributable to participation and engagement in psychosocial interventions."}, {"Title": "The landscape of NeuroImage-ing research.", "Abstract": "As the field of neuroimaging grows, it can be difficult for scientists within the field to gain and maintain a detailed understanding of its ever-changing landscape. While collaboration and citation networks highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here, we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics, and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and with hubs that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to changes in the prevalence of its neighbors. Finally, we incorporate data from PNAS to investigate whether it serves as a trend-setter for topics' use within NeuroImage. We find that popularity trends are correlated across the two journals, and that changes in popularity tend to occur earlier within PNAS among growing topics. Broadly, this work presents a cohesive model for understanding the emergent relationships and dynamics of research topics within NeuroImage."}, {"Title": "Understanding the pediatric psychiatric phenotype of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of current insights into the neurodevelopmental and psychiatric manifestations of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) in children and adolescents. The pediatric neuropsychiatric expression of 22q11DS is characterized by high variability, both interindividual and intraindividual (different expressions over the lifespan). Besides varying levels of intellectual disability, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychotic disorders in young individuals with 22q11DS is significantly higher than in the general population, or in individuals with idiopathic intellectual disability. Possible explanations for this observed phenotypic variability will be discussed, including genetic pleiotropy, gene-environment interactions, the age-dependency of phenotypes, but also the impact of assessment and ascertainment bias as well as the limitations of our current diagnostic classification system. The implications inferred by these observations aforementioned bear direct relevance to both scientists and clinicians. Observations regarding the neuropsychiatric manifestations in individuals with 22q11DS exemplify the need for a dimensional approach to neuropsychiatric assessment, in addition to our current categorical diagnostic classification system. The potential usefulness of 22q11DS as a genetic model to study the early phases of schizophrenia as well as the phenomenon of neuropsychiatric pleiotropy observed in many CNV's will be delineated. From a clinical perspective, the importance of regular neuropsychiatric evaluations with attention to symptoms not always captured in diagnostic categories and of maintaining equilibrium between individual difficulties and competencies and environmental demands will be discussed."}, {"Title": "2017 Program Director Survey: Feedback from your adult neurology residency leadership.", "Abstract": "To survey adult neurology program directors (PDs) and inform the future development of neurology training programs.\nAll US adult neurology PDs were invited to complete the survey.

This study examines the definitions, explanatory models, signs and symptoms, and healthcare-seeking behaviours common to Fang culture-bound syndromes (i.e., kong, eluma, witchcraft, mibili, mikug, and nsamadalu). The Fang ethnic group is the majority ethnic group in Equatorial Guinea. From September 2012 to January 2013, 45 key Fang informants were selected, including community leaders, tribal elders, healthcare workers, traditional healers, and non-Catholic pastors in 39 of 724 Fang tribal villages in 6 of 13 districts in the mainland region of Equatorial Guinea. An ethnographic approach with an emic-etic perspective was employed. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, participant observation and a questionnaire that included DHS6 key indicators. Interviews were designed based on the Cultural Formulation form in the DSM-5 and explored the definition of Fang cultural syndromes, symptoms, cultural perceptions of cause, and current help-seeking. Participants defined \"Fang culture-bound syndromes\" as those diseases that cannot be cured, treated, or diagnosed by science. Such syndromes present with the same signs and symptoms as diseases identified by Western medicine. However, they arise because of the actions of enemies, because of the actions of spirits or ancestors, as punishments for disregarding the law of God, because of the violation of sexual or dietary taboos, or because of the violation of a Fang rite of passage, the dzas, which is celebrated at birth. Six Fang culture-bound syndromes were included in the study: 1) Eluma, a disease that is targeted at the victim out of envy and starts out with sharp, intense, focussed pain and aggressiveness; 2) Witchcraft, characterized by isolation from the outside, socially maladaptive behaviour, and the use of hallucinogenic substances; 3) Kong, which is common among the wealthy class and manifests as a disconnection from the environment and a lack of vital energy; 4) Mibili, a possession by evil spirits that manifests through visual and auditory hallucinations; 5) Mikug, which appears after a person has had contact with human bones in a ritual; and 6) Nsamadalu, which emerges after a traumatic process caused by violating traditions through having sexual relations with one's sister or brother. The therapeutic resources of choice for addressing Fang culture-bound syndromes were traditional Fang medicine and the religious practices of the Bethany and Pentecostal churches, among others. Among African ethnic groups, symbolism, the weight of tradition, and the principle of chance in health and disease are underlying factors in the presentation of certain diseases, which in ethno-psychiatry are now referred to as culture-bound syndromes. In this study, traditional healers, elders, healthcare professionals, religious figures, and leaders of the Fang community in Equatorial Guinea referred to six such cultural syndromes: eluma, witchcraft, kong, mibili, mikug, and nsamadalu. In the absence of a multidisciplinary approach to mental illness in the country, the Fang ethnic group seeks healthcare for culture-bound syndromes from traditional healing and religious rites in the Evangelical faiths."}, {"Title": "Sir Alexander Morison and The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases: Part 1.", "Abstract": "Sir Alexander Morison's The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases and the original art work that formed the basis of the book have not had the scholarly attention they deserve.

Recently it has been hypothesized that heterogeneity of findings within this literature might be partly explained by participants' history of treatment-resistant depression. This study aimed to investigate the role of growth factor proteins in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) undergoing an inpatient intervention. <b>Methods:</b> Blood samples were collected from 36 patients with TRD and 36 matched controls. Patients were assessed both at admission and discharge from a specialist inpatient program. We examined serum biomarker differences between patients and non-depressed matched controls, longitudinal changes after inpatient treatment and relationship to clinical outcomes. Additionally, the influence of potential covariates on biomarker levels were assessed. <b>Results:</b> Patients displayed lower serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (OR = 0.025; 95% CI = 0.001, 0.500) and vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGFC; OR = 0.083, 95% CI = 0.008, 0.839) as well as higher angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2; OR = 2.651, 95% CI = 1.325, 5.303) compared to controls.

During treatment, non-responders showed a decrease in VEGF and VEGFC levels, while responders showed no significant changes. <b>Conclusion:</b> TRD patients demonstrate a deficit of peripheral growth factors and our results suggest that markers of the VEGF family might decline over time in chronically depressed patients in spite of multidisciplinary treatment. The action of angiogenic proteins may play an important role in the pathophysiology of TRD, and pending comprehensive investigation may provide important insights for the future of precision psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry services in Wales.", "Abstract": "Aims and methodRecent funding from Welsh Government for mental health has helped to develop liaison psychiatry services in Wales.

Human sex trafficking is associated with significant and long-term mental health consequences. Research to date has emphasized ways to identify survivors in health care settings. Once identified, however, few specialized services are available to help survivors exit and recover. The current services infrastructure for HST has been compared to the disjointed social response to intimate partner violence before the women's movement helped develop a system of battered women's shelters. Although research has highlighted the need for a multidisciplinary and interagency response to HST, including mental health care, best practices have not yet been formulated. Furthermore, available services are fragmented across sectors. With psychology and psychiatry taking tentative steps to develop services for HST survivors, this article identifies six principles to help avoid a fragmented and potentially retraumatizing clinical and systemic response. The overarching goal is to design services that are flexible, accessible, trauma informed, survivor driven, responsive to stages of change, multidisciplinary, and enduring, especially given the centrality of healthy attachments and community in trauma recovery. Principles are derived from the limited available research on HST services and from examples of efficacious interventions for patient groups with similar characteristics. The discussion is also informed by composite clinical vignettes from a specialized clinic for adult survivors of HST, housed in a major teaching hospital. Finally, practice recommendations and strategies for building interdisciplinary collaborations are discussed."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder in a large Italian catchment area: a school-based population study within the ASDEU project.", "Abstract": "This study aims to estimate Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) prevalence in school-aged children in the province of Pisa (Italy) using the strategy of the ASD in the European Union (ASDEU) project.\nA multistage approach was used to identify cases in a community sample (N = 10 138) of 7-9-year-old children attending elementary schools in Pisa - Italy.

Second, a Teacher Nomination form (TN) to identify children at risk for ASD was filled in by teachers who joined the study and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) was filled in by the parents of children identified as positive by the TN; a comprehensive assessment, which included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition, was performed for children with positive TN and SCQ\u2a7e9.\nA total of 81 children who had a disability certificate also had ASD (prevalence: 0.79%, i.e. 1/126). Specifically, 66 children (57 males and nine females; 62% with intellectual disability -ID-) were certified with ASD, whereas another 15 (11 males and four females; 80% with ID) were recognised as having ASD among those certified with another neurodevelopmental disorder. Considering the population of 4417 (children belonging to schools which agreed to participate in the TN/SCQ procedure) and using only the number of children certified with ASD, the prevalence (38 in 4417) was 0.86%, i.e. one in 116. As far as this population is concerned, the prevalence rises to 1% if we consider the eight new cases (six males and two females; no subject had ID) identified among children with no pre-existing diagnoses and to 1.15%, i.e., one in 87, if probabilistic estimation is used.\nThis is the first population-based ASD prevalence study conducted in Italy so far and its results indicate a prevalence of ASD in children aged 7-9 years of about one in 87.

Identifying biomarkers for lithium response could enable personalization of treatment and refine criteria for stratification of BD cases into treatment-relevant subgroups. Existing systematic reviews identify potential biomarkers of lithium response, but none directly address the conceptual issues that need to be addressed to enhance translation of research into precision prescribing of lithium. For example, although clinical syndrome subtyping of BD has not led to customized individual treatments, we emphasize the importance of assessing clinical response phenotypes in biomarker research. Also, we highlight the need to give greater consideration to the quality of prospective longitudinal monitoring of illness activity and the differentiation of non-response from partial or non-adherence with medication. It is unlikely that there is a single biomarker for lithium response or tolerability, so this review argues that more research should be directed toward the exploration of biosignatures. Importantly, we emphasize that an integrative science approach may improve the likelihood of discovering the optimal combination of clinical factors and multimodal biomarkers (e.g., blood omics, neuroimaging, and actigraphy derived-markers). This strategy could uncover a valid lithium response phenotype and facilitate development of a composite prediction algorithm. Lastly, this narrative review discusses how these strategies could improve eligibility criteria for lithium treatment in BD, and highlights barriers to translation to clinical practice including the often-overlooked issue of the cost-effectiveness of introducing biomarker tests in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Study protocol for a single-blind, randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial of internet-based versus face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Expert guidelines recommend cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) as a first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but the majority of patients with OCD do not have access to CBT.

Manuals, muddles or modules.", "Abstract": "Providing adequate treatment services for maltreated children is a considerable challenge. The recently updated NICE guideline on Child abuse and neglect (NICE guideline [NG276] 2017, London) includes recommendations on intervention for a variety of parenting contexts, and different forms of maltreatment at various stages of identification: 'Early Help for families showing possible signs of abuse and neglect', and 'Therapeutic interventions for children, young people and families, after child abuse and neglect'. The fifteen evidence-based manualised approaches to be considered for use by practitioners are valuable and backed up by appropriate research on effectiveness. Approaches are selected which could be applied to more than one form of maltreatment. However, the manualised approaches reviewed by NICE have differing theoretical frameworks and attempting to put together an intervention for more complex forms of maltreatment, based solely on these approaches, may result in confusion and muddle. In practice, polyvictimisation or multipart maltreatment is now seen as the rule, rather than the exception. In these cases, whole sibships may be affected, with children of different ages and stages of development presenting with differing needs. As a result, there is a cumulative, negative impact on their health and development. As Macdonald et\u00a0al. (Health Technology Assessment, 2016, 20, 1) state, 'Most children experience more than one form of maltreatment, and there is growing recognition of the need to better take into account children's profiles of maltreatment in order to improve policy and practice' (p. 38). Marchette and Weisz (Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2017, 58, 970) draw attention to the paradox that there are many focal treatment manuals in the child mental health field, which have contributed to practice, but which are not used widely in everyday practice, due to a focus on single disorders rather than the reality of comorbid, co-occurring problems. Few practitioners or service providers have the time or resources to learn a different approach for each disorder or problem type. A solution is the development of modular approaches. Effective practice elements can be 'distilled' from the intervention approaches recommended by NICE and from other evidence-based interventions identified (Bentovim and Elliott, Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 2014 43, 270). Practice elements can be integrated into a flexible modular approach to intervention which can be tailored to fit the complex profiles of those maltreated children, young people and their families whom practitioners work within their everyday practice."}, {"Title": "The Complexities of Evaluating the Exposome in Psychiatry: A Data-Driven Illustration of Challenges and Some Propositions for Amendments.", "Abstract": "Identifying modifiable factors through environmental research may improve mental health outcomes. However, several challenges need to be addressed to optimize the chances of success. By analyzing the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 data, we provide a data-driven illustration of how closely connected the exposures and the mental health outcomes are and how model and variable specifications produce \"vibration of effects\" (variation of results under multiple different model specifications). Interdependence of exposures is the rule rather than the exception. Therefore, exposure-wide systematic approaches are needed to separate genuine strong signals from selective reporting and dissect sources of heterogeneity. Pre-registration of protocols and analytical plans is still uncommon in environmental research. Different studies often present very different models, including different variables, despite examining the same outcome, even if consistent sets of variables and definitions are available. For datasets that are already collected (and often already analyzed), the exploratory nature of the work should be disclosed. Exploratory analysis should be separated from prospective confirmatory research with truly pre-specified analysis plans. In the era of big-data, where very low P values for trivial effects are detected, several safeguards may be considered to improve inferences, eg, lowering P-value thresholds, prioritizing effect sizes over significance, analyzing pre-specified falsification endpoints, and embracing alternative approaches like false discovery rates and Bayesian methods. Any claims for causality should be cautious and preferably avoided, until intervention effects have been validated. We hope the propositions for amendments presented here may help with meeting these pressing challenges."}, {"Title": "Investigation of the Video-EEG Findings and Clinical Data in Patients Diagnosed With Epilepsy and Psychosis.", "Abstract": "Studies on electrophysiological characteristics of patients with epilepsy and concomitant psychosis are limited.

A total of 67 nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, investigated at the video-EEG monitoring unit were randomly selected as the control group and compared statistically with the EP group.\nIn medical history, patients with EP had experienced significantly higher level of status epilepticus (P=0.002) and perinatal cerebral injury (P=0.04), whereas drug-resistant epilepsy was detected at a lower level (P=0.015). With respect to seizure onset zone, the EP group had significantly more seizures of unknown foci, whereas the control group had mostly temporal lobe origin (P=0.0004). EEG findings showed that slow background activity was significantly common among patients with EP (P=0.009). Although only 5 of 15 patients with EP had been operated, 43 of 67 patients had undergone epilepsy surgery (P=0.04) in the control group. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to postoperative seizure control as per Engel classification.\nAlthough our sample size could be considered small, slowed EEG background activity, and the marked frequency of initial precipitant factors such as status epilepticus, perinatal cerebral injury, and detected neuronal autoantibodies suggested that EP is associated with more extensive involvement.

During a one-week visit conducted in October 2017, we interviewed key-informants working at decisional levels in the domains of health, justice and security. Two clinical workshops involving psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses were held in psychiatric facilities, including at Ndera, the main psychiatric hospital of the country. Three axes of development and improvement were identified: First there is a need for a clearer, more coherent and updated legislative framework. Second, the absence of a forensic secured unit, which compromises both quality of care for forensic patients and security of the other patients and staff, should be remediated. Third, the supervision and training in this specialized domain should be provided through international collaborations. Hopefully, Rwanda could become in the next few years a driving force for other African countries in the field of forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Pharmacy resident teaching in psychiatry and neurology for pharmacy programs in the United States.", "Abstract": "The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists' Postgraduate Year 1 and Year 2 Residency Accreditation Standards require that residents demonstrate effective teaching skills. The College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists' survey of pharmacy program curricula assessed resident teaching in psychiatry and neurology, however, results were not published. The objective of this article is to describe resident teaching in psychiatry and neurology curricula as reported by responses to the college's survey.\nAn electronic survey was sent to a curricular representative from each of 133 US pharmacy programs accredited as of July 2015. Programs were asked to report on psychiatry and neurology curricular content, faculty credentials, and types of teaching activities, including resident teaching.\nFifty-six percent (75/133) of programs responded to the survey. Fifty out of 75 (67%) distinct pharmacy programs reported utilizing residents for teaching topics in psychiatry and neurology. Residents were twice as likely to teach didactic topics in psychiatry (n\u2009=\u200944) compared to neurology (n\u2009=\u200922). Three times as many residents were involved in precepting psychiatric Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (n\u2009=\u200937) compared to neurology Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (n\u2009=\u200912).\nResidents are involved in both didactic and experiential teaching with more residents teaching psychiatry content compared to neurology content.

Theories of comorbidity are complex, but recurring associations between the conditions suggest overlap that is more than simple co-occurrence. Common underlying pathophysiology may imply that epilepsy itself may constituently include psychiatric symptoms. Conditions such as depression or cognitive difficulties commonly occur and in some cases, are considered to be associated with specific epilepsy characteristics such as localization or seizure type. Regardless of etiologic attributions to psychiatric comorbidity, it is clear today that treatment for epilepsy needs to target psychiatric illness.

There has been much media coverage regarding the inappropriate detention of minors under section 136 and the suggestion that many were taken to police cells, as there were no suitable places of safety. Although previous studies describe characteristics of a typical individual detained under section 136, few distinguish the differences between adults and adolescents. Profiling these adolescents can help to identify adolescents at risk, allowing for earlier intervention and prevent the inappropriate detention of individuals. Data were collected retrospectively for all patients under 18 years of age who were brought to a section 136 suite in south-west London over a five-year period. The typical profile of an adolescent presenting to this suite was a 16-year-old female of white ethnicity who was sectioned in a public area due to attempted suicide or deliberate self-harm.

Children between the ages of 6 and 17 years who were evaluated and diagnosed with CM1 at a neurosurgery clinic were identified. Eighty-six participants were recruited for this study with an average age of 11 years. Parents of participants completed a pediatric medical history questionnaire and a semistructured interview regarding the child's psychiatric, developmental, medical, and family history. A review of medical records was completed to complement interview data. Elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (22.1%), anxiety (12.8%), and depression (10.5%), were identified in the study population when compared to published norms in the general population documented by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013. In addition, elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses in first-degree relatives of study participants were also identified. A 2-step binary logistic regression analysis revealed that maternal complications during pregnancy (Wald = 6.52, p = 0.01) increased the risk of a psychiatric diagnosis 9-fold. Premature birth (Wald = 6.79, p = 0.01) also significantly predicted a psychiatric diagnosis amongst participants. The current findings suggest a high prevalence of psychiatric illness in children with CM1. Pregnancy complications were associated with a high risk of a psychiatric diagnosis. Early CNS developmental disturbance may explain this relationship. Prematurity only slightly improved the prediction model.

The co-occurrence of schizophrenia (SZ) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common and challenging co-morbid condition. Also, the relationship between SZ and OCD remains unclear.\nThe aim of this study was to describe the co-morbidity of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compare clinical characteristics of schizophrenia patients with versus without comorbid OCD.\nA cohort-study was carried out on 396 patients enrolled between November 2011 to June 2014 at the Department of Psychiatry, Rumeilah Hospital in Qatar. We employed the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), and Structured clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) for diagnoses, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist for scoring OCD. Patients were grouped in SZ patients with and without comorbid OCD (SZ-OCD vs SZ).\n396 subjects were interviewed. Age of SZ-OCD patients was 42.69\u2009\u00b1\u200914.33 (years old) whereas SZ patients without OCD ranged 41.59\u2009\u00b1\u200913.59 years old. There were statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between SZ with and without OCD : age (p\u2009=\u20090.010), BMI (body mass index; p\u2009=\u20090.011), education (p\u2009=\u20090.033), employment (p\u2009=\u20090.019), cigarette smoking (p\u2009=\u20090.039), sheesha smoking (p\u2009=\u20090.008), and prevalence of consanguinity (p\u2009=\u20090.043). In particular, the rate of consanguinity in the current generation was 31.8% [95% CI\u2009=\u200929.1-34.7]. Also, there were statistically significant differences at Hamilton Depression score, General Health Score, Clinical Global Impression- Score, duration of illnesses, and Global Assessment of Functioning (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The results show that anxious, mood and psychotic dimensions rated higher among SZ - OCD ones than SZ only patients.\nThis study confirms that SZ-OCD is a common co-morbidity and prevalence of SZ OCD is higher among patients reporting a degree of consanguinity. Even if this condition is under-recognized in clinical practice, it may significantly change SZ presentation and outcome since psychopathological dimensions report higher scores in the co-morbidity sample."}, {"Title": "Setting the bar of social enterprise research high. Learning from medical science.", "Abstract": "Both dysfunctional blood cells and physical exercise, despite the former being pathological and the latter completely normal, make one's blood more acidic, carrying less oxygen, which presents as fatigue. It is up to scientists to develop proper accounts of such mechanisms in the form of theories that are able to distinguish false from true positives. This piece's purpose is to make a case for preventing false positives in social enterprise research. This is achieved by showing how recent research portrays social enterprises as shallow nested systems defined by epiphenomenal enterprise activities as perceived by stakeholders, instead of the internal causal mechanisms that gear such activities. In achieving this piece's purpose, the analysis turns to an analogy with psychiatry, whose status as a medical profession was forged by telling disorders as harmful dysfunctions apart from the false positives of problems of living in general. Similarly, it is concluded that the relevance of social enterprises does not result from stakeholder rationales to use social enterprise-led activities per se, but from the designed functions of social enterprise mechanisms in conjunction with a value judgment that such mechanisms have specific benefits compared to alternatives."}, {"Title": "\"When I Stop My Medication, Everything Goes Wrong\": Content Analysis of Interviews with Adolescent Patients Treated with Psychotropic Medication.", "Abstract": "Medication nonadherence constitutes a major problem in adolescent psychiatry.

The dominant stereotype of mental illness is that of madness, although final year medical students describe a more diverse spectrum of mental health problems. There is strong adherence to secular occult explanations of mental illness and advocacy for traditional medicine in addressing these illnesses, including among final year medical students.\nNo student would opt for psychiatry as a specialisation, although some expressed interest in integrating psychiatry into their future medical practice.

The manganese levels were significantly higher in ADHD children than in controls (<i>p</i>=0.033), when studies investigating blood levels and those investigating hair levels were included. However, when only studies investigating blood levels were included, there was no significant difference between ADHD children and controls (<i>p</i>=0.076).

A norm is a coefficient or an indicator for estimating the required human resources in an organization. Due to the changes in the available working hours of nurses in recent years and to use of a standard method, the Iranian Ministry of Health decided to update nursing estimation norm in hospitals in 2014-2015. This study aimed to design a nurse-required estimation norm for educational and non-educational hospitals based on the workload indicator in Iran.\nThis was a descriptive cross-sectional study, carried out from December 2015 to November 2016 in 49 wards in 12 educational and 17 non-educational hospitals in Mashhad, Iran. The wards and hospitals who had the best performance in nursing care quality indicators were selected. Focus group, work study, consensus, interview, and reviewing documents, staff and patient records, and the calculations of modified Workload Indicators of Staffing Needs (WISN) were used to collect the data.\nPatient care, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and transfer out of the hospital were identified as the main activities of holding focus groups. Interviews and reviewing documents led to the identification of 10 factors associated with nurses' available working time. In both educational and non-educational hospitals, the annual working time of all nurses except nurses working in the burn and psychiatric, burn ICU, and pediatric psychiatry wards, which was 1302\u00a0h per year, was 1411\u00a0h per year. The calculations of the modified WISN method showed that the lowest norm in educational hospitals was for psychiatric, eye surgery, and dermatology wards (0.53) and in non-educational hospitals was for ENT ward (0.57). The highest norm in educational and non-educational hospitals was for burn ICU (3.95) and general ICU (3.07) wards, respectively.\nThe nursing estimation norm in different wards of the hospital varies, considering that the time available to nurses and their workload in different wards and hospitals are different, and each ward has its special norm therefore, a single norm for all wards and hospitals cannot be used for a fair distribution of nurses."}, {"Title": "Role of IL-6/RORC/IL-22 axis in driving Th17 pathway mediated immunopathogenesis of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The immuno-inflammatory origin of schizophrenia in a subset of patients is viewed as a key element of an overarching etiological construct.

Amongst the Th cell subsets, the Th17 cells have emerged as a paradigmatic lineage with significant functional implications in a vast number of immune mediated diseases including brain disorders such as schizophrenia. The present study was aimed at examining the functional role of the Th17 pathway in schizophrenia. To address this, genotyping of IL17A (rs2275913; G197A) Single Nucleotide Polymorphism was carried out by the PCR-RFLP method in 221 schizophrenia patients and 223 healthy control subjects.

More psychiatric medications were introduced than ever before or since (Healy, 2002). While psychiatric researchers later credited these drugs, in part, for controlling psychotic, depressive, and anxious symptoms-and subsequently for emptying decaying psychiatric institutions throughout the Western world-psychiatrists also produced a number of other theories that relied on a more delicate and nuanced blending of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. Canadian-based researchers were at the forefront of experiments combining mescaline, LSD, and psychoactive substances later described as \"psychedelics.\" From a relatively isolated setting on the Canadian prairies, in one of the most notorious mental hospitals in North America, this blending of traditions generated a unique approach. A close look at the correspondence between the psychiatrist Humphry Osmond and his friend, the writer Aldous Huxley, who shared interests in psychoactive substances and their effects on perception, and the stimulation of empathy, gives us an opportunity to explore how they developed their psychedelic approach to therapy in the 1950s. The combination of working in an isolated hospital, far from the main research powers in North America, produced a sense of regional incubation and required Osmond to look for collaborators well beyond his own field of psychiatry.

Namely, \"In the Shadow of the Double\" explores the broader geography of mental care within which Spiritists defined the uniqueness of their healing practice, vis-\u00e0-vis both institutional psychiatry, to which they theorized a relationship of strategic complementarity, and other forms of religiously grounded healing, which they disparaged as \"backwards\" and even dangerous.

The IMCC incorporates geriatric nursing, social work, and APRNs from neurology, gerontology, palliative care, and geriatric psychiatry. APRNs provide comprehensive, coordinated primary care for dementia, other chronic conditions, and minor acute illnesses. Partnering with PLWD and families and taking a palliative-oriented, dementia-informed medical home approach, the IMCC aims to reduce dementia burden. This study describes the first 12 months of IMCC's operation with 139 enrolled PLWD-caregiver dyads. All patients have a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment; most have Alzheimer's disease (53.2%). Patients have an average of 5.8 medical conditions and 6.9 prescriptions; 38.1% have an advanced directive, a medical power of attorney, or a living will. Mean age is 78.6, 63.3% are female, and 30.9% are African American. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 12.6. Most require assistance in activities of daily living. Many display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. The rate of ambulatory-sensitive hospitalizations declined from 6.7% in December 2015 to less than 1% in May 2016. Caregivers were highly satisfied. We observed nonsignificant improvements in neuropsychiatric symptom severity (p=.07), caregiver distress (p=.69), and caregiver competence (p=.18).

While no impact on alertness and cognitive functions has been proven among youth, data on elderly are lacking. The primary objective of this study was to measure the impact of etifoxine, lorazepam or placebo on alertness in the elderly. The secondary objectives were to evaluate cognitive performances and adverse effects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-way crossover design, 30 healthy volunteers aged 65 to 75 years underwent three one-day sessions. After treatment intake, standardized cognitive tests were conducted using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries and other psychological tests (Stroop, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span). The reaction time (RTI) as primary endpoint was analysed using a 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 latin square variance analysis. A 100-mg dose of etifoxine has no deleterious impact on alertness and causes no cognitive disorders as compared to placebo (RTI: 744\u202f\u00b1\u202f146\u202fms versus 770\u202f\u00b1\u202f153\u202fms; p\u202f=\u202f1.00).

Currently, he ambulates on his feet at home and in a wheelchair out in the community. He is nonverbal but can imprecisely sign for \"more\" and understands a few words. His father reports that his main concern is long-standing nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and aggression. His self-injury consists of head banging against hard objects such as concrete floors and biting or scratching himself to the point of bleeding. Over the past 13 years, he has been prescribed over 10 different psychotropic medications, including various typical and atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, and alpha agonists, all of which were discontinued because of the perception of undesirable side effects or lack of efficacy. His current medications include aripiprazole, olanzapine, levetiracetam, clorazepate, and trazodone. To rule out causes of irritability, you order a brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging, metabolic testing (for causes of NSSI such as Lesch-Nyhan), an autoimmune workup (for causes of pain or inflammation such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis), and hearing/vision testing, which are all normal.

Outcome studies have produced ambiguous and inconsistent findings regarding the impact of this model. This review examines a primary care-embedded psychiatric consultation service in place for nine years in a family medicine residency program. Psychiatric consultants, family physicians, and residents actively involved in the service participated in structured interviews designed to identify the clinical and educational value of the service. The benefits and limitations identified were then categorized into physician, consultant, patient, and systems factors. Among the challenges identified were inconsistent patient appointment-keeping, ambiguity about appropriate referrals, consultant scope-of-practice parameters, and delayed follow-up with consultation recommendations. Improved psychiatric education for primary care physicians also appeared to shift referrals toward more complex patients. The benefits identified included the availability of psychiatric services to underserved and disenfranchised patients, increased primary care physician comfort with medication management, and improved interprofessional communication and education. The integration of the service into the clinic fostered the development of a more psychologically minded practice.

Psychiatric nurses do not receive adequate education about how to teach patients to best manage tobacco withdrawal symptoms. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Psychiatric nurses who receive a brief educational intervention about tobacco withdrawal symptoms and best practices for using nicotine gum may be more prepared to teach patients about these topics. In turn, patients may use nicotine gum more often during their hospitalization, leading to improved outcomes for them as well as for staff. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: A simple educational intervention aimed at psychiatric nurses can result in positive outcomes for psychiatric inpatients who use tobacco.

The results of this feasibility study demonstrate that additional research that builds on the work presented here is warranted.\nIntroduction Tobacco use is prohibited in most psychiatric facilities in the United States, yet many psychiatric inpatients are tobacco users. Psychiatric nurses have reported inadequate education about best practices for managing tobacco dependence. Aim To explore the feasibility of an educational intervention for psychiatric nurses designed to improve their ability to educate patients about best practices for managing tobacco dependence, as well as effective use of nicotine gum. Method Fourteen nurses on a psychiatric inpatient unit at a community hospital were educated about the targeted topics. Chart reviews of nonequivalent pre-intervention and post-intervention patient groups were conducted to explore the outcomes of the intervention. Results Patients received more teaching, and used nicotine gum more often, following the intervention. However, no statistically significant differences between the pre-intervention and post-intervention patient groups were found. Discussion Educating nurses about best practices for managing tobacco withdrawal symptoms may have positive outcomes. Existing research suggests that such interventions may be most effective when support and structure are provided to ensure long-term practice changes.

The aim of this study is to review the general medical care in all French UHSA.\nA descriptive study was carried out through a survey of the nine facilities.\nAll UHSA benefit from the intervention of a general practitioner. The physical clinical examination, the biological assessment and the electrocardiogram are systematically performed at the patient's admission in 7, 5 and 9 establishments, respectively. However, the offer of general medical care in UHSA seems disparate and sometimes insufficient. Specialized consultations are regularly requested during hospitalizations, but no establishment benefits from a telemedicine system or specialized consultations on site. The extraction of the patient to the general hospital is therefore systematic when such a consultation is needed. But the number of penitentiary escorts per day is limited. In 6 UHSA, medical extractions are thus regularly canceled by the penitentiary administration, sometimes without a medical opinion. Finally, the patient's regular physician is only contacted in 3 UHSA during hospitalizations.\nBased on these results, ways of improving the organization of general medical care in UHSA are proposed through four main axes: the structure and general organization; the general medical care; the link with the healthcare partners and the articulation with the penitentiary administration."}, {"Title": "[How human rights can guide german psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The concerns and recommendations of the UN \"Final Remarks\" on the first German State Report are substantiated by up-to-date health reporting data.

Therein, the Committee interprets the CRPD in a way that differs questionably from former international statements about human rights and from former WHO recommendations. Particularly, the Committee demands the complete abolition of substitute decisions by legal guardians and the complete elimination of confinement and of coercive measures.The German government does not accept the Committee's interpretation of the CRPD. The Federal Constitutional Court has declared that the Committee's statements are not legally binding under public international law, neither for national nor for international courts. Furthermore, the Federal Constitutional Court has criticized the Committee's position. Particularly, it has declared that the CRPD does not imply a total ban of substitute decisions and coercive measures. The Federal Constitutional Court rather acknowledges the state's duty to protect especially those people who cannot decide freely and who are in a helpless situation because of illness or disability. The Court has declared that the state must not abandon these people to their fate.The Federal Constitutional Court has interpreted the CRPD by balancing different fundamental rights and by differentiating between the free and the natural will. In contrast, the Committee has absolutized a na\u00efvely understood right for self-determination."}, {"Title": "[The psychopathology of the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard School and its relevance for present-day psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Historically, the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard School represents a countermovement to psychopathology as described by Karl Jaspers and Kurt Schneider. The School aimed to interlink psychopathological and neurobiological aspects. Starting from the model of different functional neuronal systems, each of which can be disturbed in the sense of a hypofunction, hyperfunction, or parafunction, it developed a comprehensive phenomenology of psychopathological symptoms and syndromes that finally culminated in Karl Leonhard's course descriptions. This school of thought can provide important impulses even today. Thus, on the one hand, the neurobiological models can serve as the basis for additional research projects and on the other hand, the psychopathological descriptions of disorders can perhaps also be interpreted in the sense of typological constructs that can contribute to pragmatic clinical decisionmaking."}, {"Title": "Is it time to revise the diagnostic criteria for apathy in brain disorders? The 2018 international consensus group.", "Abstract": "Apathy is a very common behavioural and psychological symptom across brain disorders. In the last decade, there have been considerable advances in research on apathy and motivation. It is thus important to revise the apathy diagnostic criteria published in 2009. The main objectives were to: a) revise the definition of apathy; b) update the list of apathy dimensions; c) operationalise the diagnostic criteria; and d) suggest appropriate assessment tools including new technologies.\nThe expert panel (N\u2009=\u200923) included researchers and health care professionals working on brain disorders and apathy, a representative of a regulatory body, and a representative of the pharmaceutical industry. The revised diagnostic criteria for apathy were developed in a two-step process. First, following the standard Delphi methodology, the experts were asked to answer questions via web-survey in two rounds. Second, all the collected information was discussed on the occasion of the 26th European Congress of Psychiatry held in Nice (France).\nApathy was defined as a quantitative reduction of goal-directed activity in comparison to the patient's previous level of functioning (criterion A). Symptoms must persist for at least four weeks, and affect at least two of the three apathy dimensions (behaviour/cognition; emotion; social interaction; criterion B). Apathy should cause identifiable functional impairments (criterion C), and should not be fully explained by other factors, such as effects of a substance or major changes in the patient's environment (Criterion D).\nThe new diagnostic criteria for apathy provide a clinical and scientific framework to increase the validity of apathy as a clinical construct. This should also help to pave the path for apathy in brain disorders to be an interventional target."}, {"Title": "(Micro)Glia as Effectors of Cortical Volume Loss in Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Contrary to the notion that neurology but not psychiatry is the domain of disorders evincing structural brain alterations, it is now clear that there are subtle but consistent neuropathological changes in schizophrenia. These range from increases in ventricular size to dystrophic changes in dendritic spines. A decrease in dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is among the most replicated of postmortem structural findings in schizophrenia. Examination of the mechanisms that account for the loss of dendritic spines has in large part focused on genes and molecules that regulate neuronal structure. But the simple question of what is the effector of spine loss, ie, where do the lost spines go, is unanswered. Recent data on glial cells suggest that microglia (MG), and perhaps astrocytes, play an important physiological role in synaptic remodeling of neurons during development. Synapses are added to the dendrites of pyramidal cells during the maturation of these neurons; excess synapses are subsequently phagocytosed by MG. In the PFC, this occurs during adolescence, when certain symptoms of schizophrenia emerge. This brief review discusses recent advances in our understanding of MG function and how these non-neuronal cells lead to structural changes in neurons in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a clinical review of the concept, diagnosis and management.", "Abstract": "The history of psychiatry is the history of therapeutic enthusiasm with all of the triumph and tragedy, hubris and humility that this brings. As a result, the emergence of any new diagnosis, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), needs to be greeted with caution, rigour and scientific objectivity, as well as compassion, therapeutic engagement and optimism. Although there is now little doubt that ADHD is a valid, useful diagnostic concept, and progress has been made, there is still considerable work to be done to establish its incidence, prevalence and biological underpinnings, as well as optimal therapeutic strategies. As with all mental illnesses, it is likely that knowledge will develop over many decades and diagnostic criteria will be refined in parallel. In the absence of definitive biological understanding, there should be particular caution about over-exuberant diagnostic expansionism unless it is accompanied by compelling evidence of therapeutic benefit for those diagnosed."}, {"Title": "University students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a literature review.", "Abstract": "To review existing literature about university students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\nA framework for scoping studies and content analysis were used to source and review selected publications from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and relevant bibliographies.\nSeventy-four publications were reviewed and key findings were categorised under six core themes that represent the issues germane to university students with ADHD. These themes are: academic, social and psychological functioning, giftedness, new media technologies, treatment, substance misuse and the non-medical use of prescription stimulants, and malingering.\nIn Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) young people with ADHD are unlikely to enrol into further education, and of those who do go to university, few will graduate at the same time as their non-ADHD peers. ADHD is associated with poor educational outcomes and it may be a hidden disability within institutions of higher education (e.g. universities). Surprisingly, in this topic area, there is a paucity of research in Ireland and the UK. Most studies originate from North America were research activity in the field has been ongoing since the 1990s. These studies however, tend to use relatively small samples of college (university) students recruited at a single institution. It is difficult to generalise the findings of these studies to student populations in North America, let alone in Ireland and the UK. At the very least, these North American studies provide insights into key areas of concern. This topic area straddles education and psychiatry. This means an inter-disciplinary approach is required to examine, better understand and address the impact of ADHD on the educational outcomes of university students. The philosophies of difference, equity and self-realisation can offer a conceptual framework for conducting further research and/or developing services to deliver more personalised learning support for university students with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Attitudes and reported practice of paediatricians and child psychiatrists regarding the assessment and treatment of ADHD in Ireland.", "Abstract": "This mixed-method national survey has obtained original data on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) attitudes, assessment and treatment regimes reported by paediatricians and child psychiatrists; and has compared their clinics. It has examined the extent of involvement of Irish paediatricians in the management of ADHD.\nA questionnaire was designed, based on a review of literature and ADHD guidelines, and piloted by expert clinicians. Universal recruitment was conducted among Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) consultants (n=71) and community/general paediatric consultants (n=72). Quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analysed.\nThere was an overall response rate of 43%. A dedicated ADHD clinic is offered in 79% of CAMHS services, but only in one paediatric service. Participants reported that the assessment of ADHD involves multidisciplinary work and this was only established in CAMHS clinics. Medication is initiated by 82% of child psychiatrists and only 22% of paediatricians.\nThis first national study of ADHD attitudes and practices presents comprehensive data regarding the management of children with ADHD in CAMHS and paediatric settings in Ireland. Paediatricians reported a minor role in managing ADHD. Study limitations are related to subjective reporting rather than case note audit, and a moderate response rate for the paediatricians' participants."}, {"Title": "The views of Wilhelm Griesinger (1817-68) on suicidality or 'self-murder'.", "Abstract": "To date, little attention has been paid to the fact that a whole section in Wilhelm Griesinger's textbook is devoted to suicidality. Griesinger perceived suicide as a distinct entity. In his opinion, only one-third of all suicides were committed by people suffering from mental disorders; heredity and brain anomalies could also be involved. Therapeutically, Griesinger recommended removing all potential means for suicide and admitting people at risk to a psychiatric hospital.

Statistics show that 8% of the general population suffers from SP. Although this value has been described inaccurately, there is no standard definition or etiology to diagnose SP. There are several speculations describing SP in the current literature. These descriptions can be viewed as either cultural-based or medical-based. The disparity among cultural or ethnic groups and medical professionals in identifying SP has led to the various approaches to managing the condition.

Collegial consultation could allow a framed prescription of treatments that are not authorized in specific indications. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity in adult populations (ADHD) is a striking example of a pathology where off-label prescription is frequent. First considered to be a childhood disorder, the awareness of this condition in adults is increasing, leading to the development of new clinical practices and treatments. However, the adult ADHD diagnosis and its management are still emerging in France despite a high prevalence. Treatment of adult ADHD relies on methylphenidate prescription, but the initiation of this drug is not authorized in adult populations. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is structurally close to amphetamine and acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Due to these pharmacological properties, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular side-effects could occur. Furthermore, its addictive potential has led France to classify it as a psychoactive drug, dispensed via secured prescription. The first prescription and the one-year follow-up are restricted to neurologists, paediatrics, psychiatrists and sleep disorders specialists at hospital. The objective of this article is to propose a multidisciplinary framework for the off-label prescription of methylphenidate in adult ADHD.\nThe Multidisciplinary Advice Consultation for Exceptional Addiction Treatments (Consultation d'Avis Multidisciplinaire de Traitements d'Exception en Addictologie CAMTEA) was first set up in Lille for the prescription of baclofen in alcohol dependence and was then extended to topiramate in binge eating disorder. This procedure has been adapted to the particularities of ADHD in adult populations, the differential diagnosis (bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, anxious disorder, personality disorder, substance use disorder) and the co-morbidities requiring a full psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, a particular attention has been paid to the monitoring of neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular and misuse risk because of the potential side-effects of methylphenidate.\nThe proposed prescription framework is structured into several specialized consultations. A first psychiatric evaluation aims to diagnose adult ADHD, using the French version of the Diagnostisch Interview Voor ADHD 2.0\u00a0questionnaire (DIVA 2.0), and to assess the quality of life impact with the Weiss Functional Inventory Rating Scale (WIFRS). It also searches for the presence of differential diagnosis or co-morbidities. The second appointment consists of a pharmacological evaluation that aims to search for contraindications and potential drug interaction. A neuropsychological evaluation based on standardized tests (Weschler Adulte Intelligence Scale [WAIS IV], Conner's Continuous Performance Test 3 [CPT] and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personnality Inventory [MMPI]) is also required to evaluate neurocognitive disabilities and personality features. Once the parameters of the different assessments have been collected, the synthesis is presented during a multidisciplinary meeting in order to assess the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. Several specialties are involved in this multidisciplinary meeting: psychiatry, addictology, general medicine, addictovigilance, pharmacovigilance and neuropsychology. One strategy among three possibilities can be decided: (1) contraindication to treatment with methylphenidate, (2) attention deficit disorder that does not require medication management, and (3) indication of treatment with methylphenidate with the choice of the pharmacological form (immediate or prolonged release). A biological check-up and an electrocardiogram are carried out systematically before any treatment. If the decision is made to initiate treatment, it is started at the lowest dosage and followed by a titration phase. A weekly follow-up is carried out during the titration phase in order to assess treatment efficacy and safety. After treatment stabilization, the general practitioner can carry out the renewal, and the patient will be reassessed within the framework of the multidisciplinary consultation every 3\u00a0months.\nWhen an off-label prescription is being considered, it must comply with the basic rules of good clinical practice, and the benefit/risk ratio should be constantly reassessed. The proposed multidisciplinary framework, adapted to the characteristics of adult ADHD and the pharmacological properties of methylphenidate, appears to be an interesting strategy to meet the requirements of the good clinical practice. The complementary assessments carried out and the collegial framework allow enhancing the patient's follow-up and minimize the drug risk, particularly in the psychiatric, addictive and cardiovascular adverse events. Finally, this framework could also help the monitoring of other off-label treatments for ADHD, such as atomoxetine or guanfacine."}, {"Title": "India's Mental Healthcare Act, 2017: Content, context, controversy.", "Abstract": "India's new mental health legislation, the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, was commenced on 29 May 2018 and seeks explicitly to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It grants a legally binding right to mental healthcare to over 1.3 billion people, one sixth of the planet's population. Key measures include (a) new definitions of 'mental illness' and 'mental health establishment'; (b) revised consideration of 'capacity' in relation to mental healthcare (c) 'advance directives' to permit persons with mental illness to direct future care; (d) 'nominated representatives', who need not be family members; (e) the right to mental healthcare and broad social rights for the mentally ill; (f) establishment of governmental authorities to oversee services; (g) Mental Health Review Boards to review admissions and other matters; (h) revised procedures for 'independent admission' (voluntary admission), 'supported admission' (admission and treatment without patient consent), and 'admission of minor'; (i) revised rules governing treatment, restraint and research; and (j) de facto decriminalization of suicide. Key challenges relate to resourcing both mental health services and the new structures proposed in the legislation, the appropriateness of apparently increasingly legalized approaches to care (especially the implications of potentially lengthy judicial proceedings), and possible paradoxical effects resulting in barriers to care (e.g. revised licensing requirements for general hospital psychiatry units). There is ongoing controversy about specific measures (e.g. the ban on electro-convulsive therapy without muscle relaxants and anaesthesia), reflecting a need for continued engagement with stakeholders including patients, families, the Indian Psychiatric Society and non-governmental organisations. Despite these challenges, the new legislation offers substantial potential benefits not only to India but, by example, to other countries that seek to align their laws with the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and improve the position of the mentally ill."}, {"Title": "Caring for Families Separated by Changing Immigration Policies and Enforcement: A Cultural Psychiatry Perspective.", "Abstract": "Recent changes in U.S. immigration policies and enforcement have precipitated a 300% rise in arrests and planned deportations.

Building on cross-cultural work with refugee families and other groups and on work with families separated by parental incarceration, the authors provide recommendations to guide clinicians working with families who are separated or who fear separation. Mental health problems among separated families can in part be addressed through identifying the origins of distress, elucidating family structures and roles, strengthening communication practices, linking with legal and economic resources, and facilitating decision making through distress reduction."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry as a career choice among medical students: a cross-sectional study examining school-related and non-school factors.", "Abstract": "Given the low recruitment to psychiatry worldwide, the current study aimed to examine how premedical and intramedical school factors, perception of career aspects, attitudes towards psychiatry, stigma towards mental illness and personality traits may affect the likelihood of psychiatry as a career choice.\nCross-sectional online study.\n502 medical students from two public medical institutions in Singapore.\nWe critically examined existing literature for factors identified to influence psychiatry as a career choice and explored their effects in a group of medical students in Singapore.

Among medical school factors, attending a psychiatry/mental\u2009health club was the only influential factor. Negative attitudes towards psychiatry, but not stigma towards people with mental illness, significantly predicted the likelihood of not choosing psychiatry as a career.\nImproving educational environment or teaching practice in psychiatric training may aid in future recruitment for psychiatrists.

In this paper, I examine current efforts to understand and reduce both violence and coercive responses to violence in psychiatry, arguing that these efforts are destined to fall short. By and large, scholarship on psychiatric violence reduction has focused on identifying discrete factors that are statistically associated with violence, such as patient demographics and clinical qualities, in an effort to quantify risk and predict\u00a0violent acts before\u00a0they happen. Using the work of Horkheimer and Adorno, I characterize the theoretical orientation of such efforts as identity thinking. I then argue that these approaches lead to epistemic imperceptiveness and a subtle form of conceptual restraint on patients. I suggest a reorientation in psychiatric research, away from identity thinking and toward a more productive and just approach to the problem of violence in psychiatric clinics."}, {"Title": "Interventions for involuntary psychiatric inpatients: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Observational research has found that involuntary treatment provides limited benefits in terms of long-term clinical outcomes.

Seven databases (AMED, PsycINFO, Embase Classic, Embase 1974-2017, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and BNI) were searched and the results were analysed in a narrative synthesis.\nNineteen papers describing fourteen different interventions were included. Using narrative synthesis the interventions were summarised into three categories: a) structured patient-centred care planning; b) specialist therapeutic interventions; c) systemic changes to hospital practice. The methodologies used and outcomes assessed were heterogeneous. Most studies were of low quality, although five interventions were tested in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Preliminary evidence supports structured patient-centred care planning interventions have an effect on long-term outcomes (such as readmission), and that specialist therapeutic interventions and systemic changes to hospital practice have an effect on reducing the use of coercive measures on wards.\nThis review shows that it is possible to conduct rigorous intervention-testing studies in involuntary patients, including RCTs.

The name reflects the combined practice of psychiatry and neurology that was still present at the time. Directors were nominated by the founding organizations: American Psychiatry Association (APA), American Neurological Association (ANA), and the Section of Nervous and Mental Diseases of the American Medical Association (AMA). Many of the early physicians who were certified by the ABPN did so for psychiatry as well as neurology. Neurologist Walter Freeman and psychiatrist Adolph Meyer played important roles in the ABPN during the early days. Following the founding of the AAN in 1948, neurological practitioners believed the AAN would better represent them in the ABPN. At first the ANA appointed AAN members to the ANA Council; but after 1972, the AAN could directly nominate directors for the ABPN. Despite this situation, the AAN had an important influence in the ABPN from its start, as is shown by the fact that all of the key organizational leaders responsible for founding the AAN-the \"Four Horsemen\" (Abraham B.

Students completed a knowledge scale, and the medical conditions regard scale comparing attitudes to four mental illness and three physical illness.\nKnowledge about and attitudes toward mental illness showed significant improvement over the 5-year period. However, both preclinical and clinical students revealed significant levels of stigmatization toward mental illness despite improvements in knowledge. Students recognized the need to prioritize treatment for persons with mental illness but did not want to be personally involved in the treatment process.\nResults highlight that significant negative attitudes still exist among medical students toward mental illness and these persist up until graduation.

Given this vulnerability, combined with metabolic risks of antipsychotics, physical health monitoring is critical. Inpatient admission is an opportunity to screen for medical comorbidities. Our objective was to improve the rates of physical health monitoring on an inpatient psychiatry unit through implementation of an electronic standardized order set.\nUsing a clinical audit tool, we completed a baseline retrospective audit (96 eligible charts) of patients aged 18 to 100 years, discharged between January and March 2012, prescribed an antipsychotic for 3 or more days. We then developed and implemented a standard electronic admission order set and provided training to inpatient clinical staff. We completed a second chart audit of patients discharged between January and March 2016 (190 eligible charts) to measure improvement in physical health monitoring and intervention rates for abnormal results.\nIn the 2012 audit, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), blood pressure, blood glucose, fasting lipids, electrocardiogram (ECG), and height/weight were measured in 71%, 92%, 31%, 36%, 51%, and 75% of patients, respectively. In the 2016 audit, TSH, blood pressure, blood glucose, fasting lipids, ECG, and height/weight were measured in 86%, 96%, 96%, 64%, 87%, and 71% of patients, respectively. There were statistically significant improvements (P < 0.05) in monitoring rates for blood glucose, lipids, ECG, and TSH. Intervention rates for abnormal blood glucose and/or lipids (feedback to family doctor and/or patient, consultation to hospitalist, endocrinology, and/or dietician) did not change between 2012 and 2016.\nElectronic standardized order set can be used as a tool to improve screening for physical health comorbidity in patients with severe mental illness receiving antipsychotic medications."}, {"Title": "Security of mind: 20 years of attachment theory and its relevance to psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this editorial, I suggest that no psychiatrist should be without a working knowledge of attachment theory, and it is a capability that all trainees should cover in the proposed new curriculum.

Notably, these studies have relied exclusively on questionnaire data, and thus their findings may be attributable to a method effect. This study examined the factor structure of <i>DSM-5</i> PTSD symptoms using both questionnaire and interview data to determine the impact of assessment method on factor structure and construct validity of alternative model symptom clusters. Participants (<i>N</i> = 380) were veterans who completed the PTSD Checklist for <i>DSM-5</i> (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for <i>DSM-5</i> (CAPS-5; Weathers et al., 2013). Fit was similar across models. However, the seven-factor Hybrid model (Armour et al., 2015) fit best. Limited evidence of a method effect was observed. Results of construct validity analyses were mixed; some of the newly proposed symptom clusters demonstrated hypothesized differential associations with external correlates, but others did not. These findings suggest that results of previous <i>DSM-5</i> PTSD CFAs supporting the Hybrid model are not attributable to a method effect. However, observed limited difference in model fit and mixed construct validity evidence raise concerns regarding the value of parsing <i>DSM-5</i> symptom clusters. Constructs implied by the new factors in the more complex measurement models of PTSD require greater explication and construct validation.

It is responsible for delays in help-seeking, encourages social distance and discrimination, and furthers self-stigmatization. This paper discusses the circumstances of the origins of the idea of a chronic brain disease (Emil Kraepelin, 1856-1926), of the split personality concept derived from the term \"schizophrenia\" (Eugen Bleuler, 1857-1939), and the craziness idea reflected in the \"first rank symptoms\", which are all hallucinations and delusions (Kurt Schneider, 1887-1967). It shows how Emil Kraepelin's scientific search for homogenous groups of patients with a common aetiology, symptom pattern, and prognosis materialized in the definition of \"dementia praecox\" as a progressing brain disease; how Eugen Bleuler's life and professional circumstances facilitated an \"empathic\" approach to his patients and prompted him to put in the foreground incoherence of cognitive and affective functioning, and not the course of the disease; finally, how Kurt Schneider in his didactic attempt to teach general practitioners how to reliably diagnose schizophrenia, neglected what Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler had emphasized decades earlier and devised his own criteria, consisting exclusively of hallucinations and delusions. In a strange conglomerate, the modern operational diagnostic criteria reflect all three approaches, by claiming to be Neo-Kraepelinean in terms of defining a categorical disease entity with a suggestion of chronicity, by keeping Bleuler's ambiguous term schizophrenia, and by relying heavily on Kurt Schneider's hallucinations and delusions. While interrater reliability may have improved with operational diagnostic criteria, the definition of schizophrenia is still arbitrary and has no empirical validity-but induces stigma."}, {"Title": "Discoveries on the Genetics of ADHD in the 21st Century: New Findings and Their Implications.", "Abstract": "The 21st century has witnessed the discovery of multiple rare and common gene variants associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and these discoveries have already provided a starting point for the investigation of the biology of the disorder and novel treatments. The purpose of this selective review is to examine genetic findings from the past 5 years and consider their implications for the conceptualization of ADHD and future clinical practice. Recent discoveries reveal the strong genetic overlaps between ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as intellectual disability. Thus, the removal of the previous diagnostic exclusion criteria for ADHD in the presence of ASD is a welcome change in DSM-5. However, ADHD also shows substantial genetic correlations with a much broader group of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as with nonpsychiatric conditions (e.g., lung cancer). Investigating potential explanations for these links is an important next step. ADHD, while usefully conceptualized as a disorder in clinical practice, can be viewed as a trait. Recent genome-wide association study findings, consistent with twin studies, highlight that ADHD lies at the extreme end of a continuously distributed dimension, akin to hypertension along the continuum of blood pressure. Although ADHD levels typically decline with age, twin and molecular genetic studies suggest that a persistent trajectory is associated with higher genetic loading. Routine testing for rare mutations in ADHD is not yet recommended, although guidelines in many countries recommend testing individuals with mild intellectual disability or ASD, so practice could change. Common gene variants for ADHD are only weakly predictive and therefore have limited clinical value at present, as does pharmacogenomics.

Primary outcome will be the child's mental health. Additional outcomes will cover the partner's drinking, the participants own mental health and drinking, the child's social adjustment, treatment seeking in all three parties and parental self-efficacy. Measures will be collected preintervention, mid-intervention and postintervention, and three times during a 2-year follow-up period. Data will be analysed using mixed-effects modelling.\nThis study has been approved by the Stockholm Regional Ethical Review Board (2016/2179-31). The results will be presented at conferences and published as peer-reviewed publications.\nISRCTN38702517; Pre-results."}, {"Title": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Psychiatric Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.", "Abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been gaining favor as a viable tool in Psychiatry. The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence of tDCS as a treatment of disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Current findings indicate that tDCS is probably effective in non-treatment-resistant depressive patients. Regarding schizophrenia and OCD, present evidence is not robust enough, although preliminary results indicate that tDCS is a promising technique. Therefore, more trials are needed before using tDCS in a clinical setting."}, {"Title": "Deep Brain Stimulation: Clinical Applications.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation has been used for decades in neurology to treat movement disorders. More recent work has focused on developing applications for deep brain stimulation in psychiatric illness. Initial studies have demonstrated positive results for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Initial open-label studies of deep brain stimulation at targets for treatment-resistant depression have been encouraging. However, the only 2 published controlled trials that were conducted for potential FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression were both negative. Future directions include potential use of alternate clinical trial designs, using tractography for more refined deep brain stimulation electrode targeting, and closed-loop deep brain stimulation approaches."}, {"Title": "Deep Brain Stimulation in Psychiatry: Mechanisms, Models, and Next-Generation Therapies.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation has preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy, but has been difficult to develop into a robust therapy, in part because its mechanisms are incompletely understood. We review evidence from movement and psychiatric disorder studies, with an emphasis on how deep brain stimulation changes brain networks. From this, we argue for a network-oriented approach to future deep brain stimulation studies. That network approach requires methods for identifying patients with specific circuit/network deficits. We describe how dimensional approaches to diagnoses may aid that identification. We discuss the use of network/circuit biomarkers to develop self-adjusting \"closed loop\" systems."}, {"Title": "Advancing Integrated Care through Psychiatric Workforce Development: A Systematic Review of Educational Interventions to Train Psychiatrists in Integrated Care.", "Abstract": "Integrated or collaborative care is a well-evidenced and widely practiced approach to improve access to high-quality mental health care in primary care and other settings. Psychiatrists require preparation for this emerging type of practice, and such training is now mandatory for Canadian psychiatry residents. However, it is not known how best to mount such training, and in the absence of such knowledge, the quality of training across Canada has suffered. To guide integrated care education nationally, we conducted a systematic review of published and unpublished training programs.\nWe searched journal databases and web-based 'grey' literature and contacted all North American psychiatry residency programs known to provide integrated care training. We included educational interventions targeting practicing psychiatrists or psychiatry residents as learners. We critically appraised literature using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). We described the goals, content, and format of training, as well as outcomes categorized according to Kirkpatrick level of impact.\nWe included 9 published and 5 unpublished educational interventions. Studies were of low to moderate quality and reflected possible publication bias toward favourable outcomes. Programs commonly involved longitudinal clinical experiences for residents, mentoring networks for practicing physicians, or brief didactic experiences and were rarely oriented toward the most empirically supported models of integrated care. Implementation challenges were widespread.\nSimilar to integrated care clinical interventions, integrated care training is important yet difficult to achieve. Educational initiatives could benefit from faculty development, quality improvement to synergistically improve care and training, and stronger evaluation.

PP has been associated to various clinical variables present in the course of the disorder, including deficits in cognitive functioning, suicide attempts, hospitalizations and response to pharmacological treatment. However, most published studies are retrospective and cross-sectional, frequently relying on patients\u00b4 ability to recall past information, which may often be inaccurate.\nParticipants were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Bipolar Disorder Research Program at the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Baseline clinical and demographic variables were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and the SCID-CV. Longitudinal data were collected through medical records, mood charts, and mood symptom scales conducted throughout a 7-year follow-up period.\nManic Predominant Polarity (MPP) was associated with a significantly higher number of hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and episodes with psychotic symptoms throughout the 7-year observed period in comparison to Depressive Predominant Polarity (DPP) and Indefinite Predominant Polarity (IPP) patients. Moreover, baseline PP was significantly associated with 7-year PP, with 67% of patients maintaining their PP both at baseline and after the 7-year follow-up period.\nThe present study is limited due to the statistically small sample size, although, to our knowledge, it is the largest longitudinal study conducted in this topic, and the unequally distributed frequency of patients\u00b4 visitations, which may have created intervals of unobserved periods within the follow-up period.\nThe results revealed PP to be an important specifier for predicting the course of the disorder. Overall, MPP was significantly associated with variables indicative of a worse outcome, suggesting that greater attention to preventive treatment should be addressed to this subgroup. Lastly, baseline PP was significantly associated with 7-year observed PP, suggesting that patients tend to remain within the same PP throughout the course of the disorder."}, {"Title": "The Role of Local Educational Institutions in Educating of EMDR Practitioners in Bosnia-Herzegovina.", "Abstract": "Providing good mental health services to the vulnerable and needy should be of utmost importance to all mental health professionals.

They cover a broad spectrum of indications including acute psychotic, manic and depressive symptoms, and maintenance treatment. This study evaluates the changes in prescribing patterns of first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) and second-generation AP at Innsbruck University Hospital for the treatment of bipolar inpatients between 1999 and 2016. In this retrospective chart review, we included adult patients with a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (ICD 9: F296; ICD 10: F31) who were admitted as inpatients at the Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy between 1999 and 2016 for more than 7 days. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. The complete medical histories were searched retrospectively for the prescription of psychotropic medications at the time of discharge, with a special focus on APs. We found a significant increase in the use of atypical AP, mainly attributable to the prescription of quetiapine for all types of episodes, followed by aripiprazole for manic and as add-on therapy for depressive episodes. The prescription rate of clozapine decreased significantly. The prescription rate of FGA showed a small but not significant decrease for the treatment of manic and mixed episodes, and a significant decrease for depressive episodes. These trends apparently mirror in part the evidence base for the use of AP, but also illustrate that clinicians still appreciate the effectiveness of FGA despite their inferior tolerability profile."}, {"Title": "Police Interactions Among Neuropathologically Confirmed Dementia Patients: Prevalence and Cause.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the prevalence and recurrence of police interaction (PI) with patients diagnosed with dementia.

The diagnoses were Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia. A prerequisite was that extensive clinical investigation and follow-up had been conducted at the Department of Geriatric Psychiatry in Lund.\nOf the 281 patients studied, 50 (18%) had a history of interacting with the police during the course of their disease. Frontotemporal dementia patients had a relatively higher prevalence of PI and more often due to criminal behavior. The recurrence of PIs differed among the groups; frontotemporal dementia patients exhibited a higher PI recurrence compared with the other groups.\nThe patterns of PIs differ between the frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease patients.

However, little research has been conducted regarding the efficacy of incident reporting systems, particularly within an inpatient psychiatry setting.\nThe medical records from a random sample of 40 psychiatric units within Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers were screened and evaluated by physicians for 9 types of safety events. The abstracted safety events were then evaluated to assess if they were caused by an error and if they caused harm to the patient. These safety events were then matched to incidents that were reported to the VHA Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), which includes all reported adverse events, close calls, and root cause analyses that occur within the VHA health system.\nOverall, 37.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u202f=\u202f33.5%-41.5%) of safety events detected in the medical record were reported to the AERS. Among the patient safety events identified, the most commonly reported to the AERS were patient falls (52.3%), assaults (46.2%), and elopements (42.3%). Reporting rates increased when the patient safety event resulted in harm to the patient (48.2%; CI\u202f=\u202f41.6%-55.0%).\nThe majority of patient safety events that occur on VHA inpatient psychiatric units do not get reported to the VHA's Adverse Event Reporting System.

A critical explanatory gap lies in our mechanistic understanding of how systems-level neuroimaging biomarkers emerge from underlying synaptic-level perturbations associated with a disease state. We describe an emerging computational psychiatry approach leveraging biophysically based computational models of large-scale brain dynamics and their potential integration with clinical and pharmacological neuroimaging. In particular, we focus on neural circuit models, which describe how patterns of functional connectivity observed in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging emerge from neural dynamics shaped by inter-areal interactions through underlying structural connectivity defining long-range projections. We highlight the importance of local circuit physiological dynamics, in combination with structural connectivity, in shaping the emergent functional connectivity. Furthermore, heterogeneity of local circuit properties across brain areas, which impacts large-scale dynamics, may be critical for modeling whole-brain phenomena and alterations in psychiatric disorders and pharmacological manipulation. Finally, we discuss important directions for future model development and biophysical extensions, which will expand their utility to link clinical neuroimaging to neurobiological mechanisms."}, {"Title": "A Survey of Clinical Approaches to Suicide Risk Assessment for Patients Intoxicated on Alcohol.", "Abstract": "Suicidal ideation and alcohol use are common among emergency department patients. It is unclear at what point a suicide risk assessment should occur among patients who present with acute alcohol intoxication.\nThis study aims to describe practice patterns among expert practitioners for timing the suicide risk assessment for an intoxicated patient.\nAn online survey was sent to emergency psychiatrists and behavioral health specialists on 2 national listserves including that of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry's Emergency Psychiatry Special Interest Group.\nSixty respondents had a mean of 16 \u00b1 12years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) out of specialty training and had extensive experience and comfort in managing this patient presentation. All respondents were board-certified and most (68%) practiced in academic settings. The most common practice for conducting a safety risk assessment in alcohol-intoxicated patients was to proceed once the patient was clinically sober (58%). Other practices included retesting the patient until a specific blood alcohol concentration was reached (19%) or waiting a certain time after presentation based on the initial blood alcohol concentration (15%). Some (8%) evaluated actively-intoxicated patients for suicide risk. Practice varied slightly based on the location of practice,type of practice, and where the clinician trained.\nExpert clinicians most often describe using a clinical assessment to determine sobriety before completing a suicidal risk assessment, although alternative practices remain common.

However, the mechanisms behind both their strengths and their weaknesses are inadequately understood. Here we describe how advances in computational modeling may help formalize and test hypotheses regarding how patients make inferences, which are core postulates of these therapies. Specifically, we highlight the relevance of computations with regard to the development, maintenance, and therapeutic change in psychiatric disorders. A Bayesian approach helps delineate which apparent inferential biases and aberrant beliefs are in fact near-normative, given patients' current concerns, and which are not. As examples, we formalize three hypotheses. First, high-level dysfunctional beliefs should be treated as beliefs over models of the world. There is a need to test how, and whether, people apply these high-level beliefs to guide the formation of lower level beliefs important for real-life decision making, conditional on their experiences. Second, during the genesis of a disorder, maladaptive beliefs grow because more benign alternative schemas are discounted during belief updating. Third, we propose that when patients learn within therapy but fail to benefit in real life, this can be accounted for by a mechanism that we term overaccommodation, similar to that used to explain fear reinstatement. Beyond these specifics, an ambitious collaborative research program between computational psychiatry researchers, therapists, and experts-by-experience needs to form testable predictions out of factors claimed to be important for therapy."}, {"Title": "Deep Brain Stimulation for Intractable Obsessive-compulsive Disorder: The International and Japanese Situation/Scenario.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat symptoms by modulating the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loop in the central nervous system (CNS), and attempts to research loop circuit disorders have been globally initiated among the intractable neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Beyond cultural, political or ideal positions, a further critical issue, often underestimated or quite not considered, concerns a person\u2019s ability to express a valid consent to the request of death, according to the same criteria of validity of the informed consent to any medical act. This assumes particular importance in the case of assisted suicide. Assisted suicide represents a phenomenon in sharp growth in Western world. It is legal in many nations, and in Switzerland it is also allowed for foreign citizens, thus increasing the phenomenon of the so-called \u201ctourism of suicide\u201d. In addition to neoplastic and neurological diseases, depression has also been accepted as a disease that makes assisted suicide possible. This imposes profound clinical and ethical considerations, since depression is unanimously recognized as a treatable disease and since in its most serious forms, such as those in which suicidal ideation dominates, it can compromise the patient\u2019s ability to express a valid consent to any medical act, including the assisted suicide. Furthermore, it is often overlooked that any serious and disabling somatic disease, source of intense and chronic suffering, carries the very high risk of the onset of unrecognized depressive conditions, able in turn to negatively influence the ability to express valid consent. Faced with this situation, which has involved a large number of Italian citizens in recent years, the personal and official voice of psychiatry is absolutely lacking, contrasting its silence with the opinions of those who do not want to take into account its potentially fundamental considerations."}, {"Title": "Web-Based Cognitive Bias Intervention for Psychiatric Disorders: Protocol for a Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Traditional psychological therapies focus mainly on modification of individuals' conscious decision-making process.

Among outpatients with depression, we examined the differential impact of medical or non-medical marijuana use, relative to no-use, on psychopathology and service use over time.\nParticipants were 307 psychiatry outpatients participating in a trial of drug/alcohol use treatment for depression. Measures of past 30-day marijuana use, depression/anxiety symptoms, psychiatry visits, and functional data related to health status were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Regressions (baseline and 1 year) and growth models (over time) predicted clinical and psychiatry visit outcomes, from medical or non-medical marijuana use (no-use\u202f=\u202freference).\nAt baseline, 40.0% of the sample used marijuana and more reported non-medical (71.7%) than medical (28.2%) use. Relative to non-users at baseline, patients using medically had worse mental/physical health functioning (p's\u202f<\u202f0.05), and non-medical use was associated with higher suicidal ideation (B\u202f=\u202f1.08, p\u202f=\u202f.002), worse mental health functioning (B\u202f=\u202f-3.79, p\u202f=\u202f.015), and fewer psychiatry visits (B\u202f=\u202f-0.69, p\u202f=\u202f.009).

The primary analysis examined rates and doses of gabapentin use in relation to SUD. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to assess a predictive model for SUD in gabapentin users. The secondary analysis examined trends of off-label gabapentin use.\nOf 1,483 admissions to inpatient psychiatry services, 345 subjects (23.1%) were prescribed gabapentin as an outpatient prior to admission. Current SUD was identified in 88.1% of the sample, with 65.2% identified as polysubstance positive. Mean daily doses of gabapentin were higher in subjects with positive SUD than in those with no history of SUD. Gabapentin doses \u2265 1,800 mg/d were associated with opiate misuse (P < .001), need for detoxification (P = .004), and positive hepatitis C status (P = .001). Multinomial linear regression revealed that use of gabapentin doses \u2265 1,800 mg/d was predictive of opiate misuse and positive hepatitis C status, with 68.7% positive predictive value.\nHigh-dose gabapentin use can be predictive of opiate misuse disorder.

(2) To critically discuss the promises and pitfalls of using this literature to understand violence in schizophrenia in clinical, forensic, and legal settings. <b>Methods:</b> Following the PRISMA guidelines and literature searches until January 2018, we found 21 original studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1) Studies of persons with schizophrenia, (2) a history of violence or aggressive behavior, (3) the use of one or more MRI-modalities (sMRI, DTI, fMRI). <b>Results:</b> The most consistent findings from the structural studies were reduced volumes of the hippocampus and the frontal lobe (in particular the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex) in schizophrenia patients with a history of violence or higher aggression scores. The functional studies mainly showed differences and aggression correlates in the frontal lobe and amygdala. However, the studies were methodologically heterogeneous, with four particular areas of concern: different definitions of violence, region of interest vs. whole-brain studies, small subject samples, and group comparisons in a heterogeneous diagnostic category (schizophrenia). <b>Conclusion:</b> The literature reports subtle, but inconsistent group level differences in brain structure and function associated with violence and aggression with schizophrenia, in particular in areas involved in the formation of psychosis symptoms and affective regulation. Due to methodological challenges the results should be interpreted with caution. In order to come closer to the neurobiological underpinnings of violence in schizophrenia future studies could: (1) address the neurobiological differences of premeditated and reactive violence, (2) use RDoC criteria, for example, or other symptom-based systems to categorize psychosis patients, (3) increase subject cohorts and apply new data driven methods. In this perspective, MRI-studies of violence in schizophrenia have the potential to inform clinical violence prediction and legal evaluations <i>in the future</i>."}, {"Title": "Which work-related characteristics are most strongly associated with common mental disorders? A cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Studies exploring work-related risk factors of common mental disorders (CMDs), such as major depressive disorder (MDD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) or alcohol abuse, have generally focused on a limited set of work characteristics. For the first time in a primary care setting, we examine simultaneously multiple work-related risk factors in relation to CMDs.\nWe use data from a study of working individuals recruited among 2027 patients of 121 general practitioners (GPs) representative of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in the North of France (April-August 2014). CMDs (MDD; GAD; alcohol abuse) were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Six worked-related factors were examined (work intensity, emotional demands, autonomy, social relations at work, conflict in values and job insecurity). Several covariates were considered (patient, GP and contextual characteristics). To study the association between workplace risk factors and CMDs, we used multilevel Poisson regression models adjusted for covariates.\nAmong study participants, 389 (19.1%) met criteria for MDD, 522 (25.8%) for GAD and 196 (9.7%) for alcohol abuse. In multivariable analyses adjusted for covariates, MDD/GAD was significantly associated with work intensity (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27) (absolute risk=52.8%), emotional demands (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35) (absolute risk=54.9%) and social relations at work (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.87) (absolute risk=15.0%); alcohol abuse was associated with social relations at work (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.53) (absolute risk=7.6%) and autonomy (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99) (absolute risk=8.9%).\nSeveral workplace factors are associated with CMDs among working individuals seen by a GP.

These advances have been spurred by brain-inspired architectures and algorithms such as hierarchical filtering and reinforcement learning. OpenAI Gym is an open-source platform in which to train, test, and benchmark algorithms-it provides a range of tasks, including those of classic arcade games such as Doom. Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions.\nTo illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n\u00a0= 9, 22 \u00b1 1 years of age) and older (n\u00a0= 7, 56 \u00b1 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward.\nThese simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level-dependent responses can be produced.\nWe show that active inference, through epistemic and value-based goals, enables simulated subjects to actively develop detailed representations of gaming environments, and we demonstrate the use of a principled algorithmic and neurobiological framework for testing hypotheses in psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Subjective Cognitive Impairment Cohort (SCIENCe): study design and first results.", "Abstract": "We aimed to describe the Subjective Cognitive Impairment Cohort (SCIENCe) study design, to cross-sectionally describe participant characteristics, and to evaluate the SCD-plus criteria.\nThe SCIENCe is a prospective cohort study of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients.

We have developed a Virtual Reality aggression prevention training (VRAPT), providing safe virtual environments, in which patients can practice controlling their aggressive behaviors in an adequate way. The main objective of this study is to examine whether VRAPT is effective in reducing aggression among forensic psychiatric inpatients.\nFour forensic psychiatric centers in the Netherlands are participating in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either VRAPT or a waiting list.

The theme \"time: opportunity for change\" seems to have an overarching importance.\nBy understanding the specific content along these themes, relevant to the individual patient, carers may be able to better support their personal recovery journey.

In Switzerland, nearly all psychiatric hospitals offer structured exercise and sport therapy as part of their standard therapeutic treatment. However, little is known about the degree to which psychiatric patients make use of these treatment offers. The aim of this study is to examine, in a sample of psychiatric in-patients (a) how many participate in the structured exercise and sport therapy programs offered by the clinic, (b) how many engage in exercise and sport activities on an individual basis, and (c) how many meet recommended levels of health-enhancing physical activity during their stay at the clinic. Furthermore, we examine whether those who engage in exercise and sport activities are more likely to meet internationally accepted physical activity recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> 107 psychiatric in-patients (49% women, M<sub>age</sub> = 39.9 years) were recruited at three psychiatric clinics in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. All participants were engaged in treatment and received usual care. Based on accelerometer data, participants were classified as either meeting or not meeting physical activity recommendations (\u2265150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week). Participation in structured and individually performed exercise and sport activities was assessed with the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> In total, 57% of all patients met physical activity recommendations. 55% participated in structured exercise and sport therapy activities, whereas only 22% of all patients engaged in exercise and sport activities independently. Psychiatric patients were significantly more likely to meet recommended levels of health-enhancing physical activity if they engaged in at least 60 min per week of structured exercise and sport therapy or in at least 30 min of individually performed exercise and sport activity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Given that prolonged immobilization and sedentary behavior have harmful effects on patients' physical and mental well-being, promoting exercise and sport activities is an important endeavor in psychiatric care. Clinics currently succeed in involving between 50 and 60% of all patients in sufficient physical activity. While this is encouraging, more systematic efforts are needed to ensure that all patients get enough physical activity."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry, Cultural Competency, and the Care of Ultra-Orthodox Jews: Achieving Secular and Theocentric Convergence Through Introspection.", "Abstract": "Several socio-cultural factors complicate mental health care in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish population. These include societal stigma, fear of the influence of secular ideas, the need for rabbinic approval of the method and provider, and the notion that excessive concern with the self is counter-productive to religious growth. Little is known about how the religious beliefs of this population might be employed in therapeutic contexts. One potential point of convergence is the Jewish philosophical tradition of introspection as a means toward personal, interpersonal, and spiritual growth. We reviewed Jewish religious-philosophical writings on introspection from antiquity (the Babylonian Talmud) to the Middle Ages (Duties of the Heart), the eighteenth century (Path of the Just), the early Hasidic movement (the\u00a0Tanya), and modernity (Alei Shur, Halakhic Man). Analysis of these texts indicates that: (1) introspection can be a religiously acceptable reaction to existential distress; (2) introspection might promote alignment of religious beliefs with emotions, intellect and behavior; (3) some religious philosophers were concerned about the demotivating effects of excessive introspection and self-critique on religious devotion and emotional well-being; (4) certain religious forms of introspection are remarkably analogous to modern methods of psychiatry and psychology, particularly psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy. We conclude that homology between religious philosophy of emotion and secular methods of psychiatry and psychotherapy may inform the choice and method of mental health care, foster the therapist-patient relationship, and thereby enable therapeutic convergence."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of supported employment in non-trial routine implementation: systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "While supported employment (SE) programs for people with mental illness have demonstrated their superiority in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, little is known about the effectiveness of non-trial routine programs.

Recent evidence indicates that arbitration between these two modes of control (\"metacontrol\") is based on their relative costs and benefits. While model-based control may increase accuracy, it requires greater computational resources, so people invoke model-based control only when potential rewards exceed those of model-free control. We used a sequential decision task, while concurrently manipulating performance incentives, to ask if symptoms and traits of psychopathology decrease or increase model-based control in response to incentives.\nWe recruited a nonpatient population of 839 online participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed transdiagnostic self-report measures encompassing symptoms, traits, and factors. We fit a dual-controller reinforcement learning model and obtained a computational measure of model-based control separately for small incentives and large incentives.\nNone of the constructs were related to a failure of large incentives to boost model-based control. In fact, for the sensation seeking trait and anxious-depression factor, higher scores were associated with a larger incentive effect, whereby greater levels of these constructs were associated with larger increases in model-based control. Many constructs showed decreases in model-based control as a function of severity, but a social withdrawal factor was positively correlated; alcohol use and social anxiety were unrelated to model-based control.\nOur results demonstrate that model-based control can reliably be improved independent of construct severity for most measures. This suggests that incentives may be a useful intervention for boosting model-based control across a range of symptom and trait severity."}, {"Title": "Rare cause of manic period trigger in bipolar mood disorder: testosterone replacement.", "Abstract": "Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare congenital disorder characterised by the deficiency and the absence of puberty and infertility.

A long tradition of diagnosing \"mental illness\" of society-exemplified by Erich Fromm-stands apart from approach of contemporary social psychiatry and is not perceived as relevant for psychiatric discourse. In this Perspective article, I argue that it is possible to uphold the idea of a supra-individual dimension to mental health, while avoiding the obvious pitfalls involved in categorical diagnosing of society as suffering from mental illness. I argue for an extended notion of public mental ill-health, which goes beyond the quantitative understanding of mental health as an aggregate of individual diseased minds captured in statistics, and which can be conceived as a dynamic, emergent property resulting from interactions of individual brains/minds in social space. Such a notion, in turn, presents a challenge of how to account for the interfacing between individual minds/brains and the collective mental phenomena. A suitable theoretical framework is provided by the notion of epidemiology of representations, originally formulated by cognitive anthropologist Dan Sperber. Within this framework, it is possible to highlight the role of public (material) representations in inter-individual transfer of mental representations and mental states. It is a suitable conceptual platform to explain how the troubling experiences with causal or mediating role on mental health, to a significant degree arise through a person's direct interaction with material representations and participation in collective mental states, again generated by material representations."}, {"Title": "Neuroepigenetics of Mental Illness: The Inside Outs of the Outside Within.", "Abstract": "Epigenetics refers to environmentally sensitive modifications to DNA and chromatin that regulate gene transcription without altering the genetic sequence itself. Because of the brain's central role in a person's adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment, the field of epigenetic research is particularly pertinent for the neurosciences and mental health and illness. \"Neuroepigenetics\" refers to the field of epigenetics, as applied to research of the nervous system and related functional abilities. The onset and course of mental disorders revolve around person-environment interactions, i.e., the interplay between environmental factors with people (and their brain) throughout life and on the background of an individual's inherited genomic make-up. With respect to the nervous system and its functional abilities, neuroepigenetic research aims to turn the inside outs by explicating the epigenetic profiles that regulate gene expression within cells while epigenetic profiles themselves may reflect the imprints of external factors (the outside of the organism). Neuroepigenetic research is of prime importance for elucidating the molecular underpinnings of gene-environment interplay in relation to functional abilities of the brain and mental health throughout life, and thus for identifying the mechanisms underlying onset and course of mental disorders. However, neuroepigenetic research is still in its infancy and many conceptual and methodological challenges are apparent. In addition, there are considerable complexities and major challenges in conceptualizing the nature and diagnosis of mental disorders, and these need to be taken into account in studying neuroepigenetics of mental disorders.

This seminal study was among the first to document that a substantial proportion of boys with ADHD continue to show the core symptoms of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity at a mean age of 18 years as well as worse educational, social, and psychiatric outcomes, including non-alcohol substance use disorder, than do comparison boys, thus setting the stage for continued poor functioning as adults.

There are no screening services for antenatal depression and no data available on prevalence rates of depression among women attending the Irish obstetric services. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence rates of depression during pregnancy in a population sample in Ireland using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as a screening tool. Pregnant women during all stages of pregnancy were recruited from five maternity hospitals throughout the Republic of Ireland. Approximately 5000 EPDS questionnaires were collected. Information on the participant's age, gestational week, gravidity, parity, and level of education attained was also collected. A score of >\u200912 was used as a measure of probable depression. Overall, 15.8% of pregnant women scored >\u200912 in the EPDS. There was a significant association between gestational week and rates of depression, with increasing rates occurring with advancing pregnancy (p\u00a0<\u20090.001). Overall, higher socioeconomic groups were over-represented in the sample although we replicated the well-established findings of higher EPDS scores in women with lower educational attainment (p\u00a0<\u20090.005). This study demonstrates that prevalence rates of probable antenatal depression are high among women attending the obstetric services in Ireland and highlight the importance of increasing awareness of antenatal depression. These high rates of antenatal depression may be related to certain conditions that are specific to an Irish setting: the absence of screening for depression in the context of grossly under-resourced perinatal psychiatry services.

Fourth-year medical students participated in a consultation/liaison psychiatry service to two government-operated primary care clinics. Each student attended two half-day consultations to the clinics during the psychiatry clinical clerkship. Students joined in discussions with primary care clinicians, performed supervised clinical assessments, and administered a depression screening instrument. The learning experience was evaluated through four focus groups, each with 9-10 participants, held throughout the academic year. An end-of-year, anonymous, online questionnaire survey was administered to the entire class. Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts was performed and quantitative statistics were calculated (Stata version 13).\nFocus group themes included the following: (a) active learning opportunities in primary care psychiatry consultation had perceived added educational value, (b) students benefited from contact with patients with previously undiagnosed common mental disorders, and (c) students' primary care experience raised their awareness of societal and professional responsibilities. Of the class of 113 students, 93 (82%) responded to the questionnaire. The survey responses reflected the qualitative themes, with 79 respondents (85%) stating that the learning experience met or exceeded their expectations.\nAcademic psychiatry has been criticized for its overreliance on secondary care settings in undergraduate clinical teaching.

Some of the goals of clinical practice and those of commercial developers of psychiatric therapies overlap, such as developing safe and effective treatments. However, there might also be incompatible goals; physicians aim to provide the best care they can to their patients, whereas the medical industry ultimately aims to develop therapies that are commercially successful. In some cases, however, clinical research may be aiming both at improved patient care and commercial success. It is in these cases that a conflict of interest (COI) arises. The goal of this study was to identify differences and commonalities regarding COIs between 2 kinds of somatic psychiatric interventions: pharmacological and neurosurgical. METHODS The authors conducted a study focused on professional concerns regarding pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions. They used medical and bioethics journal articles as an indicator of professionals' concerns and carried out a thematic content analysis of peer-reviewed articles published between 1960 and 2015, using PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven relevant articles were identified, of which 86 papers focused primarily on psychopharmacology and 51 on neurosurgery. The intervention most discussed in the psychiatric neurosurgery data set was deep brain stimulation (n = 42). While there were no significant differences at the level of categories, pharmacological and neurosurgical interventions differ in the underlying themes discussed. Two issues widely discussed in the articles on pharmaceutical interventions, but largely neglected in the neurosurgery articles, were medical professional issues and industry involvement. CONCLUSIONS COIs are a neglected issue in the discussion of ethics concerns regarding medical devices in psychiatry. Yet as these interventions become more common, it is important to address them in part through learning from the discussion regarding COIs in the pharmaceutical industry and by developing approaches to address those aspects of COIs that are unique to the medical device industry."}, {"Title": "2017 Annual Report of the ABPN.", "Abstract": "The following is an edited/abbreviated version of the 2017 Report of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc.

Learning paradigms are increasingly being extended to study mood and psychiatric disorders as well as addiction. However, one potentially critical characteristic that this research ignores is the effect of time on learning: human feedback learning paradigms are usually conducted in a single rapidly paced session, whereas learning experiences in ecologically relevant circumstances and in animal research are almost always separated by longer periods of time. In our experiments, we examined reward learning in short condensed sessions distributed across weeks versus learning completed in a single \"massed\" session in male and female participants. As expected, we found that after equal amounts of training, accuracy was matched between the spaced and massed conditions. However, in a 3-week follow-up, we found that participants exhibited significantly greater memory for the value of spaced-trained stimuli. Supporting a role for short-term memory in massed learning, we found a significant positive correlation between initial learning and working memory capacity. Neurally, we found that patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex showed stronger discrimination of spaced- versus massed-trained reward values. Further, patterns in the striatum discriminated between spaced- and massed-trained stimuli overall. Our results indicate that single-session learning tasks engage partially distinct learning mechanisms from distributed training. Our studies begin to address a large gap in our knowledge of human learning from reinforcement, with potential implications for our understanding of mood disorders and addiction.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and animals learn to associate predictive value with stimuli and actions, and these values then guide future behavior. Such reinforcement-based learning often happens over long time periods, in contrast to most studies of reward-based learning in humans. In experiments that tested the effect of spacing on learning, we found that associations learned in a single massed session were correlated with short-term memory and significantly decayed over time, whereas associations learned in short massed sessions over weeks were well maintained. Additionally, patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex discriminated the values of stimuli learned over weeks but not minutes. These results highlight the importance of studying learning over time, with potential applications to drug addiction and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Restricted, Repetitive, and Reciprocal Social Behavior in Toddlers Born Small for Gestation Duration.", "Abstract": "To characterize restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) and reciprocal social behaviors (RSBs) in a large sample of toddlers who represent a range of birth weights and gestation durations.\nA battery of questionnaires characterizing demographic information and measuring RRBs and RSBs were completed by parents of toddlers between the ages of 17-26 months (n\u2009=\u20091589 total; n\u2009=\u200998 preterm).

Physicians claim more knowledge and skills in how to actually do the assessments. The aim of this study was to explore physicians' tacit knowledge of performing assessments of capacity to work and the need for sickness absence in patients with depression and anxiety disorders.\nWe performed a qualitative study with open-ended interviews and a short video vignette of a physician and a patient with depression as stimuli. Participating physicians (n\u2009=\u200924) were specialized in general practice, occupational health or psychiatry and experienced in treating patients with depression and anxiety.

The physicians both identified and created the pieces of the puzzle, mainly by facilitating strategies to make the patient a better supplier of essential information. The finished puzzle made up a highly individualized comprehensive picture required for adequate assessment. Categories 2-4 identified the particular essential pieces of information the participants used, relating to the patient's disorder, capacity in the work place and contextual everyday life. For the sickness absence assessment, apart from decreased work capacity, the physicians also took particulars of the work place into account; e.g. could the work place handle an employee with reduced capacity.\nPhysicians' tacit knowledge of assessing work capacity and the need for sickness absence for patients with CMD was identified as doing a jigsaw puzzle.

The aim of the study was to examine and compare the therapeutic relationship in forensic and general psychiatric settings.\n52 forensic patients and 66 general psychiatric patients filled in the Psychopathy Personality Inventory - Revised (PPI-R), the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems - German Version (IIP-D), the Questionnaire on Motivation for Psychotherapy (Fragebogen zur Erfassung der Psychotherapiemotivation (FPTM)) as well as the Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised (WAI-SR). We applied descriptive analyses, calculated univariate <i>t</i>-tests as well as multivariate <i>T</i>-tests and performed general linear models.\nThe quality of the therapeutic alliance does not differ significantly between forensic and general psychiatric patients. Moreover, patients of forensic psychiatry consider therapeutic techniques applied by their therapists as more valuable for achieving their therapeutic aims than patients of the general psychiatry.\nThe therapeutic relationship in forensic psychiatry is as viable as in general psychiatry. This can be regarded as a result of the long-term therapy in the context of forensic psychiatry which allows more time to be spent on relationship building than in a general psychiatry setting where therapy is limited to a few weeks."}, {"Title": "Revisiting the canons of psychiatry: Teaching the fundamentals of CATIE, STAR*D, and STEP-BD to family medicine residents.", "Abstract": "Family medicine physicians are often the first providers to encounter and identify mental illness in their patients. Having a solid understanding of three landmark studies-Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D), and Systemic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD)-can significantly improve a family medicine physician's approach to mental illness and treatment choices, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Each of these studies has generated dozens of publications and consolidating the fundamentals of each one is essential for a resident to retain and implement findings in a real-world setting when treating patients with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. When presented at the 38th Forum for Behavioral Science in Family Medicine in Chicago, IL, in September 2017, learners answered pre- and post-presentation questions about the treatment and guidelines pertaining to the three studies. Discussion leaders-physicians double-boarded in family medicine and psychiatry-presented key findings, clinical guidelines generated from each study, and updates since their respective publications. At the conclusion of the talk, participants received access to a slide deck and one-page summary for use in teaching at their home residency programs.

Participants completed a web-based survey consisting of demographics; the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC) 12-item survey, which measures explicit stigma; and an Implicit Association Test (IAT), measuring implicit bias toward physical illness (diabetes mellitus) or mental illness (schizophrenia).\nA total of 538 people participated: undergraduate students ( n = 382), medical school students ( n = 118), and psychiatrists ( n = 38). Psychiatrists had significantly lower explicit and implicit stigma than undergraduate students and medical school students. Having been diagnosed with mental illness or having had a relationship with someone experiencing one was significantly associated with lower explicit stigma. Mean scores on the OMS-HC \"disclosure/help-seeking\" subscale were higher compared with the \"attitudes towards people with mental illness\" subscale. There was no correlation between the OMS-HC and IAT.\nThese findings support the theory that increased education and experience with mental illness are associated with reduced stigma. Attitudes regarding disclosure/help-seeking were more stigmatizing than attitudes towards people with mental illness. The groups identified in this study can potentially benefit from anti-stigma campaigns that focus on reducing specific components of explicit, implicit, public and self-stigma."}, {"Title": "Be like water: a personal strategy for clinical psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "This paper describes, from the personal perspective of a mid-career researcher, principles and advice regarding the development of an embedded clinical psychiatric research program within a medical school and public sector mental health service.

Weekly ward rounds are an important forum for reviewing a patient's progress and developing a personalised care plan for the coming week. In general medicine, structured ward rounds and check lists have been shown to prevent omissions and improve patient safety; however, they are not widely used in psychiatry. At the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, the format of ward rounds differed between psychiatry wards and clinical teams, and care plans were not standardised. An audit in October 2015 found only 5% of acute psychiatric inpatients had a documented nursing care plan. It was agreed that a clear multidisciplinary care plan from the weekly ward round would be beneficial.

I build from Janis H. Jenkins's research on the \"extraordinary condition\" of schizophrenia to discuss \"extraordinary care,\" which parents practiced as a way to refute cultural and clinical beliefs about pathogenic families and degenerative diseases. Parents' accounts of extraordinary care revealed a reliance on biomedical knowledge to treat the symptoms of mental illness coupled with an ongoing determination to improve children's lives beyond what psychiatry could offer. Extraordinary care thus points to the therapeutic limits of biomedical psychiatry while also reinforcing the significance of social relations as families work toward recovery."}, {"Title": "Balancing the risk of the evacuation and sheltering-in-place options: a survival study following Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident.", "Abstract": "The decision to evacuate or shelter-in-place is fundamental to emergency response, especially for a vulnerable population. While an elevated risk of mortality due to a hasty, unplanned evacuation has been well documented, there is little research on and knowledge about the health consequences of sheltering-in-place in disaster contexts. We compared hospital mortality in patients who sheltered-in-place (non-evacuees) after the incident with the baseline preincident mortality and articulated postincident circumstances of the hospital while sheltering-in-place.\nWe considered all 484 patients admitted to Takano Hospital (located 22\u2009km South of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant) from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2016.\nSignificant differences in mortality rates between preincident baseline and three postincident groups (evacuees, non-evacuees (our major interest) and new admittees) were tested using the Bayesian survival analysis with Weibull multivariate regression and survival probability using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. All the analyses were separately performed by the internal and psychiatry department.\nAfter adjusting for covariates, non-evacuees in the internal department had a significantly higher mortality risk with an HR of 1.57 (95% credible intervals 1.11 to 2.18) than the baseline preincident. Of them, most deaths occurred within the first 100 days of the incident. No significant increase in mortality risk was identified in evacuees and new admittees postincident in the department, which were adjusted for covariates. In contrast, for the psychiatry department, statistical difference in mortality risk was not identified in any groups.\nThe mortality risk of sheltering-in-place in a harsh environment might be comparable to those in an unplanned evacuation. If sheltering-in-place with sufficient resources is not guaranteed, evacuation could be a reasonable option, which might save more lives of vulnerable people if performed in a well-planned manner with satisfactory arrangements for appropriate transportation and places to safely evacuate."}, {"Title": "New approaches in psychiatric drug development.", "Abstract": "Numerous novel neuroscience-based drug targets have been identified in recent years. However, it remains unclear how these targets relate to the expression of symptoms in central nervous system (CNS) disorders in general and psychiatric disorders in particular. To discuss this issue, a New Frontiers Meetings of European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) was organized to address the challenges in translational neuroscience research that are impeding the effective development of new treatments. The main aim of this meeting was to discuss scientific insights, concepts and methodologies in order to improve drug development for psychiatric disorders. The meeting was designed to bring together stakeholders from academia, pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies. Here we provide a synopsis of the proceedings from the meeting entitled 'New approaches to psychiatric drug development'. New views on psychiatric drug development were presented to address the challenges and pitfalls as identified by the different stakeholders. The general conclusion of the meeting was that drug discovery could be stimulated by designing new classification and sensitive assessment tools for psychiatric disorders, which bear closer relationships to neuropharmacological and neuroscientific developments. This is in line with the vision of precision psychiatry in which patients are clustered, not merely on symptoms, but primarily on biological phenotypes that represent pathophysiological relevant and 'drugable' processes. To achieve these goals, a closer collaboration between all stakeholders in early stages of development is essential to define the research criteria together and to reach consensus on new quantitative biological methodologies and etiology-directed treatments."}, {"Title": "C-Reactive Protein and T3: New Prognostic Factors in Acute Ischemic Stroke.", "Abstract": "Several studies have shown that high level of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events, and a decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) was reported to be associated with stroke severity and poor prognosis.\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate CRP and T3 as independent predictors of poor functional and cognitive outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke at hospital discharge.\nThis study evaluated 120 patients who were admitted to the Clinical Hospital of Neurology and Psychiatry Brasov, between July 2016 and January 2017. The patients were evaluated for clinical stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and serum CRP and total T3 were evaluated on admission. Functional outcome and cognitive outcome were evaluated at discharge.\nThe severity of NIHHS scores were associated with higher CRP levels (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f.583, P = .000) and lower T3 concentration (\u03b2 = -.185, P\u202f=\u202f.043). Poor cognitive prognosis was associated with CRP levels (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f.441, P\u202f=\u202f.000) but not with T3 concentrations (P\u202f=\u202f.142).

Using CRP and T3 as prognostic factors resulted in a probability of 53.5% to predict a poor functional outcome and of 80.42% to predict a poor cognitive outcome in stroke patients at discharge.\nThe study showed that higher CRP and lower T3 levels were associated with stroke severity on admission. Functional outcome is likely secondary to stroke severity but functional outcome at discharge was associated with higher CRP levels and not with T3 concentration. Cognitive outcome was associated with higher CRP levels and not with T3 concentration."}, {"Title": "Successful management of persistent distressing neuropsychiatric symptoms by clozapine in a patient suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies.", "Abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia associated with poor prognosis and high carers' burden. Neuropsychiatric symptoms worsen this prognosis and are a high source of distress for service users and their carers. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of these symptoms. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the first-line pharmacological option, but challenging risky behaviours may persist despite their use. Antipsychotic medications are indicated in such clinical scenarios, but there is very limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of these medications for managing neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB. Hence, we report an individual with DLB with severe distressing persistent visual hallucinations and agitation. After multiple treatment options had failed, clozapine was successfully initiated with substantial improvement in both clinical and functional outcomes.

Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial, and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.\nInternational evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.\nGovernance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis and translation experts. In total, 37 societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.\nThe evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (ii) reducing unnecessary testing; (iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.\nOverall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.\nThe international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences.

'Lifestyle medicine' has recently gained traction in the field of psychiatry, aimed at improvement of both physical and mental health. Online interventions can be an effective and inexpensive alternative or supplement to therapy that is delivered using more traditional modes, overcoming barriers that may prohibit people from accessing treatment by promoting flexibility and accessibility.\nThis systematic review evaluates the existing evidence for the efficacy or effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for (1) individuals with depressive symptoms, (2) clinically depressed populations or discussing the outcomes of depression within a subset of a larger cohort that are delivered online or via smart phone. Included studies were randomised controlled trials, with active comparator conditions, in adult populations and with reported lifestyle and depression-related outcomes. The analysis examined attrition, engagement, adherence and behaviour change techniques employed to achieve the target behaviours.\nSeven studies were included in the review and targeted behaviour change in five domains: alcohol reduction, improved sleep quality/insomnia reduction, increased physical activity, reduced/cessation of substance abuse and smoking cessation. Four of the studies achieved significant improvements in the targeted behaviour; of these three also reported significant improvements in depressive symptoms.

Coinciding with the 19th-century beginnings of scientific psychiatry, advances that proved transformative and valuable for much of the rest of medicine arguably engendered, and served to entrench, mistaken, and misleading conceptions of psychiatric disorder. Powerful analogical reasoning based on what is assumed, projected, and expected (and thus occupying the realm of the medical imaginary), fostered inappropriate models for psychiatry. Dissatisfaction with DSM systems have given rise to alternative models, exemplified here in (i) network models of disorder calling for revision of ideas about causal explanation, and (ii) the critiques of categorical analyses associated with recently revised domain criteria for research.

Multiple electronic databases were searched to identify literature on the topic of immediate staff debriefing. The analysis identified several core components of immediate staff debriefing: terminology, type, critical reflection, iterative process, training, documentation, and monitoring. While these components were regarded as vital to the implementation of debriefing, they remain inconsistently described in the literature. Immediate staff debriefing is an important intervention not only to prevent future episodes of seclusion and restraint use, but as a forum for staff to support each other emotionally and psychologically after a potentially distressing event. The core components identified in this review should be incorporated into the organization's policies, practice guidelines, and training modules to ensure consistent conceptualization and implementation of the debriefing process."}, {"Title": "[Forensic preventive assertive community treatment : Pilot project to prevent violent crimes in the context of psychiatric disorders].", "Abstract": "Since 2012, a\u00a0forensic preventive outpatient clinic has been established at Ansbach District Hospital to fill a\u00a0gap in general psychiatric care for patients with schizophrenia or severe personality disorders and having a\u00a0high risk for violent behavior. An interdisciplinary team drawing on forensic psychiatric knowledge applies instruments for forensic risk prognosis and treatment or interventions to prevent violent crimes and to protect potential victims.

The DM is a structured communication technique that uses systematic, interactive data gathering to reach a consensus among a panel of experts.\nWe extracted preliminary educational objectives from nationwide pain fellowship training programs. After redundant objectives and those relating to procedures outside the scope of emergency medicine (EM) were removed, 23 preliminary objectives remained. We enlisted experts in EM, medical toxicology, anesthesia, pain, psychiatry, and medical education to evaluate the objectives in repeated rounds. Based on the time we had designated for teaching (3 hours) and our estimate of 15 to 20 minutes for each learning objective, we aimed for nine to 12 final learning objectives. The expert panel rated the 23 preliminary objectives with a 5-point Likert scale. Experts were blinded to each other's answers. When 80% of experts agreed with proposed objectives, objectives were considered \"accepted\" and retained. When 80% of experts disagreed with proposed objectives, the objectives were considered \"rejected\" and discarded. The remaining objectives were considered in subsequent rounds. In the first round, one objective was rejected and four were accepted. In the second round, four objectives were rejected and five were accepted. Having reached nine objectives the panel unanimously agreed that the nine objectives were sufficient to be used as a foundation for teaching modules.\nUsing the DM, our expert panel identified nine educational objectives that were used as the foundation for an educational module. Of the nine objectives, three were categorized as \"medical knowledge,\" two as \"pharmacologic knowledge,\" two as \"patient communication,\" and two as \"systems-based practice.\" The learning objectives are as follows: recognize common barriers to treating pain; understand alternative interventional therapies used to treat different kinds of pain their implications, benefits, and risks; identify common component symptoms that may exacerbate chronic pain (i.e., depression, anxiety, delirium, cachexia, dyspnea); study the major drug groups used to treat different kinds of pain; recognize the risks of polypharmacy; set realistic expectations with patients early in their presentation to the emergency department (ED); educate patients as the risks of different classes of pain medications, including risk of addiction; understand the legal and regulatory issues that govern pain management in the ED; and understand in-hospital resources available for patient follow up and referral to pain clinics.\nWe successfully used the DM to develop educational objectives for an e-learning module.

The objective of this article is to profile the use of antipsychotic medications in a pediatric population in Poland based on data from the Pomeranian region (Northern Poland).\nThe study was based on National Health Fund data about prescription drug reimbursement between 2008 and 2012. A patient database was created using ID to analyze specific patterns and information about individuals using antipsychotics. Percentage population indicators were calculated using official demographic reports.\nAn increased number of overall prescriptions was observed since 2008, with a subsequent decline to its lowest number in 2012. The population with at least one antipsychotic-filled prescription per year has grown in the same time. The annual rate has increased from 0.26% to 0.31% of the general population between 0 and 17 years of age in the Pomeranian region. We observed an increasing number of females and the 0- to 4-year-old receiving antipsychotic prescriptions. The population share of prescribed first-generation antipsychotics exceeded the share of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The use of SGAs increased from 38% to 44% of all prescriptions, during the observation period. The most frequently prescribed drugs were Risperidone (26.7%) and Chlorprothixene (21.7%).\nThe study revealed that the prescribing patterns of antipsychotics increased in the Polish pediatric population and concerned more patients from the youngest group. The high prevalence of such early exposure to antipsychotics should focus more attention on drug safety in this population."}, {"Title": "Case formulation using pattern-based formulation (PBF) methodology: clinical case 4.", "Abstract": "To provide a further example of the utility of the pattern-based model in formulation, and to introduce some further patterns.\nA case study was carried out using the Pattern-based Formulation (PBF).\nBased on the case of a patient with a past history of trauma who developed late onset somatic symptoms, post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, the PBF approach enabled development of a comprehensive formulation to explain the patient's current presentation.

She returned two days later with worsening symptoms and subsequently developed tonic-clonic seizures. MRI of the brain and temporomandibular joints were noncontributory. Psychiatry was consulted, and the patient was prescribed olanzapine and mirtazapine for suspected depression with somatization symptoms. She continued to deteriorate despite therapy and developed right lid ptosis and ophthalmoparesis, which led to a presumptive diagnosis of cephalic tetanus.

Clinical histories were obtained and anxiety and depressive symptom questionnaires were completed prior to testing. Among 539 patients referred, 100 (18.6%) were diagnosed with PNSC. Outcome data were collected by telephone or during routine follow-up a median of 572 days postdiagnosis.\nEighty-four patients (84%) provided outcome data. Following communication of the diagnosis, 32 patients (38%) had immediate PNSC resolution. Attack resolution occurred in 44% by 1 month, 51% by 6 months, 52% by 12 months, 69% after 12 months, and 31% continued to have PNSC at the time of follow-up. Patients with continued PNSC had higher anxiety scores than patients with immediate resolution (<i>p</i> = 0.047). Following diagnosis, emergency department visits for fainting decreased from 78.6% to 20.2% (<i>p</i> = 0.017), and management by psychology or psychiatry increased from 26.2% to 76.2% (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

He was previously followed by a psychiatrist for 2 years for additional diagnoses of insomnia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability. He has tried and (apparently) failed multiple psychotropic trials including stimulants, nonstimulants, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. He has a delayed sleep onset and frequent night awakenings each night for the past 3 months, during which he \"screams, cries, and thrashes and can stay up for over an hour.\" His behaviors are described as irritable, self-injurious, and aggressive with no clear pattern of triggers according to his mother. He is nonverbal and communicates by leading and rarely pointing. The patient's current medication regimen includes clonidine 0.2 mg at night, lorazepam 1.5 mg as needed at night, olanzapine 5 mg twice daily, and diphenhydramine as needed for sleep/agitation. His mother is concerned that he is developing \"tolerance\" to the regimen and wants to wean him off some of the medications. His mother is struggling to take care of the patient given his worsening behavior and body habitus (body mass index >99%; z = 3.41).There is a family history of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and autism. He has a 3-year-old sister, who is also diagnosed with ASD, though she is not as severely impacted. His mother's partner recently moved in along with 2 children of his own, aged 3 and 4 years. Sam attends a specialized school, where he receives behavior therapy and occupational therapy. He has undergone inpatient pediatric hospitalization twice, 1 time for 3 weeks and the other for 6 days, for aggressive behavior, and in both instances, he was discharged before inpatient psychiatric placement because of a lack of available beds.After urgent consultation with your local developmental and behavioral pediatrician, a slight reduction was made in the lorazepam because of concerns about tolerance and side effects. However, within a week of this, he was brought to the emergency department for continued self-injurious behavior and increased trouble with sleeping. His mother voiced concerns about his safety in the home, which were particularly related to aggression toward his younger sister. He was admitted to the pediatric inpatient floor for observation, and medication adjustment (increasing olanzapine), which was initially helpful in improving behavior, but mostly behavioral/environmental strategies were used to soothe him, including frequent wagon rides through the hospital corridors.Despite the patient being stable from the medical standpoint, Sam's mother did not feel comfortable taking him home. Social work contacted local community mental health services to pursue outpatient resources and respite care options and sought inpatient pediatric psychiatry. After several failed attempts to find placement, he remained in pediatric inpatient care for 1 and a half months with no acute medical interventions other than his oral medications.He was finally accepted to the in-state pediatric psychiatric facility when a bed was available. During his week-long stay, he had further medication adjustments with a decrease in olanzapine and optimization of his clonidine dose. During his psychiatric hospital stay, care coordination succeeded in arranging center-based applied behavior analysis interventions and respite care and parent training for his family. Sam began to show improvement in his overall agitation and aggression, requiring less clonazepam, and his mother then maintained outpatient follow-up.The day before discharge, you visit him in the hospital, and a medical student asks you why he was in the hospital for so long.

Secondarily, we wished to assess variables associated with OH.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study on 82 consecutive geriatric outpatients presenting with LLD. OH was defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of greater than 20\u00a0mm Hg and/or 10\u00a0mm Hg on diastolic blood pressure on an orthostatic stress test from sitting to standing. Logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with OH.\nThe prevalence of OH as measured on the orthostatic stress test and on the OHQ was 28% and 57%, respectively.

It is thought that this gap results in the difficulty to understand psychiatric patients in clinical practice for many years. It has also created an obstacle to scientific researches addressing the validity and reliability of the psychoanalytical principles. On the other hand, psychoanalysis has been much criticised for years due to the lack of empirical foundations. As a result of this paucity, psychiatry is led by the biomedical approach. Without enough grounds in evidence-based medicine, psychoanalytical principles could not become widespread in psychiatric practice. To survive criticism and strengthen its place in contemporary psychiatry, empirical research in psychoanalytical discipline has gained momentum in the last two decades. Development of objective psychodynamic diagnostic tools enabled the design of such studies. The aim of this review is to introduce such diagnostic tools, namely Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) and Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis (OPD), and to discuss the possible contributions they provide for psychoanalytical perspective to take its deserved place in the psychiatry discipline."}, {"Title": "Differential Valuation and Learning From Social and Nonsocial Cues in Borderline Personality Disorder.", "Abstract": "Volatile interpersonal relationships are a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and lead to devastating disruption of patients' personal and professional lives. Quantitative models of social decision making and learning hold promise for defining the underlying mechanisms of this problem. In this study, we tested BPD and control subject weighting of social versus nonsocial information and their learning about choices under stable and volatile conditions. We compared behavior using quantitative models.\nSubjects (n\u00a0= 20 BPD, n\u00a0= 23 control subjects) played an extended reward learning task with a partner (confederate) that requires learning about nonsocial and social cue reward probability (the social valuation task). Task experience was measured using language metrics: explicit emotions/beliefs, talk about the confederate, and implicit distress (using the previously established marker self-referentiality). Subjects' weighting of social and nonsocial cues was tested in mixed-effect regression models. Subjects' learning rates under stable and volatile conditions were modeled (Rescorla-Wagner approach) and group\u00a0\u00d7 condition interactions tested.\nCompared to control subjects, BPD subject debriefings included more mentions of the confederate and less distress language. BPD subjects also weighted social cues more heavily but had blunted learning responses to (nonsocial and social) volatility.\nThis is the first report of patient behavior in the social valuation task. The results suggest that BPD subjects expect higher volatility than control subjects. These findings lay the groundwork for a neurocomputational dissection of social and nonsocial belief updating in BPD, which holds promise for the development of novel clinical interventions that more directly target pathophysiology."}, {"Title": "Decision making and support available to individuals considering and undertaking electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a qualitative, consumer-led study.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most controversial treatments in psychiatry.

In the pilot clinic, 32 youths were referred to the CPM intervention. Among the remaining seven clinics, 196 youths were referred to usual care (control group). Differences in treatment access and engagement between the intervention and control groups were assessed using propensity-score weighted logistic regression models.\nHolding all else constant, children receiving the CPM intervention had four times higher odds of accessing psychiatric evaluations than children in the usual care control group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.16, p<.01). The odds of engagement (i.e., participation in follow-up appointments) were seven times greater for youths in the CPM than youths in the control group (AOR=7.54, p<.01).\nAccess and engagement were significantly higher for children receiving CPM than for usual care participants.

As a measure of inter-rater reliability, we calculated the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC, \u22650.75\u2009=\u2009excellent, 0.40-0.74\u2009=\u2009fair to good, <0.40\u2009=\u2009poor) for the PANSS-6 total score and individual item scores. Furthermore, for the PANSS-6 total scores obtained by the six noncertified PANSS raters, we calculated the median deviation from the PANSS-6 total scores obtained by the only certified PANSS rater.\nThe ICC for the PANSS-6 total score was 0.74 (F\u2009=\u20092.84, p\u2009=\u2009.03). The ICCs for the six individual PANSS-6 items ranged from 0.45 (N6 - Lack of spontaneity & flow of conversation) to 0.76 (P3 - Hallucinatory behavior). The PANSS-6 total scores obtained by the six noncertified PANSS raters deviated by a median of 12.7% (interquartile range: 6.2-20.0) from the PANSS-6 total scores obtained by the certified PANSS rater.\nWe found a good level of inter-rater reliability of PANSS-6 ratings obtained using the SNAPSI for seven raters with varying levels of clinical and research experience."}, {"Title": "The Clinical Significance of Subthreshold Borderline Personality Disorder Features in Outpatient Youth.", "Abstract": "Studies among adult patients have found that subthreshold borderline personality disorder (BPD) features are associated with elevated psychosocial morbidity compared with patients with no BPD features. However, the clinical significance of subthreshold features of BPD has not been investigated among real-world patients during the clinical emergence of the disorder, which is usually between puberty and emerging adulthood. This study aimed to replicate and extend previous research by comparing outpatient youth aged 15-25 years with subthreshold BPD features with youth with no BPD features. The sample included 499 potential participants, of whom 111 had no DSM-IV BPD features at all, and 155 had between one and four features. Results indicated that the group with subthreshold BPD features had more severe mental illness and poorer social and occupational functioning. These findings suggest that subthreshold BPD features are clinically important and should be a focus of clinical intervention to reduce continuing disability and improve outcome."}, {"Title": "Resilience predicts remission in antidepressant treatment of geriatric depression.", "Abstract": "With the world population rapidly aging, it is increasingly important to identify sociodemographic, cognitive, and clinical features that predict poor outcome in geriatric depression. Self-report measures of resilience-ie, the ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity-may identify those depressed older adults with more favorable prognoses.\nWe investigated the utility of baseline variables including 4 factors of resilience (grit, active coping self-efficacy, accommodative coping self-efficacy, and spirituality) for predicting treatment response and remission in a 16-week randomized controlled trial of methylphenidate, citalopram, or their combination in 143 adults over the age of 60 with MDD.\nFinal logistic regression models revealed that greater total baseline resilience (Wald \u03c7<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a03.8, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) significantly predicted both treatment response and remission. Specifically, a 20% increase in total resilience predicted nearly 2 times greater likelihood of remission (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.98, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0[1.01, 3.91]). Examining the individual factors of resilience, only accommodative coping self-efficacy (Wald \u03c7<sup>2</sup> \u00a0=\u00a03.7, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05; OR\u00a0=\u00a01.41 [1.00-2.01]) was significantly associated with remission. We found no relation between baseline sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race, education level) or measures of cognitive performance and posttreatment depressive symptoms.\nSelf-reported resilience may predict greater responsivity to antidepressant medication in older adults with MDD. Future research should investigate the potential for resilience training-and in particular, interventions designed to increase accommodative coping-to promote sustained remission of geriatric depression."}, {"Title": "Paraphilic Disorder in a Male Patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Incidence or Coincidence.", "Abstract": "Paraphilic disorder in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be extremely disturbing to both the patient\u00a0and caretakers.

This is even more so the case for an adolescent population. This study looked at 30 consecutive female patient admissions to Bluebird House, a medium secure adolescent unit in the South of England, to identify whether both the 'honeymoon effect' (low incident rate in the first 28 days following admission) and 'gate fever' (high incident rate in the last 28 days prior to discharge) were identifiable phenomena. Analysis of the incident rate found that in our secure adolescent population, the number of incidents both in the first week and at the first 28 days was higher in comparison to the whole admission. We also did not find a consistent increase in incidents in the final 28 days of the admission."}, {"Title": "Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.", "Abstract": "What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?\nInternational evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.\nPrevious guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.\nInternational evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.\nGovernance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups, and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15\u00a0months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.\nThe evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: i) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; ii) reducing unnecessary testing; iii) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and iv) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.\nOverall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.\nThe international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.\nThe guideline was primarily funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) supported by a partnership with ESHRE and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Animal studies propose inflammation and glucocorticoids as mediators of the developmental programming effect of prenatal stress on offspring stress responses, but studies in humans are not yet at this stage. Indeed, to date no single study has examined the effects of a rigorously defined, clinically significant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in pregnancy on maternal antenatal inflammatory biomarkers and hypothalamic-pituitary (HPA) axis, as well as on offspring HPA axis, behavior and developmental outcomes in the first postnatal year.\nA prospective longitudinal design was used in 106 women (49 cases vs. 57 healthy controls) to study the effect of MDD in pregnancy and associated antenatal biology (inflammatory and cortisol biomarkers), on offspring stress response (cortisol response to immunization, at 8 weeks and 12 months), early neurobehavior (Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, NBAS, at day 6), and cognitive, language and motor development (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 12 months).\nCompared with healthy controls, women with MDD in pregnancy had raised interleukin (IL) IL-6 (effect size (\u03b4)\u202f=\u202f0.53, p\u202f=\u202f0.031), IL-10 (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.53, p\u202f=\u202f0.043), tumor necrosis factor alpha (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.90, p\u202f=\u202f0.003) and vascular endothelial growth factor (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.56, p\u202f=\u202f0.008), together with raised diurnal cortisol secretion (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.89, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), raised evening cortisol (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.64, p\u202f=\u202f0.004), and blunted cortisol awakening response (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.70, p\u202f=\u202f0.020), and an 8-day shorter length of gestation (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.70, p\u202f=\u202f0.005). Furthermore, they had neonates with suboptimal neurobehavioral function in four out of five NBAS clusters measured (range of \u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.45-1.22 and p\u202f=\u202f0.049-<0.001) and increased cortisol response to stress at one year of age (\u03b4\u202f=\u202f0.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lastly, maternal inflammatory biomarkers and cortisol levels were correlated with infant stress response, suggesting a mechanistic link.\nThis study confirms and extends the notion that depression in pregnancy is associated with altered offspring behavior and biological stress response, and demonstrates that changes in maternal antenatal stress-related biology are associated with these infant outcomes."}, {"Title": "Behavioral Health Needs of Older Adults in the Emergency Department.", "Abstract": "Behavioral health disorders are common among older adults and, owing to limited access to resources for mental health care in the community, emergency department providers are often on the front lines of mental health crises.

Patients with dementia were older and more often female, while no association was found with the level of intellectual disability. Thyroid function and calcium values were often abnormal in those with and without dementia.\nIn persons with Down syndrome, dementia is a prevalent cause for admission to psychiatry, especially in females and those of advanced age.

However, as knowledge of signaling pathways is increasing, the therapeutic potential of memantine is being applied for the treatment of various psychiatric illnesses.\nThe PubMed online database was searched for the use of memantine in various psychiatric disorders. Case studies, open-label trials, and controlled trials from the search were included.\nMemantine monotherapy was found to exert efficacy in several neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, binge eating disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. For posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, memantine was found efficacious in augmentation with other medications. In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), memantine was used as both an augmentation to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and standalone therapy, and most published studies found it to improve OCD symptoms. For schizophrenia, memantine has been reported to be consistently effective for negative symptoms only. The manic phase of bipolar disorder also appears to benefit from memantine. The depressive phase of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder did not respond significantly to memantine. Catatonia as a symptom of various disorders improved in several case studies when memantine was used in combination with other medications.\nMemantine may have several therapeutic applications in psychiatry, reflecting the involvement of glutamate pathways in multiple psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Interictal Epileptiform Discharge Detection in EEG in Different Practice Settings.", "Abstract": "The goal of the study was to measure the performance of academic and private practice (PP) neurologists in detecting interictal epileptiform discharges in routine scalp EEG recordings.\nThirty-five EEG scorers (EEGers) participated (19 academic and 16 PP) and marked the location of ETs in 200 30-second EEG segments using a web-based EEG annotation system. All participants provided board certification status, years of Epilepsy Fellowship Training (EFT), and years in practice. The Persyst P13 automated IED detection algorithm was also run on the EEG segments for comparison.\nAcademic EEGers had an average of 1.66 years of EFT versus 0.50 years of EFT for PP EEGers (P < 0.0001) and had higher rates of board certification. Inter-rater agreement for the 35 EEGers was fair. There was higher performance for EEGers in academics, with at least 1.5 years of EFT, and with American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology and American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology-E specialty board certification. The Persyst P13 algorithm at its default setting (perception value = 0.4) did not perform as well at the EEGers, but at substantially higher perception value settings, the algorithm performed almost as well human experts.\nInter-rater agreement among EEGers in both academic and PP settings varies considerably. Practice location, years of EFT, and board certification are associated with significantly higher performance for IED detection in routine scalp EEG. Continued medical education of PP neurologists and neurologists without EFT is needed to improve routine scalp EEG interpretation skills. The performance of automated detection algorithms is approaching that of human experts."}, {"Title": "A Retrospective Review of Physician Assistant Education Association End of Rotation Examinations.", "Abstract": "The PAEA End of Rotation\u2122 exams were developed to assess medical knowledge of the 7 core supervised clinical practice experiences, including Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Pediatrics, Women's Health, and Psychiatry and Behavioral Health.

Gottesman's many contributions to behavior genetics, and part of his enduring legacy, was his introduction of the term 'endophenotype' to the field of psychiatry. Gottesman argued that focusing on endophenotypes, rather than complex heterogeneous clinical diagnoses, could help elucidate disease etiology. Although a different strategy for gene identification ultimately proved successful (that of amassing extremely large sample sizes in order to overcome the 'noise' of heterogeneity and have sufficient power to find genes of very small effect), the endophenotype concept continues to make a meaningful contribution to the field. The endophenotype concept forced the field to move beyond a simple disease model of finding genes 'for' psychiatric outcomes, and reminded us that genes are quite distal from complex behavioral outcomes and disorders. Endophenotypes called our attention to the steps along that pathway. In that process, the concept of endophenotypes evolved and expanded to include discussion of the role that other intermediary traits and psychological processes play in the development and genetic etiology of psychiatric and substance use disorders. As large-scale consortia continues to identify genes and generate genome-wide polygenic scores that are associated with behavioral outcomes, the next important step will be to characterize the pathways and mechanisms by which genetic risk unfolds. This essential step of mapping risk from genes to behavior is an evolution that follows naturally from the endophenotype concept, and could ultimately translate into improved prevention and intervention for individuals who are pre-disposed to mental health challenges."}, {"Title": "Detention under section 136: Why is it increasing?", "Abstract": "There has been a significant increase in the use of section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 in England and Wales, particularly over the past 10 years, but the reasons for this increase remain unclear. This paper presents a history of English mental-health legislation and the current evidence relating to the use of section 136. It suggests that changing police attitudes, socio-economic factors and diminished resources amongst both the police and mental-health services may have contributed towards its increase. The strain placed on health services may have also resulted in a greater reliance on the police force as an access point to NHS care and could result in the inappropriate use of section 136. With the principle of the 'least restrictive option' at the heart of the Mental Health Act, this advocates the need for reform."}, {"Title": "A systematic review of the effects of CYP2D6 phenotypes on risperidone treatment in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "The second generation antipsychotic drug risperidone is widely used in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry to treat conditions associated with disruptive behavior, aggression and irritability, such as autism spectrum disorders. While risperidone can provide symptomatic relief for many patients, there is considerable individual variability in the therapeutic response and side-effect profile of the medication. One well established biological factor that contributes to these individual differences is genetic variation in the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6. The 2D6 enzyme metabolizes risperidone and therefore affects drug levels and dosing. In the present review, we summarize the current literature on 2D6 variants and their effects on risperidone responses, specifically in children and adolescents. Relevant articles were identified through systematic review, and after irrelevant articles were discarded, ten studies were included in the review. Most prospective studies were well controlled, but often did not have a large enough sample size to make robust statements about rarer variants, including those categorized as ultra-rapid and poor metabolizers. Individual studies demonstrated a role for different genetic variants in risperidone drug efficacy, pharmacokinetics, hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms and drug-drug interactions. Where studies overlapped in measurements, there was typically a consensus between results. These findings indicate that the value of 2D6 genotyping in the youth population treated with risperidone requires further study, in particular with the less common variants."}, {"Title": "The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Practice Resource for Prescribing in Corrections.", "Abstract": "The practice of prescribing in jails and prisons is often different from that in the community.

The absence of child and adolescent mental health legislation in most countries exacerbates the issues young people face in independently accessing mental healthcare. Countries with existing legislation rarely define a minimum age for mental health consent (MAMHC). In stark contrast, nearly all 196 nations studied maintain legislation defining a minimum age of criminal responsibility (MACR).\nThis review highlights inconsistent developmental and legal perspectives in defined markers of competency across medical and judicial systems.\nA review of the MAMHC was performed and compared with MACR for the 52 countries for which policy data could be identified through publicly available sources.\nOnly 18% of countries maintain identifiable mental health policies specific to children's mental health needs. Of those reviewed, only 11 nations maintained a defined MAMHC, with 7 of 11 having a MAMHC 2\u2009years higher than the country's legislated MACR.\nWith increasing scientific understanding of the influences on child and adolescent decision making, some investment in the evidence-base and reconciliation of the very different approaches to child and adolescent consent is needed.\nA more coherent approach to child and adolescent consent across disciplines could help improve the accessibility of services for young people and facilitate mental health professionals and services as well as criminal justice systems deliver optimal care."}, {"Title": "GraphVar 2.0: A user-friendly toolbox for machine learning on functional connectivity measures.", "Abstract": "We previously presented GraphVar as a user-friendly MATLAB toolbox for comprehensive graph analyses of functional brain connectivity.

Evidence has suggested that depression could be associated with excess all-cause mortality across different settings and populations, although the causality of these associations remains unclear.\nWe conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase electronic databases were searched through January 20, 2018. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated associations of depression and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were selected for the review. The evidence was graded as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, or weak based on quantitative criteria that included an assessment of heterogeneity, 95% prediction intervals, small-study effects, and excess significance bias.\nA total of 26 references providing 2 systematic reviews and data for 17 meta-analytic estimates met inclusion criteria (19 of them on all-cause mortality); data from 246 unique studies (N\u2009=\u20093,825,380) were synthesized. All 17 associations had P\u2009<\u20090.05 per random effects summary effects, but none of them met criteria for convincing evidence. Associations of depression and all-cause mortality in patients after acute myocardial infarction, in individuals with heart failure, in cancer patients as well as in samples from mixed settings met criteria for highly suggestive evidence. However, none of the associations remained supported by highly suggestive evidence in sensitivity analyses that considered studies employing structured diagnostic interviews. In addition, associations of depression and all-cause mortality in cancer and post-acute myocardial infarction samples were supported only by suggestive evidence when studies that tried to adjust for potential confounders were considered.\nEven though associations between depression and mortality have nominally significant results in all assessed settings and populations, the evidence becomes weaker when focusing on studies that used structured interviews and those that tried to adjust for potential confounders.

Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15\u00a0months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.\nThe evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.\nOverall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.\nThe international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program."}, {"Title": "Disruptive Behaviors across Different Disorders: Evaluation of a Clinical Sample Using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory.", "Abstract": "The study reports the prevalence of disruptive behaviors in a help-seeking sample of young children across a diverse range of clinical diagnoses (based on ICD-10).\nThe Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), a parent rating scale of disruptive behaviors, was completed on 310 children (2-11 years) at three child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in three German states (Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony); the majority of children were outpatients.\nMean intensity scores of disruptive behaviors differed significantly by diagnostic group, with the lowest ratings within a community sample, and increasingly higher scores in children with a diagnosis from the internalizing spectrum, those with pervasive developmental disorders, and finally, those with externalizing disorders (e. g. hyperkinetic disorder, conduct disorders). Seventy percent of the clinical sample, compared to only 17 % of the community sample, exceeded the normative cut-off score of 111, indicating that disruptive behaviors are common in young German children seeking help for different mental health problems.\nThese findings support the Research Domain Criteria approach by showing that disruptive behaviors cross our current diagnostic labels and may need to be assessed and conceptualized in treatment planning, even in children without a primary diagnosis from the externalizing spectrum."}, {"Title": "The Family Check-Up Online Program for Parents of Middle School Students: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.", "Abstract": "Research has established that skillful family management during adolescence protects youth from a variety of mental health and behavioral problems.

Discovery of novel pharmacotherapies that engage therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease with psychosis would benefit from identifying the neurobiology of resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether alterations in the synaptic proteome were associated with resilience to psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and, if present, were independent of neuropathologic burden.\nQuantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure multiple neuropathologies in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from subjects with early and middle-stage Alzheimer's disease who differed in psychosis status. Synaptic proteins were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in gray matter homogenates from these subjects and from neuropathologically unaffected subjects. The synaptic proteome was similarly evaluated in cortical gray matter homogenate and in postsynaptic density fractions from an APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mouse model of amyloidosis with germline reduction in Kalrn, which has been shown to confer resilience to progression of psychosis-associated behaviors relative to APPswe/PSEN1dE9 alone.\nSubjects resilient to psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease had higher levels of synaptic proteins compared with those with psychosis and unaffected control subjects. Neuropathologic burden predicted less than 20% of the variance in psychosis status and did not account for the synaptic protein level differences between groups. Reduction of Kalrn in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice resulted in higher levels of synaptic proteins in cortical homogenate and normalized protein levels in the postsynaptic density.\nAccumulation of synaptic proteins, particularly those that are enriched in the postsynaptic density, is associated with resilience to psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. One candidate mechanism for this synaptic proteome compensation is alteration in levels of proteins that facilitate the transport of synaptic proteins to and from the postsynaptic density."}, {"Title": "Liraglutide for psychiatric disorders: clinical evidence and challenges.", "Abstract": "Obesity and diabetes are both risk factors and consequences of psychiatric disorders.

In the past, several psychotropic drugs have received their place in the treatment arsenal via this route. Both in psychiatry and addiction medicine, there is an important need for new treatments with new working mechanisms. Potential new uses in both psychiatry and addiction medicine of several drugs that have already been registered for other indications are currently under study.

The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using grounded theory.\nTwenty-six (86%) patients and relatives reported having first learned about the diagnosis by reading the patient's release form or during an incidental encounter with personnel. Most patients and their relatives disagreed with the diagnosis and reported negative feelings about the way in which they learned about it. Only four (14%) patients and relatives fully understood why medications were prescribed.

Eventually, 50 patients received a text message to remind them of their appointment, while 46 did not. We used a \u03c72 test to evaluate group differences. The effect size was expressed in the 'number needed to cash' (nnc), similar to the number needed to treat (nnt). Routinely available hospital-data was used to estimate lost revenue per year.<br/> RESULTS: A significant group difference was found in the number of outpatient clinic visits in favour of sending a text message reminder (74% vs. 92%, p = 0.018). This corresponded to a nnc of 5.53, i.e. 6 text messages need to be sent in order to accomplish one extra patient showing up for their intake.

Positive psychiatry extends the focus of psychiatric treatment to go beyond the reduction of psychiatric symptoms and and improvement of functional disability to promote the attainment of well-being.\nThis article examined the conceptualization of well-being from the context of treatment for psychosis, its relationship with clinical recovery and highlighted some of challenges and implications for mental health services in promoting well-being.\nRecovery from psychosis is a complex and individual process, where well-being is more than just the absence of mental illness. Clinical and personal recovery processes may contribute to well-being although further longitudinal studies are required. A recent framework for understanding well-being in psychosis helps address the lack of consensus in this field. There is a considerable overlap between the indicators of well-being in this model and the CHIME framework for personal recovery. Thus, interventions targeting personal recovery processes may be a potential way to promote well-being. Current mental health services face a considerable challenge if they are to fulfill the dual role of reducing psychopathology and/or disability whilst concurrently addressing personal recovery to promote well-being.

We present a machine learning (ML) workflow to drug discovery or repositioning by predicting indication for a particular disease based on drug expression profiles, with a focus on applications in psychiatry. Drugs that are not originally indicated for the disease but with high predicted probabilities serve as candidates for repurposing. This approach is widely applicable to any chemicals or drugs with expression profiles measured, even if drug targets are unknown. It is also highly flexible as virtually any supervised learning algorithms can be used. We employed the ML approach to identify repositioning opportunities for schizophrenia as well as depression and anxiety disorders. We applied various state-of-the-art ML approaches, including deep neural networks (DNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), elastic net regression, random forest, and gradient boosted trees. The predictive performance of the five approaches in cross validation did not differ substantially, with SVM slightly outperforming the others. However, other methods also reveal literature-supported repositioning candidates of different mechanisms of actions. As a further validation, we showed that the repositioning hits are enriched for psychiatric medications considered in clinical trials.

Association analysis of common variants was performed by using summary statistics of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), and association analysis of rare variants was conducted by sequencing the entire coding region of the 31 MDD risk genes in 107 Han Chinese patients with early-onset and/or familial AD. We also quantified the mRNA expression alterations of these MDD risk genes in brain tissues of AD patients and AD mouse models, followed by protein-protein interaction network prediction to show their potential effects in AD pathways. We found that common and rare variants of L3MBTL2 were significantly associated with AD. mRNA expression levels of 18 MDD risk genes, in particular SORCS3 and OAT, were differentially expressed in AD brain tissues. 13 MDD risk genes were predicted to physically interact with core AD genes. The involvement of HACE1, NEGR1, and SLC6A15 in AD was supported by convergent lines of evidence.

A measure that has received increasing interest is the effect of antipsychotic drugs on resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in magnetic resonance imaging. However, quantitative comparisons of antipsychotic drug-induced alterations of FC patterns are missing. Consideration of receptor binding affinities provides a means for the effects of antipsychotic drugs on extended brain networks to be related directly to their molecular mechanism of action. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the affinities of three second-generation antipsychotics (amisulpride, risperidone and olanzapine) to dopamine and serotonin receptors and FC patterns related to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in Sprague-Dawley rats. FC of the relevant regions was quantified by correlation coefficients and local network properties.

All patients were assessed by Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98 and classified as having PS when scored two or more on at least one of the psychotic symptom items (perceptual disturbances, delusions, and thought process abnormalities). Of 233 patients with delirium, 116 (49.8%) manifested PS. Patients with PS were younger, more likely to use antipsychotics to manage delirium, and had more hyperactive motor subtype than patients without PS. Logistic regression analysis showed that odds ratio of psychotic symptoms for having in-hospital mortality was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.08-0.94) after controlling age, sex, disease severity, comorbidity, number of medications, etiologies, motor subtypes, delirium severity and use of antipsychotics. The present study demonstrated that PS of delirium was associated with unique clinical characteristics and may affect the clinical course in a psychiatry-referral sample."}, {"Title": "Creating boundaries to empower digital health technology.", "Abstract": "SummaryThe potential of digital health tools such as smartphones and sensors to increase access to and enhance delivery of healthcare is well known. However, a lack of regulation and delineation between those technologies seeking to offer direct clinical diagnostics and treatments and those involving clinical care enhancements or direct-to-consumer resources has led to patient and clinician confusion about the appropriate use and role of digital health. Here, we propose that creating boundaries and better defining the scope of digital health technology will advance the field through matching the right use cases with the right tools. We further propose that ethical clinicians, as stewards of standard of care, are well suited to uphold these boundaries and to safeguard best practices in digital health.Declaration of interestH.H. is an employee of Verily Life Sciences and owns equity in this company.

While they are indicated as adjunctive treatment for short-term use according to clinical practice guidelines, previous studies have shown patterns of long-term use of benzodiazepines, which is problematic due to side effects, dependence and potential of abuse. The aims of this study were to examine among a large sample of primary care adults suffering from anxiety disorders: 1) benzodiazepine use patterns; and 2) correlates of long-term benzodiazepine use.\nData were drawn from the \"Dialogue\" project, a large primary care study conducted in 64 primary care clinics in the province of Quebec, Canada. Following a mental health screening in waiting rooms, patients at risk of anxiety or depression completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Simplified (CIDIS). A sample of 740 adults meeting DSM-IV criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder or Social Anxiety Disorder in the past 12 months took part in this study.\nBenzodiazepines were used by 22.6% of participants with anxiety disorders in our primary care sample. A large majority of benzodiazepine users (88.4%) met our indicator of long-term use, as defined by utilization for more than 12 weeks including regular and as-needed use. Based on a logistic regression model, individual correlates associated with long-term benzodiazepine use included: being 30 years or older, having a comorbid physical illness, meeting criteria for comorbid agoraphobia, reporting the use of sleep-aids, and concurrent SSRI utilization.\nData collection with self-reported questionnaires may be subject to information bias.\nDespite knowledge of the risks of long-term use of benzodiazepines, this remains a pervasive problem. Clinicians need to be mindful of patterns and risk factors leading to long-term use of benzodiazepines in patients with anxiety disorders. Results of this study should raise awareness regarding appropriate prescription practices for benzodiazepines, including decision-making in initiation, duration of prescription, and use of strategies for discontinuation in current long-term benzodiazepine users."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychodynamic Approach to Depression: Integrating Resting State Dysfunctions of the Brain and Disturbed Self-Related Processes.", "Abstract": "A mechanism-based approach was developed focusing on the psychodynamic, psychological and neuronal mechanisms in healthy and depressed persons. In this integrative concept of depression, the self is a core dimension in depression. It is attributed to negative emotions (e.g., failure, guilt). The <i>increased inward focus</i> in depression is connected with a <i>decreased environmental focus</i>. The development of neuropsychodynamic hypotheses of the altered self-reference is based on the investigation of the emotional-cognitive interaction in depressed patients. It may be hypothesized that the increased negative self-attributions-as typical characteristics of an increased self-focus in depression-may result from altered neuronal activity in subcortical-cortical midline structures in the brain, especially from hyperactivity in the cortical-subcortical midline regions and hypoactivity in the lateral regions. The increased resting state activity in depression is especially associated with an increased resting state activity in the default mode network (DMN) and a dysbalance between DMN and executive network (EN) activity. Possible therapeutic consequences of the neuropsychodynamic approach to depression involve the necessary emotional attunement in psychotherapy of depressed patients and the adequate timing of therapeutic interventions. The hypotheses which have been developed in the context of the neuropsychodynamic model of depression may be used for more specific psychotherapeutic interventions, aiming at specific mechanisms of compensation and defence, which are related to the increased resting state activity and the disturbed resting state-stimulus-interaction."}, {"Title": "[Functional Anatomy of Encoding/Retrieval Processing in the Medial Parietal Areas].", "Abstract": "This article reviews memory functions in the medial parietal areas, which consist of the retrosplenial cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus.

Clinical encounter data were collected during telephone consultations. Focus groups were conducted with health care providers and staff from enrolled practices. In-depth interviews were conducted with patients served by the practices that participated in the focus groups. Transcribed interviews were analyzed by two researchers using an iterative, interpretive process with a grounded theory framework.\nIn the first 3.5 years, MCPAP for Moms enrolled 145 obstetric practices, conducted 145 trainings for 1,174 health care providers, and served 3,699 women. Of telephone consultations provided, 42% were with obstetric care providers-midwives and 16% with psychiatrists. Health care providers perceived that MCPAP for Moms facilitates health care providers detecting and addressing depression and women disclosing symptoms, seeking help, and initiating treatment. Obstetric practices reported that they need additional support to more proactively address and further improve depression care.\nThe high volume of encounters, sustained utilization over 3.5 years, and qualitative themes identified from health care providers and patients demonstrate that MCPAP for Moms is a feasible, acceptable, and sustainable approach to increasing access to evidence-based treatments for perinatal mental health and substance use disorders on a population-based level."}, {"Title": "Reliability, validity, and factorial structure of the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) in Iranian psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "The association between psychological well-being and physical and mental health has been shown in the literature.

The latter had been evaluated multiple times in the general practice over several years; each time it was considered to be a symptom of depression. After referral, the patient was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), comorbid to a depressive and anxiety disorder. Retrospectively, we conclude that affective symptoms accompanying OSA and sleepiness were wrongfully interpreted as depression, but after having led to problems at work, they have triggered psychiatric comorbidity. Treatment of OSA in addition to the psychiatric disorders resulted in a full recovery over time. The delayed diagnosis of OSA has certainly diminished the patient's quality of life and might have precipitated the depressive disorder. Moreover, OSA poses patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke and traffic accidents."}, {"Title": "Long-stay patients with and without intellectual disability in forensic psychiatric settings: comparison of characteristics and needs.", "Abstract": "In recent years, concerns have been raised that too many patients stay for too long in forensic psychiatric services and that this is a particular problem in those with an intellectual disability.\nTo compare the characteristics, needs, and care pathways of long-stay patients with and without intellectual disability within forensic psychiatric hospital settings in England.\nFile reviews and questionnaires were completed for all long-stay patients in high secure and a representative sample of those in medium secure settings in England.

Following release from the pre-synaptic neuron and synaptic transmission, glutamate is either taken up into the pre-synaptic neuron or neighbouring glia by transmembrane glutamate transporters. Excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT) 1 and EAAT2 are Na<sup>+</sup>-dependant glutamate transporters expressed predominantly in glia cells of the central nervous system. As the most abundant glutamate transporters, their primary role is to modulate levels of glutamatergic excitability and prevent spill over of glutamate beyond the synapse. This role is facilitated through the binding and transportation of glutamate into astrocytes and microglia. The function of EAAT1 and EAAT2 is heavily regulated at the levels of gene expression, post-transcriptional splicing, glycosylation states and cell-surface trafficking of the protein. Both glutamatergic dysfunction and glial dysfunction have been proposed to be involved in psychiatric disorder. This review will present an overview of the roles that EAAT1 and EAAT2 play in modulating glutamatergic activity in the human brain, and mount an argument that these two transporters could be involved in the aetiologies of schizophrenia and affective disorders as well as represent potential drug targets for novel therapies for those disorders."}, {"Title": "An investigation of the process of change in psychopathology and exercise during inpatient treatment for adults with longstanding eating disorders.", "Abstract": "Excessive exercise is recognized as a predictor of poor outcome in eating disorders.

Excessive exercise was defined as having \u22656 episodes of driven exercise during week 1 of treatment. Excessive exercisers received one additional session of individual counseling with the clinical exercise physiologist. The study used repeated measurements during treatment and collected measures of eating disorders: psychopathology (EDE-Q), general psychopathology (SCL-5), and frequencies of exercise and body mass index (BMI). Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA.\nBoth eating disorders and general psychopathology were reduced from admission to discharge in excessive exercisers and non-exercisers. There was an overall interaction effect between time (week) and excessive exercise for the process of exercise and eating disorders psychopathology reduction.

Under which ethical principles is this practice justified? I assess the justification for advance care planning put forward by the philosopher Ronald Dworkin, which he rationalises through an integrity-based conception of autonomy. I suggest his judgement is misguided by arguing in favour of two claims. First, that patients with dementia qualify for some right to contemporary autonomy conceptualised under the 'sense of liberty' it provides. Second, that respecting precedent autonomy, such as an advance care plan, is not essential to Dworkin's integrity-based account of autonomy. Together, my claims problematise the practice of using advance decisions in the context of dementia."}, {"Title": "Spanish translation and analysis of the metric properties of inpatient satisfaction scale in psychiatry: The Satispsy-22-E.", "Abstract": "The Satispsy-22 scale is an instrument created for the specific evaluation of psychiatric inpatient satisfaction.

We identified bulimia nervosa as the primary diagnosis and\u00a0medical and psychiatric comorbidities using ICD-9-CM codes. The differences in comorbidities were quantified using the Chi-square (\u03c72) test, and a multinomial logistic regression model was used to quantify associations among comorbidities (odds ratio (OR)). Results The sample consisted of 3,319 inpatient admissions with bulimia nervosa between 2010-2014. Overall, 88% patients were younger than 40 years of age (p < 0.001). Bulimia nervosa was seen in a higher proportion of females (92.5%). The mean inpatient stay was 9.15 days and had a variable trend, whereas inpatient charges have been increasing (p < 0.001), averaging $34,398 (USD). The odds of having a longer hospitalization > 7 days (median) was seen in patients with comorbid fluid/electrolyte disorders (OR = 1.816; p < 0.001) and comorbid depression (OR = 1.745; p < 0.001). The most prevalent psychiatric comorbidities were psychosis (52.4%), followed by depression (23.5%). Females had three times higher odds of comorbid diabetes (OR = 3.374; p < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 2.548; p-value < 0.001), comorbid depression (OR = 1.670; p = 0.002), and drug abuse (OR = 2.008; p < 0.001).

We believe that medical and psychiatric comorbidities of bulimia nervosa should be carefully investigated by clinicians as they can further complicate the management of bulimia nervosa and result in adverse inpatient outcomes."}, {"Title": "Maternal and paternal cannabis use during pregnancy and the risk of psychotic-like experiences in the offspring.", "Abstract": "Cannabis use continues to increase among pregnant women. Gestational cannabis exposure has been associated with various adverse outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether cannabis use during pregnancy increases the risk for offspring psychotic-like experiences. In this prospective cohort, we examined the relationship between parental cannabis use during pregnancy and offspring psychotic-like experiences. Comparisons were made between maternal and paternal cannabis use during pregnancy to investigate causal influences of intra-uterine cannabis exposure during foetal neurodevelopmental. This study was embedded in the Generation R birth cohort and included N\u202f=\u202f3692 participants. Maternal cannabis exposure was determined using self-reports and cannabis metabolite levels from urine. Paternal cannabis use during pregnancy was obtained by maternal report. Maternal cannabis use increased the risk of psychotic-like experiences in the offspring (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.38, 95% CI 1.03-1.85). Estimates were comparable for maternal cannabis use exclusively before pregnancy versus continued cannabis use during pregnancy. Paternal cannabis use was similarly associated with offspring psychotic-like experiences (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>\u202f=\u202f1.44, 95% CI 1.14-1.82). We demonstrated that both maternal and paternal cannabis use were associated with more offspring psychotic-like experiences at age ten years. This may suggest that common aetiologies, rather than solely causal intra-uterine mechanisms, underlie the association between parental cannabis use and offspring psychotic-like experiences. These common backgrounds most likely reflect genetic vulnerabilities and shared familial mechanisms, shedding a potential new light on the debated causal path from cannabis use to psychotic-like phenomena.

The aim of this article was to explore the complexity of not talking about psychosocial hardships ('silence') in meeting places in Norwegian community mental health care. The research team consisted of first-hand and academic knowers of community mental health care (participatory research team). We performed two series of focus group discussions with service users and staff of meeting places. The focus group interviews were analysed within a discourse analytic framework, and five discursive constructions were identified: (1) biomedical colonization of illness-talk, (2) restricted access for biomedical psychiatry and problem-talk in the common spaces of meeting places, (3) censorship of service users' civil and human rights to freedom of speech, (4) protection from exploitation and burdens and (5) silent knowledge of the peer community. Based on the analysis, we suggest that not talking about illness (silence) entails a complexity ranging from under-privileging implications to promoting the interests of people who 'use' meeting places. For instance, restricting biomedical psychiatry may imply the unintended implication of further silencing service users, while silently shared understandings of hardships among peers may imply resistance against demands to speak to legitimize one's situation. The discussion illuminates dilemmas related to silence that require critical reflexive discussions and continuous negotiations among service users, staff and policymakers in community mental health care."}, {"Title": "Emerging themes in coping with lifetime stress and implication for stress management education.", "Abstract": "Adults with adverse childhood experiences and exposure to adverse life events experience a diverse array of physical, mental, and social health problems across their lifespan. Adult exposure to emotional trauma, physical injury, or other adverse life events may result in the development of post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Understanding individuals' response to stress and their coping strategies is as important as the stimulus or the causes of the stress for effective stress management interventions.\nThis is a mixed quantitative and qualitative online survey study which explores the coping strategies to stress in adults with adverse childhood experiences and exposure to adverse life events through analysis of emerging themes from survey questionnaire responses of study participants.\nParticipants who respond to stress through adaptive coping focused either on problem-solving, 17.6% (32 out of 188), or on emotion-focused coping, 45.2% (85 out of 188). Participants engaged in problem-solving mainly through therapy such as counseling and other professional stress management, whereas those who chose emotion-focused coping used diverse strategies including practicing mindfulness, meditation, and yoga; using humor and jokes; seeking higher power or religious pursuits; engaging in physical or breathing exercises; and seeking social support. Participants who practiced maladaptive coping styles constituted 37.2% (70 out of 188) of respondents and resorted to avoidance of the stressful condition, withdrawal from a stressful environment, disengagement from stressful relationships, and use and abuse of drugs and/or alcohol.\nAn understanding of emerging themes in coping strategies calls for collaborative and multidisciplinary approaches in the design, implementation, and execution of health education and promotion programs tailored to meet the diverse needs of priority populations.

The two schools of thought are the Post-Traumatic Model (PTM) and the Socio-Cognitive Model (SCM). This case highlights the validity of PTM in an individual who suffered severe and prolonged physical, psychological, and sexual abuse from 2 years old through adulthood. The reported abuse was corroborated and proven on two separate occasions via medical professionals/rape kit and the police. This resulted in the incarceration of one of her abusers. The only way for the patient to cope with the trauma she suffered was to dissociate, which resulted in the development of four full identity alters. In addition to being diagnosed with DID, the patient has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and chronic suicidality. Unable to manage the suicidal ideations and MDD after nearly 10 years of therapy and psychiatric medications, the patient was referred for Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). Upon receiving ECT weekly for 2 years, the patient reported having \"lost the others.\" As ECT progressed she went from having four alters to no alters and at the time of this report only being able to vaguely hear alter #4. With the integration of these alters she had access to the memories and pain that the alters had protected her from. Prior to losing the alters, her long-term memory was impaired by dissociative processes. Her long-term memory was also impaired because when one of the alters was in control of consciousness only that alter remembered what had happened during that time, unless that alter shared what had happened with one or more of the others. It is unclear if frequent ECT was the catalyst that lead to the integration of her alters however, integration finally began following prolonged ECT. This case highlights the importance of the PTM as an etiological description for DID and the importance of mental health providers further studying and researching the effects of ECT on patients with chronic MDD, PTSD, and suicidal intent, especially if these are comorbid with DID."}, {"Title": "Clinical picture, pathogenesis and psychometric assessment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Negative symptoms of schizophrenia constitute a serious diagnostic and therapeutic problem. They substantially account for the impairment of health, social functioning and quality of life whereas treatment is difficult.

The models of positive and negative symptoms, introduced in the 1980's by Timothy Crow and Nancy Andreasen, and William Carpenter's concept of so-called deficit syndrome with the criteria of the division of negative symptoms into the primary and secondary, are discussed. Current views on the pathogenesis of negative symptoms are shown with reference to neuroimaging studies, neurotransmitter alterations, neuropsychological deficits, genetic, immunological and epidemiological studies. A subsection is devoted to the diagnostics tools for negative symptoms. Chronologically, they are divided into scales of the 1st and 2nd generation. The first generation includes: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome (SDS), and the Proxy for Deficit Syndrome. The second generation scales, developed as a result of the recommendation by American experts in 2006, include: the Brief Negative Syndrome Scale (BNSS) and the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), also the self-assessment scales: the Motivation and Pleasure Scale - Self Report (MAP-SR) and the Self-assessment of Negative Symptoms (SNS).

Only a single study has been published in humans that shows the effect of extensive training on habit expression. Here, we report five failed attempts to demonstrate that overtraining instrumental behavior leads to the development of inflexible habits in humans, using variants of four previously published outcome devaluation paradigms. Extensive training did not lead to greater habits in two versions of an avoidance learning task, in an appetitive slips-of-action task, or in two independent attempts to replicate the original demonstration. The finding that these outcome devaluation procedures may be insensitive to duration of stimulus-response training in humans has implications for prior work in psychiatric populations. Specifically, it converges with the suggestion that the failures in outcome devaluation in compulsive individuals reflect dysfunction in goal-directed control, rather than overactive habit learning. We discuss why habits are difficult to experimentally induce in healthy humans, and the implications of this for future research in healthy and disordered populations.

Because this intervention has serious implications for the citizens' civil liberties it is regulated by law. Every country's health system approaches this issue differently with regard to the relevant laws and the logistical processes by which involuntary hospitalization generally is enacted. This paper aims at analyzing the regulation and process of involuntary hospitalization in New York (United States) and Zurich (Switzerland). Comparing the respective historical, political, and economic backgrounds shows how notions of risk and liberty are culture-bound and consequently shape legislation and local practices. It is highly relevant to reconsider which criteria are required for involuntary hospitalization as this might shape the view of society on psychiatric patients and psychiatry itself. Furthermore, this article discusses the impact that training and experience of the person authorized to conduct and maintain an involuntary hospitalization has on the outcome."}, {"Title": "[Children of mentally ill parents : Also a\u00a0topic in the context of child protection].", "Abstract": "Severe mental illness in parents increases the risk of neglect, physical and sexual abuse (adverse childhood experiences, ACE) of children.\nPresentation of the current situation of child protection issues in psychiatric care in Germany and the derivation of needs and potential solution strategies.\nBased on a\u00a0selective literature search, the needs and the current situation in Germany are presented and potential solution strategies are pointed out.

There are very promising treatment approaches like the \"Good lives model\" or the \"Community Reinforcement Approach\" (CRA-Concept), which consider the personal aims and the pursuit of happiness of the patient as a starting point and resource. The most recent legislative changes will probably cause a shorter duration of stay in forensic clinics and will require a more intense and well connected aftercare.

The current lack of biomarkers in routine use is attributable in part to the existing way mental health conditions are diagnosed, being based upon descriptions of symptoms rather than causal biological evidence. New ways of conceptualizing mental health disorders together with the enormous advances in genetic, epidemiological, and neuroscience research are informing the brain circuits and physiological mechanisms underpinning behavioural constructs that cut across current diagnostic DSM-5 categories. Combining these advances with 'Big Data', analytical approaches offer new opportunities for biomarker development. Here we provide an introductory perspective to this volume, highlighting methodological strategies for biomarker identification; ranging from stem cells, immune mechanisms, genomics, imaging, network science to cognition. Thereafter we emphasize key points made by contributors on affective disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder. An underlying theme is how preclinical and clinical research are informing biomarker development and the importance of forward and reverse translation approaches. In considering the exploitation of biomarkers we note that there is a timely opportunity to improve clinical trial design informed by patient 'biological' and 'psychological' phenotype. This has the potential to reinvigorate drug development and clinical trials in psychiatry. In conclusion, we are poised to move from the descriptive and discovery phase to one where biomarker panels can be evaluated in real-life cohorts. This will necessitate resources for large-scale collaborative efforts worldwide. Ultimately this will lead to new interventions and personalized medicines and transform our ability to prevent illness onset and treat complex psychiatric disorders more effectively."}, {"Title": "Maternal filicide: A case series from a medico-legal psychiatry unit in India.", "Abstract": "Maternal filicide has occurred throughout history and carries along with it, a host of paradoxical and complex clinical, legal and social dimensions.

Data were collected retrospectively as part of a clinical audit process and then analysed with descriptive statistics, cross-tabular univariate analyses with chi-square tests using SPSS version 20.\nA total of 1,465 patients were included. Sociodemographic factors disproportionately elevated during the recession included male sex, Caucasian ethnicity, own home ownership, higher levels of education and unemployment. More patients seeking mental health care were already taking psychotropic medications (e.g. antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and stimulants). At the same time, disproportionately fewer patients engaged in substance abuse or had a prior formal history of mental health problems. The referral reasons during recession were less likely to be associated with substance abuse or mood concerns and more likely for 'other' reasons. The patients seeking psychiatric help during a recession were disproportionately likely to be diagnosed with personality disorders and 'other' less common diagnostic categories and less likely to suffer from mood or trauma-related diagnoses. Referrals for counselling and social services were also disproportionately more common during the recession.\nThis study provides a comprehensive description of longitudinal patterns of mental health service utilization before and during a recession.

This hierarchical unsupervised generative embedding (HUGE) approach combined a hierarchical formulation of dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for fMRI with Gaussian mixture models and relied on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for inference. While well suited for the inversion of complex hierarchical models, MCMC-based sampling suffers from a computational burden that is prohibitive for many applications. To address this problem, this paper derives an efficient variational Bayesian (VB) inversion scheme for HUGE that simultaneously provides approximations to the posterior distribution over model parameters and to the log model evidence. The face validity of the VB scheme was tested using two synthetic fMRI datasets with known ground truth. Additionally, an empirical fMRI dataset of stroke patients and healthy controls was used to evaluate the practical utility of the method in application to real-world problems. Our analyses demonstrate good performance of our VB scheme, with a marked speed-up of model inversion by two orders of magnitude compared to MCMC, while maintaining a similar level of accuracy. Notably, additional acceleration would be possible if parallel computing techniques were applied. Generally, our VB implementation of HUGE is fast enough to support multi-start procedures for whole-group analyses, a useful strategy to ameliorate problems with local extrema. HUGE thus represents a potentially useful practical solution for an important problem in clinical neuromodeling and computational psychiatry, i.e., the unsupervised detection of subgroups in heterogeneous populations that are defined by effective connectivity."}, {"Title": "Addiction disorders: a need for change. Proposal for a new management. Position paper of SIA, Italian Society on Alcohol.", "Abstract": "Various epidemiological and biological evaluations and the recent publication of the DSM-V (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders) has imposed on the scientific community a period of reflection on the diagnosis and treatment of what in the DSM-IV was defined as \"addiction\". To date, the term \"addiction\" has been replaced by the DSM-5, because there is no global scientific consensus that has unequivocally characterized its clinical characteristics. This, we will talk about substance/alcohol use disorders (SUDs/AUDs) and disorders related to behavioral alterations (DBA) that can generate organic diseases, mental disorders, and social problems. In the first psychotic episode 40-70% of subjects meet the criteria of a SUDs/AUDs, excluding tobacco dependence. Substances can not only be the cause of a psychotic onset, but they can also disrupt a psychotic picture or interfere with drug therapy. The pharmacodynamic profiles of many substances are able to provoke the phenomenology of the main psychotic symptoms in a way that can be superimposed onto those presented by psychotic subjects without a history of SUDs/AUDs. The Department of Addictions (DAs) must not be absorbed by or incorporated into the Departments of Mental Health (DMH), with which, however, precise operational cooperation protocols will have to be defined and maintained, but it will have to maintain its own autonomy and independent connotation. Addiction Medicine is a discipline that brings together elements of public health, prevention, internal medicine, clinical pharmacology, neurology, and even psychiatry. The inclusion of the DAs in those of DMH refers purely to a problem of pathology that has to do with lifestyle, choices, and behaviors. These, over time, show their dysfunctionality and only then do related problems emerge. Moreover, epidemiological, social, and clinical motivations impose the creation of alcohological teams dedicated to alcohol-related activities.

Also examined were the influences on web-based media use, for instance, the assessment of their suitability for use in teaching. <b>Method:</b> An online survey of 264 teacher coordinators in internal medicine, surgery, anesthesiology, gynecology, pediatrics and psychiatry was conducted in March and April, 2016. This survey was carried out in the German-speaking countries using a 181-item questionnaire developed by us. Analysis took place in the form of descriptive and exploratory data analysis. <b>Results:</b> The response rate was 34.8% with 92 responses. Individual web-based media were actively used in the classroom by a maximum of 28% of participants. Reasons cited against using web-based media in teaching included the amount of time required and lack of support staff. The assessment of suitability revealed that interactive patient cases, podcasts and subject-specific apps for teaching medicine were predominantly viewed as constructive teaching tools. Social media such as Facebook and Twitter were considered unsuitable. When using web-based media and assessing their suitability for teaching, no correlations with the personal profiles of the teachers were found in the exploratory analysis, except regarding the use of different sources of information. <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite the Internet's rapid development in the past 15 years, web-based media continue to play only a minor role in teaching medicine.

I argue that the novel engages the dynamics among psychopharmacology, neuroscience, and psychiatry, and investigates how these specialties function within Western culture to mediate between dominant and subordinate divisions. As such, a neuroscientific reading of A Clockwork Orange articulates how counterculture perverts psychopharmacology, driving it away from the normalizing discourses of psychiatric power (as it is used to correct deviant mental states).

Outcome analysis were stratified based on specific DAA therapy and preexisting mental illness (mental health [MH] subjects and non-MH subjects), with a sub-analysis of major depressive disorder patients.\nAnalysis included 48 patients, majority males (96%), with a mean age of 59.4 years (\u00b18.0). Twenty-four (50%) patients had a preexisting MH diagnosis, with major depressive disorder being the most common MH diagnosis (50%, n\u2009=\u200912). Despite a trend toward improvement, no significant changes in questionnaire scores after 12 weeks of DAA therapy were observed for all patient groups (<i>P</i>\u2009>\u2009.05). Neither MH subjects nor non-MH subjects displayed a significant change in questionnaire scores from baseline to end of treatment (<i>P</i>\u2009>\u2009.05). No patients required acute psychiatric interventions during DAA treatment.\nTreatment with DAA therapy was not associated with psychiatric decompensation. Data from this pilot study supports the safe utilization of DAA therapy in hepatitis C virus patients with preexisting MH illness as it appears to be devoid of depressive and psychiatric side effects."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of provider response to positive depression screenings and physician attitudes on integrating psychiatric pharmacist services in primary care settings.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify potential gaps in the management of depression and assess the perceptions of primary care providers (PCPs) toward integrating psychiatric pharmacists into primary care settings.\nThis was a retrospective chart review of patients \u226518 years of age seen in primary care clinics in Los Angeles County with a documented annual health screening (AHS) between January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. Primary outcomes were number and percentage of patients screened for depression with patient health questionnaire (PHQ) assessments, positive depression screenings, and interventions made for positive depression screenings. Secondary outcomes were PCPs' perceptions on management of depression, use of AHS, and roles for psychiatric pharmacists through evaluation of provider survey.\nOf the patients who received an AHS (n = 6797), 63% received PHQ assessments. Of 145 individuals with a positive PHQ-2, 69% had a positive PHQ-9. Greater than 50% of individuals with a positive PHQ-9 had no preexisting depression diagnosis. Seventy-six percent of individuals with a positive PHQ-9 and 78% with reported suicide ideation had no documented intervention. The majority of providers reported there is a role for psychiatric pharmacists in primary care.\nGaps in the management of depression were identified. Although depression screenings were performed for the majority of individuals receiving an AHS, no documented interventions were made for most of those individuals who screened positive for depression. Primary care clinics could benefit from psychiatric pharmacist involvement in depression screening and follow-up processes."}, {"Title": "Cases in Psychiatry: A description of a multi-campus elective course for pharmacy students.", "Abstract": "Cases in Psychiatry was a multi-campus elective course aimed to expand psychiatry knowledge beyond the required course curriculum.

The purpose of this manuscript is to report existing IPPEs in psychiatry and neurology across the United States.\nTwo separate electronic surveys were administered to individual College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists members with board certification in psychiatric pharmacy with an academic affiliation and academic institutions in the 2014-15 academic year to assess the neuropsychiatric curriculum in pharmacy programs. Results focusing on IPPEs were summarized using descriptive statistics.\nAcademic institutional data reveal only 37.3% offered IPPEs in psychiatry, and 6.7% offered neurology. The number of available IPPEs is low even if a program offered an available rotation. The majority of College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists member respondents (69.9%) did not offer IPPEs in psychiatry in the 2014-15 academic year, and none offered an IPPE in neurology. More than half of individual respondents feel their institution should increase IPPEs in psychiatry and neurology in order to enhance their curriculum.\nTo expand IPPE availability, pharmacy programs should increase early exposure of pharmacy students to patients with psychiatric and neurologic conditions. Longitudinal experiences may allow students to engage in hands-on experiences, which may impact future career aspirations and reduce stigma. Current example IPPEs at the authors' institutions are included to stimulate discussion and action among readers on how IPPEs in these practice areas may be developed. Implementation of IPPEs in psychiatry and neurology is needed for students to gain experience working with these patients."}, {"Title": "Assessment of pharmacists' self-reported preparedness to provide pharmacotherapy services to individuals with psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare pharmacists' level of training and/or experience in psychiatric pharmacy to (1) their self-perceived preparedness to provide pharmacotherapy services to individuals with psychiatric disorders and (2) barriers to providing pharmacotherapy services to individuals with psychiatric disorders.\nThis study used data from an Internet-based questionnaire. Respondents were divided into 2 groups: group A completed the Arizona Pharmacy Association's Psychiatric Certificate Program, and/or was board certified in psychiatric pharmacy, and/or was a member of the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists, and/or had completed a psychiatric pharmacy residency; group B had no specialized training and/or experience in psychiatric pharmacy. A Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test was used to compare the scaled responses for each group.\nCompared with pharmacists without training and/or experience in psychiatry (N\u2009=\u2009235), respondents with specialized training and/or experience in psychiatric pharmacy (N\u2009=\u200938) reported more frequent interactions with patients with psychiatric disorders and provided more counseling and drug information, monitoring for adverse drug reactions, screening for treatment issues, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment recommendations (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.05).

It may be present in children but often fades prior to puberty. Gender dysphoria is more likely to persist into adulthood when present in adolescents. Due to the common occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities, gender dysphoria is a contributing factor leading to outpatient and inpatient psychiatric care in children and adolescents. There is currently limited available literature on psychiatric hospitalization and management in transgender adolescents. A PubMed search revealed no case reports regarding psychiatric admission for transgender adolescents with comorbid anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation. Due to the lack of literature related to psychiatric management of transgender adolescent patients, this case series briefly describes the past medical history, pharmacotherapy, and discharge diagnoses of 5 transgender adolescents admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit. In this case series, 4 of the 5 patients identified as female to male and ages ranged from 13 to 17 years. All patients had a history of depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation as the key factor prompting admission. All patients were managed on psychotropic pharmacotherapy, and 3 of the 5 patients were on pharmacotherapy related to gender transition. Anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were common comorbidities leading to psychiatric hospitalization of adolescent transgender patients in various stages of gender transitioning in this case series."}, {"Title": "Rediscovering the value of families for psychiatric genetics research.", "Abstract": "As it is likely that both common and rare genetic variation are important for complex disease risk, studies that examine the full range of the allelic frequency distribution should be utilized to dissect the genetic influences on mental illness. The rate limiting factor for inferring an association between a variant and a phenotype is inevitably the total number of copies of the minor allele captured in the studied sample. For rare variation, with minor allele frequencies of 0.5% or less, very large samples of unrelated individuals are necessary to unambiguously associate a locus with an illness. Unfortunately, such large samples are often cost prohibitive. However, by using alternative analytic strategies and studying related individuals, particularly those from large multiplex families, it is possible to reduce the required sample size while maintaining statistical power. We contend that using whole genome sequence (WGS) in extended pedigrees provides a cost-effective strategy for psychiatric gene mapping that complements common variant approaches and WGS in unrelated individuals. This was our impetus for forming the \"Pedigree-Based Whole Genome Sequencing of Affective and Psychotic Disorders\" consortium. In this review, we provide a rationale for the use of WGS with pedigrees in modern psychiatric genetics research. We begin with a focused review of the current literature, followed by a short history of family-based research in psychiatry. Next, we describe several advantages of pedigrees for WGS research, including power estimates, methods for studying the environment, and endophenotypes. We conclude with a brief description of our consortium and its goals."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Shetland.", "Abstract": "The Shetland Isles are a place of breathtaking landscapes and pristine wildlife.

The argument draws on experiential accounts of navigating the practices of diagnosis by people living with multiple conditions of ill-health and disability. Vulnerability as a concept is used widely across different domains and conveys a multitude of meanings. Contemporary biomedicine, and its associated health systems and services, understands vulnerability mostly as inherent to particular physical and mental bodily conditions that put people at risk of ill-health or emotionally fragility. This may combine with a more epidemiological understanding of vulnerability as the experience of certain population groups subject to entrenched structural inequalities. Philosophers and feminists have argued that vulnerability is a universal experience of being human while political commentators have explored its potential as a resource for resistance and action. Diagnosis within medicine and psychiatry has been the subject of extensive social analysis, critique and activism. The paper draws on first-hand experiential accounts collected through face-to-face interviews with people living with multiple conditions about their experiences of diagnosis, mostly at the primary care level. We identify five aspects to diagnostic practice that are harmful and exacerbate the experience of vulnerability: temporal sequencing; diagnostic authority; medical specialisation; strategic symptom selection; medical isolation. However, these diagnostic practices are not best understood only in terms of the power asymmetries inherent to the medical consultation, but are embedded into the very institution of diagnosis. The paper thus proposes a combined approach to vulnerability that recognises it as a universal condition of humanity but one that becomes animated or amplified for some bodies, through their own inherent incapacities or the external structures of inequality, and through the practices of medicine as situated in particular times and places."}, {"Title": "Possible SAMe-induced mania.", "Abstract": "This paper describes a patient who presented with mania with psychotic features in the context of concomitant use of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

However, little is known about how weight is discussed in non-weight-specific settings where the primary purpose of the interaction concerns clinical matters apparently unrelated to weight. This study explores how mental health clinicians initiate discussions about a patient's possible weight problem in the non-weight-specific setting of a UK NHS Gender Identity Clinic (GIC), where weight is topicalized during discussions about the risks of treatment.\nA conversation analytic study.\nA total of 194 recordings of routine clinician-patient consultations were collected from the GIC. Weight talk was initiated by four clinicians in 43 consultations. Twenty-one instances contained reference to a possible weight problem. Transcripts were analysed using conversation analysis.\nClinicians used three communication practices to initiate discussion of a possible weight problem with patients: (1) announcing that patients are overweight; (2) asking patients whether they are overweight; and (3) deducing that patients are overweight or obese via a body mass index (BMI) calculation. Announcing that patients are overweight is the least aligning practice that denies patient's agency and grammatically constrains them to agree with a negative label. Asking patients whether they are overweight treats them as having limited agency and generates comparatively aligning, but occasionally resistant, responses. Jointly deducing that patients are overweight or obese via a BMI calculation is the most aligning practice, which deflects responsibility for labelling the patient onto an objective instrument.\nSmall differences in the wording of turns that initiate discussions about a possible weight problem can have significant consequences for interactional alignment. Clinicians from different specialities may benefit from considering the interactional consequences of different practices for initiating discussions about weight during the kinds of real-life discussions considered here. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? There is a correlation between clinical communication about weight and patient weight loss. Clinicians from all specialties are encouraged to discuss diet and exercise with patients, but communication about weight remains problematic. Health psychologists have identified an urgent need for communication training to raise sensitive topics like weight without damaging the doctor-patient relationship. What does this study add? Clinicians in a non-weight-specific setting use three communication practices to introduce the possibility that a patient's weight may be a problem. These practices have varying consequences for the interaction and doctor-patient relationship. Conversation analytic findings may be useful in training clinicians how to initiate discussions about weight with patients."}, {"Title": "X\u2009+\u2009Y\u2009=\u2009Time for QI: Meaningful Engagement of Residents in Quality Improvement During the Ambulatory Block.", "Abstract": "Meaningful resident engagement in quality improvement (QI) remains challenging.

This study aimed at define risk factors and test machine learning algorithms for their accuracy in the prediction of the risk to being subjected to coercive measures. <b>Methods:</b> In a sample of involuntarily hospitalized patients (<i>n</i> = 393) at the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich, we analyzed risk factors for the experience of coercion (<i>n</i> = 170 patients) using chi-square tests and Mann Whitney U tests. We trained machine learning algorithms [logistic regression, Supported Vector Machine (SVM), and decision trees] with these risk factors and tested obtained models for their accuracy via five-fold cross validation. To verify the results we compared them to binary logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> In a model with 8 risk-factors which were available at admission, the SVM algorithm identified 102 out of 170 patients, which had experienced coercion and 174 out of 223 patients without coercion (69% accuracy with 60% sensitivity and 78% specificity, AUC 0.74). In a model with 18 risk-factors, available after discharge, the logistic regression algorithm identified 121 out of 170 with and 176 out of 223 without coercion (75% accuracy, 71% sensitivity, and 79% specificity, AUC 0.82). <b>Discussion:</b> Incorporating both clinical and demographic variables can help to estimate the risk of experiencing coercion for psychiatric patients. This study could show that trained machine learning algorithms are comparable to binary logistic regression and can reach a good or even excellent area under the curve (AUC) in the prediction of the outcome coercion/no coercion when cross validation is used. Due to the better generalizability machine learning is a promising approach for further studies, especially when more variables are analyzed. More detailed knowledge about individual risk factors may help to prevent the occurrence of situations involving coercion."}, {"Title": "Facts and myths pertaining to fibromyalgia.", "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, physical exhaustion, and cognitive difficulties. It occurs in all populations throughout the world, with prevalence between 2% and 4% in general populations. Definition, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of FM remain points of contention, with some even contesting its existence. The various classification systems according to pain medicine, psychiatry, and neurology (pain disease; persistent somatoform pain disorder; masked depression; somatic symptom disorder; small fiber neuropathy; brain disease) mostly capture only some components of this complex and heterogeneous disorder. The diagnosis can be established in most cases by a general practitioner when the symptoms meet recognized criteria and a somatic disease sufficiently explaining the symptoms is excluded. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines give a strong recommendation for aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioral therapies. Drug therapy is not mandatory.

Earlier versions of such dualism posed little problem in regard to the manner of their communication. The Cartesian view that mind and body did, in fact, name different substances introduced a problem of incommunicability that is yet to be resolved. Earlier views that madness may be related to changes in the brain began gaining empirical support during the 17th century. Writers on madness chose to resolve the mind-body problem differently Some stated that such communication was not needed; others, that mind was a redundant concept, as madness could be fully explained by structural changes in the brain; and yet others described psychological spaces for madness to inhabit as a symbolic conflict. The epistemology of the neurosciences bypasses the conundrum, as it processes all together the variables representing the brain, subjectivity, and behavior and bridges the \"philosophical\" gap by means of correlational structures."}, {"Title": "The mind-body Cartesian dualism and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650) argued that the natures of mind and body are completely different from one another and that each could exist by itself.

Thus, it is crucial to obtain a unifying and generally accepted means of its measuring. The three most commonly used psychometric schizotypy inventories, the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales, Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire and Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences were, however, built upon different theoretical schizotypy models, wherefore comparing results from studies that have used different inventories is difficult and sometimes questionable. Therefore, an analysis of all three inventories was conducted within the same sample of 327 healthy participants to illustrate the similarities and differences in factor structures. Results showed that findings are likely dependent on the used assessment instrument. A following item-level factor analysis was conducted to investigate the shared structure of all three inventories, in order to illustrate a framework interpretable as \"common ground\" between measures. This adjusted four-factor structure may be used to better aid comparisons between schizotypy-studies having used different inventories. At least, our findings illustrate the necessity of viewing individual results before the background of the theoretical framework of the respective measurement tool."}, {"Title": "The Psychiatric Neuromodulation Unit: Implementation and Management.", "Abstract": "The proven effectiveness of neuromodulation and stimulation techniques for the management of psychiatric disorders has brought strongly needed innovation in psychiatry, given the high prevalence and high costs of treatment resistance.

In this contribution, we have combined the results of a literature search with the suggestions of clinical psychiatrists, managers, and bioethicists who have had firsthand experience in building a PNU. Eleven key issues concerning the implementation and management of a PNU were identified: general context, team composition, environment, basic technical equipment, clinical versus research activities, target clinical population, education and training, interdisciplinarity, ethical aspects, regulatory and reimbursement issues, fund-raising, and partnership development.

It is proposed to 'task-share' the screening, diagnosis and treatment of common mental disorders fromspecialists to primary care workers. Key to facilitating this is training primary care workers to deliver mental health care. Mental health training in Africa shows a predominance of short-term, externally driven training programmes. Locally, a more sustainable delivery system was needed.\nThe aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a locally delivered, long-term, inservice training programme to facilitate mental health care in primary care.\nThis was a quasi-experimental study using mixed methods. The in-service training programme was delivered in weekly 1-h sessions by local psychiatry staff to 20 primary care nurses at the clinic over 5 months. The training was evaluated using quantitative data from participant questionnaires and analysis of the referrals from primary to specialist care. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews and 14 observed training sessions.\nThe training was feasible and well received. Referrals to the mental health nurse increased in quality and participants' self-rated competence improved. Additional benefits included the development of supervision skills of mental health nurses and providing a forum for staff to discuss service improvement. The programme acted as a vehicle to pilot integration in one clinic and identify unanticipated barriers prior to rollout.\nLong-term, in-service training, using existing local staff had benefits to the integration of mental health into primary care.

However, the career paths of female psychiatrists appear to diverge significantly from that of their male counterparts. This article reviews the pervasiveness of the trend of women being less likely to pursue active research in psychiatry. In addition, we examine the correlation between academic rank and research productivity. Methods We searched the American Medical Association's (AMA) Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) to identify training programs for psychiatry. A total of 5234 psychiatrists met our inclusion criteria. The gender, academic rank, research work, and h-index of faculty members were compared. The ratio of women reaching senior ranks as compared to men was also calculated. The Scopus database was used to determine the h-index of the individuals included in this study. Data analysis was done with SPSS 22.0 Release 2013 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used where required, with the P-value set at less than 0.05. Results In our study sample, 2181 (42%) of the psychiatrists were women. However, according to the information obtained from the websites of 23 programs, few women reached higher ranks, full professorship, or positions such as the chairperson of a program, and only 9% of women achieved the designation of chairperson of the psychiatry department, with men representing the other 91%. Higher academic rank correlated with higher h-index. A statistically-significant difference between the genders in terms of h-index was found for the assistant professor rank as well. However, this difference was not observed at the level of an associate professor. Conclusions Despite adequate representation of women in the academic workforce in psychiatry, there appears to be a discrepancy in the research productivity of the two genders. This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address gender disparities in academic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "'The few cubic centimetres inside your skull': a neurological reading of George Orwell's <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>.", "Abstract": "<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> (1949), George Orwell's political satire on state surveillance and mind control, was written between 1946 and 1948, at a time when new thinking in forensic psychiatry coincided with scientific breakthroughs in neurology to bring questions of criminality, psychotherapy and mental health to the forefront of the popular imagination. This paper examines how <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> inverts psychiatric paradigms in order to diagnose what Orwell sees as the madness of totalitarian regimes. It then goes on to place the novel's dystopian vision of total surveillance and mind control in the context of the neurological research and brain scanning techniques of the mid-20th century. Not only does this context provide new insight into the enduring power of Orwell's novel, it also locates it within a historical moment when technological interventions into the brain seemed to offer a paradigm of mental health and illness as a simple, knowable binary. <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> complicates this binary, and deserves to be acknowledged as an early example of what might be called 'electric shock' literature, within a mid-20th century canon that includes Harold Pinter's <i>The Caretaker</i> (1960), Ken Kesey's <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> (1962), and Sylvia Plath's <i>The Bell Jar</i> (1963)."}, {"Title": "Translational research in psychiatry: The Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC).", "Abstract": "Despite the consensus achieved in the homogenization of clinical criteria by categorical psychiatric classification systems (DEM and CIE), they are criticized for a lack of validity and inability to guide clinical treatment and research. In this review article we introduce the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as an alternative framework for translational research in psychiatry. The RDOC framework systematizes both research targets and methodology for research in psychiatry. RDoC is based on a catalogue of neurobiological and neurocognitive evidence of behaviour, and conceives psychopathology as the phenotypic expression of alterations of functional domains that are classified into 5psychobiological systems. The RdoC framework also proposes that domains must be validated with evidence in 7levels of analysis: genes, molecules, cells, nerve circuits, physiology, behaviour and self-reports. As opposed to categorical systems focused on diagnosis, RDoC focuses on the study of psychopathology as a correlate of detectable functional, biological and behavioural disruption of normal processes. In order to build a useful psychiatric nosology for guiding clinical interventions, the RDoC research framework links the neurobiological basis of mental processes with phenotypical manifestations. Although the RDoC findings have not yet been articulated into a specific model for guiding clinical practice, they provide a useful transition system for creating clinical, basic and epidemiological research hypotheses."}, {"Title": "Effects of Atomoxetine on Height and Weight in Korean Children and Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Retrospective Chart Review.", "Abstract": "We aimed to investigate the long-term effects of atomoxetine on growth in Korean children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nThe medical records of 82 subjects (mean age, 9.0\u00b12.0 years; 64 boys) with ADHD treated with atomoxetine for at least 1 year at the Department of Psychiatry at Asan Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed. Height and weight data were prospectively obtained and retrospectively gathered and converted to age- and gender-corrected z scores using norms from Korean youths. Growth changes were analyzed using random coefficients models with changes in height or weight z scores as the dependent variables.\nHeight z scores significantly decreased during the treatment period (\u03b2=-0.054, p=0.024). Height z scores decreased during the 1st year of treatment (\u03b2=-0.086, p=0.003), but did not change after the 1st year. Weight z scores did not change significantly during treatment (\u03b2=0.004, p=0.925).\nOur results suggest that long-term atomoxetine treatment may be associated with deficits in height growth in Korean youths, although this effect was minor and tended to be attenuated over the first year.

These Kampo formulae are widely prescribed in almost all medical disciplines, including psychiatry, in Japan; they have been used for various psychiatric disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. Kampo is a versatile traditional medicine with a variety of positive effects on mental states with relatively benign side effect profiles. Kampo formulae can be adjunctively combined with or substituted for the Western psychotropic drugs, which will provide more treatment options to patients with psychiatric conditions.\nThis review summarizes the current knowledge on Kampo for psychiatric conditions, highlighting a paucity of data and a need for further good-quality evidence on these medications."}, {"Title": "Modern molecular study of weight gain related to antidepressant treatment: clinical implications of the pharmacogenetic testing.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant medication influences cellular lipogenesis, being associated with metabolic side effects including weight gain. Due to the increasing use of antidepressants in children and adolescents, their metabolic and endocrine adverse effects are of particular concern, especially within this pediatric population that appears to be at greater risk. Genetic factors with a possible influence on antidepressant's adverse effects include CYP [cytochrome P450 (CYP450)] polymorphisms. We target to evaluate the efficacy of the pharmacogenetic testing, when prescribing antidepressants, in correlation with the occurrence of adverse events and weight gain. Our research was performed between the years 2010 and 2016, in the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Timisoara, Romania. We recruited 80 patients, children and adolescents with depressive disorders. Our study sample was divided in two groups: G1 - 40 patients took treatment after pharmacogenetic testing, and G2 - 40 patients without pharmacogenetic testing before the treatment election. Our results show statistically significant differences concerning the weight gain for groups G1 (with pharmacogenetic testing) and G2 (without pharmacogenetic testing). The CYP genotype and the pharmacogenetic testing, for choosing the personalized antidepressant therapy in children and adolescents with depressive disorders, proved to be good predictors for the response to antidepressants and the side effects registered, especially for weight gain. The significant correlations between the CYP polymorphisms for group G2 (without pharmacogenetic testing) and the weight gain/body mass index (BMI) increase, as major side effects induced by antidepressants, proved the fact that the pharmacogenetic screening is needed in the future clinical practice, allowing for individualized, tailored treatment, especially for at-risk pediatric categories."}, {"Title": "Bridging the Great Divide: What Can Neurology Learn From Psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Neurology and psychiatry share common historical origins and rely on similar tools to study brain disorders. Yet the practical integration of medical and scientific approaches across these clinical neurosciences remains elusive. Although much has been written about the need to incorporate emerging systems-level, cellular-molecular, and genetic-epigenetic advances into a science of mind for psychiatric disorders, less attention has been given to applying clinical neuroscience principles to conceptualize neurologic conditions with an integrated neurobio-psycho-social approach. In this perspective article, the authors briefly outline the historically interwoven and complicated relationship between neurology and psychiatry. Through a series of vignettes, the authors then illustrate how some traditional psychiatric conditions are being reconceptualized in part as disorders of neurodevelopment and awareness. They emphasize the intersection of neurology and psychiatry by highlighting conditions that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. The authors argue that the divide between neurology and psychiatry can be narrowed by moving from lesion-based toward circuit-based understandings of neuropsychiatric disorders, from unidirectional toward bidirectional models of brain-behavior relationships, from exclusive reliance on categorical diagnoses toward transdiagnostic dimensional perspectives, and from silo-based research and treatments toward interdisciplinary approaches. The time is ripe for neurologists and psychiatrists to implement an integrated clinical neuroscience approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders. The subspecialty of behavioral neurology & neuropsychiatry is poised to lead the next generation of clinicians to merge brain science with psychological and social-cultural factors. These efforts will catalyze translational research, revitalize training programs, and advance the development of impactful patient-centered treatments."}, {"Title": "The missing link between philosophy and psychopathology.", "Abstract": "The uncertainty regarding the scientific status of psychiatry arises from psychiatry's involvement with some unsolved problems, or put in another way, from its enmeshment in certain points of transition of contemporary science. There is, in primis, the unsolved problem of the relationship between the mind and the body and, moreo- ver, the intricate relationship of connection/disjunction among biology, social science, anthropology, philosophy, etc. To speak about what psychopathology can expect from philosophy is, above all, to immerse oneself in a debate about the conditions of possibility of psychiatry as a science. This debate is especially concerned with the models of knowledge that have, until now, been proposed to psychiatry. Those models oscillate between the Dilthey's paradigms of the \"Science of Nature\" and the \"Science of Spirit\".\nIt is certain that psychopathology, as already indicated by Jaspers, is a discipline which is among the most involved regard- ing the use of the two different cognitive strategies. The first strategy concerns the concept of \"explanation\" and its rigid approach to the objective and ultimate cause of the phenomenon. The second strategy is the \"comprehensive\" approach. This model, which the hermeneutic thought defines \"interpretative\", theorizes the provisional character, the subjectiveness and the finiteness of every cognitive project.\nThe interest of the authors is orientated towards the hermeneutic side (comprehensive-interpretative) of psychiatry, that which deals with the specificity of every clinical history, with the continuity of sense, and with intrinsic narrative intelligibility of every human event, psychopathological or not.\nThis approach to psychopathology is based on the statement: \"a clinical history is a text which must be interpreted\". From this perspective, every clinical history should be perceived as a text to decipher but, above all, as a \"text\" to listen to, in the persevering expectation that it could disclose its particular \"project of world\". When speaking about psychiatry, we always face a problem which dominates all the others: the unsolved problem of the relation- ship between typicalness and singularity of subjective events. B.B. Mandelbrot, theorist of \"fractals\", sums this dilemma up clearly. He suggests that the innumerable variety of the configurations of Nature is a challenge to investigate the morphology of that which is \"irregu- lar\" in order to discover in it, as far as possible, a rule."}, {"Title": "Culture and psychism: the ethnopsychoanalysis of Georges Devereux.", "Abstract": "This paper introduces the significant theoretical contribution of Georges Devereux (1908-85) on the relationship between culture and psychism, which he developed in his work at the interface of anthropology, psychoanalysis and quantum epistemology during the mid-twentieth century.

It is a major risk factor for all manifestations of coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Patients with acute coronary syndrome, who quit smoking, reduce their risk of cardiovascular events immediately and significantly when compared to those who continue smoking. The study was conducted to determine the frequency of smoking cessation after counselling in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nPatients of age 35-80 years of either gender presenting with Acute coronary syndrome presented in emergency within 12 hours of symptoms having history of smoking (>1pack year for >5 years) were included in the study. A total 225 patients were enrolled in the study from emergency of Punjab institute of cardiology, Lahore for the duration of six months. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Their demographic information was also noted. Then patients under went counselling session with researcher himself in presence of psychiatrist from Department of Psychiatry, Services hospital, Lahore. After admitting patients in ward, patients received standard in-hospital treatment for smoking cessation which consisted of an assessment of their smoking behaviour and a personalized brief quit advice. Then patients were followed-up for 12 weeks. On weekly visit, patients were counselled for smoking cessation. After 12 weeks, patients were assessed for cessation of smoking.\nSmoking cessation was seen in only 37 (16.4%) in ACS patients. Highest frequency of smoking cessation was seen in patients >65 years of age, i.e., 35.1%. Highest frequency for smoking cessation was seen in patients whose BMI was <30 (70.3%), patients with low socioeconomic status (45.9%) and patients with educational status as under matric (40.5%). None of these factors were significantly associated with smoking cessation in patients who presented with ACS.\nResults of this study demonstrate low frequency of smoking cessation among patients presenting with ACS.

All 41 patients participated in participant observations of individual or group treatment sessions, and 26 were interviewed about their experiences with using the app in treatment. The data material was generated and analyzed concurrently, applying the inductive methodology of Interpretive Description.\nThe patients' experiences with Recovery Record depended on its app features, the impact of these features on patients, and their specific app usage. This patient-app interaction affected and was affected by changeable contexts making patients' experiences dynamic. The patient-app interaction affected patients' placement of specific Recovery Record app features along a continuum from supportive to obstructive of individual everyday life activities including the eating disorder treatment. As an example, some patients found it supportive being notified by their clinician when their logs had been monitored as it gave them a sense of relatedness. Contrarily, other patients felt under surveillance, which was obstructive, as it made them feel uneasy or even dismissing the app.\nSome patients experienced the app and its features as mostly supportive of their everyday life and the eating disorder treatment, while others experienced it primarily as obstructive. When applying apps in eating disorder treatment, we therefore recommend that patients and clinicians collaborate to determine how the app in question best fits the capacities, preferences, and treatment needs of the individual patient. Thus, we encourage patients and clinicians to discuss how specific features of the applied app affect the individual patient to increase the use of supportive features, while limiting the use of obstructive ones."}, {"Title": "Epigenetic Programming by Early-Life Stress.", "Abstract": "Studies show that adverse conditions during early life can increase risks of developing mood disorders later in life.

Effect sizes were large in the offspring of the highest density pedigrees and were stronger in high-density DA than in high-density AUD pedigrees. Sensitivity to the pathogenic effects of membership in these high-risk sibships was substantially attenuated by high levels of school attainment and resilience, female sex, and absence of parental divorce. Offspring of pedigrees with a high density of AUD or DA are multiply disadvantaged and typically suffer from educational difficulties, social deprivation, socio-economic dysfunction, personality problems, and elevated rates of both psychiatric disorders and externalizing syndromes. Despite these difficulties, personal strengths, including improved school achievement and resilience, and an intact parental marriage can substantially buffer these adverse effects and might form a basis for prevention efforts."}, {"Title": "Open Notes in Swedish Psychiatric Care (Part 2): Survey Among Psychiatric Care Professionals.", "Abstract": "This is the second of two papers presenting the results from a study of the implementation of patient online access to their electronic health records (here referred to as Open Notes) in adult psychiatric care in Sweden. The study contributes an important understanding of both the expectations and concerns that existed among health care professionals before the introduction of the Open Notes Service in psychiatry and the perceived impact of the technology on their own work and patient behavior after the implementation. The results from the previously published baseline survey showed that psychiatric health care professionals generally thought that Open Notes would influence both the patients and their own practice negatively.\nThe objective of this study was to describe and discuss how health care professionals in adult psychiatric care in Region Sk\u00e5ne in southern Sweden experienced the influence of Open Notes on their patients and their own practice, and to compare the results with those of the baseline study.\nWe distributed a full population Web-based questionnaire to psychiatric care professionals in Region Sk\u00e5ne in the spring of 2017, which was one and a half years after the implementation of the service. The response rate was 27.73% (699/2521). Analyses showed that the respondents were representative of the staff as a whole. A statistical analysis examined the relationships between health professional groups and attitudes to the Open Notes Service.\nA total of 41.5% (285/687) of the health care professionals reported that none of their patients stated that they had read their Open Notes. Few health care professionals agreed with the statements about the potential benefits for patients from Open Notes. Slightly more of the health care professionals agreed with the statements about the potential risks. In addition, the results indicate that there was little impact on practice in terms of longer appointments or health care professionals having to address patients' questions outside of appointments. However, the results also indicate that changes had taken place in clinical documentation. Psychologists (39/63, 62%) and doctors (36/94, 38%) in particular stated that they were less candid in their documentation after the implementation of Open Notes. Nearly 40% of the health care professionals (239/650, 36.8%) reported that the Open Notes Service in psychiatry was a good idea.\nMost health care professionals who responded to the postimplementation survey did not experience that patients in adult psychiatric care had become more involved in their care after the implementation of Open Notes. The results also indicate that the clinical documentation had changed after the implementation of Open Notes. Finally, the results indicate that it is important to prepare health care professionals before an implementation of Open Notes, especially in medical areas where the service is considered sensitive."}, {"Title": "A patient perspective on recurrent or prolonged contact with psychiatric inpatient care for affective disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this qualitative study was to explore why some patients receive recurrent or prolonged psychiatric inpatient care, based on the experiences of the patients themselves.\nThe participants were recruited at an outpatient clinic at the department of psychiatry for patients with affective disorders at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. Ten patients, nine women and one man, aged 22-61\u00a0years, agreed to participate. A semi-structured interview guide was used during the interviews, which were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.\nThe four themes that emerged were <i>Difficulties in affective regulation</i>, where the informants reported difficulty in managing their emotions, with the possible consequence of admission to inpatient care; <i>Relational sensitivity</i>, concerning a sensitivity to relationships with healthcare professionals and a need for a secure therapeutic rapport; <i>Resignation,</i> characterized by passivity and depression; and <i>Ambivalence towards responsibility</i>, where ambivalence about their responsibility could lead to failure to initiate change.\nMore options beside inpatient care should be available in cases of an urgent need for help. A stable care structure, good cooperation, and long-term planning based on individual needs are pivotal. In the planning of psychiatric care, consideration must be given to the patient's relational sensitivity. By encouraging patients to actively seek help, we can counteract their resistance and achieve a more effective contact with psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Physical performance and physical activity of patients under compulsory forensic psychiatric inpatient care.", "Abstract": "Research stresses the importance of physical activity in general psychiatric care. There is very little research made in the area of forensic psychiatric care. The aim of this exploratory, cross-sectional study was to assess various physical, psychological, and health variables of patients under compulsory forensic psychiatric inpatient care, and to examine correlations among these variables. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>max), walking ability, running speed, and explosive leg strength were examined in 28 patients. Patients answered questionnaires about physical activity, aggression, stress, character maturity, and health-related quality of life (HRQL). The patients had a mean age of 33.6\u00a0years, a mean VO<sub>2</sub>max of 25.3 (8.4) mL 0<sub>2</sub>/min/kg and a mean physical activity level of 268.0 (272.4) min/week. Results from the 6-min walk test were 612.5 (102.8) m. Nine patients had physical activity levels below the international recommendations of 150\u00a0min/week. Levels of aggression and stress were high and HRQL was low.

This study investigates family treatment expectations and experiences of an FSG. Family members were interviewed before ( n = 20) and after ( n = 17) attending an FSG. Results show that family members hesitated or were curious about the FSG, expected to receive peer support and universality of problems, to receive information and advice and thought about the safety and respect of the group. Family members experienced the treatment as helpful because it was supportive, they gained new insights and they felt relieved and satisfied. Many family members see the guidance of the therapists and the differences in family and gender roles as an added value of attending an FSG. However, considering the limitations of the study, future studies should gain insight in and stress the importance of the meaning of therapeutic processes for family members confronted with different psychiatric disorders and/or situations."}, {"Title": "The mind electric: Challenges to clinical categories from a person-centred perspective and the possibilities of metaphysics and art for clinician, patient, and treatment.", "Abstract": "The paper proposes that frameworks typical to metaphysics and art could be used in clinical treatment in somatic and psychiatric contexts to ensure improved care. The concept of the \"body electric\" of somatic patients which I introduced in previous work is developed further and paired with the \"mind electric\" of psychiatric patients. Both are defined as a patient's personally generated metaphysical possibility of being healthy-within-illness which is experientially actualized. Both concepts are used here to explore the alternative and the serious challenges to treatment approaches focused on clinical categories, disease, provision, and promotion of standardized or \"black-box\" therapies. An argument against the idea implied by the hope for such mass treatments and corresponding overreliance on science, namely, that health comes from fixing and regularizing, is developed based on cultural history and the evidenced fact that personally assumed health, just like art and metaphysics, is transgressive of scientific data, and accommodates the untrue, the impossible or the irregular as actual and normal. Because normality is created only with the help of disorder and from within it for chronic patients, clinicians should offer them the metaphysical care they need to produce and actualize their possibility of irregular normality or their body/mind electric. Better treatments can only be provided when scientific advances will be matched with advances in the humanistic competence of clinicians."}, {"Title": "Building workforce capacity in Australia and New Zealand: a profile of psychiatrists with an interest in intellectual and developmental disability mental health.", "Abstract": "To describe the characteristics of psychiatrists working in the area of intellectual and developmental disability mental health (IDDMH) across Australia and New Zealand.\nA secondary analysis of data collected by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2014 workforce survey.

We report the case of an 80-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with PTSD after the 2011 triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear plant accident) in Fukushima. Her recovery was greatly enhanced by the social support she received while living in Idobata-Nagaya community housing, established by Soma city in Fukushima, where residents could naturally discuss their traumatic experiences. Habituation to traumatic memories and processing of cognitive aspects of the psychological trauma, which are therapeutic mechanisms of trauma-focused psychotherapies, spontaneously occurred in this setting.

When Canada ratified the CRPD, it reserved the right to continue using substitute decision making schemes even if the CRPD was 'interpreted as requiring their elimination'. This was a prescient decision because the CRPD Committee, which is tasked with overseeing the interpretation and implementation of the CRPD, subsequently opined that all legislation supporting substitute decision making schemes contravene the CRPD and must be revoked. The CRPD Committee insists that every person can make decisions with sufficient support and that if a person lacks capacity to make a decision, we must rely on their 'will and preferences'. Many international legal scholars have called this interpretation unrealistic.

These limitations led to the development of multimodal neuroimaging (MN), which combines data obtained from multiple neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and yields more detailed information about brain dynamics. There are several types of MN, including visual inspection, data integration, and data fusion. This literature review aimed to provide a brief summary and basic information about MN techniques (data fusion approaches in particular) and classification approaches. Data fusion approaches are generally categorized as asymmetric and symmetric. The present review focused exclusively on studies based on symmetric data fusion methods (data-driven methods), such as independent component analysis and principal component analysis. Machine learning techniques have recently been introduced for use in identifying diseases and biomarkers of disease. The machine learning technique most widely used by neuroscientists is classification-especially support vector machine classification. Several studies differentiated patients with psychiatric diseases and healthy controls with using combined datasets. The common conclusion among these studies is that the prediction of diseases increases when combining data via MN techniques; however, there remain a few challenges associated with MN, such as sample size. Perhaps in the future N-way fusion can be used to combine multiple neuroimaging techniques or nonimaging predictors (eg, cognitive ability) to overcome the limitations of MN."}, {"Title": "The optimistic brain: Trait optimism mediates the influence of resting-state brain activity and connectivity on anxiety in late adolescence.", "Abstract": "As a hot research topic in the field of psychology and psychiatry, trait optimism reflects the tendency to expect positive outcomes in the future. Consistent evidence has demonstrated the role of trait optimism in reducing anxiety among different populations. However, less is known about the neural bases of trait optimism and the underlying mechanisms for how trait optimism protects against anxiety in the healthy brain. In this investigation, we examined these issues in 231 healthy adolescent students by assessing resting-state brain activity (i.e., fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and connectivity (i.e., resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC). Whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of trait optimism were linked with decreased fALFF in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and increased RSFC between the right OFC and left supplementary motor cortex (SMC). Mediation analyses further showed that trait optimism mediated the influence of the right OFC activity and the OFC-SMC connectivity on anxiety. Our results remained significant even after excluding the impact of head motion, positive and negative affect and depression. Taken together, this study reveals that fALFF and RSFC are functional neural markers of trait optimism and provides a brain-personality-symptom pathway for protection against anxiety in which fALFF and RSFC affect anxiety through trait optimism."}, {"Title": "A population study of Norwegian psychiatric patients referred for clinical brain scanning.", "Abstract": "Patients with psychiatric conditions are often referred for a brain scan during the course of their diagnostic workup.\nThe aim of our study is to determine frequency and type of organic brain pathology, the relationship to age, gender and psychiatric diagnosis.\nWe investigated magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography brain scans from consecutively referred patients over a 10-year period (January 2002-December 2011).

The authors compared individually delivered mantram repetition therapy and another non-trauma-focused treatment for PTSD.\nThe study was a two-site, open-allocation, blinded-assessment randomized trial involving 173 veterans diagnosed with military-related PTSD from two Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics (January 2012 to March 2014). The mantram group (N=89) learned skills for silent mantram repetition, slowing thoughts, and one-pointed attention. The comparison group (N=84) received present-centered therapy, focusing on currently stressful events and problem-solving skills. Both treatments were delivered individually in eight weekly 1-hour sessions. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and by self-report. Secondary outcome measures included insomnia, depression, anger, spiritual well-being, mindfulness, and quality of life. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted using linear mixed models.\nThe mantram group had significantly greater improvements in CAPS score than the present-centered therapy group, both at the posttreatment assessment (between-group difference across time, -9.98, 95% CI=-3.63, -16.00; d=0.49) and at the 2-month follow-up (between-group difference, -9.34, 95% CI=-1.50, -17.18; d=0.46). Self-reported PTSD symptom severity was also lower in the mantram group compared with the present-centered therapy group at the posttreatment assessment, but there was no difference at the 2-month follow-up.

Hence, maintaining the acetyl-histone homeostasis as a component of neuronal mechanisms by targeting HDACs has emerged as an exciting intervention strategy for several neuropsychiatric disorders. Though extensive preclinical animal studies have elevated the translational potential of HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) in psychiatric disorders, so far, the translational gain remains low. This is perhaps attributed to the anticipated specificity issues and off-target effects which might negate the risk-reward advantage over the approved antipsychotics in use. So, to harness the therapeutic potential of HDACis in psychiatric disorders, a combination therapeutic strategy involving co-administration of an approved HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) along with a marketed antipsychotic drug has emerged in parallel. This takes advantage of the ability of HDACi, like SAHA, to reverse the potentially detrimental hypoacetylated state of chromatin and facilitate to augment the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. Apart from these efforts, as an alternative therapeutic strategy, highly tolerable oral metabolic acetate supplements with an ability to reverse the hypoacetylation states of histone were initiated in animal models. Exogenous acetate carrier enriches the cellular acetyl-CoA pool restoring acetyl-histone homeostasis, reminiscent of HDACi effect, without the associated toxicity. Though the path towards therapeutic intervention in psychiatric disorders using histone acetylation modulators is riddled with challenges, the growing number of tool compounds along with innovative research strategies, however, bodes well for the future."}, {"Title": "Frontal meningioma with psychiatric symptoms.", "Abstract": "Frontal meningioma is often asymptomatic and patient may present with psychiatric symptoms.

Recently, there has been an increased interest in this subject. This study aimed to determine the impact of antiepileptic agents on ECT process in the event of continued use in the course of the therapy.\nFrom among the patients on an ECT therapy in the Psychiatry Clinic of Hacettepe University Hospital since 2010, a total of 39 patients who continued to use the antiepileptic agent they were taking prior to the ECT therapy were determined and included in the study. As for the control group, on the list of ECT patients, the 39 patients coming immediately after the patients using antiepileptics were taken up in the study. The patients using antiepileptics were compared with the control subjects on the basis of their sociodemographic characteristics, number of active sessions, energy levels of the past seizures, seizure durations, some clinical outcomes, and characteristics of the first and the last seizures.\nThere were no differences between the control subjects and those using the antiepileptics in terms of average age, body mass index, Clinical Global Impression scores, and sex distribution. Energy levels required to induce the first and the last seizures and total amounts of energy used in active seizures were significantly higher in patients taking the antiepileptics than the control group. Besides, the durations of the first peripheral and central seizures were significantly less in patients using the antiepileptics as compared with the control subjects. When sociodemographic variables and numeric data about the seizures were brought into the equation in the binary logistic regression analysis for determination of being included in either the group of patients taking antiepileptics or the control group, the only meaningful variable was found to be \"duration of the first central seizure.\"\nContinued use of the antiepileptics during ECT by the patients to undergo ECT may lead to an increased dose of energy to be used during the therapy. When all variables are taken into consideration, it was determined that the use of antiepileptic significantly shortened purely the duration of the first seizure. In the light of the present results, it does not seem meaningful to suggest as a conclusive requirement to discontinue the antiepileptics used before ECT prior to the commencement thereof."}, {"Title": "Italian Guidelines for the treatment of alcohol dependence.", "Abstract": "The European Union is the heaviest-drinking region in the world, with the highest proportion of total diseases and premature deaths due to alcohol.

Developed in collaboration with many experts and esteemed scientific societies such as the Referral Center for Alcoholism of the Lazio Region (CRARL), the Italian Society of Drug Addiction (SITD), the Italian Society for the Treatment of Alcoholism and its Complications (SITAC), the Italian Society of Psychiatry and Dependence (SIPDip) the Italian Society of Dependency Diseases (SIPaD) and the Institute of Cell Biology and Neurobiology of the National Research Council (IBCN-CNR), these Guidelines provide to the operators evidenced-based statements aimed at increasing the knowledge and the appropriate use of medications for people affected by AUD. With the possibility of a dynamic updating, the overall goal of these Guidelines will be to guarantee the homogeneity of treatments and a qualitative improvement in the assistance of patients with AUD, thus reducing the significant psychosocial and public health consequences related to this important psychiatric condition."}, {"Title": "Texting as a Means of Reducing Pediatric Adolescent Psychiatric Emergency Encounters Wait Times.", "Abstract": "There is no universal system to facilitate communication between emergency rooms (ERs) and pediatric mental health providers, which leads to long wait times. This project tested the concept that a group texting application (GroupMe) could improve communication between providers and could reduce wait times by allowing frontline workers to contact multiple providers simultaneously.\nWe compared total wait times or overall length of service of 906 ER encounters before and 921 encounters after the GroupMe texting application was implemented. To reduce differences between preintervention and postintervention time points, we utilized propensity score matching to generate a matched group of controls (total sample n = 831 ER encounters before and n = 831 ER encounters after).\nAlthough there were no differences in total wait times when using the GroupMe application, there was a significant decrease in wait times after patients were diagnosed in ER by psychiatric provider both before (mean difference, 96.4 minutes saved; t = 2.23; P < 0.05) and after propensity score matching (mean difference, 88.0 minutes saved; t = 2.48; P < 0.05) for disposition type and acuity level.\nUse of a group texting application has the potential to improve communication and wait times. However, its ability to reduce overall wait times is hampered when the limited availability of pediatric psychiatry providers results in delays in diagnosis and treatment decisions."}, {"Title": "[Sport as applied therapy in patients with schizophrenic psychoses].", "Abstract": "Sport as applied therapy in patients with schizophrenic psychoses Abstract. Schizophrenic psychoses are serious mental illnesses associated with low life expectancy compared with healthy individuals and other psychiatric disorders. Overweight and associated health problems such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and smoking-associated lung disease have been shown to be risk factors related to high mortality. Low physical activity and increased sedentary behavior have been identified as the most important behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in people with schizophrenia. Numerous research results show a positive influence of sport on mental symptoms as well as on physical health. In the studies, however, different types of guided movement with divergent intensity were used in group or single setting. The Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik und Nervenheilkunde [German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics] recommends sports and physical exercise interventions for patients with severe mental illnesses. Still, further large randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the nature, extent and duration, as well as the effect of the methods used in the various stages of the disease. One goal should be the evidence-based implementation of specific and systematic sport and movement interventions as a complementary module in addition to psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment in people with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in criminal trials and the role of psychiatrists expert witnesses: A case study.", "Abstract": "Various neuroscientific techniques are increasingly being used in criminal courts causing a vivid debate on the way that this kind of techniques will and should be used as scientific evidence. The role of experts in this context is important, since it is them that analyse, present, interpret and communicate the results of these techniques to the judges and the jury. In an attempt to contribute to the discussion about the role of the experts in criminal cases where neuroimaging evidence was introduced, we examined twenty seven cases from the US and Europe. Focusing on the role of experts and their presentation of neuroscientific evidence, we aimed to examine the extent to which neuroimaging data can contribute to the construction of a solid and more objective, \"scientifically - based\" case. We found that neurobiological information introduced through experts' testimony is generally used in order to demonstrate some physical, organic base of a psychiatric condition, or/and in order to make visible some brain lesion, (structural or functional), susceptible to have affected the capacity to reason and to control one's impulses. While neuroimaging evidence is often presented by the defence as a scientific method able to offer a precise diagnosis of the pathology in question, our case analysis shows that the very same neurobiological evidence can be interpreted in different - sometimes diametrically opposed - ways by defence and State experts. Conflicting testimony about the same empirical evidence goes against the hypothesis of neuroscientific techniques constituting \"objective and hard evidence\", able to reach solid, scientific and objective conclusions. Frequent conflicts between neuroimaging experts require the courts to deal with the resulting uncertainty. As the law changes with technology, it is necessary for legal professionals to train and be prepared for the new issues they may encounter in light of new developments in neuroscience, so that they become more vigilant as to the interpretation of neuroscientific data."}, {"Title": "[Sharing to improve our way of working].", "Abstract": "Inter-day hospital supervisions in child psychiatry, through clinical and case studies, give caregivers a chance to review and reflect on their practices as well as training and tools.

The disenfranchisement from public institutions and services is further compounded by cultural stigma and gender inequality creating emotional, psychosocial, health, and educational problems in the lives of vulnerable pregnant adolescents (Int J Adolesc Med Health 15(4):321-9, 2003; BMC Public Health 8:83, 2008). In this paper we have applied an engagement interview framework to examine interpersonal, practical, and cultural challenges faced by pregnant adolescents.\nUsing a qualitative study design, 12 pregnant adolescents (ages 15-19) visiting a health facility's antenatal services in Nairobi were interviewed. All recruited adolescents were pregnant for the first time and screened positive on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) with 16% of 176 participants interviewed in a descriptive survey in the same Kangemi primary health facility found to be severely depressed (Osok et al., Depression and its psychosocial risk factors in pregnant Kenyan adolescents: a cross-sectional study in a community health Centre of Nairobi, BMC Psychiatry, 2018 18:136 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1706-y). An engagement interview approach (Social Work 52(4):295-308, 2007) was applied to elicit various practical, psychological, interpersonal, and cultural barriers to life adjustment, service access, obtaining resources, and psychosocial support related to pregnancy. Grounded theory method was applied for qualitative data sifting and analysis (Strauss and Corbin, Basics of qualitative research, 1990).\nFindings revealed that pregnant adolescents face four major areas of challenges, including depression, anxiety and stress around the pregnancy, denial of the pregnancy, lack of basic needs provisions and care, and restricted educational or livelihood opportunities for personal development post pregnancy. These challenges were related both to existing social and cultural values/norms on gender and traditional family structure, as well as to service structural barriers (including prenatal care, mental health care, newborn care, parenting support services). More importantly, dealing with these challenges has led to negative mental health consequences in adolescent pregnant girls, including feeling insecure about the future, feeling very defeated and sad to be pregnant, and feeling unsupported and disempowered in providing care for the baby.\nFindings have implications for service planning, including developing more integrated mental health services for pregnant adolescents. Additionally, we felt a need for developing reproductive education and information dissemination strategies to improve community members' knowledge of pregnant adolescent mental health issues."}, {"Title": "Australian standards of care and treatment guidelines for transgender and gender diverse children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "The Australian standards of care and treatment guidelines aim to maximise quality care provision to transgender and gender diverse (TGD) children and adolescents across Australia, while recognising the unique circumstances of providing such care to this population. Recommendations are made based on available empirical evidence and clinician consensus, and have been developed in consultation with Australian professionals from multiple disciplines working with the TGD population, TGD support organisations, as well as TGD children and adolescents and their families. Main recommendations: Recommendations include general principles for supporting TGD children and adolescents using an affirmative approach, separate guidelines for the care of pre-pubertal children and TGD adolescents, as well as discipline-based recommendations for mental health care, medical and surgical interventions, fertility preservation, and speech therapy. Changes in management as a result of this statement: Although published international treatment guidelines currently exist, challenges in accessing and providing TGD health care specific to Australia have not been addressed to date. In response to this, these are the first guidelines to be developed for TGD children and adolescents in Australia. These guidelines also move away from treatment recommendations based on chronological age, with recommended timing of medical transition and surgical interventions dependent on the adolescent's capacity and competence to make informed decisions, duration of time on puberty suppression, coexisting mental health and medical issues, and existing family support."}, {"Title": "Branched-chain amino acids are associated with metabolic parameters in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> An important aspect of bipolar disorder (BD) research is the identification of biomarkers pertaining to the somatic health state.

Furthermore, correlations were found between BCAAs and anthropometric and glucose metabolism data. All BCAAs correlated with lipid metabolism parameters in females. There were no associations between BCAAs and long-term clinical parameters of BD. A negative correlation was found between valine and Hamilton Depression-Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory II, in male individuals<b>Conclusions:</b> Our results indicate the utility of BCAAs as biomarkers for the current state of health, also in BD. As BD individuals have a high risk for overweight/obesity, in association with comorbid medical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular diseases or insulin resistance), health state markers are urgently required.

Neuroleptic use can have significant and lasting adverse neurologic, metabolic, and cardiovascular effects. In the current literature, neuroleptic prescribing and monitoring is described in outpatient settings, with little description of inpatient pediatric practice. In this study, we are the first to explore prescribing and monitoring in inpatient pediatrics, highlighting similarities and differences in practice between pediatric medicine and psychiatry.\nThis retrospective study included patients <18 years of age who received a neuroleptic during inpatient hospitalization between September 2014 and March 2015, within either the pediatric inpatient medical or psychiatric setting. Data collected included sex, age, race, height, weight, length of stay, service providing care, details involving the neuroleptic(s) administered, comorbidities, lipid and glycemic monitoring, and results, monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, and mental health consultation.\nFactors associated with improved neuroleptic monitoring included longer length of stay and evidence of an adverse drug effect. Clearly specified indication for use was associated with improved neuroleptic monitoring. Although neuroleptic initiation during admission had improved indication documentation and monitoring practices compared with initiation before admission, a significant gap exists between inpatient psychiatry and medical settings in adverse drug effect monitoring, particularly extrapyramidal symptom monitoring and lipid collection.\nIn our study, we describe current practice in the use and monitoring of neuroleptics in inpatient pediatric medical and psychiatric settings.

Six EBPIs (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis; Family Psycho-Education (FPE); Relapse Prevention Planning (RPP); Skills Training; Supported Employment; and Assertive Community Treatment) were chosen, based on the strength and consistency of CPG recommendations.

There is patchy evidence for targeting of EBPIs to those who might benefit most. Service characteristics contribute more to the prediction of receipt than clinical characteristics.

Further, when the authors looked at patients treated aggressively with antiherpetic medications at the time, the relative risk of SD was reduced by a factor of 10. It should be stressed that no investigations were made on subjects already suffering from SD, and that those treated were the few rare cases severely affected by HSV.

Clinical variables and the utilization of specialists were assessed via medical records and face-to-face interviews. The factors associated with the utilization of specialists were assessed using multivariate linear regression and included age, sex, relationship status, cognitive impairment, depression, activities of daily living, and formal diagnosis of dementia.\nOur results show that 89 out of 485 study participants (18.4%) were referred to specialists 12 months prior to assessment. Of these 89 individuals, 14.6% (n = 13) did not receive imaging diagnostics, while 39.3% (n = 35) received brain imaging by CT scan and 46.1% (n = 41) by MRI.

Expert opinion: Ketamine may inhibit CYP gene expression through inhibiting calcium signaling, decreasing ATP levels, producing excessive reactive oxygen species, and subsequently perturbing cytoskeletal dynamics. Further research is still needed to avoid possible ketamine-drug interactions during long-term use in the clinic."}, {"Title": "Adapting Word Embeddings from Multiple Domains to Symptom Recognition from Psychiatric Notes.", "Abstract": "Mental health is increasingly recognized an important topic in healthcare. Information concerning psychiatric symptoms is critical for the timely diagnosis of mental disorders, as well as for the personalization of interventions. However, the diversity and sparsity of psychiatric symptoms make it challenging for conventional natural language processing techniques to automatically extract such information from clinical text. To address this problem, this study takes the initiative to use and adapt word embeddings from four source domains - intensive care, biomedical literature, Wikipedia and Psychiatric Forum - to recognize symptoms in the target domain of psychiatry. We investigated four different approaches including 1) only using word embeddings of the source domain, 2) directly combining data of the source and target to generate word embeddings, 3) assigning different weights to word embeddings, and 4) retraining the word embedding model of the source domain using a corpus of the target domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of adapting multiple word embeddings of external domains to improve psychiatric symptom recognition in clinical text. Experimental results showed that the last two approaches outperformed the baseline methods, indicating the effectiveness of our new strategies to leverage embeddings from other domains."}, {"Title": "The biopolitics of CFS/ME.", "Abstract": "This paper argues that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) constitutes a biopolitical problem, a scientific object which needs to be studied, classified and regulated. Assemblages of authorities, knowledges and techniques make CFS/ME subjects and shape their everyday conduct in an attempt to increase their supposed autonomy, wellbeing and health. CFS and CFS/ME identities are however made not only through government, scientific, and medical interventions but also by the patients themselves, a biosocial community who collaborates with scientists, educates itself about the intricacies of biomedicine, and contests psychiatric truth claims. CFS/ME is an illness trapped between medicine and psychology, an illness that is open to debate and therefore difficult to manage and standardise. The paper delineates different interventions by medicine, science, the state and the patients themselves and concludes that CFS/ME remains elusive, only partially standardised, in an on-going battle between all the different actors that want to define it for their own situated interests."}, {"Title": "Diagnosing the Kaiser: Psychiatry, Wilhelm II and the Question of German War Guilt The William Bynum Prize Essay 2016.", "Abstract": "After his abdication in November 1918, the German emperor Wilhelm II continued to haunt the minds of his people. With the abolition of the lese-majesty laws in the new republic, many topics that were only discussed privately or obliquely before could now be broached openly. One of these topics was the mental state of the exiled Kaiser. Numerous psychiatrists, physicians and laypeople published their diagnoses of Wilhelm in high-circulation newspaper articles, pamphlets, and books shortly after the end of the war. Whether these diagnoses were accurate and whether the Kaiser really was mentally ill became the issue of a heated debate.This article situates these diagnoses of Wilhelm II in their political context. The authors of these diagnoses - none of whom had met or examined Wilhelm II in person - came from all political camps and they wrote with very different motives in mind. Diagnosing the exiled Kaiser as mentally ill was a kind of exorcism of the Hohenzollern rule, opening the way for either a socialist republic or the hoped-for rule of a new leader. But more importantly, it was a way to discuss and allocate political responsibility and culpability. Psychiatric diagnoses were used to exonerate both the Emperor (for whom the treaty of Versailles provided a tribunal as war criminal) and the German nation. They were also used to blame the Kaiser's entourage and groups that had allegedly manipulated the weak-willed monarch. Medical concepts became a vehicle for a debate on the key political questions in interwar Germany."}, {"Title": "Aripiprazole once-monthly as maintenance treatment for bipolar I disorder: a 52-week, multicenter, open-label study.", "Abstract": "The long-acting injectable antipsychotic aripiprazole once-monthly 400\u00a0mg (AOM 400) was recently approved for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (BP-I). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AOM 400 as long-term maintenance treatment for BP-I.\nThis open-label multicenter study evaluated the effectiveness of AOM 400 as maintenance treatment for BP-I by assessing safety and tolerability (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective). The study enrolled AOM 400-naive (\"de novo\") patients as well as AOM 400-experienced (\"rollover\") patients with BP-I from a lead-in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that demonstrated the efficacy of AOM 400 in the maintenance treatment of BP-I (Calabrese et al. in J Clin Psychiatry 78:324-331, 2017). Safety variables included frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and TEAEs resulting in study discontinuation. Efficacy was assessed by the proportion of patients maintaining stability throughout the maintenance phase, as well as mean changes from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impressions for Bipolar Disorder-Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-BP-S) total scores. Patient acceptability and tolerability of treatment was assessed using the Patient Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire-Modified.\nOf 464 patients entering the maintenance phase, 379 (82%) were de novo and 85 (18%) were rollover. TEAEs were more common in de novo than rollover patients. The overall discontinuation rate due to TEAEs was 10.3% (48/464). Improvements in YMRS and CGI-BP-S total scores were maintained during the study, and the vast majority of both de novo (87.0%) and rollover (97.6%) patients maintained stability through their last visit. Overall, the need for rescue medication during the maintenance phase was minimal (<\u200910% of patients). Patient satisfaction levels were high, with both de novo and rollover patients rating the side effect burden of AOM 400 as greatly improved relative to previous medications.\nAOM 400 was safe, effective, and well tolerated by both de novo and AOM 400-experienced patients with BP-I for long-term maintenance treatment.

We aimed to provide the true population prevalence of 22q11.2 CNVs and associated trajectory of disease risk and mortality by use of the unbiased, representative Danish iPSYCH population case cohort.\nThis case-cohort study was done on a population of 86\u2008189 individuals selected from the iPSYCH case cohort of 1\u2008472\u2008762 singletons born in Denmark between May 1, 1981, and Dec 31, 2005, who have a known mother from the Danish Civil Registration System, were residents in Denmark at 1 year of age, and enrolled in the iPSYCH Initiative. We used epidemiological methods in conjunction with nationwide hospital registers to analyse the iPSYCH case cohort of individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, or bipolar disorder and a random population-based sample. The main outcomes assessed were the population prevalence of 22q11.2 rearrangements, and associated unbiased, population-adjusted estimates and 31-year disease risk trajectories for major neuropsychiatric disorders.\nPopulation prevalence in the Danish population was one in 3672 (seven of 25\u2008704 [0\u00b7027%; 95% CI 0\u00b7012-0\u00b7057]) for deletions and one in 1606 (17 of 25\u2008704 [0\u00b7066%; 0\u00b7040-0\u00b7107]) for duplications. Mortality after the age of 1 year among carriers was zero, and hazard ratios for neuropsychiatric disorders ranged from 2\u00b760 to 82\u00b744 for both rearrangements. By the age of 32 years, about 10% of individuals with deletions or duplications had developed ADHD, autism, or intellectual disability, and deletion carriers had higher probability than duplication carriers of co-occurring intellectual disability or epilepsy.\nThe significantly different prevalence of 22q11.2 duplications and deletions indicates distinct selective pressures on these rearrangements. Although risk of congenital abnormalities, developmental delay, and intellectual disability is elevated in deletion carriers, the overall prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders is higher in duplication carriers, which implies that identification and clinical monitoring should extend beyond congenital traits and into child and adolescent psychiatry.\nCapital Region's Research Foundation for Mental Health Research, The Lundbeck Foundation, and US National Institutes of Health."}, {"Title": "Mapping risk factors for depression across the lifespan: An umbrella review of evidence from meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies.", "Abstract": "The development of depression may involve a complex interplay of environmental and genetic risk factors. PubMed and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception through August 3, 2017, to identify meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies of environmental risk factors associated with depression. For each eligible meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size and its 95% confidence interval (CI) by random-effects modeling, the 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity with I<sup>2</sup>, and evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. Seventy meta-analytic reviews met the eligibility criteria and provided 134 meta-analyses for associations from 1283 primary studies. While 109 associations were nominally significant (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), only 8 met the criteria for convincing evidence and, when limited to prospective studies, convincing evidence was found in 6 (widowhood, physical abuse during childhood, obesity, having 4-5 metabolic risk factors, sexual dysfunction, job strain). In studies in which depression was assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, only associations with widowhood, job strain, and being a Gulf War veteran were supported by convincing evidence. Additionally, 8\u202fMR studies were included and provided no consistent evidence for the causal effects of obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The proportion of variance explained by genetic risk factors was extremely small (0.1-0.4%), which limited the evidence provided by the MR studies. Our findings suggest that despite the large number of putative risk factors investigated in the literature, few associations were supported by robust evidence. The current findings may have clinical and research implications for the early identification of individuals at risk for depression."}, {"Title": "Making psychiatric semiology great again: A semiologic, not nosologic challenge.", "Abstract": "This article analyzes whether psychiatric disorders can be considered different from non-psychiatric disorders on a nosologic or semiologic point of view. The supposed difference between psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders relates to the fact that the individuation of psychiatric disorders seems more complex than for non-psychiatric disorders. This individuation process can be related to nosologic and semiologic considerations. The first part of the article analyzes whether the ways of constructing classifications of psychiatric disorders are different than for non-psychiatric disorders. The ways of establishing the boundaries between the normal and the pathologic, and of classifying the signs and symptoms in different categories of disorder, are analyzed. Rather than highlighting the specificity of psychiatric disorders, nosologic investigation reveals conceptual notions that apply to the entire field of medicine when we seek to establish the boundaries between the normal and the pathologic and between different disorders. Psychiatry is thus very important in medicine because it exemplifies the inherent problem of the construction of cognitive schemes imposed on clinical and scientific medical information to delineate a classification of disorders and increase its comprehensibility and utility. The second part of this article assesses whether the clinical manifestations of psychiatric disorders (semiology) are specific to the point that they are entities that are different from non-psychiatric disorders. The attribution of clinical manifestations in the different classifications (Research Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic Statistic Manual, Research Domain Criteria) is analyzed. Then the two principal models on signs and symptoms, i.e. the latent variable model and the causal network model, are assessed. Unlike nosologic investigation, semiologic analysis is able to reveal specific psychiatric features in a patient. The challenge, therefore, is to better define and classify signs and symptoms in psychiatry based on a dual and mutually interactive biological and psychological perspective, and to incorporate semiologic psychiatry into an integrative, multilevel and multisystem brain and cognitive approach."}, {"Title": "Increased risk of depression in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus: a Danish nationwide cohort study.", "Abstract": "There is a wide range in the reported prevalences of depression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while the prevalence of depression in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) remains severely understudied.\nTo examine whether patients with SLE or CLE have an increased risk of depression.\nIn this nationwide observational cohort study, we included patients aged \u2265 18 years with a first-time diagnosis of SLE or CLE between 2000 and 2015 identified in the Danish National Patient Register, which were matched with the general population in a ratio of 1 : 10.

These signaling pathways can perturb neuronal structure, chemistry, and function, leading to discrete changes in behavior. They are also increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. The importance of these humoral signaling pathways is perhaps most powerfully illustrated in the context of infection and inflammation. Here we provide an overview of how interaction of immune activation of neural and humoral interoceptive mechanisms mediates discrete changes in brain and behavior and highlight how activation of these pathways at specific points in neural development may predispose to psychiatric disorder. As our mechanistic understanding of these interoceptive pathways continues to emerge, it is revealing novel therapeutic targets, potentially heralding an exciting new era of immunotherapies in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Interoception and Mental Health: A Roadmap.", "Abstract": "Interoception refers to the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates signals originating from within the body, providing a moment-by-moment mapping of the body's internal landscape across conscious and unconscious levels.

Nurses from inpatient psychiatric services in the German-speaking part of Switzerland completed a questionnaire based on a concept analysis of PSO.\n538 questionnaires were analysed. PSO was more often conducted intermittent than as constant observation. In more than one out of four cases, suicidality reasoned as a cause for prescription. Nurses generally used standardized instruments to assess the risk of harming oneself or others. The duration of PSO lasted eight hours or more in three out of four cases. In every fifth case, there was no validation of the need of the intervention taking place during one shift. Nurses have a neutral attitude towards the intervention and are experiencing no or weak negative feelings during performance of PSO.\nThe results suggest that there is an inconsistent performance of PSO in Switzerland as well as in other countries.

Often, people with SMI are not well engaged in primary care treatment and do not receive high-value preventative and medical services. There have been numerous efforts to improve this care, and few controlled trials, with inconsistent results. While people with SMI often do poorly with usual primary care arrangements, research suggests that integrated care and medical care management may improve treatment and outcomes, and reduce treatment costs.\nThis hybrid implementation-effectiveness study is a prospective, cluster controlled trial of a medical home, the SMI Patient-Aligned Care Team (SMI PACT), to improve the healthcare of patients with SMI enrolled with the Veterans Health Administration. The SMI PACT team includes proactive medical nurse care management, and integrated mental health treatment through regular psychiatry consultation and a collaborative care model. Patients are recruited to receive primary care through SMI PACT based on having a serious mental illness that is manageable with treatment, and elevated risk for hospitalization or death. In a site-level prospective controlled trial, this project studies the effect, relative to usual care, of SMI PACT on provision of appropriate preventive and medical treatments, health-related quality of life, satisfaction with care, and medical and mental health treatment utilization and costs.

JASP is a recently developed open-source statistical package that facilitates both Bayesian and NHST analysis using a graphical interface. This article provides an applied introduction to Bayesian inference with Bayes factors using JASP.\nWe use JASP to compare and contrast Bayesian alternatives for several common classical null hypothesis significance tests: correlations, frequency distributions, t-tests, ANCOVAs, and ANOVAs. These examples are also used to illustrate the strengths and limitations of both NHST and Bayesian hypothesis testing.\nA comparison of NHST and Bayesian inferential frameworks demonstrates that Bayes factors can complement p-values by providing additional information for hypothesis testing. Namely, Bayes factors can quantify relative evidence for both alternative and null hypotheses. Moreover, the magnitude of this evidence can be presented as an easy-to-interpret odds ratio.\nWhile Bayesian analysis is by no means a new method, this type of statistical inference has been largely inaccessible for most psychiatry researchers.

The final adjusted polypharmacy model showed that antipsychotic polypharmacy decreased among young adults and adults ages 40 or older compared with beneficiaries ages 30-39 (\u03b2=-.02, p=.04, and \u03b2=-.02, p=.007, respectively). The raw proportion of beneficiaries on high- and low-risk agents did not change, although final adjusted models demonstrated changes in use of high- and low-risk agents by diagnosis and risk group.\nPolypharmacy decreased among young and older adults after academic detailing with audit and feedback.

The objective of this study is to explore the influence of the most commonly used antipsychotics in this population (Olanzapine and Risperidone) on physical activity and the physical fitness of people with severe mental illness. Sixty-two people between 26 and 61 years of age with severe mental illness were assessed. All participants were evaluated with a battery of 11 physical tests to assess their physical fitness and with the IPAQ-short version questionnaire to determine their level of physical activity. The doses of Risperidone and Olanzapine were also evaluated in all participants. Significant differences were found for physical activity, with higher levels reported in those patients with severe mental illness who did not take any of these medications. Regarding physical fitness, significant differences were only found for the consumption of Risperidone, with better physical fitness levels seen in patients who did not consume this medication; on the other hand, for the consumption of Olanzapine, differences were found in muscular strength, balance and aerobic condition with better values in non-Olanzapine consumers compared with Olanzapine consumers."}, {"Title": "[Addiction-related clinical practice in hospital setting\u2009: from specialization to responsibilization].", "Abstract": "Over the past two years, the Swiss Institute for Postgraduate and Further Education in Medicine has implemented a new certification in addiction medicine and an in-depth training in addiction psychiatry and psychotherapy.

Indeed, anxiety and depression are common comorbidities in epilepsy, and patients with psychiatric disease are at risk of epilepsy. Some antiepileptic drugs (AED) have psychiatric side effects; conversely, some AED could be used to treat psychiatric pathologies. Based on current literature data, the aim of this study is to determine the psychiatric effects induced by the most frequently prescribed AED in epileptic adults. Some AED will have positive mood or anxiolytic effects like sodium channel blockers, valproate and benzodiazepines; conversely, others might induce negative psychiatric effect, especially depression, anxiety or aggression, like levetiracetam, perampanel, topiramate, zonisamide, and barbiturates. The main risk factor for presenting these side effects is a personal history of psychiatric pathology. We therefore recommend monitoring the occurrence of psychiatric side effects, especially when using the most at risk AED and/or in case of psychiatric history. Moreover, in this latter case, it is preferable to use AED with positive psychiatric effects. The use of anxiety and depression scales could be useful detection tools."}, {"Title": "[The Indian Ayurveda medicine-a meaningful supplement to psychiatric treatment?].", "Abstract": "Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine that is more than 3000 years old, consisting mostly of a\u00a0specific diet, oily infusions mainly in the area of the head, enemas, medicinal plants and yoga. It is based on a\u00a0naturopathic and anthropological belief in association with the hinduistic religion. Ayurveda has been practiced very successfully in India but so far it has only been insufficiently appreciated by western medicine, especially psychiatry. An exception is Scharfetter from Z\u00fcrich who wrote a review article on this topic in 1976. Nevertheless, it is probable that particularly the immunological mechanisms of psychotic and affective disorders can be influenced by the application of ayurvedic methods; however, the empirical data source, particularly with respect to randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses regarding psychiatric disorder symptoms is limited. Even if Ayurveda is applied in a highly individualized manner, this should be rapidly improved for further evidential assessment.

To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and videoconferencing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of videoconferencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at least one videoconferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to June of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach supported by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduction of the videoconferencing system, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decisions were obvious. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a need to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3) a need to build an alliance with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient and health personnel.

More than 10% of MDD patients have suicide intent, while it has been reported that more than 40% patients did not consult their doctors for MDD. In order to increase consultation rate of potential MDD patients, we developed a novel MDD screening system which can be used at home without help of health-care professionals. Using a fingertip photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensor as a substitute of electrocardiograph (ECG), the system discriminates MDD patients from healthy subjects using autonomic nerve transient responses induced by a mental task (random number generation) via logistic regression analysis. The nine logistic regression variables are averages of heart rate (HR), high frequency (HF) component of heart rate variability (HRV), and the low frequency (LF)/HF ratio of HRV before, during, and after the mental task. We conducted a clinical test of the proposed system. Participants were 6 MDD patients (4 females and 2 males, aged 23-60 years) from Shizuoka Saiseikai General Hospital psychiatry outpatient unit and 14 healthy volunteers from University of Electro-Communications (6 females and 8 males, aged 21-63 years).

It can indeed have detrimental consequences if not used appropriately, and is unpopular among patients. As a consequence, its reduction is supported by international recommendations. Varying rates of psychiatric inpatient admissions therefore deserve to draw attention of researchers, clinicians and policy makers alike as such variations can challenge quality, equity and efficiency of care. In this context, our objectives were first to describe variations in psychiatric inpatient admission rates across the whole territory of mainland France, and second to identify their association with characteristics of the supply of care, which can be targeted by dedicated health policies.\nOur study was carried out in French psychiatric sectors' catchment areas for the year 2012. Inpatient admission rates per 100,000 adult inhabitants were calculated using data from the national psychiatric discharge database. Their variations were described numerically and graphically. We then carried out a negative binomial regression to identify characteristics of the supply of care (public and private care, health and social care, hospital and community-based care, specialised and non-specialised care) which were associated with these variations while adjusting our analysis for other relevant factors, in particular epidemiological differences.\nConsiderable variations in inpatient admission rates were observed between psychiatric sectors' catchment areas and were widespread on the French territory. Institutional characteristics of the hospital to which each sector was linked (private non-profit status, specialisation in psychiatry and participation to teaching activities and to emergency care) were associated with inpatient admission rates. Similarly, an increase in the availability of community-based private psychiatrists was associated with a decrease in the inpatient admission rate while an increase in the capacity of housing institutions for disabled individuals was associated with an increase in this rate.\nOur results advocate for a homogenous repartition of health and social care for mental disorders in lines with the health needs of the population served. This should apply particularly to community-based private psychiatrists, whose heterogeneity of repartition has often been underscored."}, {"Title": "ECT: a new look at an old friend.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment option in psychiatry is advancing day by day.

Although etomidate or a ketamine-propofol combination may be the first choice for many clinicians, the search for ideal induction agent continues. Dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, or ketamine may aid in augmentation of ECT; however, they are not recommended routinely. A systematic procedure for hyperventilation of the patient has been shown to have clinical repercussions. Optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval (ASTI) has a significant impact on the success of the procedure. BIS monitoring alone cannot be relied upon for timing stimulus. High-dose brief pulse right unilateral ECT represents an acceptable first-line form of treatment, though there is currently no 'gold standard'. Other stimulus variations such as focal electrically administered seizure therapy, individualized low-amplitude seizure therapy, magnetic seizure therapy, left unilateral and left anterior right temporal electrode placements are explored to reduce memory effects.

Much of what we know about the medical and psychological management of PTSD has its origins in military psychiatric approaches, and a review of these practices reveals important tenets that should be applied in current treatment for both military and nonmilitary PTSD. These practices include intervention as soon as possible after the traumatic exposure, provision for a safe and supportive therapeutic milieu designed for an individual's relatively rapid return to his or her responsibilities and normal activities, and using a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy (especially exposure to the traumatic memory). A review of current guidelines for treatment of PTSD reveals that few treatments are endorsed with great certainty, owing in large part to a paucity of clinical trials, particularly of pharmacotherapy. This shortcoming must be addressed to enable translation of promising discoveries in the neuroscience of fear into the therapeutic advances patients need and deserve.

Due to its robust effectiveness, ECT revived in the early 1980's and today holds its position in clinical psychiatric practices around the world. Mechanism of ECT on brain and psychopathology is still not fully understood. Main theories have been neurotransmitter, post-receptor, neurophysiological and neuroendocrine theory.

Great advantage of ECT is lack of absolute contraindications. ECT in Croatia was introduced in clinical psychiatric practice in 1960's in four institutions. Mainly due to stigma, but also a tendency for shifting toward hypothesized action mechanism, ECT in Croatia has been re-named to electrostimulative therapy or electroneuromodulatory treatment.

This exploratory pilot examined changes over 1\u00a0year of training in junior psychiatry residents' competency milestone elements in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and CBT.\nSeventy-nine randomly selected audio-recorded sessions from differing phases of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and CBT with five junior residents and ten patients were rated using the Psychotherapy Process Q-sort (PQS).\nIn both treatments, patient engagement with attention to in-session emotions improved. In CBT, residents were directive, supported patients' self-efficacy, emphasized patients' accepting responsibility for their problems, discussed homework such as thought records, and focused on termination in the concluding sessions. In Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, residents attended to emotional arousal and linked patients' feelings or perceptions to past situations or behavior. Growth and hierarchical linear modeling differentiated these treatments, with CBT v.

ESM, a structured self-report diary technique, allows the investigation of experiences within, and in interaction with, the real-world context. This paper provides an overview of how zooming in on the micro-level of experience and behaviour using ESM adds new insights and additional perspectives to standard approaches. More specifically, it discusses how ESM: a) contributes to a deeper understanding of psychopathological phenomena, b) allows to capture variability over time, c) aids in identifying internal and situational determinants of variability in symptomatology, and d) enables a thorough investigation of the interaction between the person and his/her environment and of real-life social interactions. Next to improving assessment of psychopathology and its underlying mechanisms, ESM contributes to advancing and changing clinical practice by allowing a more fine-grained evaluation of treatment effects as well as by providing the opportunity for extending treatment beyond the clinical setting into real life with the development of ecological momentary interventions. Furthermore, this paper provides an overview of the technical details of setting up an ESM study in terms of design, questionnaire development and statistical approaches. Overall, although a number of considerations and challenges remain, ESM offers one of the best opportunities for personalized medicine in psychiatry, from both a research and a clinical perspective."}, {"Title": "Beyond the \"at risk mental state\" concept: transitioning to transdiagnostic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The \"at risk mental state\" for psychosis approach has been a catalytic, highly productive research paradigm over the last 25 years. In this paper we review that paradigm and summarize its key lessons, which include the valence of this phenotype for future psychosis outcomes, but also for comorbid, persistent or incident non-psychotic disorders; and the evidence that onset of psychotic disorder can at least be delayed in ultra high risk (UHR) patients, and that some full-threshold psychotic disorder may emerge from risk states not captured by UHR criteria. The paradigm has also illuminated risk factors and mechanisms involved in psychosis onset. However, findings from this and related paradigms indicate the need to develop new identification and diagnostic strategies. These findings include the high prevalence and impact of mental disorders in young people, the limitations of current diagnostic systems and risk identification approaches, the diffuse and unstable symptom patterns in early stages, and their pluripotent, transdiagnostic trajectories. The approach we have recently adopted has been guided by the clinical staging model and adapts the original \"at risk mental state\" approach to encompass a broader range of inputs and output target syndromes. This approach is supported by a number of novel modelling and prediction strategies that acknowledge and reflect the dynamic nature of psychopathology, such as dynamical systems theory, network theory, and joint modelling. Importantly, a broader transdiagnostic approach and enhancing specific prediction (profiling or increasing precision) can be achieved concurrently. A holistic strategy can be developed that applies these new prediction approaches, as well as machine learning and iterative probabilistic multimodal models, to a blend of subjective psychological data, physical disturbances (e.g., EEG measures) and biomarkers (e.g., neuroinflammation, neural network abnormalities) acquired through fine-grained sequential or longitudinal assessments. This strategy could ultimately enhance our understanding and ability to predict the onset, early course and evolution of mental ill health, further opening pathways for preventive interventions."}, {"Title": "Child Psychiatry Engagement in the Management of Delirium in Critically Ill Children.", "Abstract": "To characterize the engagement of child psychiatry by pediatric intensivists in cases of suspected delirium in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) prior to implementation of a delirium management algorithm with regards to recommendations, antipsychotic prescribing, and follow-up after PICU discharge.\nRetrospective chart review.\nSingle-center tertiary PICU.\nSixteen patients who received child psychiatry consultation for suspected delirium while in the PICU.\nChild psychiatry was consulted for 50 patients in the PICU during the 2-year period.

This article aims to answer the question how changing views on firesetting as either a culpable act or an excusable expression of pathology have influenced the actual court decisions over time. The focus will be on the notion of pyromania and its implications on criminal responsibility and relevant developments concerning pathological firesetting are placed in a judicial context. In particular, the legal effects of changing views on firesetting as either pathological or punishable are discussed and illustrated by relevant Dutch court cases. Results show a pendulum movement that can be linked to changing medico-legal views. In the first half of the nineteenth century pyromania flourished and the pathology of firesetters was emphasized, leading to a focus on treatment instead of punishment. In the second half of that century the diagnosis of pyromania was questioned and focus shifted to the punishability of firesetters. In the first half of the twentieth century the pendulum seemed to stabilize with (partially) insane firesetters oftentimes receiving punishment as well as treatment."}, {"Title": "Correlates of offense recidivism in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia increases the risk of offending.

Nevertheless, the concept of dangerousness has received little attention in the Portuguese critical literature. Moreover, there is concern that the concept is often used improperly. We endeavoured to evaluate a sample of Portuguese forensic reports in order to discuss: 1) the prevalence of defendants who were considered guilty, NGRI, and dangerous; 2) which treatments were proposed; and 3) the frequency of technical errors found. We analysed 124 case folders from the year 2006, from both mainland Portugal and the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores, which included an evaluation of dangerousness of the defendants. These 124 cases were analysed using frequencies, correlations and multiple logistic regressions. The majority of the defendants were male and single. Thirty-nine percent (39%) were considered NGRI. A total of 34% of the defendants were considered dangerous or no dangerousness could be excluded. In 66% of cases treatment was recommended but in only 9% was admission to a forensic hospital recommended. Technical errors in the forensic reports, both of format and content, were identified in 26% of the 124 cases, the incidence of errors being high in reports from certain institutions. The majority of the forensic reports did not discuss the educational background of the defendants or their criminal history/records. We conclude that the experience of the expert is crucial in producing an appropriate report. The establishment of uniform criteria for the preparation of forensic reports and enhanced training of psychiatrists in forensic psychiatry should be considered as possible strategies to improve the accuracy of forensic reporting, particularly when assessing dangerousness."}, {"Title": "The medical-legal aspect of sexual deviant behaviors due to brain lesions: A case report and narrative review of the literature.", "Abstract": "We reported a case of sexual assault in a 60-year-old male with no history of mental illness.

When analyses controlled for a range of risk factors for population-level suicide rates, the effects of Connecticut and Indiana's firearm seizure laws on firearm and nonfirearm suicide rates were evaluated by using the synthetic-control methodology and difference-in-place placebo tests. Sensitivity analyses employed regression-based difference-in-differences analyses with randomization inference.\nIndiana's firearm seizure law was associated with a 7.5% reduction in firearm suicides in the ten years following its enactment, an effect specific to suicides with firearms and larger than that seen in any comparison state by chance alone. Enactment of Connecticut's law was associated with a 1.6% reduction in firearm suicides immediately after its passage and a 13.7% reduction in firearm suicides in the post-Virginia Tech period, when enforcement of the law substantially increased. Regression-based sensitivity analyses showed that these findings were robust to alternative specifications.

The purpose of this study was to examine to what extent adolescents perceive or experience coercion during inpatient mental health care, and to examine predictors of experienced coercion.\nA cross-sectional sample of 96 adolescent inpatients from 10 Norwegian acute and combined (acute and sub-acute) psychiatric wards reported their experienced coercion on Coercion Ladder and the Experienced Coercion Scale in questionnaires. Staff reported use of formal coercion, diagnoses, and psychosocial functioning. We used two tailed t-tests and mixed effects models to analyze the impact from demographics, alliance with parents, use of formal coercion, diagnostic condition, and global psychosocial functioning.\nHigh experienced coercion was reported by a third of all patients. In a mixed effects model, being under formal coercion (involuntary admission and / or coercive measures); a worse relationship between patient and parent; and lower psychosocial functioning, significantly predicted higher experienced coercion. Twenty-eight percent of the total sample of patients reported a lack of confidence and trust both in parents and staff.\nRoughly one third of patients in the sample reported high experienced coercion. Being under formal coercion was the strongest predictor. The average scores of experienced coercion in subgroups are comparable with adult scores in similar care situations. There was one exception: Adolescents with psychosis reported low experienced coercion and almost all of them were under voluntary care."}, {"Title": "Who needs collaborative care treatment? A qualitative study exploring attitudes towards and experiences with mental healthcare among general practitioners and care managers.", "Abstract": "Collaborative care treatment is widely recognized as an effective approach to improve the quality of mental healthcare through enhanced and structured collaboration between general practice and specialized psychiatry. However, studies indicate that the complexity of collaborative care treatment interventions challenge the implementation in real-life general practice settings. Four Danish Collaborative Care Models were launched in 2014 for patients with mild/moderate anxiety and depression. These involved collaboration between general practitioners, care managers and consultant psychiatrists. Taking a multi-practice bottom-up approach, this paper aims to explore the perceived barriers and enablers related to collaborative care for patients with mental health problems and to investigate the actual experiences with a Danish collaborative care model in a single-case study in order to identify enablers and barriers for successful implementation.\nCombining interviews and observations of usual treatment practices, we conducted a multi-practice study among general practitioners who were not involved in the Danish collaborative care models to explore their perspectives on existing mental health treatment and to investigate (from a bottom-up approach) their perceptions of and need for collaborative care in mental health treatment. Additionally, by combining observations and qualitative interviews, we followed the implementation of a Danish collaborative care model in a single-case study to convey identified barriers and enablers of the collaborative care model.\nExperienced and perceived enablers of the Danish collaborative care model mainly consisted of a need for new treatment options to deal with mild/moderate anxiety and depression. The model was considered to meet the need for a free fast track to high-quality treatment. Experienced barriers included: poor adaptation of the model to the working conditions and needs in daily general practice, time consumption, unsustainable logistical set-up and unclear care manager role. General practitioners in the multi-practice study considered access to treatment and not collaboration with specialised psychiatry to be essential for this group of patients.\nThe study calls for increased attention to implementation processes and better adaptation of collaborative care models to the clinical reality of general practice.

Following a brief review of the limited published literature regarding the teaching of boundaries during medical school, the authors define key concepts, including the clinical frame, boundary crossings and violations, fiduciary duty, and dual relationships. Next, they provide examples of common boundary challenges that arise during the course of undergraduate medical education and later during clinical practice. The authors present factors that may contribute to boundary concerns, including characteristics of providers and patients, and they describe some of the potential consequences of boundary violations.

Year 12 workshops focused on applications and medical school, while Year 9 took a broader approach reflecting their relative distance from applying. Subsequent workshops were informed by the findings of earlier ones.\nThe main finding was that potential applicants had limited knowledge about medicine and medical school in several areas. Older students would benefit from accessible information about medical degrees and application processes, access to work experience opportunities and personal contact with medical students and junior doctors, particularly those from a similar background. Younger students demonstrated a lack of awareness of the breadth of medical careers and a limited understanding of what medicine encompasses. Many Year 9 students were attracted by elements of practice which they did not associate with medicine, such as 'talking to people with mental health problems'. An exercise addressing this elicited an increase in their interest in medicine. These issues were identified by participants as being more marked for those without knowledgeable support at home or school. It was apparent that school teachers may not be equipped to fill these knowledge gaps.\nGaps in knowledge and support may reflect the importance of 'social capital' in facilitating access to medical school. Medical schools could act as hubs to introduce students to resources which are essential for widening participation. Outreach and support to schools may ensure that fundamental knowledge gaps are equitably addressed for all prospective applicants. More generally, a focus on medicine which under-emphasises aspects of medical practice involving communication may deter some students and have longer term impact on recruitment to careers including general practice and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Predictors of medication adherence among patients with severe psychiatric disorders: findings from the baseline assessment of a randomized controlled trial (Tecla).", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are characterized by a high disease burden.

Unfortunately, the paradigmatic approach to special education based on postmodern philosophy is in contrast to the biomedical approach that is based on the positivist and Cartesian models. The paper is an attempt to systematize the similarities and differences between the humanistic approach and the modern biomedical model, which, despite the apparent differences, do not differ so much from each other. Work with a person disabled intellectually in the severe or profound degree is governed by the principles of methodical realism, taking into account to an equal extent the principal deficits, the concomitant diseases, limitations and the social context. The deeper the impairment and disability is, the smaller is the role of the humanistic paradigm in work with the client in the medical management and educational process. Changing the paradigms of special pedagogy has drawn attention to the social context of disability, separating, however, special pedagogy from modern medicine and psychology, cognitive-oriented and psychometry-based. The postmodern paradigm has become an ideology, which makes it difficult to work with deeply disabled people. Only the multidirectional approach including a variety of paradigms makes it possible to provide integrational aid to people with severe and profound grade intellectual disabilities.

Good Psychiatric Management for borderline personality disorder (GPM) offers an evidence-based, simplified, psychodynamically informed framework for the outpatient management of patients with borderline personality disorder, one of the most challenging disorders psychiatric residents must learn to treat. In this article, we provide an overview of GPM, and show that training in GPM meets a requirement for training in supportive psychotherapy; builds on psychodynamic psychotherapy training; and applies to other severe personality disorders, especially narcissistic personality disorder. We describe the interpersonal hypersensitivity model used in GPM as a straightforward way for clinicians to collaborate with patients in organizing approaches to psychoeducation, treatment goals, case management, use of multiple treatment modalities, and safety. A modification of the interpersonal hypersensitivity model that includes intra-personal hypersensitivity can be used to address narcissistic problems often present in borderline personality disorder. We argue that these features make GPM ideally suited for psychiatry residents in treating their most challenging patients, provide clinical examples to illustrate these points, and report the key lessons learned by a psychiatry resident after a year of GPM supervision."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of oxygenated hemoglobin concentration change during pleasant and unpleasant image-recall tasks in patients with depression: Comparison with healthy subjects.", "Abstract": "Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been reported to show cognitive impairment in attention, cognition control, and motivation.

However, the underlying neural mechanism is still unclear. We evaluated brain function during pleasant and unpleasant image-recall tasks using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in MDD patients.\nThe subjects were 25 MDD patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were classified according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. We measured the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration change (\u03b4oxyHb) in the forehead and temporal lobe during image-recall task with pleasant (e.g., puppy) and unpleasant (e.g., snake) images using NIRS. To check whether all subjects understood the task, they were asked to draw pictures of both image tasks after NIRS measurement.\nThe \u03b4oxyHb in the healthy group was significantly higher than that in the MDD group in the bilateral frontal region during the unpleasant condition. A significant negative correlation between the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score and \u03b4oxyHb was observed in the left frontal region during the unpleasant condition.\nWe suggest that image-recall tasks related to emotion measured by NIRS might be a visually useful psychophysiological marker to understand the decrease in the frontal lobe function in MDD patients.

UMS euthanasia occurs fairly rarely in Belgium, but the frequency has increased substantially over the past few years. Although most mental health nurses play an important role and are supportive of euthanasia in general, their role, attitude and knowledge when it comes to UMS euthanasia were unknown until now. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Most mental health nurses in Belgium appear to be supportive towards UMS euthanasia and where UMS euthanasia is carried out, mental health nurses are often involved in the preceding decision-making process. Mental health nurses critically reflect on the interpretation and application of the legal euthanasia criteria as experienced in their daily work with their patients, and identify several problems. After a rather quiet period in Belgium, the public ethical debate regarding UMS euthanasia has recently been reopened and intensified. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Sufficient attention must be paid to how mental health nurses can be involved in the process of UMS euthanasia. This applies at several levels: legal, healthcare policy, bedside care and education. Specific attention must be paid within the UMS euthanasia process to ensure adequate cooperation between physicians, nurses and patients. There is a need for proper training in: knowledge of psychiatric pathologies and remaining treatment options; communication skills; the legal framework and all its difficulties; transdisciplinary and multicultural approaches; ethical reflection and how nurses handle their own emotions.\nIntroduction Euthanasia because of unbearable mental suffering (UMS euthanasia) has been legal in Belgium since 2002, under certain circumstances that govern careful practice. Despite the legal framework, there are specific difficulties and concerns regarding UMS euthanasia. Mental health nurses are often involved in the process, but little is known about their attitudes towards UMS euthanasia, their role and their knowledge. Aim To determine the attitudes, role and knowledge of mental health nurses regarding UMS euthanasia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was performed at a convenience sample of four psychiatric hospitals in Belgium (n\u00a0=\u00a0133) as a pilot study. Self-administered questionnaires were provided to mental health nurses. Results Half the nurses in our sample had been involved at least once in the process of UMS euthanasia. A large majority of mental health nurses were supportive of UMS euthanasia. Nurses show differences in attitudes related to the different psychiatric pathologies of the patients, and in whether or not minors are involved. In some cases, they believed that the mental suffering of psychiatric patients can be unbearable and irreversible and that psychiatric patients can be competent to voluntarily request UMS euthanasia. Nurses stated that they have an important role in the UMS euthanasia process, but also demanded more knowledge and clear guidelines to implement the procedure. Discussion Nurses have a key role regarding UMS euthanasia but face several challenges: the recent process, resistance to a multidisciplinary approach by psychiatrists and an unclear role defined by the legal framework. Nurses do not appear to have a common voice on the topic and the development of clear guidelines appears to be essential. Social recovery can offer a way out of an UMS euthanasia request, but it will not always offer a solution. Implications for Practice Sufficient attention must be paid to how mental health nurses can be involved in the process of UMS euthanasia at various levels: bedside practice, healthcare management, education and policy. A form of systematic cooperation between nurses, physicians and patients can contribute to the utmost careful decision-making process needed in these cases. There is a need for proper training in: knowledge of psychiatric pathologies and remaining treatment options; communication skills; the legal framework and all its difficulties; transdisciplinary and multicultural approaches; ethical reflection and how nurses handle their own emotions."}, {"Title": "Gut, Microbiome, and Brain Regulatory Axis: Relevance to Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "It has become apparent that the molecular and biochemical integrity of interactive families, genera, and species of human gut microflora is critically linked to maintaining complex metabolic and behavioral processes mediated by peripheral organ systems and central nervous system neuronal groupings.

This is partly due to the current suboptimal treatment options: existing psychotropic medications, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers, are effective only in a subset of patients or produce partial response and they are often associated with debilitating side effects that discourage adherence. Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic information impacts on drug response/side effects with the goal to provide tailored treatments, thereby maximizing efficacy and tolerability. The first pharmacogenetic studies focused on candidate genes, previously known to be relevant to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of psychotropic drugs. Results were mainly inconclusive, but some replicated candidates were identified and included as pharmacogenetic biomarkers in drug labeling and in some commercial kits. With the advent of the genomic revolution, it became possible to study the genetic variation on an unprecedented scale, throughout the whole genome with no need of a priori hypothesis. This may lead to the personalized prescription of existing medications and potentially to the development of innovative ones, thanks to new insights into the genetics of mental illness.

A multidisciplinary pharmacotherapy programme was therefore initiated by pharmacists in 2001. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of teamwork between psychiatrists and pharmacists in benzodiazepine dose adjustment, with 15\u00a0years of hindsight.\nIn this retrospective study, daily prescribed benzodiazepine doses were compared between a reference group of patients in prisons in Lyon, France, in 2000, and four groups after psychiatrist-pharmacist teamwork in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016.\nA number of 1249 patients were included. Prescribed doses of benzodiazepine decreased in the intervention groups, to a mean of 29-35\u00a0mg diazepam equivalent per day, compared to the control group (42\u00a0mg/day) (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The first 4-year period (2000-2004) demonstrated that monthly meetings and systematic pharmaceutical medication review had an impact on prescribed benzodiazepines, limiting consumed doses. The others (2004-2008, 2008-2012 and 2012-2016) confirmed that physicians' adherence to prescription guidelines and the efficacy of pharmacotherapy programme was maintained, particularly in those inmates taking high doses.\nA continuous quality programme conducted by psychiatrists and pharmacists showed positive impact in reducing doses of benzodiazepine prescribed to prisoner patients and contributing to reduce risk of benzodiazepine-related problems."}, {"Title": "Attitudes towards motherhood of women with physical versus psychiatric disabilities.", "Abstract": "Women with disabilities may face social negative attitudes with regard to their being mothers.

The vignettes consisted of a woman with a physical disability/a woman with a psychiatric disability/a woman without a disability, who either was or was not a mother.\nType of disability was found to have a main effect in some attitude domains, suggesting that attitudes toward women with physical disabilities were better than attitudes towards women with psychiatric disabilities. An interaction between type of disability and motherhood was found for the interpersonal distress subscale of the attitudes scale. It was found that when women had physical disabilities, there was no change in attitude towards them regardless of whether they were presented as mothers or not; However, when the target woman had a psychiatric disability, and she was presented as a mother, negative attitudes were generated towards her.\nThe study demonstrates the existence of a hierarchy of stigmatization and the effect of being a mother on stigmatization."}, {"Title": "The Fountain of Health: effective health promotion knowledge transfer in individual primary care and group community-based formats.", "Abstract": "ABSTRACTBackground:The Fountain of Health (FoH) initiative is a knowledge transfer (KT) project on the science of brain health and resilience promotion, in alignment with positive psychiatry.\nAssess the effectiveness of FoH KT delivered in individual and group-based formats.\nPre- and post-intervention quality assurance survey of FoH KT.\nInterventions occurred in Nova Scotia, Canada.\nAdults over age 50 years without pre-existing dementia were targeted.

Untreated depression has negative health consequences for mother and fetus. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective option for the treatment of severe depression, high suicide risk, catatonia, medication-resistant illness, psychotic agitation, severe physical decline, and other life-threatening conditions. To our knowledge, however, there is no literature that consolidates all the evidence on maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated depression, medications, and ECT then translating it into one cohesive protocol that could serve as a management guide and a source of reassurance to health-care providers involved in such practice. Hoping to facilitate ECT access to perinatal patients, the authors combined their multidisciplinary clinical experience (in perinatal psychiatry, neuropsychiatry and neuromodulation, and anesthesiology) at three different centers in the USA (Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, The University of Chicago, and Brown University) with a careful and critical literature review and propose guidelines for the administration of ECT in pregnancy. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature regarding both ECT and psychotropic medications in pregnancy was performed, including meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials published in general medicine, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and obstetrics journals and guidelines. The indication and appropriateness of ECT in pregnancy must be carefully weighed against the risks of untreated maternal illness and those of alternative treatment options. The safety of ECT in pregnancy has been documented over the last 50\u00a0years. The adverse effects in pregnancy are similar to the risks of ECT in any individual. The most common risk to the mother is premature contractions and preterm labor, which occur infrequently and are not clearly caused by ECT. The rates of miscarriages were not significantly different from that of the general population. There have been no associations of ECT with congenital anomalies, either morphologic or behavioral, and no neurocognitive disturbances in the child. ECT is a reasonably safe and effective treatment alternative for management of many psychiatric disorders in pregnant patients. The authors provide recommendations for treatment modifications in pregnancy-based physiologic changes that occur during that period and consolidate them into a protocol that can assist clinicians in improving access and safety of ECT for pregnant patients."}, {"Title": "Validation of pharmacist-physician collaboration in psychiatry: 'the Eichberger-model'.", "Abstract": "Background Collaboration between physicians and pharmacists can increase medication safety.

In the present study, we use data from the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, to characterize quantitative trends in Geriatrics graduate medical education between academic years 2001-2002 and 2017-2018. We find that, when Hospice/Palliative Care is excluded, Geriatrics-related graduate medical education programs have grown by just 1.1% when adjusting for population growth. There are 58 fewer total filled Geriatrics and Geriatric Psychiatry positions in 2017-2018 than there were in 2001-2002, a population-adjusted decline of 23.3%.

We conducted longitudinal and cross-sectional investigations of VEP plasticity in controls and individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) type II. VEP plasticity was assessed at baseline, as described previously (Elvs\u00e5shagen et al. Biol Psychiatry 2012), and 2.2 years later, at follow-up. The longitudinal sample with VEP data from both time points comprised 29 controls and 16 patients. VEP data were available from 13 additional patients at follow-up (total n\u2009=\u200958). VEPs were evoked by checkerboard reversals in two premodulation blocks before and six blocks after a plasticity-inducing block of prolonged (10\u2009min) visual stimulation. VEP plasticity was computed by subtracting premodulation VEP amplitudes from postmodulation amplitudes. Saliva samples for cortisol analysis were collected immediately after awakening in the morning, 30\u2009min later, and at 12:30 PM, at follow-up. We found reduced VEP plasticity in BD type II, that impaired plasticity was present in the euthymic phases of the illness, and that VEP plasticity correlated negatively with depression severity. There was a positive association between VEP plasticity and saliva cortisol in controls, possibly reflecting an inverted U-shaped relationship between cortisol and synaptic plasticity. VEP plasticity exhibited moderate temporal stability over a period of 2.2 years. The present study provides additional evidence for impaired LTP-like cortical plasticity in BD type II. VEP plasticity is an accessible method, which may help elucidate the pathophysiological and clinical significance of synaptic dysfunction in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "What do clinicians consider when assessing chronic low back pain? A content analysis of multidisciplinary pain centre team assessments of functioning, disability, and health.", "Abstract": "Beyond expert suggestions as to the appropriate subject matter for chronic pain assessments, little is known about the actual content of multidisciplinary pain centre (MPC) clinical assessments. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Low Back Pain Core Set (ICF LBP-CS) provides a universal language to support the consistent description of LBP-related assessments across disciplines within multidisciplinary teams (MDTs). This study sought to map the content of MPC clinical assessments to the ICF to: (1) identify and compare the content of clinical MDT assessments using a cross-disciplinary framework and (2) examine the content validity of the LBP-CS. A qualitative examination of MPC team clinical assessments of chronic low back pain was undertaken. Multidisciplinary team (pain medicine, psychiatry, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychology) assessments were audio-recorded and transcribed. Concepts were extracted from transcripts using a meaning condensation procedure and then linked to the ICF. Across 7 MDT assessments, comprised 42 discipline-specific assessments and 241,209 transcribed words, 8596 concepts were extracted. Contextual factors (ie, the person and environment), except for physiotherapy, accounted for almost half of each discipline's assessments (range: 49%-58%). Concepts spanned 113 second-level ICF categories, including 73/78 LBP-CS categories. Overall, the findings revealed novel insights into the content of MPC clinical assessments that can be used to improve health care delivery. International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-based assessment profiles demonstrated unique contributions from each discipline to chronic low back pain assessment. Finally, users of the LBP-CS can be confident that the tool exhibits sound content validity from the perceptive of MDT assessments of functioning, disability, and health."}, {"Title": "Prediction of response to drug therapy in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Personalized medicine has become increasingly relevant to many medical fields, promising more efficient drug therapies and earlier intervention. The development of personalized medicine is coupled with the identification of biomarkers and classification algorithms that help predict the responses of different patients to different drugs. In the last 10 years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several genetically pre-screened drugs labelled as pharmacogenomics in the fields of oncology, pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, haematology, neurology, rheumatology and even psychiatry. Clinicians have long cautioned that what may appear to be similar patient-reported symptoms may actually arise from different biological causes. With growing populations being diagnosed with different psychiatric conditions, it is critical for scientists and clinicians to develop precision medication tailored to individual conditions. Genome-wide association studies have highlighted the complicated nature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and autism spectrum disorder. Following these studies, association studies are needed to look for genomic markers of responsiveness to available drugs of individual patients within the population of a specific disorder. In addition to GWAS, the advent of new technologies such as brain imaging, cell reprogramming, sequencing and gene editing has given us the opportunity to look for more biomarkers that characterize a therapeutic response to a drug and to use all these biomarkers for determining treatment options. In this review, we discuss studies that were performed to find biomarkers of responsiveness to different available drugs for four brain disorders: bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depression and autism spectrum disorder.

Here we define the neuroanatomic correlates of key cognitive abilities and determine if there are associations with histories of psychostimulant medication.\nWe acquired neuroanatomic magnetic resonance imaging data from 264 members of 60 families (mean age 29.5; s.d. 18.4, 116 with ADHD). Using linear mixed model regression, we tested for associations between cognitive abilities (working memory, information processing, intelligence, and attention), symptoms and both cortical and subcortical volumes.\nSymptom severity was associated with spatial working memory (t = -3.77, p = 0.0002), processing speed (t = -2.95, p = 0.004) and a measure of impulsive responding (t = 2.19, p = 0.03); these associations did not vary with age (all p &gt; 0.1). Neuroanatomic associations of cognition varied by task but centered on prefrontal, lateral parietal and temporal cortical regions, the thalamus and putamen. The neuroanatomic correlates of ADHD symptoms overlapped significantly with those of working memory (Dice's overlap coefficient: spatial, p = 0.003; verbal, p = 0.001) and information processing (p = 0.02).

We interviewed 19 faculty members and conducted two focus groups with 18 residents. Semi-structured questions explored the relational meaning of health advocacy, how residents and faculty learned about the role and ethical considerations involved in incorporating advocacy work into clinical practice within a relationship-centred care framework.\nFour themes emerged from the interviews and focus groups: 1) health advocacy as an extension of the relationship to self; 2) health advocacy and professional boundaries in the physician-patient relationship; 3) health advocacy within a team-based approach; and 4) health advocacy and the physician-community/organization relationship. Participants described implications for practice of the challenges of health advocacy, including perceived institutional risks, professional boundaries and the appropriation of patient voice.\nOur study provides insights into the relational complexities of the health advocate role in residency curriculum and clinical practice. All participants described health advocacy as a broad spectrum of actions that are guided by relationships among patients, health care professionals and communities. Our analysis revealed that some challenges that participants identified with a health advocacy role could be addressed by anchoring the role within a specific theoretical framework.

The aims of our study were thus (a) to assess the frequency of comorbid PIU in a sample of adolescent psychiatric inpatients and compare it with a control group of nonreferred adolescents and (b) to gain insights into correlations between PIU and psychiatric comorbidities.\n111 child and adolescent psychiatry inpatients (CAP-IP, mean age 15.1 \u00b1 1.4 years; female\u2009:\u2009male 72.4%\u2009:\u200927.6%) undergoing routine psychodiagnostics were screened for the presence of PIU. The widely used Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS) was chosen for this purpose. Prevalence rates of PIU were then compared to matched nonreferred control subjects from a school sample. Additionally, comorbidities of inpatients with PIU were compared to inpatients without PIU.\nOur inpatient sample showed a much higher prevalence of PIU than that found in previous populational samples of young people. Compared with a matched school sample, addictive internet use was 7.8 times higher and problematic internet use 3.3 times higher among our adolescent sample. PIU was significantly associated with characteristic patterns of psychopathology, that is, suicidality, difficulties in establishing stable and consolidated identity, and peer victimization.\nPIU among adolescents undergoing inpatient psychiatric treatment is much more frequent than among their peers in the general population and is associated with specific patterns of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Making Individual Prognoses in Psychiatry Using Neuroimaging and Machine Learning.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric prognosis is a difficult problem. Making a prognosis requires looking far into the future, as opposed to making a diagnosis, which is concerned with the current state. During the follow-up period, many factors will influence the course of the disease. Combined with the usually scarcer longitudinal data and the variability in the definition of outcomes/transition, this makes prognostic predictions a challenging endeavor. Employing neuroimaging data in this endeavor introduces the additional hurdle of high dimensionality. Machine learning techniques are especially suited to tackle this challenging problem. This review starts with a brief introduction to machine learning in the context of its application to clinical neuroimaging data. We highlight a few issues that are especially relevant for prediction of outcome and transition using neuroimaging. We then review the literature that discusses the application of machine learning for this purpose. Critical examination of the studies and their results with respect to the relevant issues revealed the following: 1) there is growing evidence for the prognostic capability of machine learning-based models using neuroimaging; and 2) reported accuracies may be too optimistic owing to small sample sizes and the lack of independent test samples. Finally, we discuss options to improve the reliability of (prognostic) prediction models. These include new methodologies and multimodal modeling. Paramount, however, is our conclusion that future work will need to provide properly (cross-)validated accuracy estimates of models trained on sufficiently large datasets. Nevertheless, with the technological advances enabling acquisition of large databases of patients and healthy subjects, machine learning represents a powerful tool in the search for psychiatric biomarkers."}, {"Title": "Enhancing Psychosis-Spectrum Nosology Through an International Data Sharing Initiative.", "Abstract": "The latent structure of schizotypy and psychosis-spectrum symptoms remains poorly understood. Furthermore, molecular genetic substrates are poorly defined, largely due to the substantial resources required to collect rich phenotypic data across diverse populations. Sample sizes of phenotypic studies are often insufficient for advanced structural equation modeling approaches. In the last 50 years, efforts in both psychiatry and psychological science have moved toward (1) a dimensional model of psychopathology (eg, the current Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology [HiTOP] initiative), (2) an integration of methods and measures across traits and units of analysis (eg, the RDoC initiative), and (3) powerful, impactful study designs maximizing sample size to detect subtle genomic variation relating to complex traits (the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium [PGC]). These movements are important to the future study of the psychosis spectrum, and to resolving heterogeneity with respect to instrument and population. The International Consortium of Schizotypy Research is composed of over 40 laboratories in 12 countries, and to date, members have compiled a body of schizotypy- and psychosis-related phenotype data from more than 30000 individuals. It has become apparent that compiling data into a protected, relational database and crowdsourcing analytic and data science expertise will result in significant enhancement of current research on the structure and biological substrates of the psychosis spectrum.

Qualitative data was also gathered with a staff questionnaire. We hypothesised that compared to the use of white lights, red lights would be associated with a greater amount of recorded sleep, lesser use of 'as required' medication and no increase in the number of falls (reflecting comparable safety).\nWhilst there were no significant differences in quantitative measures recorded, there were more observations of sleep during the red light period than the white light period (14.1 versus 13.9 times per night) (U=627.5, z=-0.69, p=0.49) and fewer 'as required' medication administrations during the red light period compared to the white light period (3.3 versus 4.8 times per night) (U=640.0, z=0.56, p=0.57).

However, most DSM-V conditions are, in fact, syndromes, that is, collections of signs and symptoms that commonly occur together in the clinic. This report discusses the value of syndromes in medicine and psychiatry. It is argued that a more precise future enumeration of brain circuits and the pathogenesis of psychiatric conditions will help us better understand and treat psychiatric syndromes, but they are unlikely to eliminate the need to categorize psychiatric conditions. We expect that biomarkers will play an increasingly critical role in psychiatric diagnosis. Beyond a better mechanistic understanding of the DSM-V syndromes, future diagnostic efforts will need to increase the focus on function and address risk factors for nonresponse and relapse.

However, there are extremely limited data on the practice of mindfulness with adolescents in a psychiatric hospital. The iMatter ( Improve Mindful ATTention, Enhance Relaxation) group is a manualized program developed to provide adolescents on a short-term psychiatric inpatient unit with an opportunity to learn and practice relaxation strategies, mindfulness exercises, and simple yoga poses. Mindfulness skills are taught in the context of the group and include self-observation of thoughts and feelings, breathing exercises, self-validation of one's experience, loving-kindness toward self, non-judgmental stance toward self, and acceptance and observation of change within self.

Working at multiple scales, it forms an efficient system for processing and integration of multimodal information. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated strong associations between modalities of both microscales and macroscales of brain organization. These consistent observations point toward potential common organization principles where regions with a microscale architecture supportive of a larger computational load have more and stronger connections in the brain network on the macroscale. Conversely, disruptions observed on one organizational scale could modulate the other. First neuropsychiatric micro-macro comparisons in, among other conditions, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, have, for example, shown overlapping alterations across both scales. We give an overview of recent findings on associations between microscale and macroscale organization observed in the healthy brain, followed by a summary of microscale and macroscale findings reported in the context of brain disorders. We conclude with suggestions for future multiscale connectome comparisons linking multiple scales and modalities of organization and suggest how such comparisons could contribute to a more complete fundamental understanding of brain organization and associated disease-related alterations."}, {"Title": "Identification and medical utilization of incident cases of alcohol dependence: A population-based case-control study.", "Abstract": "Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) often seek help from medical professionals due to alcohol-related diseases, but the overall distribution of medical specialties identifying new AD cases is unclear.

Based on previously described abnormalities of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in severe forms of depression, we hypothesized that the temporal trajectory of basal cortisol levels would vary among individuals with depression due to heterogeneity in pathophysiology, and that cortisol trajectories that reflect elevated or increasing HPA activity would predict better response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To test that hypothesis, we sampled scalp hair from 39 subjects with treatment-resistant depression just before ECT. Cortisol trajectory over the 12 weeks preceding ECT was reconstructed from cortisol concentrations in sequential hair segments. Cortisol trajectories varied widely between individuals, and exploratory analyses of clinical features revealed associations with melancholia and global severity. ECT non-responders showed a decreasing trajectory (mean change -25%, 95%-CI\u202f=\u202f[-1%,-43%]) during the 8 weeks preceding ECT (group-by-time interaction, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). The association between cortisol trajectory and subsequent ECT response was independent of clinical features. A classification algorithm showed that cortisol trajectory predicted ECT response with 80% accuracy, suggesting that this biomarker might be developed into a clinically useful test for ECT-responsive depression. In conclusion, cortisol trajectory mapped onto symptoms of melancholia and independently predicted response to ECT in this severely depressed sample. These findings deserve to be replicated in a larger sample. Cortisol trajectory holds promise as a reliable, noninvasive, inexpensive biomarker for psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Examining the factors that are correlated with mindfulness with a focus on attention deficit hyperactivity symptoms.", "Abstract": "We hypothesized that attention deficit hyperactivity symptoms would negatively correlate with the level of mindfulness.\nSeventy-six subjects referred to the outpatient psychiatry unit and 32 healthy control subjects filled out the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS).\nPatients scored higher on ADH symptoms compared to controls (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.001).

The great challenge is providing a sensitive understanding of the workload resulting from psychotherapeutic interventions, the primary treatment that many patients need. This review reinforces the need to add patient outcomes to workload assessment processes.\nIntroduction No systematic reviews on measurement tools in adult psychiatric inpatient settings exist in the literature, and thus, further research is required on ways to identify approaches to calculate safe nurse staffing levels based on patients' care needs in adult psychiatric inpatient units. Aim To identify instruments that enable an assessment of nursing workload in psychiatric settings. Method A scoping review was conducted. Results Four studies were identified, with five instruments used to support the calculation of staff needs and workload. All four studies present methodological limitations. Two instruments have already been adapted to this specific context, but validation studies are lacking.

The number of patients subjected to mechanical restraint, but not to isolation, on the ward decreased significantly, while the total number of coercive interventions remained unchanged. Findings suggest some potential of intensive models of need-adapted care to reduce coercive interventions in psychiatry. However, results must be substantiated by evidence from randomized-controlled trials and longer observation periods."}, {"Title": "Mapping of Crowdsourcing in Health: Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing involves obtaining ideas, needed services, or content by soliciting Web-based contributions from a crowd. The 4 types of crowdsourced tasks (problem solving, data processing, surveillance or monitoring, and surveying) can be applied in the 3 categories of health (promotion, research, and care).\nThis study aimed to map the different applications of crowdsourcing in health to assess the fields of health that are using crowdsourcing and the crowdsourced tasks used. We also describe the logistics of crowdsourcing and the characteristics of crowd workers.\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for available reports from inception to March 30, 2016, with no restriction on language or publication status.\nWe identified 202 relevant studies that used crowdsourcing, including 9 randomized controlled trials, of which only one had posted results at ClinicalTrials.gov. Crowdsourcing was used in health promotion (91/202, 45.0%), research (73/202, 36.1%), and care (38/202, 18.8%). The 4 most frequent areas of application were public health (67/202, 33.2%), psychiatry (32/202, 15.8%), surgery (22/202, 10.9%), and oncology (14/202, 6.9%). Half of the reports (99/202, 49.0%) referred to data processing, 34.6% (70/202) referred to surveying, 10.4% (21/202) referred to surveillance or monitoring, and 5.9% (12/202) referred to problem-solving. Labor market platforms (eg, Amazon Mechanical Turk) were used in most studies (190/202, 94%). The crowd workers' characteristics were poorly reported, and crowdsourcing logistics were missing from two-thirds of the reports. When reported, the median size of the crowd was 424 (first and third quartiles: 167-802); crowd workers' median age was 34 years (32-36). Crowd workers were mainly recruited nationally, particularly in the United States. For many studies (58.9%, 119/202), previous experience in crowdsourcing was required, and passing a qualification test or training was seldom needed (11.9% of studies; 24/202). For half of the studies, monetary incentives were mentioned, with mainly less than US $1 to perform the task. The time needed to perform the task was mostly less than 10 min (58.9% of studies; 119/202). Data quality validation was used in 54/202 studies (26.7%), mainly by attention check questions or by replicating the task with several crowd workers.\nThe use of crowdsourcing, which allows access to a large pool of participants as well as saving time in data collection, lowering costs, and speeding up innovations, is increasing in health promotion, research, and care. However, the description of crowdsourcing logistics and crowd workers' characteristics is frequently missing in study reports and needs to be precisely reported to better interpret the study findings and replicate them."}, {"Title": "Handwriting assessment to distinguish comorbid learning difficulties from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Chinese adolescents: A case-control study.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning difficulties (LDs) are proposed as 2 overlapping disorders. The objective of this study was to investigate the handwriting performance in ADHD and comorbid ADHD-LD adolescents.\nThe study examined the Chinese and English handwriting performance and sensorimotor skills of 32 ADHD, 12 ADHD-LD, and their matched controls.\nParticipants with ADHD had comparable writing time and speed, but the readability was lower than their controls. Participants with ADHD-LD had lower writing speeds in both Chinese and English handwriting than their controls. The ADHD and ADHD-LD groups also showed larger variations in either speed or pen pressure than their controls. Chinese handwriting assessment effectively classified ADHD and ADHD-LD with good sensitivity and positive predictive value.\nClinicians should be aware of the fundamental difference between the 2 disorders and make good use of handwriting assessment as a reference to deliver effective therapies and trainings."}, {"Title": "A Qualitative Analysis of Stress and Relaxation Themes Contributing to Burnout in First-Year Psychiatry and Medicine Residents.", "Abstract": "Qualitative research on trainee well-being can add nuance to the understanding of propagators of burnout, and the role for interventions aimed at supporting well-being. This qualitative study was conducted to identify (i) situations and environments that cause stress for trainees, (ii) stress-reducing activities that trainees utilize, and (iii) whether trainees who report distress (high burnout and depression scores) describe different stressors and relaxation factors than those who do not.\nThe study was conducted with a convenience sample of first-year medicine and psychiatry residents at a large urban teaching hospital. Participants were asked to complete electronic stress and relaxation diaries daily for 1\u00a0week. Diary entries were coded for recurrent themes. Participants were screened for burnout and depression. Codes were compared by subgroup based on baseline burnout and depression status to elucidate if specific themes emerged in these subgroups.\nStudy sample included 51 interns. Sixteen (16/50, 32%) screened positive for burnout and three (3/50, 14%) had a positive depression screen. The most common stressors related to aspects of the learning environment, compounded by feeling under-equipped, overwhelmed, or out of time. The majority of relaxation activities involved social connection, food, other comforts, and occurred outside of the hospital environment.\nThis study reveals that interns (regardless of burnout or depression screen) identify stressors that derive primarily from organizational, interpersonal, and cultural experiences of the learning environment; whereas relaxation themes are diversely represented across realms (home, leisure, social, health), though emphasize activities that occur outside of the work place."}, {"Title": "Hippocampal gray matter increases following multimodal psychological treatment for combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Smaller hippocampal volumes are one of the most consistent findings in neuroimaging studies of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, very few prospective studies have assessed changes in hippocampal gray matter prior to and following therapy for PTSD, and no neuroimaging studies to date have longitudinally assessed military populations.\nA pilot study was conducted, assessing patients with combat-related PTSD with structural MRI. Participants were then assigned either to a treatment group or waiting-list control group. After the treatment group received multimodal psychological therapy for approximately 6\u00a0weeks, both groups completed a second neuroimaging assessment.\nRegion-of-interest analysis was used to measure gray matter volume in the hippocampus and amygdala. There was a group by time interaction; the therapy group (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a06) showed a significant increase in hippocampal volume and a nonsignificant trend toward an increase in amygdala volume following therapy, while no change was observed in the waiting-list group (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a09).\nThis study provides initial evidence for increases in gray matter volume in the hippocampus in response to therapy for combat-related PTSD."}, {"Title": "Transitioning Bodies. The Case of Self-Prescribing Sexual Hormones in Gender Affirmation in Individuals Attending Psychiatric Services.", "Abstract": "Self-prescribing of sexual hormones for gender affirmation is a potentially widespread and poorly studied phenomenon that many clinicians are unaware of. The uncontrolled use of hormones poses significant health hazards, which have not been previously reported in the literature. We have collected seven clinical cases in general adult psychiatry settings (both inpatient and outpatients), describing transgender and gender non-conforming individuals' (TGNC) self-prescribing and self-administering hormones bought from the Internet without any medical consultation. Among these cases, two were taking androgens, and the rest were taking oestrogens. The main reason for self-administration of hormones seems to be the lack of access to specialised care due to discrimination and long waiting lists. We advocate for clinicians to be aware of the phenomenon and proactively help TGNC individuals by enquiring about self-prescribing of hormones, providing information and referring to the most appropriate treatment centre as well as encourage a public debate on the discrimination and the stigma that TGNC population suffer from. Overall, there is an urgent need for the implementation of different and innovative health care services for TGNC individuals as well as more targeted prevention strategies on such underreported and highly risky behaviours. Furthermore, it is necessary for every clinician involved in the care for TGNC people to be aware of their special needs and be able to be an allied and an advocate to help in reducing stigma and discrimination that affect the access to care for this often underserved population."}, {"Title": "The Importance of Nidotherapy and Environmental Change in the Management of People with Complex Mental Disorders.", "Abstract": "Much has been done in the last 50 years to achieve a better understanding of the psychosocial causes and other factors influencing the manifestation of mental illness, but there has been a conspicuous omission. Although gross environmental deficiencies were exposed in old mental institutions, 70 years ago the more subtle maladaptive settings that reinforce chronicity in mental illness have often been forgotten. In this review, the potential of systematic environmental manipulation as a treatment (nidotherapy) and other similar forms of management, used many times in the past but now mainly in forensic settings, is examined. There is now accumulating evidence, reinforced by controlled trials, that planned environmental change, preferably carried out with the full cooperation of the patient, can be a major contributor to therapeutic benefit. It is also very cost-effective. All forms of the environment, physical, social and personal, can be addressed in making assessments, and once a planned way forward has been chosen, progress can be monitored by personnel with limited mental health experience. These interventions have applications in general mental health and occupational health services and deserve much wider use."}, {"Title": "Autistic traits, but not schizotypy, predict increased weighting of sensory information in Bayesian visual integration.", "Abstract": "Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference that is, how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge. However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals' likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations."}, {"Title": "Historicizing transcultural psychiatry: people, epistemic objects, networks, and practices.", "Abstract": "The history of transcultural psychiatry has recently attracted much historical attention, including a workshop in March 2016 in which an international panel of scholars met at the Maison de Sciences de l'Homme Paris-Nord (MSH-PN). Papers from this workshop are presented here. By conceiving of transcultural psychiatry as a dynamic social field that frames its knowledge claims around epistemic objects that are specific to the field, and by focusing on the ways that concepts within this field are used to organize intellectual work, several themes are explored that draw this field into the historiography of psychiatry. Attention is paid to the organization of networks and publications, and to important actors within the field who brought about significant developments in the colonial and post-colonial conceptions of mental illness."}, {"Title": "Sleep-related motor and behavioral disorders: Recent advances and new entities.", "Abstract": "Patients with sleep-related motor and behavioral disorders present to a variety of subspecialty clinics (neurology, sleep medicine, respiratory medicine, psychiatry).

Given that early life events are also linked to dysregulation of the same system, there might be an association between childhood adversities and suicidal behavior in affective disorders, moderated by HPA-axis genes. We aimed to investigate a potential association between childhood trauma and previous suicide attempts in affective disorder patients, moderated by variants of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene. <b>Methods:</b> The current pilot study is part of an ongoing study on suicidal behavior in affective disorders (VieSAD). Two hundred fifty eight Caucasian affective disorder patients were assessed at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Medical University Vienna and the Karl Landsteiner University for Health and Science. An assemblage of psychiatric interviews was performed (e.g., SCAN, HAMD, SBQ-R, CTQ) and DNA samples of peripheral blood cells were genotyped with TaqMan\u00ae SNP Genotyping Assays (rs7209436, rs4792887, rs110402, rs242924, and rs242939). <b>Results:</b> Neither genetic, nor haplotypic associations between CRHR1 polymorphisms and previous suicide attempts could be established for the present sample. Using a binary logistic regression model, significant gene-environment-interactions were found for the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7209436 and rs110402, reflecting the impact of childhood trauma and CRHR1 polymorphisms on previous suicide attempts. <b>Limitations:</b> A larger sample size will be required to ultimately elucidate the link between childhood trauma and the HPA axis in suicidal behavior. <b>Conclusion:</b> This pilot study presents promising gene-environment-interaction findings in affective disorder patients with a history of suicide attempts."}, {"Title": "Ethics Committees and Mental Health.", "Abstract": "Although research processes are covered by the objectivity of science, they are still influenced by the interests of those who conduct them. This is why high level committees have been tasked with defining the scope of the studies and performing a thorough assessment of them, since these imply great dilemmas. This premise leads to the emergence of Ethics Committees, where liaison psychiatry has an important place due to its communication abilities and knowledge of the human behavior. This paper attempts to provide some observations to take into account when discussing the link between ethics and mental health. In this work, the authors approach the question of ethics committees and the importance that psychiatrist performance has within them. This is done through a review of relevant papers on the subject. A detailed description on research ethics is provided in terms of justification, purpose and duties. Likewise, emphasis is placed on each of the areas in which psychiatrists are involved and bear great responsibilities in the medical decision-making process. Similarly, this description also includes the moment in which participants give their informed consent when taking part in medical research. Finally, we conclude that there are several questions regarding the relevance given to these committees in the methodological and ethical assessment of research projects. This in turn implies greater effort in the search for a culture of quality which highlights the emphasis on research subjects."}, {"Title": "Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination of phlebotomy tourniquets and faucets.", "Abstract": "Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is transmitted through direct contact or fomites.

Despite its apparent continuity, the cingulum's composition continually changes as fibres join and leave the bundle. To help understand its complex structure, this review begins with detailed, comparative descriptions of the multiple connections comprising the cingulum bundle. Next, the impact of cingulum bundle damage in rats, monkeys, and humans is analysed. Despite causing extensive anatomical disconnections, cingulum bundle lesions typically produce only mild deficits, highlighting the importance of parallel pathways and the distributed nature of its various functions. Meanwhile, non-invasive imaging implicates the cingulum bundle in executive control, emotion, pain (dorsal cingulum), and episodic memory (parahippocampal cingulum), while clinical studies reveal cingulum abnormalities in numerous conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical and treatment implications of aggression in mental illness are predominantly studied in perspectives of mental health care professionals. Coping style of caregivers towards aggression of persons with mental illness is understudied. So we studied coping strategies used by caregivers of patients with severe mental illness towards aggressive behaviors of patients and relationship between aggressive behavior and coping strategies. We assessed two hundreds and seventy caregivers of patients with severe mental illness attending outpatient psychiatry department using Modified Overt Aggression Scale and the Ways of Coping Scale - revised. 95.6% of the caregivers perceived verbal aggression followed by aggression against property (67%), auto aggression (33.7%) and physical aggression (25.6%). The study revealed that adaptive coping strategies - planful problem solving and seeking social support were used by 40% each of caregivers to deal with aggressive behavior. Only 4.4% of caregivers resorted to escape avoidance which is maladaptive coping strategy. Though adaptive strategies were used by caregivers these were not used in appropriate situations. Physical aggression and aggression against property were not significantly associated with planful problem solving (r\u202f=\u202f0.105; p\u202f=\u202f0.08 and r\u202f=\u202f0.110; p\u202f=\u202f0.07 respectively).

A systematic review of the qualitative literature was undertaken for the years 1994-2016. The following electronic databases were searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts. Using narrative synthesis methods, the following themes were identified: mental health knowledge (the GHPs' knowledge level about mental illness and how this impacts their experiences and perceptions); GHPs perceive mental illness as a safety risk (GHPs concern over harm to the consumer and themselves); organizational support (the system response from the environmental design, and expert support and care); and emotional consequences of care (the feelings expressed by GHPs based on their experiences and perceptions of consumers).

Previous studies indicate small to moderate effects on social communication capacities. The duration of most available programs is relatively short, and extended training might lead to further improvement. This randomized controlled trial compared an extended 24-week version of the SSGT program KONTAKT with standard care. The weekly sessions gradually shifted in content from acquisition of new skills to real-world application of the acquired skills. A total of 50 participants with ASD (15 females; 35 males) aged 8-17\u00a0years were included. The study was conducted at two child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient units in Sweden. The primary outcome was the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2) rated by parents and blinded teachers. Secondary outcomes included parent- and teacher-rated adaptive behaviors, trainer-rated global functioning and clinical severity, and self-reported child and caregiver stress. Assessments were made at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-months follow-up.

We examined the relationship between candidates' prior psychiatry experience, preparation techniques and expenses, perceptions of the exam and a pass result. We also examined perceptions of well-being.\nA web-based survey was sent to RANZCP trainees. The association between responses and exam outcome was analysed using SPSS Statistics 23.\nA total of 23% ( n\u2009=\u200938) of the cohort responded to the survey. Respondents studied for an average of 7.8\u2009months for the essay-style exam and 4.4\u2009months for the multiple-choice questions. The mean months of total psychiatry experience prior to sitting was 36.1\u2009months. Every additional 50\u2009hours of study increased odds of passing by 23%. Respondents who believed that exam preparation would affect outcome had an almost 4-fold higher odds of passing than those who did not.

This study examined the concurrent relationship among emotion dysregulation, variables from the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), and suicide risk (operationalized as a continuous variable that increases in intensity from nonspecific to active suicide ideation to suicide ideation with a plan) in a clinical adolescent sample.\nA total of 151 adolescents (aged 12-17) were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to determine whether the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by the variables of perceived burdensomeness (PB), thwarted belongingness, and capability for suicide, as proposed by the IPTS.\nAs hypothesized, the relationship between emotion dysregulation and suicide risk was explained by PB and capability for suicide. Depressive symptoms had an independent relationship with suicide risk after controlling for IPTS variables.\nThe results from this study suggest that effective treatment strategies that reduce negative cognition tied to PB and depressive symptoms would address the most proximal variables related to suicide risk in adolescents. Enhancing emotion management would serve to maintain low levels of proximal influences on risk."}, {"Title": "Behavioral health care in solid organ transplantation in a pediatric setting.", "Abstract": "This study examined the demographic, medical, and psychiatric characteristics of transplant patients across organ groups seen by transplant psychology/psychiatry clinicians at a pediatric institution between 2008 and 2014. Chart reviews were conducted to better understand the behavioral health care provided to SOT patients and the role of transplant-dedicated psychology and psychiatry clinicians. Transplant psychology/psychiatry was consulted a total of 1060 times on 399 unique SOT patients over a 6-year period. There were no significant differences in the distribution of age, sex, or ethnicity across organ groups. Common reasons for a consultation included pretransplant evaluation, anxiety, depression, agitation, and general coping. Rates varied by organ groups. Twenty percent of consults also received a psychopharmacological evaluation, with differences in rates between organ groups. Roughly one-third of patients required high frequency of transplant psychology/psychiatry involvement. Lung and heart patients had the highest utilization. Psychiatric diagnosis rates were identified, with adjustment (41.0%) and anxiety disorders (30.1%) being the most common. Pediatric psychology and psychiatry clinicians offer developmentally informed biopsychosocial approaches to treatment for SOT patients. Clarifying the prevalence and nature of behavioral health care provided by organ group can help pediatric providers better understand appropriate psychosocial interventions and resources utilized by this patient population and ultimately guide centers toward a more unified approach to care."}, {"Title": "Delayed anxiety and depressive morbidity among dengue patients in a multi-ethnic urban setting: first report from Sri Lanka.", "Abstract": "Although the physical consequences of dengue are well documented, delayed psychological co-morbidities are not well studied to date. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms among past dengue patients.\nA community-based, case-control study in a multi-ethnic urban setting was conducted in Sri Lanka involving adults who were diagnosed to have dengue fever by a positive dengue IgM antibody response between 6 and 24\u00a0months ago. Self-administered Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-20) and a structured clinical interview by a psychiatrist were done in the patients and in an age and gender-matched control group.\nFifty-three participants each in the patient (mean age 42.9\u00a0years, SD 15.5) and control (mean age 41.6\u00a0years, SD 15.3) groups were surveyed. The ages ranged from 18 to 70\u00a0years and 64.2% were females.

However it is unknown what impact these encounters have regarding job satisfaction. The aim of this study was to evaluate which encounters are perceived as challenging by German GPs and whether they were associated with job satisfaction.\nA total of 1538 questionnaires were sent to GPs in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. GPs should rate 14 medical conditions and 8 traits of patients on the perceived challenge using a Likert scale (1: 'not challenging at all' to 10: 'extremely challenging'). Job satisfaction was measured with the Warr-Cook-Wall job satisfaction scale. A linear regression analyses were used to explore potential associations between for the primary outcome variable 'overall job satisfaction'.\nTotal response was 578 (38%). GPs perceived 16% of their patients as challenging.

GPs were mostly satisfied with 'colleagues' (mean\u2009=\u20095.80) and mostly dissatisfied with their 'hours of work' (mean\u2009=\u20094.20). The linear regression analysis showed no association with challenging medical conditions and traits of patients but only with different aspects of job satisfaction concerning the outcome variable 'overall job satisfaction'.\nEspecially psychiatric conditions are perceived as challenging the question arises, in what amount psychiatric competences are gained during the postgraduate specialty training in general practice and if GPs with a mandatory rotation in psychiatry perceive these conditions as less challenging. Interestingly this study indicates that challenging encounter in terms of challenging medical conditions and traits of patients do not affect GP's job satisfaction."}, {"Title": "Autoimmune phenotypes in schizophrenia reveal novel treatment targets.", "Abstract": "Typical and atypical antipsychotics are the first-line treatments for schizophrenia, but these classes of drugs are not universally effective, and they can have serious side effects that impact compliance. Antipsychotic drugs generally target the dopamine pathways with some variation. As research of schizophrenia pathophysiology has shifted away from a strictly dopamine-centric focus, the development of new pharmacotherapies has waned. A field of inquiry with centuries-old roots is gaining traction in psychiatric research circles and may represent a new frontier for drug discovery in schizophrenia. At the forefront of this investigative effort is the immune system and its many components, pathways and phenotypes, which are now known to actively engage the brain. Studies in schizophrenia reveal an intricate association of environmentally-driven immune activation in concert with a disrupted genetic template. A consistent conduit through this gene-environmental milieu is the gut-brain axis, which when dysregulated can generate pathological autoimmunity. In this review, we present epidemiological and biochemical evidence in support of an autoimmune component in schizophrenia and depict gut processes and a dysbiotic microbiome as a source and perpetuator of autoimmune dysfunction in the brain. Within this framework, we review the role of infectious agents, inflammation, gut dysbioses and autoantibody propagation on CNS pathologies such as neurotransmitter receptor hypofunction and complement pathway-mediated synaptic pruning. We then review the new pharmacotherapeutic horizon and novel agents directed to impact these pathological conditions. At the core of this discourse is the understanding that schizophrenia is etiologically and pathophysiologically heterogeneous and thus its treatment requires individualized attention with disease state variants diagnosed with objective biomarkers."}, {"Title": "A systematic review of genome-wide research on psychotic experiences and negative symptom traits: new revelations and implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "We present a systematic review of genome-wide research on psychotic experience and negative symptom (PENS) traits in the community. We integrate these new findings, most of which have emerged over the last four years, with more established behaviour genetic and epidemiological research. The review includes the first genome-wide association studies of PENS, including a recent meta-analysis, and the first SNP heritability estimates. Sample sizes of\u2009<10\u00a0000 participants mean that no genome-wide significant variants have yet been replicated. Importantly, however, in the most recent and well-powered studies, polygenic risk score prediction and linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression analyses show that all types of PENS share genetic influences with diagnosed schizophrenia and that negative symptom traits also share genetic influences with major depression. These genetic findings corroborate other evidence in supporting a link between PENS in the community and psychiatric conditions. Beyond the systematic review, we highlight recent work on gene-environment correlation, which appears to be a relevant process for psychotic experiences. Genes that influence risk factors such as tobacco use and stressful life events are likely to be harbouring 'hits' that also influence PENS. We argue for the acceptance of PENS within the mainstream, as heritable traits in the same vein as other sub-clinical psychopathology and personality styles such as neuroticism. While acknowledging some mixed findings, new evidence shows genetic overlap between PENS and psychiatric conditions. In sum, normal variations in adolescent and adult thinking styles, such as feeling paranoid, are heritable and show genetic associations with schizophrenia and major depression."}, {"Title": "A Perspective on a Possible Relation Between the Psychopathology of the Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Spectrum and Unconjugated Bilirubin: A Longitudinal Protocol Study.", "Abstract": "Some authors suggest a relation between Unconjugated Bilirubin (UCB) plasma high levels and schizophrenia, as schizophrenia patients have been showing higher UCB levels when compared with other psychiatric patients and general population. These higher UCB levels have been already correlated with acute psychotic states, positive symptoms, and poor outcome in patients with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders share common symptoms but there aren't yet accepted biomarkers for their distinction. In our study protocol we propose an observational longitudinal study on a sample composed of two subgroups: patients with schizophrenia and patients with schizoaffective disorder. We will compare the UCB levels between groups, and search for a possible correlation with patient's psychopathology. For that purpose we will use nosological, psychopathological, neuropsychological, and psychosocial instruments. Thus we will be testing two different hypotheses: (1) Is UCB serum level a diagnosis indicator, with categorical distinction potential, between groups of patients with different psychotic disorders? (2) Is UCB serum level a severity indicator, with dimensional distinction potential, among groups of patients with the same psychotic disorder? We believe that UCB mean levels may contribute to some clarification of this controversy, as a potential biological indicator, facilitating the distinction between these two diagnostic categories and\\or discriminating the dimensional severity among each of these psychotic conditions. Thus we may be opening a new opportunities for innovative and exciting biological psychiatry research regarding organic aspects in the schizophrenia spectrum."}, {"Title": "Innovative Educational Initiatives to Train Psychodynamic Psychiatrists in Underserved Areas of the World.", "Abstract": "Psychodynamic psychiatry remains a challenging subject to teach in underserved areas, where enthusiasm to learn is substantial.

In this group there were also a greater number of depressive episodes over the course of illness, accompanied by more psychotic symptoms and a higher incidence of comorbidity. Moreover, these patients apparently lacked insight into their own mania and hypomania symptoms, resulting in difficulties in early diagnosis, longer time needed to confirm the diagnosis, higher rate of hospitalization, and greater number of hospitalizations."}, {"Title": "A pilot study of MD (psychiatry) theses-based research.", "Abstract": "Undertaking a research project is mandatory for MD Psychiatry trainees.

Guided by computational frameworks, we formulated and tested two scenarios in which maladaptive representations of expected value should be most evident, thereby delineating conditions that may evoke decision-making impairments in schizophrenia.\nIn a modified reinforcement learning paradigm, 42 medicated people with schizophrenia and 36 healthy volunteers learned to select the most frequently rewarded option in a 75-25 pair: once when presented with a more deterministic (90-10) pair and once when presented with a more probabilistic (60-40) pair. Novel and old combinations of choice options were presented in a subsequent transfer phase. Computational modeling was employed to elucidate contributions from stimulus-response systems (actor-critic) and expected value (Q-learning).\nPeople with schizophrenia showed robust performance impairments with increasing value difference between two competing options, which strongly correlated with decreased contributions from expected value-based learning (Q-learning). Moreover, a subtle yet consistent contextual choice bias for the probabilistic 75 option was present in people with schizophrenia, which could be accounted for by a context-dependent reward prediction error in the actor-critic.\nWe provide evidence that decision-making impairments in schizophrenia increase monotonically with demands placed on expected value computations. A contextual choice bias is consistent with overreliance on stimulus-response learning, which may signify a deficit secondary to the maladaptive representation of expected value. These results shed new light on conditions under which decision-making impairments may arise."}, {"Title": "Use of a Gabapentin Protocol for the Management of Alcohol Withdrawal: A Preliminary Experience Expanding From the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Service.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepines are the conventional mainstay to manage alcohol withdrawal; however, patients are subsequently at increased risk for poor sleep, cravings, and return to drinking. Research on alternative pharmacologic agents to facilitate safe alcohol withdrawal is scant. Gabapentin is one medication shown in small studies to reduce the need for benzodiazepines in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. The continuation of gabapentin after alcohol withdrawal appears to be safe during early sobriety and may aid in reducing alcohol-related cravings or returning to alcohol consumption. Use of a gabapentin-based, benzodiazepine-sparing protool began in early 2015 by the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Service.\nA retrospective chart review was conducted to detect any safety concerns with use of a gabapentin protocol for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\nSecondary outcomes were derived by comparing a matched cohort of patients who received benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\nSeventy-seven patients had their alcohol withdrawal managed via a gabapentin protocol during the study period. No patients required transfer to a higher level of care or had a documented withdrawal seizure. Length of stay between the gabapentin protocol group and benzodiazepine group were similar.\nThis preliminary data has supported the frequent use of this protocol in the general internal medicine practice and formalization of an institutional order set of this protocol for mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

Fear can involve both acute and potential threats that can manifest in different behaviors and result from activity within different neural nodes and networks. Fear circuits have been studied extensively in animal models for several decades and in human neuroimaging research for almost 20 years. Therefore, the centrality of fear processing to PTSD lends the disorder to be more tractable to investigation at the level of brain and behavior, and provides several observable phenotypes that can be linked to PTSD symptoms. Moreover, psychophysiological metrics of fear conditioning offer tools that can be used to shift diagnostic paradigms in psychiatry toward neurobiology-consistent with a Research Domain Criteria approach to PTSD. In general, mammalian fear processing can be divided into fear learning (or acquisition), during which an association develops between previously neutral stimuli and aversive outcomes, and fear extinction, in which the latter associations are suppressed by a new form of learning. This review describes translational research in both fear acquisition and extinction, along with their relevance to PTSD and PTSD treatment, focusing specifically on the empirical value and potential clinical utility of psychophysiological methods."}, {"Title": "Institutionalised otherness: Patients references to psychiatric diagnostic categories.", "Abstract": "Diagnosis is integral part of the way medicine organises illness: it is important for identifying treatment options, predicting outcomes and providing an explanatory framework for clinicians. Previous research has shown that during a medical visit not only the clinician but also patients provide explanations for the causes of their symptoms and health problems. Patients' lifeworld explanations are often differentiated from the diagnostic explanations provided by clinicians. However, while previous conversation analytic research has elaborated the ways in which diagnostic and lifeworld explanations are interactionally structured in somatic medicine, there is little research on how these explanations are organised in psychiatry. Psychiatric diagnosis is particularly interesting because in mental disorders illness itself is not determined by any objective measurement. Understanding of the patient's problem is constructed in interaction between the patient and clinician. The focus of this research will be patients' references to diagnosis in psychiatry and the functions of these references. The findings are based on conversation analysis of 29 audio-recorded diagnostic interviews in a psychiatric outpatient clinic. Our results demonstrate that patients can utilise diagnostic categories in several ways: disavowing a category to distance their symptoms from it, accounting for their life experiences being rooted in psychiatric illnesses and explaining their illnesses as being caused by certain life experiences. We argue that these explanations are important in patients' face-work - in constructing and maintaining a coherent and meaningful view of the patient's self."}, {"Title": "Investigation of belinostat-induced genomic instability by molecular cytogenetic analysis and pathway-focused gene expression profiling.", "Abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs), which regulate transcription and specific functions such as tumor suppression by p53, are frequently altered in tumors and have a contentious role in carcinogenesis. HDAC inhibitors, which have a long history of use in psychiatry and neurology, have recently been tested as possible treatments for tumors. Belinostat received regulatory approval in the USA on July 3, 2014, for use against peripheral T-cell lymphoma. However, the unavailability of information on belinostat genotoxicity in normal cells and the molecular mechanisms involved in the genetic instability after exposure to belinostat encouraged us to conduct this study. Our data showed that the exposure of mice to belinostat at the recommended human doses induced chromosome breakage, whole-chromosome lagging, and oxidative DNA damage in bone marrow cells in a dose-dependent manner. The expression levels of 84 genes involved in the DNA damage signaling pathway were evaluated by using an RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array. Belinostat exposure altered the expression of 25 genes, with statistically significant changes observed in 17 genes. The array results were supported by RT-PCR and western blotting experiments. Collectively, our results showed that belinostat exposure caused oxidative DNA damage and downregulated the expression of genes involved in DNA damage repair, which may be responsible for belinostat-induced genomic instability. Thus, the clinical usage of this drug should be weighed against the hazards of carcinogenesis, and the observed genotoxicity profile of belinostat may support further development of efficient HDAC inhibitors with weaker genotoxicity."}, {"Title": "Skin picking disorder: prevalence, correlates, and associations with quality of life in a large sample.", "Abstract": "Evidence suggests that skin picking disorder (SPD) could be a prevalent condition associated with comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. However, just a few studies have assessed the prevalence and correlates of SPD in samples from low- and middle-income countries.

Despite the optimism and some significant progress in biological markers, it has become increasingly evident that they are failing to meet initial expectations due to their lack of specificity, inconsistent reliability and limited availability. On the other hand, there is an increasingly emerging evidence of mobile technologies' feasibility to measure mental illness activity. Moreover, taking into account its widespread use, availability and potential to capture behavioural markers, mobile-connected technologies could be strong candidates to fill and complement-at least at some degree-the gaps that biological markers couldn't. This represents an especially interesting opportunity to reform our current diagnostic system using a bottom-up research methodology based on digital and biological markers data instead of the classical traditional top-down approach. Therefore, the field might benefit of further exploring this promising -and increasingly evidence-based- pathway as well as other auspicious alternatives in order to attain a more holistic and integrative approach in research, which could ultimately impact real-world clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Improving cognitive training for schizophrenia using neuroplasticity enhancers: Lessons from decades of basic and clinical research.", "Abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that schizophrenia is a disorder that stems from maladaptive plasticity within neural circuits and produces broad cognitive deficits leading to loss of autonomy. A large number of studies have identified abnormalities spanning many neurotransmitter systems in schizophrenia, and as a result, a variety of drugs have been developed to attempt to treat these abnormalities and enhance cognition. Unfortunately, positive results have been limited so far. This may be in part because the scope of abnormalities in the schizophrenic brain requires a treatment capable of engaging many different neurotransmitter systems. One approach to achieving this kind of treatment has been to use neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training programs to stimulate the formation of more adaptive circuits. Although the number of studies implementing this approach has increased exponentially in recent years, effect sizes for cognitive gains have been modest and adherence to treatment remains an important challenge in many studies, as patients are often required to train for 40\u202fh or more. In the present paper, we argue that cognitive training protocols will benefit from the addition of cognitive enhancers to produce more robust and longer lasting targeted neuroplasticity. Indeed, recent data from animal studies have provided support for combining plasticity-enhancing drugs with tailored behavioral training paradigms to restore normal function within dysfunctioning neural circuits. The advantages and challenges of applying this approach to patients with schizophrenia will be discussed."}, {"Title": "Metabolic syndrome and associated factors among psychiatric patients in Jimma University Specialized Hospital, South West Ethiopia.", "Abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a multisystem disorder which coined to describe the recognized clustering of metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abnormalities of glucose homeostasis.\nTo assess the prevalence and associated factors of metabolic syndrome among psychiatric patients in Jimma University Specialized Hospital.\nThis study was conducted at Jimma University Specialized hospital psychiatric ward from May 15 to July 16, 2015.

Yet tools to map, model, predict, and change connectivity are difficult to develop, largely because of the complex, dynamic, and multivariate nature of interactions between brain regions. Network neuroscience (NN) provides a theoretical framework and mathematical toolset to address these difficulties. Building on areas of mathematics such as graph theory, NN in its simplest form summarizes neuroimaging data by treating brain regions as nodes in a graph and by treating interactions or connections between nodes as edges in the graph. Network metrics can then be used to quantitatively describe the architecture of the graph, which in turn reflects the network's function. We review evidence supporting the utility of NN in understanding psychiatric disorders, with a focus on normative brain network development and abnormalities associated with psychosis. We also emphasize relevant methodological challenges, such as motion artifact correction, which are particularly important to consider when applying network tools to developmental neuroimaging data. We close with a discussion of several emerging frontiers of NN in psychiatry, including generative network modeling and network control theory. We aim to offer an accessible introduction to this emerging field and motivate further work that uses NN to better understand the normative development of brain networks and alterations in that development that accompany or foreshadow psychiatric disease."}, {"Title": "Quality of life and satisfaction with inpatient treatment in adolescents with psychiatric disorders : A\u00a0comparison between patients', parents', and caregivers' (self-)assessments at admission and discharge.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare results of patients', parents', and caregivers' (nursing staff and educators) (self-)assessments of quality of life, treatment outcomes, and satisfaction with inpatient treatment in a\u00a0child and adolescent psychiatric hospital.

Each eConsult was also categorized by clinical topic and question type in predetermined categories. Mandatory post-eConsult surveys for primary care providers were analyzed to determine the number of traditional consults avoided and to gain insight into the perceived value of eConsults.\nOf the 5597 eConsults, 169 psychiatry eConsults were completed during the study period. The average response time for a specialist to a primary care provider was 2.3\u00a0days. Eighty-seven percent of clinical responses were completed by the psychiatrist in less than 15\u00a0min. The primary care providers most commonly asked clinical questions were about depressive and anxiety disorders. 88.7% of PCPs rated the eConsult service a 5 (excellent value) or 4.\nThis study indicates that an eConsult psychiatry service has tremendous potential to improve access to psychiatric advice and expand the capacity to treat mental illness in primary care. Future research may include follow-up with PCPs regarding the implementation of specialist advice."}, {"Title": "Cause-specific mortality in Finnish forensic psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "To analyze the causes of mortality among patients committed to compulsory forensic psychiatric hospital treatment in Finland during 1980-2009 by categorizing the causes of mortality into somatic diseases, suicides and other unnatural deaths.\nThe causes of mortality were analyzed among 351 patients who died during the follow-up. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated as the ratio of observed and expected number of deaths by using the subject-years methods with 95% confidence intervals, assuming a Poisson distribution. The expected number of deaths was calculated on the basis of sex-, age- and calendar-period-specific mortality rates for the Finnish population.\nThe vast majority (249/351) of deaths were due to a somatic disease with SMR of 2.6 (mean age at death 61 years). Fifty nine patients committed suicide with a SMR of 7.1 (mean age at death 40 years). Four patients were homicide victims (mean age at death 40 years) and 32 deaths were accidental (mean age at death 52 years). The combined homicides and accidental deaths resulted in a SMR of 1.7.\nThe results of this study point out that the high risk for suicide should receive attention when the hospital treatment and the outpatient care is being organized for forensic psychiatric patients. In addition, the risk of accidents should be evaluated and it should be assured that the patients receive proper somatic healthcare during the forensic psychiatric treatment and that it continues also in the outpatient setting."}, {"Title": "Cross-Cultural Psychometric Properties of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.", "Abstract": "The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is considered the gold standard measure of depression. The factor structure of the HDRS is generally unstable, but 4 to 8 items appear to form a general depression factor. As transcultural studies of the HDRS have received little attention, and as most of the studies have taken a data-driven approach with a tendency to yield fragmented results, it is not clear if an HDRS general depression factor can also be found in non-Western populations. This is an important issue in deciding on the appropriateness of the scale as a gold standard in transcultural psychiatry.\nA systematic review was carried out to compare previously reported factor structures of the HDRS in non-Western cultures. Overlapping clusters across studies were identified and subsequently tested with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of responses from an independent sample.\nFourteen relevant studies were identified, 12 of which were obtained. A general depression factor was identified, consisting of the following symptoms: depressed mood, guilt, loss of interests, retardation, suicide, and psychological anxiety. The subsequent CFA analysis supported the fit of this model.\nThis study indicates that a general depression cluster is manifest in responses to the HDRS across cultures. While psychometric properties of the full-length HDRS are still debated, the general depression cluster appears pertinent to the assessment of depression across cultures. We recommend that cross-cultural clinicians and researchers focus on the use of unidimensional depression scales, which are in agreement with this cluster."}, {"Title": "The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis: A Brief History.", "Abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is central to homeostasis, stress responses, energy metabolism, and neuropsychiatric function.

Pyramid Club is a school-based, socio-emotional intervention, demonstrably effective with primary-aged pupils.\nThis study extends previous Pyramid Club evaluations by examining effectiveness with pupils in early secondary education; service users' perceptions and experiences were investigated to increase understanding of Pyramid's impact, thus supporting enhanced practice.\nParticipants (n\u00a0=\u00a0126) comprised selected pupils, aged 11-14 (52 males; 74 females), who completed the 10\u00a0week programme (Pyramid group) and a non-intervention comparison group.

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), informant-rated version (Goodman, 1997, J Child Psychol Psychiat, 38, 581) and self-report version (Goodman, Meltzer, & Bailey, 1998, Europ Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 7, 125), was used to measure socio-emotional well-being: pre-club (baseline assessment), post-test (within 2\u00a0weeks of programme completion), and at 12-month follow-up (informant-rated version only). Focus groups were conducted separately with Pyramid pupils and Club leaders.\nFindings from informants and self-reports identified significant improvements for the Pyramid group in total difficulties and on pertinent SDQ subscales (e.g., emotional symptoms and peer relationship problems) at post-test. Improvements were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Comparison pupils demonstrated minimal change over time. Thematic analysis of qualitative data supported the quantitative findings and provided valuable insights into the Pyramid Club experience.\nFindings contribute to evidence-based, preventative models for the early adolescent population and support the social validity of Pyramid Club."}, {"Title": "Cognitive remediation in large systems of psychiatric care.", "Abstract": "IntroductionWith the increasing enthusiasm to provide cognitive remediation (CR) as an evidence-based practice, questions arise as to what is involved in implementing CR in a large system of care. This article describes the first statewide implementation of CR in the USA, with the goal of documenting the implementation issues that care providers are likely to face when bringing CR services to their patients.\nIn 2014, the New York State Office of Mental Health set up a Cognitive Health Service that could be implemented throughout the state-operated system of care. This service was intended to broadly address cognitive health, to assure that the cognitive deficits commonly associated with psychiatric illnesses are recognized and addressed, and that cognitive health is embedded in the vocabulary of wellness. It involved creating a mechanism to train staff to recognize how cognitive health could be prioritized in treatment planning as well as implementing CR in state-operated adult outpatient psychiatry clinics.\nBy 2017, CR was available at clinics serving people with serious mental illness in 13 of 16 adult Psychiatric Centers, located in rural and urban settings throughout New York state. The embedded quality assurance program evaluation tools indicated that CR was acceptable, sustainable, and effective.\nCognitive remediation can be feasibly implemented in large systems of care that provide a multilevel system of supports, a training program that educates broadly about cognitive health and specifically about the delivery of CR, and embedded, ongoing program evaluation that is linked to staff supervision."}, {"Title": "Trends in Results of HBIPS National Performance Measures and Association With Year of Adoption.", "Abstract": "Multiple studies demonstrate a consistent pattern of improvement on quality measures among health care organizations after they begin collecting and reporting data. This study compared results on psychiatric performance measures among cohorts of hospitals with different characteristics that elected to begin reporting on the measures at various points in time.\nQuarterly reporting of Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services (HBIPS) measures to the Joint Commission was used to examine trends in performance among four hospital cohorts that began reporting in 2009 (N=243), 2011 (N=139), 2014 (N=137), or 2015 (N=372). The HBIPS measures address admission screening, restraint and seclusion use, justification of use of multiple antipsychotic medications, and discharge planning. Comparisons were based upon initial quarters of data reported and change rates.\nAfter adjustment for covariates, the analyses showed that all cohorts significantly improved across quarters for admission screening, justification of multiple antipsychotic medications, and discharge planning. Restraint hours significantly dropped over the initial reporting periods, but only for the 2009 and 2015 cohorts. Seclusion hours significantly dropped over the six reporting periods for all cohorts except 2011.\nSeveral differences were observed across cohorts in the rate of change between baseline and final measurement for various measures. In nearly every case, however, hospitals that began reporting measurement data earlier performed better than subsequent cohorts during the later cohorts' first quarter of reporting."}, {"Title": "Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence: a Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "School violence has increased over the past ten years. This study evaluated students using a more standard and sensitive method to help identify students who are at high risk for school violence. 103 participants were recruited through Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) from psychiatry outpatient clinics, the inpatient units, and the emergency department. Participants (ages 12-18) were active students in 74 traditional schools (i.e. non-online education). Collateral information was gathered from guardians before participants were evaluated. School risk evaluations were performed with each participant, and audio recordings from the evaluations were later transcribed and manually annotated. The BRACHA (School Version) and the School Safety Scale (SSS), both 14-item scales, were used. A template of open-ended questions was also used. This analysis included 103 participants who were recruited from 74 different schools. Of the 103 students evaluated, 55 were found to be moderate to high risk and 48 were found to be low risk based on the paper risk assessments including the BRACHA and SSS. Both the BRACHA and the SSS were highly correlated with risk of violence to others (Pearson correlations>0.82). There were significant differences in BRACHA and SSS total scores between low risk and high risk to others groups (p-values <0.001 under unpaired t-test). In particular, there were significant differences in individual SSS items between the two groups (p-value <0.001). Of these items, Previous Violent Behavior (Pearson Correlation\u2009=\u20090.80), Impulsivity (0.69), School Problems (0.64), and Negative Attitudes (0.61) were positively correlated with risk to others. The novel machine learning algorithm achieved an AUC of 91.02% when using the interview content to predict risk of school violence, and the AUC increased to 91.45% when demographic and socioeconomic data were added. Our study indicates that the BRACHA and SSS are clinically useful for assessing risk for school violence. The machine learning algorithm was highly accurate in assessing school violence risk."}, {"Title": "Hans Asperger, National Socialism, and \"race hygiene\" in Nazi-era Vienna.", "Abstract": "Hans Asperger (1906-1980) first designated a group of children with distinct psychological characteristics as 'autistic psychopaths' in 1938, several years before Leo Kanner's famous 1943 paper on autism. In 1944, Asperger published a comprehensive study on the topic (submitted to Vienna University in 1942 as his postdoctoral thesis), which would only find international acknowledgement in the 1980s. From then on, the eponym 'Asperger's syndrome' increasingly gained currency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the conceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact that Asperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Vienna caused some controversy regarding his potential ties to National Socialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidence was scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as an active opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goal of this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is based to a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and on a small segment of his published work.\nDrawing on a vast array of contemporary publications and previously unexplored archival documents (including Asperger's personnel files and the clinical assessments he wrote on his patients), this paper offers a critical examination of Asperger's life, politics, and career before and during the Nazi period in Austria.\nAsperger managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities. He joined several organizations affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself), publicly legitimized race hygiene policies including forced sterilizations and, on several occasions, actively cooperated with the child 'euthanasia' program. The language he employed to diagnose his patients was often remarkably harsh (even in comparison with assessments written by the staff at Vienna's notorious Spiegelgrund 'euthanasia' institution), belying the notion that he tried to protect the children under his care by embellishing their diagnoses.\nThe narrative of Asperger as a principled opponent of National Socialism and a courageous defender of his patients against Nazi 'euthanasia' and other race hygiene measures does not hold up in the face of the historical evidence. What emerges is a much more problematic role played by this pioneer of autism research. Future use of the eponym should reflect the troubling context of its origins in Nazi-era Vienna."}, {"Title": "Characteristics and Pathways of Long-Stay Patients in High and Medium Secure Settings in England; A Secondary Publication From a Large Mixed-Methods Study.", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Many patients experience extended stays within forensic care, but the characteristics of long-stay patients are poorly understood. <b>Aims:</b> To describe the characteristics of long-stay patients in high and medium secure settings in England. <b>Method:</b> Detailed file reviews provided clinical, offending and risk data for a large representative sample of 401 forensic patients from 2 of the 3 high secure settings and from 23 of the 57 medium secure settings in England on 1 April 2013. The threshold for long-stay status was defined as 5 years in medium secure care or 10 years in high secure care, or 15 years in a combination of high and medium secure settings. <b>Results:</b> 22% of patients in high security and 18% in medium security met the definition for \"long-stay,\" with 20% staying longer than 20 years. Of the long-stay sample, 58% were violent offenders (22% both sexual and violent), 27% had been convicted for violent or sexual offences whilst in an institutional setting, and 26% had committed a serious assault on staff in the last 5 years. The most prevalent diagnosis was schizophrenia (60%) followed by personality disorder (47%, predominantly antisocial and borderline types); 16% were categorised as having an intellectual disability. Overall, 7% of the long-stay sample had never been convicted of any offence, and 16.5% had no index offence prompting admission. Although some significant differences were found between the high and medium secure samples, there were more similarities than contrasts between these two levels of security. The treatment pathways of these long-stay patients involved multiple moves between settings. An unsuccessful referral to a setting of lower security was recorded over the last 5 years for 33% of the sample. <b>Conclusions:</b> Long-stay patients accounted for one fifth of the forensic inpatient population in England in this representative sample. A significant proportion of this group remain unsettled. High levels of personality pathology and the risk of assaults on staff and others within the care setting are likely to impact on treatment and management. Further research into the treatment pathways of longer stay patients is warranted to understand the complex trajectories of this group."}, {"Title": "A Pilot Evaluating Clinical Pharmacy Services in an Ambulatory Psychiatry Setting.", "Abstract": "A pilot of clinical services provided by psychiatric clinical pharmacists in an outpatient clinic are described and evaluated. The primary objective was to evaluate the difference in change of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Questionnaire scores between the two groups. Secondary objectives were to assess time patients spent in clinic, time to target psychotropic medication dose, and patient self-reported medication adherence.\nData were collected from January 2014 to November 2015 for patients with depression and/or anxiety who had an appointment within an outpatient psychiatric clinic with either a provider (control) or both a provider and clinical pharmacist (case).\nA total of 217 patients were included in the study; 117 patients served as controls and 100 patients received clinical pharmacist intervention. No statistical difference was detected in the primary outcome. However, patients in the case group had higher baseline PHQ-9/GAD scores, and the frequency of measured values was lower than anticipated, limiting power to detect a difference. All secondary outcomes achieved statistical significance. Both time in clinic and time to reach a stabilized psychotropic medication regimen were shorter in the control group. Patient self-reported adherence favored a higher adherence rate in the intervention group.\nWhile this study found no significant difference in the change in PHQ-9/GAD scores between groups, it demonstrated the need for enhanced utilization of measurement-based outcomes in the psychiatric setting.

Participants were recruited from a specialized clinic for the early detection of psychosis at the Department of Psychiatry (Universit\u00e4re Psychiatrische Kliniken [UPK]), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. Participants included individuals in the following 4 study groups: 44 healthy controls (HC group), 63 at-risk mental state (ARMS) individuals without later transition to psychosis (ARMS-NT group), 16 ARMS individuals with later transition to psychosis (ARMS-T group), and 38 antipsychotic-free patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP group). The study dates were November 2008 to November 2014. The dates of analysis were March to November 2017.\nGyrification-based structural covariance networks (connectomes) were constructed to quantify global integration, segregation, and small-worldness. Group differences in network measures were assessed using functional data analysis across a range of network densities. The extremely randomized trees algorithm with repeated 5-fold cross-validation was used to delineate ARMS-T individuals from ARMS-NT individuals. Permutation tests were conducted to assess the significance of classification performance measures.\nThe 4 study groups comprised 161 participants with mean (SD) ages ranging from 24.0 (4.7) to 25.9 (5.7) years. Small-worldness was reduced in the ARMS-T and FEP groups and was associated with decreased integration and increased segregation in both groups (Hedges g range, 0.666-1.050).

According to the multivariate analysis, the increase in psychotropic medication was associated with the study year (in 2000 39%, in 2011 58%), but could not be explained by changes in diagnostic profiles, age distribution, suicidality, violence or the Children's Global Assessment Scale scores. The use of combined psychotropic medication increased from 9% in 2000 to 25% in 2011.

In this perspective, the readers are learning about psychosis in the professional's language and from the author's viewpoint. Most often the textbooks communicate a universal image of people with psychosis, a description that fits with the diagnostic criteria. The analysis also shows that two textbooks in psychiatric nursing combined this perspective with a 'perspective from within'. Here, the readers are learning about psychosis from the patients' own viewpoint. The authors communicate a personal, psychotic universe that differs from various people, even if they have the same diagnosis, and the descriptions are focusing on the patient as a whole person.\nDrawing partly on Rita Charon's writings about narrative knowledge in the health field, and partly on insights from Martha Nussbaum and her concept of narrative imagination, we argue that mental health professionals need to learn about, understand and fathom what patients go through by reading, listening to and acknowledging the patients' own stories and experiences.

Reccurring MDD is also known as unipolar disorder. The distinction between unipolar and bipolar disorders was first suggested in 1957 by Leonard and was made official after support by several studies in 1980. Indeed, in 150 AD, Aretaeus of Cappadocia wrote \"It seems to me that melancholia is the beginning and a part of mania\". Additionally, Kraepelin, who proposed the first medical disease model in psychiatry a century ago, considered recurrent unipolar depression cases under the category of bipolar disorder and conceptualized spectrum disorders. Because today's classification systems conduct cross-sectional diagnosis, they do not consider family history, long-term characteristics and multidimensional approaches on symptoms. This method prioritizes reliability over validity and it rules out psychiatric disorders in etiology. Actually, a spectrum model which covers physical diseases is conceivable. The concept of epigenetics considers mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, Carney syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type I and II, breast and prostate cancers, carsinoid tumors, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome together. This review addressed the relationship between metabolic syndrome and mood disorders in this context along with genetic, clinical and environmental factors such as climate, geographic factors, migration and changeable lifestyles.

I was also the family doctor to the surrounding villages, in which children were considerably more materially deprived than their peers in the orphanage who had three meals a day, chlorinated running water, and a reliable school. What the orphanage children did not have was family care-instead they experienced rotating shifts of carers, many of whom were travelers like me, some only there for one or two weeks. Prior to my trip, a senior child psychiatrist had armed me with Bowlby's Attachment and Loss<sup>2</sup> and a photocopy of the ICD-10 classification of \"disinhibited attachment disorder.\" My dual role in the orphanage soon made it obvious that the social behavior of many of the institutionalized children was grossly different from that of their family-reared peers. Strangers could not walk into the orphanage until they had peeled off the hands of the small children who had crowded them. In contrast, children in local family homes peeked out from behind their mother's skirts-just as John Bowlby had said they would. Indiscriminate behavior was adaptive in the orphanage setting, because otherwise emotionally neglected children received bursts of attunement from whichever carer was available. The same indiscriminate behavior was, however, highly maladaptive outside the orphanage setting, as children would wander off without checking back and put themselves in danger."}, {"Title": "The Journal and the Academy.", "Abstract": "Every issue of the Journal includes 2 pages between the front cover and the table of contents-1 that lists the editorial team, or masthead, who assess submissions and select content and another that lists the officers of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Journal's sponsoring society and owner.

In addition, other selected organizational, economic and financial elements of the psychiatric care system were analyzed.\nIn 2013, compared to 2010, increased the number of mental health care organizations: outpatient mental health clinics (an increase of 37 clinics), outpatient mental health day hospital wards (an increase of 25 wards) and community psychiatric treatment teams (an increase of 74 teams). The largest increase in the value of contracts (approx. 150%) was related to community treatment teams.\nBetween 2010 and 2013 there was an increase in the value of cleared contracts in psychiatric care, in general and in each of the three forms of psychiatric care (i.e., in day wards, outpatient mental health clinics and in community teams). The highest increase in investments included community treatment teams, to a lesser extent day wards and outpatient clinics.

For the first time, kleptomania as an accompanying symptom rather than a formal diagnosis was included in the classification of psychiatric disorders of the American Psychiatric Association DSM-I in 1952. It was included in the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 and classified under \"habit and impulse disorders\". Kleptomania is a serious disorder, as numerous thefts are impulsively carried out, carrying the risk of detection and consequently criminal liability. In Poland, we lack epidemiological data, however, it is estimated that 5% of those who commit theft are affected by kleptomania. People suffering from this disorder often do not seek a medical opinion so reviewing such cases is challenging for expert psychiatrists. The authors have proposed the term \"kleptomania spectrum\" for defining cases in which patients have an intense urge to steal, experienced a sense of tension from such an action, and relief following it, however, the criterion of theft of a superfluous object, without a profitable motive for themselves or others is not met."}, {"Title": "Ways of understanding of religious delusions associated with a change of identity on the example of identification with Jesus Christ.", "Abstract": "Identification with Christ among psychiatric patients is an example of a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. As a delusion it includes a misidentification (change of identity) in the layer of content and, usually, grandiosity and/or paranoid traits in the formal aspect. What is more, it fits in the category of religious delusions, which are perhaps the most controversial type of delusions and as such require special sensitivity as well as knowledge beyond psychology or psychiatry. The aim of the articleis to show the phenomenon of identification with Christ among psychiatric patients, taking into account different ways of its explaining and understanding. Papers relating to the topic, both theoretical considerations and case studies, found in the EBSCO database were analyzed. Searching for the articles the following key words were used: identity, identification, delusion, Jesus/Christ/Messiah, psychosis, schizophrenia. The analysis included all (actually not numerous) articles except for the one linked to cognitive approach which did not significantly contribute to the issue. Given the multiplicity of ways of explaining and understanding the experience of identification with the figure of the Messiah, it seems to be a mistake to hold both objectivist and one-sided, based on one theory, attitude towards it. Such an experience should be recognized in the context of the history of patient's life and the all possible mechanisms leading to its occurrence, as well as the meanings hidden beneath the symptom, should be take into account. It is also important to be well-oriented in the system of religious beliefs and spiritual needs of the patient."}, {"Title": "Editorial.", "Abstract": "no summary."}, {"Title": "A Four-Week Reflective Writing Program in the Psychiatry Clerkship: Testing Effects on Reflective Capacity.", "Abstract": "Reflective capacity is the ability to review and reconstruct the importance, emotional impact, and outcomes of an experience to give it added meaning and context.

As such, it is critical that medical students receive appropriate education in both pain management and addiction. The purpose of this study was to assess the pre-clinical curriculum in pain medicine and addiction from the perspective of students after they had completed their pre-clinical training and to assess what they perceived as the strengths and weaknesses of their training.\nThe authors conducted focused interviews among clinical medical students who had completed at least 6\u00a0months of clerkships. The interviews targeted the students' retrospective opinions about the pre-clinical curriculum and their preparedness for clinical encounters with either pain or addiction-related issues during their rotations. Coders thematically analyzed the de-identified interview transcripts, with consensus reached through discussion and code modification.\nThemes that emerged through the focused interviews included: fragmented curricular structure (and insufficient time) for pain and addiction medicine, not enough specific treatment strategies for pain or addiction, especially for complex clinical scenarios, and lack of a trained work-force to provide guidance in the management of pain and addiction.\nThis study demonstrated the feasibility of gathering student perspectives to inform changes to improve the pre-clinical curriculum in pain and addiction medicine. Students identified multiple areas for improvement at the pre-clerkship level, which have informed updates to the curriculum.

It is a significant, international patient safety issue affecting medical, surgical and mental health in-patients. There is a paucity of published evidence on the incidence of VTE, and the role of VTE risk-assessment and prophylaxis, in mental healthcare settings. Epidemiological evidence indicates that antipsychotic medications are an independent risk factor for VTE. Objective To explore healthcare practitioners' experiences and perspectives regarding VTE prophylaxis for in-patients in mental health services in Ireland. Setting This study was conducted in two national teaching hospitals in Dublin, Ireland. Method This experiential, qualitative study was conducted using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling was used to allow strategic selection of participants from the pharmacy, medical and nursing disciplines. Data was analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies guidelines were used as a reporting framework. Main outcome measure Participants' views on VTE prophylaxis for mental health in-patients. Results Five key themes were derived: risk factors in mental health, attitudes to risk-assessment, challenges with VTE prophylaxis, lack of awareness, and lack of evidence in mental health. Conclusion The results indicate considerable diversities in perceived risk of VTE, and in experiences with VTE risk-assessment and prophylaxis. VTE risk was considered in practice specifically for immobile, older adults and eating disorder patients on bed rest. Specific research is required to address this area of clinical uncertainty in mental health."}, {"Title": "Quality of life and social functioning of former long-stay psychiatric patients transferred into the community: a 10 year follow up study.", "Abstract": "Deinstitutionalisation in Ireland began following the impetus of the successful transfer of psychiatric patients into the community in other countries. This study sought to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) and social functioning (SF) of former long-stay institutionalised patients with severe and enduring mental illness who had been relocated into local community settings and followed up 10\u00a0years later.\nOne month prior to hospital closure, 87 former long-stay psychiatric patients, the majority of whom had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, were assessed on a range of QoL and SF measures. Patients were followed-up 10\u00a0years later in the community, to evaluate baseline predictors of quality of life and social functioning.\nStudy completers (n\u2009=\u200935) improved significantly on a range of QoL and SF measures over the 10\u00a0year period. Specific improvements were noted in domestic skills (t = -\u00a02.8, p\u2009<\u20090.0008), community skills (t = -\u00a04.9, p\u2009<\u20090.001), as well as the activity and social relations measure (t = -\u00a04.1, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

International research on the use of coercive hospitalization in psychiatry is scarce, and an investigation of Norway's routine re-evaluation of involuntarily referred patients may expand knowledge about this aspect of psychiatric treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which Involuntarily Hospitalized (IH) patients were converted to a Voluntary Hospitalization (VH), and to identify predictive factors leading to conversion. The Multi-center Acute Psychiatry study (MAP) included all cases of acute consecutive psychiatric admissions across twenty Norwegian acute psychiatric units in health trusts in Norway across 3months in 2005-06, representing about 75% of the psychiatric acute emergency units in Norway. The incident of conversion from involuntarily hospitalization (IH) to voluntary hospitalization (VH) was analyzed using generalized linear mixed modeling.

After re-evaluation, 1148 (78.2%) remained on involuntary hospitalization, while 320 patients (21.8%) were converted to voluntary hospitalization. The predictors of conversion from involuntary to voluntary hospitalization after re-evaluation of a specialist included patients wanting admission, better scores on Global Assessment of Symptom scale, fewer hallucinations and delusions and higher alcohol intake.\nThe 24h re-evaluation period for patients referred for involuntary hospitalization, as stipulated by the Norwegian Mental Health Care Act, appeared to give adequate opportunity to reduce unnecessary involuntary hospitalization, while safeguarding the patient's right to VH."}, {"Title": "The effect of an occupational therapy mental health day treatment centre on the use of inpatient services in the Western Cape, South Africa.", "Abstract": "<b>Purpose:</b> The aim of this study was to determine whether attendance at an occupational therapy-led day treatment centre for mental health care users affects the use of inpatient services in South Africa. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental study design was used to compare admissions and days spent in hospital during the 24\u2009months before and after attendance at the centre, using the hospital's electronic records. Total population sampling yielded data for 44 mental health care users who made first contact with the service between July 2009 and June 2010.

The older the transgender adult, the more likely the individual grew up in a historical context when there was greater social stigma towards their gender identity, even among mental health professionals. In order to provide optimal healthcare to transgender adults, mental health care providers should become familiar with the basic terminology presented in this article. Transgender older adults face greater risks of poor physical health, disability, anxiety and depressive symptoms, victimization, and stigma, and higher rates of smoking, excessive alcohol use, and risky sexual behavior compared with non-transgender older adults. In spite of notable health disparities, some evidence points to resilience among transgender older adults. The mental health professional often serves as the first contact for a patient who is struggling with gender identity. The role of a mental health professional can be divided into five categories: 1) assessment of gender dysphoria; 2) psychoeducation of patients and family members about the diversity of gender identities and various options for alleviating gender dysphoria; 3) referral to and collaboration with other healthcare professionals; 4) treatment of coexisting mental health concerns; 5) advocating for transgender patients and for the transgender community.

Previous research found inconsistent characteristics of individuals who underwent coercive measures during psychiatric treatment. Furthermore, there continues to be a lack of knowledge on the clinical course of people after being involuntarily committed. This study aimed to describe the rate and duration of different coercive measures and characterise a cohort of involuntarily committed patients regarding sociodemographic and clinical variables.\nIn this observational cohort study, we analysed clinical data from the patients' medical files, the use of coercive measures (seclusion, restraint, coercive medication) and other procedural aspects in involuntarily hospitalised patients (n = 612) at the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich. For analysis, we used cross-tabulation with chi-square tests for categorical variables and, owing to a non-normal distribution, the Mann-Whitney U-test for interval variables.\nCoercive measures were documented in 170 patients (28% of those who were involuntarily hospitalised). The total number of seclusions was 344, with a mean duration of 9 hours per seclusion. A total of 89 patients (15%) received 159 episodes of coercive medication (oral and intramuscular). Also, 11 episodes of restraint were recorded in 7 patients (1%) with a mean duration of 12 hours per restraint. Patients subjected to coercion were significantly more often male, violent prior to admission, diagnosed with psychosis or personality disorder, and had a history of frequent hospitalisations with long durations of hospitalisation.\nThe prevalence of coercive measures is still high in involuntarily hospitalised patients. Seclusion was the most frequently used coercive measure, which may be based on cultural and clinical aspects and differs from findings in other countries where restraint is more frequently used. Some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were associated with the use of coercion. This underlines the importance of developing treatment strategies for patients at risk to prevent situations in which the use of coercion is necessary.

Delirium and catatonia are commonly comorbid in the medical setting and should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. Electroconvulsive therapy should be offered to patients who do not respond to benzodiazepines or have malignant features.

We aim to test the hypothesis that PFI improves problem-oriented coping strategies in relatives of BD-I patients compared to the Treatment As Usual (TAU) group.\nThe final sample was constituted of 123 patients and 139 relatives. At baseline assessment (T0), the vast majority of relatives already adopted problem-oriented coping strategies more frequently than the emotion-focused ones.

After the 90s of the 20th century, or the so called \"Decade of the Brain\", today, contemporary specialists work on the boundary between fundamental science and medicine. This brings neuroscience, neuropsychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy closer to each other. Today, we definitely know that brain structures are being built and altered thanks to experience. Psychotherapy can be more effective when based on a neuropsychological approach-this implies identification of the neural foundations of various disorders and will lead to specific psychotherapeutic conclusions. The knowledge about the brain is continually enriched, which leads to periodic rethinking and updating of the therapeutic approaches to various diseases of the nervous system and brain dysfunctions. The aim of translational studies is to match and combine scientific areas, resources, experience and techniques to improve prevention, diagnosis and therapies, and \"transformation\" of scientific discoveries into potential treatments of various diseases done in laboratory conditions. Neuropsychological studies prove that cognition is a key element that links together brain functioning and behaviour. According to Dr. Kandel, all experimental events, including psychotherapeutic interventions, affect the structure and function of neuronal synapses. The story of why psychotherapy works is a story of understanding the brain mechanisms of psychic processes, a story of how the brain has been evolving to ensure learning, forgetting, and the mechanisms of permanent psychological change. The new evidence on brain functioning necessitates the integration of neuropsychological achievements in the psychotherapeutic process. An integrative approach is needed to take into account the dynamic interaction between brain functioning, psyche, soul, spirit, and social interaction, ie, development of a model of psychotherapeutic work based on cerebral plasticity! Brain-based psychotherapy aims at changing brain functioning not directly, but through experiences. This is neuro-psychologically informed psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Toward personalised diffusion MRI in psychiatry: improved delineation of fibre bundles with the highest-ever angular resolution in vivo tractography.", "Abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is a uniquely powerful tool capable of demonstrating structural brain network abnormalities across a range of psychiatric disorders; however, it is not currently clinically useful. This is because limitations on sensitivity effectively restrict its application to scientific studies of cohorts, rather than individual patients. Recent improvements in dMRI hardware, acquisition, processing and analysis techniques may, however, overcome these measurement limitations. We therefore acquired the highest-ever angular resolution in vivo tractographic data set, and used these data to ask the question: 'is cutting-edge, optimised dMRI now sensitive enough to measure brain network abnormalities at a level that may enable personalised psychiatry?' The fibre tracking performance of this 'gold standard' data set of 1150 unique directions (11 shells) was compared to a conventional 64-direction protocol (single shell) and a clinically practical, highly optimised and accelerated 9-min protocol of 140 directions (3 shells). Three major tracts of relevance to psychiatry were evaluated: the cingulate bundle, the uncinate fasciculus and the corticospinal tract. We found up to a 34-fold improvement in tracking accuracy using the 1150-direction data set compared to the 64-direction data set, while 140-direction data offered a maximum 17-fold improvement. We also observed between 20 and 50% improvements in tracking efficiency for the 140-direction data set, a finding we then replicated in a normal cohort (n\u2009=\u200953). We found evidence that lower angular resolution data may introduce systematic anatomical biases. These data highlight the imminent potential of dMRI as a clinically meaningful technique at a personalised level, and should inform current practice in clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Integrating Health and Mental Health Services: A Past and Future History.", "Abstract": "The authors trace the modern history, current landscape, and future prospects for integration between mental health and general medical care in the United States.

This paper provides a systematic review of the topic, focusing on a range of medications which have emerged as being used recreationally, either on their own or in combination with NPS. Among gabapentinoids, pregabalin may present with higher addictive liability levels than gabapentin, with pregabalin being mostly identified in the context of opioid, polydrug intake. For antidepressants, their dopaminergic, stimulant-like, bupropion activities may explain their recreational value and diversion from the therapeutic intended use. In some vulnerable clients, a high dosage of venlafaxine (&lsquo;baby ecstasy&rsquo;) is ingested for recreational purposes, whilst the occurrence of a clinically-relevant withdrawal syndrome may be a significant issue for all venlafaxine-treated patients. Considering second generation antipsychotics, olanzapine appears to be ingested at very large dosages as an &lsquo;ideal trip terminator&rsquo;, whilst the immediate-release quetiapine formulation may possess proper abuse liability levels. Within the image- and performance- enhancing drugs (IPEDs) group, the beta-2 agonist clenbuterol (&lsquo;size zero pill&rsquo;) is reported to be self-administered for aggressive slimming purposes. Finally, high/very high dosage ingestion of the antidiarrhoeal loperamide has shown recent increasing levels of popularity due to its central recreational, anti-withdrawal, opiatergic effects.

However, considering that temporality refers mainly to an implicit aspect of our relationship with the world, disturbances in the temporal structure of consciousness remain difficult to access. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown a correlation between self disorders and the automatic ability to expect an event in time, suggesting timing is a key issue for the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Timing disorders may represent a target for cognitive remediation, but this requires that disorders can be demonstrated at an individual level. Since cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia are discrete, and there is no standardized timing exploration, we focused on timing impairments suggested to be related to self disorders. We present the case report of AF, a 22 year old man suffering from schizophrenia, with no antipsychotic intake. Although AF shows few positive and negative symptoms and has a normal neurocognitive assessment, he shows a high level of disturbance of Minimal Self Disorders (SDs) (assessed with the EASE scale). Moreover, AF has a rare ability to describe his self and time difficulties. An objective assessment of timing ability (variable foreperiod task) confirmed that AF had temporal impairments similar to those previously described in patients, i.e., a preserved ability to distinguish time intervals, but a difficulty to benefit from the passage of time to expect a visual stimulus. He presents additional difficulties in benefitting from temporal cues and adapting to changes in time delays. The impairments were ample enough to yield significant effects with analyses at the individual level. Although causal relationships between subjective and objective impairments cannot be established, the results show that exploring timing deficits at the individual level is possible in patients with schizophrenia. Besides, the results are consistent with hypotheses relating minimal self disorders (SDs) to timing difficulties. They suggest that both subjective and objective timing investigations should be developed further so that their use at an individual level can be generalized in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Noninvasive Brain Stimulation: Challenges and Opportunities for a New Clinical Specialty.", "Abstract": "Noninvasive brain stimulation refers to a set of technologies and techniques with which to modulate the excitability of the brain via transcranial stimulation.

We identified a range of pervasive digital systems, such as smartphones, smartwatches and smart homes, to assess and assist elderly demented, prodromal and preclinical populations. Generally, the studies reported good level of agreement between the digital measures and the constructs they aimed to measure. However, most of the systems are still only in the initial stages of development with limited data on acceptability in patients. Although it is clear that the use of digital technology to monitor and support the cognitive domains affected by dementia is a promising area of development, additional research validating the efficacy, utility and cost-effectiveness of these systems in patient populations is needed."}, {"Title": "Sustainability of a person-centered ward atmosphere and possibility to provide person-centered forensic psychiatric care after facility relocation.", "Abstract": "This longitudinal study aims to assess the sustainability of staff perceptions of ward atmosphere and their possibility to provide person-centered forensic psychiatric care after relocation to new hospitals that aimed to provide supportive work conditions for the staff to be able to perform care of high quality.\nIn this study we only present the result for the repeated measures, that is, only the individuals that performed both the questionnaires at baseline and at the three follow-ups. Data were collected prospectively between 2010 and 2016; before (baseline) and after relocation of the forensic psychiatric clinics to new buildings, i.e., after six months (follow-up 1), after one year (follow-up 2) and after two years (follow-up 3), respectively. Data were obtained by employing structured validated questionnaires.\nThe main findings of this study display an improvement in the staff assessment of a person-centered atmosphere from baseline to follow-up 3 in the domains of safety, everydayness and community where safety was evaluated the highest. No sustainable significant changes were found concerning staff's assessment of the support for them to provide person-centered care.\nThe findings show sustainability of person-centered ward atmosphere in forensic psychiatric care according to staff's assessment after relocation from traditional health care facilities to evidence-based designed premises. In this study the increased staff perception of the possibility to provide person-centered care in the new facilities could not be revealed as sustainability over the two years of follow-up."}, {"Title": "From Community to Meta-Community Mental Health Care.", "Abstract": "Since the 1960s, we have witnessed the development and growth of community mental health care that continues to dominate mental health policy and practice. Several high-income countries have implemented community mental health care programmes but for many others, including mostly low- and middle-income countries, it remains an aspiration. Although community mental health care has been positive for many service users, it has also had severe shortcomings. Expectations that it would lead to fuller social integration have not been fulfilled and many service users remain secluded in sheltered or custodial environments with limited social contacts and no prospect of work. Others receive little or no service at all. In today&rsquo;s complex landscape of increasingly specialised services for people with mental health problems, the number of possible interfaces between services is increasing. Together with existing uneven financing systems and a context of constant change, these interfaces are challenging us to develop effective care pathways adjusted to the needs of service users and their carers. This discussion paper reviews the developments in community mental health care over the recent years and puts forward the concept of &ldquo;Meta-Community Mental Health Care&rdquo;. &ldquo;Meta-Community Mental Health Care&rdquo; embraces pluralism in understanding and treating psychiatric disorders, acknowledges the complexities of community provision, and reflects the realities and needs of the current era of care."}, {"Title": "Antagonist treatment is just as effective as replacement therapy for opioid addiction but neither is used often enough.", "Abstract": "One of the most malignant illnesses in psychiatry is opioid addiction.

Preventing or minimizing disease is one of the main ways of achieving healthy aging. Dementia is one of the most prevalent and life-changing diseases of old age. Thus, dementia prevention research is defined as one of the main priorities worldwide. However, conducting research with persons who lack the capacity to give consent is a major ethical issue.\nOur study attempts to explore if and how advance research directives (ARDs) may be used as a future tool to deal with the ethical and practical issues in dementia research.\nWe conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews with German and Israeli professional stakeholders from the fields of gerontology, ethics, medical law, psychiatry, neurology and policy advice (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200916), and analyzed the main topics discussed regarding cross-national similarities and controversies within the groups, as well as across the two national contexts.\nWhile both countries are in the midst of a developmental process and have recognized the importance and need for ARD as a tool for expanding healthy aging, Germany is in a more advanced stage than Israel because of the EU regulation process, which indicates the influence of international harmonization on these research-related ethical issues. Consensual themes within the qualitative material were identified: the need for a broader debate on ARD, the ethical importance of autonomy and risk-benefit assessment for ARD implementation, the role of the proxy and the need for the differentiation of types of dementia research. Controversies and dilemmas aroused around themes such as the current role of IRBs in each country, the need for limits, and how to guaranty safeguarding and control.\nImplementing a new tool is a step-by-step procedure requiring a thorough understanding of the current state of knowledge as well as of the challenges and hurdles ahead. As long as improving quality of life and promoting autonomy continue to be core elements in the process of healthy aging, efforts to advance knowledge and solve dilemmas associated with the implementation of ARD is of the utmost importance."}, {"Title": "Management of psychiatric patients before deinstitutionalization: an inquiry into the years 1907-1913 in Pisa.", "Abstract": "Asylums comprises the main focus of historical research on early 20th century psychiatry.

Our data outlines a peculiar discharge rationale, suggesting that the Clinic acted like a \u201csieve-institution\u201d to prevent asylum overcrowding from treatable, non-chronic conditions.\nThese data suggest that our historical view of psychiatric care is probably not complete, and that a different approach to source materials could provide new research paradigms."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatrist burnout or psychiatric assistance burnout?].", "Abstract": "In recent years, mature industrial countries are rapidly changing from production economies to service economies. In this new socio-economic context, particular attention has been paid to mental health problems in the workplace. The risk of burnout is significantly higher for certain occupations, in particular for health workers. Doctors and psychiatrists, in particular, quite frequently have to make quick decisions by dealing with a huge amount of requests, which often require considerable assumptions of responsibility. In Italy, the process of corporateization and regionalization of the National Health Service has oriented clinical practice, in psychiatry, towards the rationalization and optimization of available resources, to ensure appropriateness and fairness of performances. The challenge that will soon be faced in health policy, with the progressive aging of the population, will be the growing burden of chronicity, in a context of limited resources, which will necessarily require a managerial approach in structuring and delivering services. The management of change in psychiatric assistance, today in Italy, can not be separated from a deep motivating involvement ( engagement) of professionals. In other words, it is desirable, in the effort to contain expenditure and rationalize welfare processes, to shift from burnout to the engagement of psychiatrists, investing economic and human resources in mental health services. In this review, through a selective search of the relevant literature 2010-2017 conducted on PubMed (key words: stress, burnout, psychiatry, mental health), the information from original articles, reviews and book chapters was analyzed and summarized. about the presence of burnout syndrome among psychiatrists. This article examines the concept of burnout, its causes and the most appropriate preventive and therapeutic interventions applicable to psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "[Problems and perspectives in psychiatric diagnosis].", "Abstract": "Diagnosis in psychiatry is a complex and difficult issue. A great many considerations have been made about the debatable ontological status of mental disorders and the difficulties in providing flawless definitions for them. While these considerations help appreciate the subtleties and difficulties of the topic, they do not imply that mental disorders do not exist or that nosological classification is unnecessary or useless. Although classifications have some inherent flaws and limitations, they can nevertheless be useful. The current psychiatric nosology, however, is based on a categorical approach that has been the object of much criticism. Alternatives include the prototype approach, which has some strong points but also a number of potential disadvantages, and the dimensional approach. The latter approach, though not solving all problems, has recently attracted increasing interest and has received substantial empirical support. There are several ways of conceptualising dimensions and using them in the context of assessment and diagnosis. One of these ways is represented by the SVARAD (Scala per la VAlutazione RApida Dimensionale, i.e., \"rapid dimensional assessment scale\"), which is an observer-rated scale that covers 10 psychopathological dimensions. Two decades of clinical and research experience have supported its reliability, validity, and ease of use. Dimensional approaches of this kind could easily integrate and enrich the traditional DSM or ICD assessment and may help optimize personalised psychiatric treatment."}, {"Title": "Association of serotonin and GABA pathway gene polymorphisms with alcohol dependence: A preliminary study.", "Abstract": "Alcohol dependence (AD), characterized by profound disruptions in specific circuits of the brain is influenced by both environmental, which play a significant role in developing addiction and genetic factors, which make some individuals more susceptible to disruptions. Various polymorphisms in the neurotransmitter genes are reported to increase the risk of developing dependence. The present study aimed to identify association of serotonin and GABA polymorphisms with AD in Indian subjects.\nThe study group comprised of 141 AD cases recruited as per DSM IV TR criteria from the outpatient Department of Psychiatry and 110 volunteers from the general population. Clinical and family history was noted and 5\u202fml blood drawn for genetic studies. Polymorphisms 5-HTTLPR and STin2 of serotonin and rs2279020 and rs3219151 of the GABA pathway were analyzed and results correlated with age at first use quantity consumed, duration of use, dependence and age at onset of dependence.\nThe marker frequencies were similar between cases and controls except for rs3219151. 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with high AUDIT scores and alcohol intake (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), GABA<sub>A</sub> rs2279020 and rs3219151 with age at first use (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001); rs2279020 with higher AUDIT score (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and rs3219151 with quantity (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001). High frequency of GABRA6 rs3219151 TT genotype in AD and its association with lower age at first use, higher intake/day, and higher duration of dependence appears to confer risk.\nThis preliminary study, though on a smaller sample size, suggests an association of 5-HTTLPR and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor polymorphisms with AD in our population."}, {"Title": "[Study of parental bonding in childhood in children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa].", "Abstract": "Anorexia nervosa constitutes a severe and complex eating disorder occurring principally in adolescence. It is one of the most deadly psychiatric disorders. Considering the multifactorial nature of anorexia nervosa, the important place of the family and the growing interest in the theory of attachment in eating disorders, parental bonding is questioned in anorexia nervosa. The main study goal is to analyze parental bonding in a population of children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa. The secondary objective is to study differences according to the age group.\nWe realized an observational pilot study in Bordeaux over a period from June 2015 to April 2017. Twenty five young girls with anorexia nervosa, aged 10 to 17 years, hospitalized in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry and department of eating disorders have been included and divided into two groups: peripubertal for children under 14 and pubertal for children aged 14 to 17 years. We met them individually to complete a series of questionnaires including the Parental Bonding Instrument (for assessing attachment), the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview for Children and Adolescent (for detecting the presence of comorbidity) and a structured questionnaire for collecting general information on anorexia nervosa.\nResults revealed high parental care, high maternal and paternal overprotection with predominantly \"optimal\" parenting style followed by \"affectionate constraint\" style. Significant differences were observed in anorexia nervosa patients with maternal (P=0.011) and paternal (P=0.085) overprotection in pubes compared to peripubertal. In correlation analysis, there was a positive correlation between maternal protection and age of diagnosis and a negative correlation between parental care and duration of illness. Furthermore, the maternal overprotection tended to be correlated significantly and positively with the age of the diagnosis and the paternal overprotection with the body mass index.\nOur study shows a rating by the parents of warm and understanding parents, an over-protective mother and a father encouraging autonomy. There is maternal and paternal overprotection in pubertal anorexia nervosa compared with peripubertals. Our results suggest the importance of analyzing parenting style in addition to Parental Bonding Instruments results and of supporting the importance of the development of family therapy in the anorexia nervosa."}, {"Title": "Gut microbiota, metabolism and psychopathology: A critical review and novel perspectives.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are often associated with metabolic comorbidities. However, the mechanisms through which metabolic and psychiatric disorders are connected remain unclear. Pre-clinical studies in rodents indicate that the bidirectional signaling between the intestine and the brain, the so-called microbiome-gut-brain axis, plays an important role in the regulation of both metabolism and behavior. The gut microbiome produces a vast number of metabolites that may be transported into the host and play a part in homeostatic control of metabolism as well as brain function. In addition to short chain fatty acids, many of these metabolites have been identified in recent years. To what extent both microbiota and their products control human metabolism and behavior is a subject of intense investigation. In this review, we will discuss the most recent findings concerning alterations in the gut microbiota as a possible pathophysiological factor for the co-occurrence of metabolic comorbidities in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric admission during pregnancy in women with schizophrenia who attended a specialist antenatal clinic.", "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> The mental health and wellbeing of pregnant women with schizophrenia is an area of research interest. We aim to explore this relationship particularly in regards to psychiatric admission rates, timing and their associated contributing factors. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 98 pregnancies to women with schizophrenia, who attended a specialist antenatal clinic and delivered from July 2007 to February 2016, were retrospectively examined. The cohort was divided into two groups based on psychiatric admission. Descriptive data were analyzed using SPSS software. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 40.8% required psychiatric admission during pregnancy. A higher proportion of subjects had their initial psychiatric admission in the first trimester compared to the third trimester (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.002). Of note, 10.2% were admitted within one month either side of conception. Women with admission also presented later for their first antenatal appointment (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.04, 95% CI -2.1 to -1.9). Psychiatric admission was associated with substance (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.014) and alcohol use (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.001), child protective services involvement (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.022) and infant being placed in out-of-home care (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.01), but not with poorer obstetric or neonatal outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> High rates of psychiatric admission are evident throughout pregnancy for women with schizophrenia, with a high proportion of first presentations for admission occurring in the first trimester. Psychiatric admission is associated with poorer antenatal care attendance and adverse psychosocial outcomes, highlighting the need for enhanced multidisciplinary pregnancy care for this at risk group.

With this background, the Discovery biology of neuropsychiatric syndromes (DBNS) proposes to recruit patients from five different syndromes (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's dementia and substance use disorders), identify those with multiple affected relatives, and invite these families to participate in this study. The families will be assessed: 1) To compare neuro-endophenotype measures between patients, first degree relatives (FDR) and healthy controls., 2) To identify cellular phenotypes which differentiate the groups., 3) To examine the longitudinal course of neuro-endophenotype measures., 4) To identify measures which correlate with outcome, and 5) To create a unified digital database and biorepository.\nThe identification of the index participants will occur at well-established specialty clinics. The selected individuals will have a strong family history (with at least another affected FDR) of mental illness. We will also recruit healthy controls without family history of such illness. All recruited individuals (N\u2009=\u20094500) will undergo brief clinical assessments and a blood sample will be drawn for isolation of DNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). From among this set, a subset of 1500 individuals (300 families and 300 controls) will be assessed on several additional assessments [detailed clinical assessments, endophenotype measures (neuroimaging- structural and functional, neuropsychology, psychophysics-electroencephalography, functional near infrared spectroscopy, eye movement tracking)], with the intention of conducting repeated measurements every alternate year. PBMCs from this set will be used to generate lymphoblastoid cell lines, and a subset of these would be converted to induced pluripotent stem cell lines and also undergo whole exome sequencing.\nWe hope to identify unique and overlapping brain endophenotypes for major psychiatric syndromes. In a proportion of subjects, we expect these neuro-endophenotypes to progress over time and to predict treatment outcome. Similarly, cellular assays could differentiate cell lines derived from such groups. The repository of biomaterials as well as digital datasets of clinical parameters, will serve as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community who wish to address research questions in the area."}, {"Title": "Presentations to NSW emergency departments with self-harm, suicidal ideation, or intentional poisoning, 2010-2014.", "Abstract": "To evaluate population trends in presentations for mental health problems presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in New South Wales during 2010-2014, particularly patients presenting with suicidal ideation, self-harm, or intentional poisoning.\nThis was a retrospective, descriptive analysis of linked Emergency Department Data Collection registry data for presentations to NSW public hospital EDs over five calendar years, 2010-2014.

In addition to its cosmetic effect, botulinum toxin may also positively modulate mood and affect, which may contribute to its popularity. A series of clinical studies has shown that this modulation can be used in the treatment of major depression. After a single glabellar treatment with botulinum toxin, patients suffering from unipolar depression experienced a quick, strong and sustained improvement in the symptoms of depression. Preliminary data suggest that botulinum toxin therapy may also be effective in the treatment of other mental disorders characterized by an excess of negative emotions, such as borderline personality disorder.

Although genomewide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic loci contributing to BD risk, sample size has become a rate-limiting obstacle to genetic discovery. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a vast but relatively untapped resource for high-throughput phenotyping. As part of the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD), we previously validated automated EHR-based phenotyping algorithms for BD against in-person diagnostic interviews (Castro et al. Am J Psychiatry 172:363-372, 2015). Here, we establish the genetic validity of these phenotypes by determining their genetic correlation with traditionally ascertained samples. Case and control algorithms were derived from structured and narrative text in the Partners Healthcare system comprising more than 4.6 million patients over 20 years. Genomewide genotype data for 3330 BD cases and 3952 controls of European ancestry were used to estimate SNP-based heritability (h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>) and genetic correlation (r<sub>g</sub>) between EHR-based phenotype definitions and traditionally ascertained BD cases in GWAS by the ICCBD and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) using LD score regression. We evaluated BD cases identified using 4 EHR-based algorithms: an NLP-based algorithm (95-NLP) and three rule-based algorithms using codified EHR with decreasing levels of stringency-\"coded-strict\", \"coded-broad\", and \"coded-broad based on a single clinical encounter\" (coded-broad-SV). The analytic sample comprised 862 95-NLP, 1968 coded-strict, 2581 coded-broad, 408 coded-broad-SV BD cases, and 3 952 controls. The estimated h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> were 0.24 (p\u2009=\u20090.015), 0.09 (p\u2009=\u20090.064), 0.13 (p\u2009=\u20090.003), 0.00 (p\u2009=\u20090.591) for 95-NLP, coded-strict, coded-broad and coded-broad-SV BD, respectively. The h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> for all EHR-based cases combined except coded-broad-SV (excluded due to 0 h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>) was 0.12 (p\u2009=\u20090.004). These h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> were lower or similar to the h<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> observed by the ICCBD\u2009+\u2009PGCBD (0.23, p\u2009=\u20093.17E-80, total N\u2009=\u200933,181). However, the r<sub>g</sub> between ICCBD\u2009+\u2009PGCBD and the EHR-based cases were high for 95-NLP (0.66, p\u2009=\u20093.69\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>), coded-strict (1.00, p\u2009=\u20092.40\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-4</sup>), and coded-broad (0.74, p\u2009=\u20098.11\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-7</sup>). The r<sub>g</sub> between EHR-based BD definitions ranged from 0.90 to 0.98.

On the basis of an original translational equilibriometric method for evaluation of movement patterns, we have introduced in the everyday clinical practice of psychiatry an easy-to-perform computerized objective quantification of the individual locomotor behaviour during execution of the Unterberger stepping test. For the last 20\u00a0years, we have gradually collected a large database of more than 1000 schizophrenic patients, their relatives, and matched psychiatric, neurological, and healthy controls via cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations. Comparative analyses revealed transdiagnostic locomotor similarities among schizophrenic patients, high-risk schizotaxic individuals, and neurological patients with multiple sclerosis and cerebellar ataxia, thus suggesting common underlying brain mechanisms. In parallel, intradiagnostic dissimilarities were revealed, which allow to separate out subclinical locomotor subgroups within the diagnostic categories. Prototypical qualitative (dysmetric and ataxic) locomotor abnormalities in schizophrenic patients were differentiated from 2 atypical quantitative ones, manifested as either hypolocomotion or hyperlocomotion. Theoretical analyses suggested that these 3 subtypes of locomotor abnormalities could be conceived as objectively measurable biomarkers of 3 schizophrenic subgroups with dissimilar brain mechanisms, which require different treatment strategies. Analogies with the prominent role of locomotor measures in some well-known animal models of mental disorders advocate for a promising objective translational research in the so far over-subjective field of psychiatry. Distinctions among prototypical, atypical, and diagnostic biomarkers, as well as between neuromotor and psychomotor locomotor abnormalities, are discussed. Conclusions are drawn about the translational and clinical implications of the new approach and its future perspectives."}, {"Title": "Trends in pharmacological emergency treatment of patients suffering from schizophrenia over a 16-year observation period.", "Abstract": "Patients suffering from schizophrenia are often treated in locked psychiatric units because of psychomotor agitation, hostility and aggressive behavior, or suicidality. Because of legal conditions, investigations on these acutely ill patients are difficult, and many studies do not represent 'real-life psychiatry'. This retrospective survey was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics of the Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. Data were collected from the records of all adult inpatients suffering from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed. (ICD-10) (F2x) who had been admitted to a locked unit in 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. In addition to demographic data, diagnoses at the time of admission, length of stay at the locked unit, and psychopharmacological treatment (3\u2009h before and following admission) were recorded.

This shift in disciplinary status took place at a time when medical education itself was experiencing a period of reform. By examining medical school registers at Harvard University, records from the Dean's office of Harvard's medical school, and oral histories, this paper examines the rise in prominence of psychiatry in medical education. Three builders of Harvard psychiatry - Elmer E. Southard, C. Macfie Campbell, and Harry C. Solomon - simultaneously sought to mark territory for psychiatry and its relevance. In doing so, they capitalized on three related elements: the fluidity that existed between psychiatry and neurology, the new venues whereby medical students gained training in psychiatry, and the broader role of patrons, professional associations, and certification boards, which sought to expand psychiatry's influence in the social and cultural life of twentieth-century America."}, {"Title": "Ethopathology and Civilization Diseases: Niko and Elisabeth Tinbergen on Autism.", "Abstract": "The idea that some diseases result from a poor fit between modern life and our biological make-up is part of the long history of what historian of medicine Charles Rosenberg has called the \"progress-and-pathology narrative.\" This article examines a key episode in that history: 1973 Nobel laureate Niko Tinbergen's use of an evolutionary framework to identify autism as a pathogenic effect of progress. Influenced by British psychiatrist John Bowlby's work, Tinbergen and his wife Elisabeth saw autistic children as victims of environmental stress caused mainly by mothers' failure to bond with their children and to protect them from conflicting situations. However, the author argues that their position was not \"environmental.\" For them, autism was due to a failure of socialization but the mechanisms that explain that failure were established by biological evolution. Situating their views within the context of Niko's concern about the derailment of biological evolution by cultural evolution, this article shows that their ideas are of special significance for understanding the persistence of the view that civilization poses a risk to human health."}, {"Title": "Outcomes Among Persons with HIV Following a Mental Health Admission: A Population-Based Study.", "Abstract": "To compare outcomes following psychiatric hospitalization between people with and without HIV.

As members of a Dutch criminal cases review commission, we recently encountered two cases in which PTSD was presented as new evidence that would justify a reopening of the case. In this article, we argue that such claims are problematic in that clinical decision making resulting in a PTSD diagnosis adheres to quite different standards than those dictating forensic fact-finding.

Data on demographic traits and measures of confidence were also collected.\nPrimary care (family medicine and pediatrics) participants expressed frustration over the lack of time and specialized knowledge they had to accurately assess children with irritability, even though they were often the first clinician consulted when problems arose. There were clear and sometimes contradictory differences between how practitioners with a general versus specialized practice assessed mental health status in the clinic setting. Input on treatment approaches revealed that medication prescription was more common by primary care participants, and therapy was preferred by the psychiatry participants.\nOverall, family medicine and pediatric practitioners were significantly less confident in their ability to evaluate mental health status, while child and adolescent psychiatry participants were supportive of having more initial triage and possible treatment occur at the primary care level, suggesting a need for more training about childhood irritability in the primary care setting."}, {"Title": "Evolving standards of care in the age of cybertechnology.", "Abstract": "Behavioral health professionals are making increased use of cybertechnology to deliver services to patients, communicate with patients, gather information about patients, and communicate with colleagues.

A brief depiction of the consumer movement history. At first, consumers operated outside of the mainstream MH system. Gradually, consumer groups and institutional personnel joined efforts towards community integration and enhancement of quality of life, pushing forward a person-centered recovery orientation. In turn, some administrators and key stakeholders in rehabilitation community services grew to value the impact of knowledge-by-experience in contemporary mental health care. In this context, over the past decade, peer roles were developed in the mental health system, including consumer-providers in community services and peer specialists in inpatient psychiatric hospitals. The insertion of peer roles into the mainstream MH system is far-reaching, including the placement of a peer-project coordinator within the ministry of health. I describe the unique contribution of peers, as experts-by-experience, to mainstream professional knowledge and practice. I also highlight the potential challenges involved when peer models of care are added to traditional medical models of care.

No study to date, however, has assessed neurocognitive predictors of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment response in adolescents with depression. This study examined neurocognitive tasks at baseline as predictors of clinical improvement with SSRI treatment (fluoxetine) at week 6 and 12 in an adolescent population.\nAdolescents with depression were recruited from a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic at a university medical center. Twenty-four adolescents (mean age 14.8 years) with Major Depressive Disorder completed tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, including visual memory, executive functioning, sustained attention, and impulsivity. Depression severity, measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), was assessed at week 6 and 12 and clinical improvement was defined as percentage (%) change in CDRS-R from baseline.\nClinical improvement is noted at both week 6 (mean % change in CDRS-R [M]\u2009=\u200946.8, standard deviation [SD]\u2009=\u200951.9) and week 12 (M\u2009=\u200987.9, SD\u2009=\u200957.2). Results reveal that less difficulty in sustained attention (p\u2009=\u20090.02), lower impulsivity (p\u2009=\u20090.00), and better planning (p\u2009=\u20090.04) at baseline were predictors of greater clinical improvement at week 6. Lower impulsivity at baseline remained significantly predictive of clinical improvement at week 12 (p\u2009=\u20090.01).\nNeurocognitive assessments could potentially help identify a subset of depressed adolescents who may not respond to conventional SSRI treatment and who may be better candidates for alternative or augmentation treatments."}, {"Title": "[Music therapy procedures controlled by the brain potentials in treatment of functional disorders].", "Abstract": "Twenty years ago, the Korsakov's Journal of Neurology and Psychiatry has published the article of Ya.I.

This involved establishing trusting connections with mental health workers who treated them with respect, made them feel valued, and who recognized their suffering and needs. The formerly suicidal patients experienced being in a recovery process, which was promoted by the support of mental health workers. Although the participants reported mostly positive experiences, there were examples of insufficient care. Sometimes, they felt that their suffering and suicidality were not sufficiently recognized.\nOur study indicates that although there has been increased focus on suicidality in the mental health services, among other through clinical guidelines, some mental health workers still lack competence and should focus more fully on how to provide individualized care for suicidal inpatients."}, {"Title": "Using Lithium in Children and Adolescents with Bipolar Disorder: Efficacy, Tolerability, and Practical Considerations.", "Abstract": "Lithium has been an intriguing treatment option in psychiatry for over a century. While seemingly just a simple elemental compound, it has powerful treatment effects for both depression and bipolar disorder. The evidence base for treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder is relatively small, but, in recent years, additional clinical trial data have enabled lithium to re-emerge as a valuable and, in many cases, preferred treatment. Pharmacologically, lithium is complex, with varied effects at both intracellular and extracellular levels. As a treatment for bipolar disorder in pediatrics, lithium is challenging, given its narrow therapeutic window and myriad of potential side effects. However, the efficacy of lithium continues to match that of newer pharmacologic agents, and its tolerability has been shown to be comparable with more commonly prescribed medications. Lithium is still one of few drugs that have been proven to reduce the risk of suicidality, and it may have utility in illnesses beyond affective disorders. Practically, as a primary agent or as an adjunct, lithium continues to claim a rightful place in the treatment armamentarium of child psychiatry. New dosing paradigms have improved tolerability and reduced potential side effects. Recent evidence affirms that lithium is effective for pediatric bipolar disorder in multiple phases of the illness."}, {"Title": "Piloting of COPES: An Empirically Informed Psychosocial Intervention on an Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient Unit.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility and initial efficacy of an empirically informed psychosocial intervention on an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit.\nData were obtained for 463 adolescents 12-16 years of age on a psychiatric inpatient unit. Information collected included demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, length of inpatient stay, completion of four treatment modules, rehospitalizations, and emergency room visits during 12 months after discharge from index admission.\nAround 98.70% of patients completed at least one out of the four treatment modules and 93.95% of patients completed two modules. There were no significant barriers to completing treatment modules on the basis of participant characteristics (demographics, psychiatric diagnosis, number of diagnoses, or length of stay). Completion of the four treatment modules, particularly modules on developing a safety plan and enhancing life, predicted lower risk for rehospitalization and emergency room contact in the 12 months postdischarge.\nFindings suggest that the intervention is feasible to implement regardless of common barriers in an inpatient psychiatric setting, such as complex psychopathology and brief duration of hospitalization. Completion of treatment modules significantly reduces risk for subsequent emergency intensive service utilization, suggesting this intervention may be an effective method for reducing acute clinical events."}, {"Title": "The Attribution of Mental Health Problems to Jinn: An Explorative Study in a Transcultural Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic.", "Abstract": "Among Muslim patients, a common cultural concept of distress is the notion that jinn may be the cause of mental health problems, especially in the presence of hallucinations.\nThis study examines the frequency with which this attribution style is manifest in a specific psychiatric outpatient population with a Muslim background.\nOf all patients registered at an outpatient clinic specialized in transcultural psychiatry, data were collected on folk belief, religion, hallucinations (if present), and medical diagnosis. Through a search in the electronic medical files, the notes made during the first contact and first psychiatric examination were screened for the keywords \"evil eye,\" \"magic,\" \"voodoo,\" and \"jinn.\" In addition, new eligible cases were accepted.\nFrom all 551 patients thus screened, 118 were eligible for participation. Of these, 49 (41.5%) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Among them, 21 (43%) were positive that their psychiatric symptoms were caused by jinn, whereas 13 (27%) thought not, and 15 (31%) were in doubt. No less than 87.2% had experienced hallucinations during their lives. Among the relatively large proportion of eligible patients who did not participate (58.5%), many expressed a fear for stigmatization or metaphysical repercussions if they spoke about jinn.\nThe phenomenon of attributing mental health symptoms to jinn was much more common in this population of Muslim patients than previously assumed.

Fundamental to the network theory of psychopathology is the role of specific symptoms and their interactions. Current statistical tools, however, fail to fully capture this constitutional property. We propose community detection tools as a means to evaluate the complex network structure of psychopathology, free from its original boundaries of distinct disorders. Unique to this approach is that symptoms can belong to multiple communities. Using a large community sample and spanning a broad range of symptoms (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), we identified 18 communities of interconnected symptoms. The differential role of symptoms within and between communities offers a framework to study the clinical concepts of comorbidity, heterogeneity and hallmark symptoms. Symptoms with many and strong connections within a community, defined as stabilizing symptoms, could be thought of as the core of a community, whereas symptoms that belong to multiple communities, defined as communicating symptoms, facilitate the communication between problem areas. We propose that defining symptoms on their stabilizing and/or communicating role within and across communities accelerates our understanding of these clinical phenomena, central to research and treatment of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Thirty-day Readmission Rates and Associated Factors: A Multilevel Analysis of Practice Variations in French Public Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Inpatient psychiatric readmissions are often used as an indicator of the quality of care and their reduction is in line with international recommendations for mental health care. Research on variations in inpatient readmission rates among mental health care providers is therefore of key importance as these variations can impact equity, quality and efficiency of care when they do not result from differences in patients' needs.\nOur objectives were first to describe variations in inpatient readmission rates between public mental health care providers in France on a nationwide scale, and second, to identify their association with patient, health care providers and environment characteristics.\nWe carried out a study for the year 2012 using data from ten administrative national databases. 30-day readmissions in inpatient care were identified in the French national psychiatric discharge database. Variations were described numerically and graphically between French psychiatric sectors and factors associated with these variations were identified by carrying out a multi-level logistic regression accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data.\nSignificant practice variations in 30-day inpatient readmission rates were observed with a coefficient of variation above 50%. While a majority of those variations was related to differences within sectors, individual patient characteristics explained a lower part of the variations resulting from differences between sectors than the characteristics of sectors and of their environment. In particular, an increase in the mortality rate and in the acute admission rate for somatic disorders in sectors' catchment area was associated with a decrease in the probability of 30-day readmission. Similarly, an increase in the number of psychiatric inpatient beds in private for-profit hospitals per 1,000 inhabitants in sectors' catchment area was associated with a decrease in this probability, which also varied with overall sectors' case-mix characteristics and with the level of urbanisation of the area.\nThe extent of the variations and the factors associated with it question the adequacy of care and suggest that some of them may be unwarranted. Our findings should however be interpreted in consideration of several limits inherent to data quality and availability as we relied on information from administrative databases. While we considered a wide range of factors potentially associated with variations in 30-day readmissions, our model indeed only explained a limited part of the variations resulting from differences between sectors.\nOur findings underscored that practice variations in psychiatry are a reality that merits the full attention of decision makers as they can impact the quality, equity and efficiency of care. A specific data system should be established to monitor practice variations in routine to promote transparency and accountability.\nFew associations were found between variations in 30-day inpatient readmissions and the supply of care. The routine collection of detailed organizational characteristics of health care providers at a national level should be supported to facilitate additional research work, both in France and in other contexts."}, {"Title": "Supplementing research ethics training in psychiatry residents: A five-tier approach.", "Abstract": "Ethics training is a key step in the research supervision of psychiatry trainees and there is need for a structured educational module.\nWe developed a new research ethics training module for psychiatry residents - The Five-Tier Approach.

In a recent study published in <i>Molecular Psychiatry</i>, we demonstrate Activating Protein 2\u03b3 (AP2\u03b3), a transcription factor previously implicated in cell fate determination in the developing cortex, as a novel player in the regulation of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Using distinct experimental approaches, we showed that AP2\u03b3 is specifically present in a subpopulation of transient amplifying progenitors, where it acts as a crucial promoter of proliferation and differentiation of adult-born glutamatergic granule neurons. Strikingly, deficiency of AP2\u03b3 in the adult brain compromises the generation of new glutamatergic neurons, with impact on the function of cortico-limbic circuits. Here, we share our view on how AP2\u03b3 integrates the transcriptional orchestration of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, and consequently, how it emerges as a novel molecular candidate to study the translation of environmental pressures into alterations of brain neuroplasticity in homeostatic, but also in neuropathological contexts."}, {"Title": "Late-life depression: issues for the general practitioner.", "Abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD) is both a prevalent and life-threatening disorder, affecting up to 13.3% of the elderly population.

Increased vigilance on the part of the GP can only benefit older people with depression. To recognize the risk of LLD, screening tools are provided in addition to treatment options for LLD. This review aims to provide the GP with guidance in recognizing and treating LLD.

We performed Cronbach's alpha coefficient and principal factor analysis. We administered other scales concomitantly to analyze the concurrent validity of PDI. We applied stepwise multiple linear regression to identify the patients' demographic and clinical variables related to the PDI score.\nOur response rate was 93%, with excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.94). The factorial analysis showed three factors with eigenvalue >1, which explained >80% of total variance: 1) \"loss of self-identity and anxiety for the future\", 2) \"concerns for social dignity and spiritual life\", and 3) \"loss of personal autonomy\". The PDI and the three factor scores were positively and significantly correlated with the Hamilton Scales for Depression and Anxiety but not with other scale scores. Among patients' variables, \"suicide risk\" and \"insufficient social and economic condition\" were positively and significantly correlated with the PDI total score.\nThe PDI can be a reliable tool to assess patients' dignity perception in a psychiatric setting, which suggests that both social and clinical severe conditions are closely related to dignity loss."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatry, one subspecialty with two ethics?

Given that within the scope of forensic psychiatry, a third party usually intervenes in the patient-doctor relationship, an amendment of the traditional ethical principles seems justified.\nThus, 47 articles, two book chapters and the guidelines produced by the World Psychiatric Association, the American Association of Psychiatry and the Law, as well as by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of psychiatrists, were analyzed. The review revealed that the ethics of correctional forensic psychiatry and those of legal forensic psychiatry do not markedly differ from each other, but they are incongruent in terms of implementation.\nIn an effort to better understand which ethical principles apply to forensic psychiatry, a chronological review of the literature published from 1950 to 2015 was carried out.\nThe ethics of correctional forensic psychiatry are primarily deontological. The principle of justice translates into the principle of health care equivalence, the principle of beneficence into providing the best possible care to patients, and the principle of respect of autonomy into ensuring confidentiality and informed consent. The ethics of legal forensic psychiatry are rather consequentialist. In this latter setting, the principle of justice is mainly characterized by professionalism, the principle of beneficence by objectivity and impartiality, and the principle of respect of autonomy by informed consent. However, these two distinct fields of forensic psychiatry share in common the principle of non maleficence, defined as the non collaboration of the psychiatrist in any activity leading to inhuman and degrading treatment or to the death penalty."}, {"Title": "Skepticism towards the Swedish vision zero for suicide: interviews with 12 psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The main causes of suicide and how suicide could and should be prevented are ongoing controversies in the scientific literature as well as in public media. In the bill on public health from 2008 (Prop 2007/08:110), the Swedish Parliament adopted an overarching \"Vision Zero for Suicide\" (VZ) and nine strategies for suicide prevention. However, how the VZ should be interpreted in healthcare is unclear. The VZ has been criticized both from a philosophical perspective and against the background of clinical experience and alleged empirical claims regarding the consequences of regulating suicide prevention. This study is part of a larger research project in medical ethics with the overarching aim to explore whether the VZ is ethically justifiable. The aim is to enrich the normative discussion by investigating empirically how the VZ is perceived in healthcare.\nInterviews based on a semi-structured interview guide were performed with 12 Swedish psychiatrists. The interviews were analysed with descriptive qualitative content analysis aiming for identifying perceptions of the Vision Zero for Suicide as well as arguments for and against it.\nThough most of the participants mentioned at least some potential benefit of the Vision Zero for Suicide, the overall impression was a predominant skepticism. Some participants focused on why they consider the VZ to be unachievable, while others focused more on its potential consequences and normative implications.\nThe VZ was perceived to be impossible to realize, nonconstructive or potentially counterproductive, and undesirable because of potential conflicts with other values and interests of patients as well as the general public. There were also important notions of the VZ having negative consequences for the working conditions of psychiatrists in Sweden, in increasing their work-related anxiety and thwarting the patient-physician relationship."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Evaluation of Children During the Organ Transplant Process.", "Abstract": "Organ transplantation is performed frequently in Turkey.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the relationship between parental psychiatric disorders and child school readiness, which is linked to later academic achievement. This study aims to investigate these relationships and broaden the evidence underlying the rationale for family-focused interventions for parental psychiatric disorders.\nThis study used linked administrative data. Children's school readiness in multiple developmental domains (physical, social, emotional, communicative, cognitive) was measured by the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) for 19 071 Western Australian children (mean age 5.5 years). Children scoring in the bottom 25% on any AEDC domain were considered developmentally vulnerable, or at risk of vulnerability, on that domain. Biological child-parent pairs were identified using birth records. Parents with psychiatric disorders were identified from hospital records, which included information on diagnosis and frequency/duration of psychiatric admissions. Logistic regressions, adjusted for parent age, mother's marital status, child Aboriginality, child English language status, local community remoteness and socioeconomic index, estimated the odds of children being vulnerable/at-risk on each of the AEDC domains.\nA total of 719 mothers and 417 fathers had a psychiatric hospitalisation during the study period (12 months prior to the child's birth, up to the end of 2009). Children whose parents had psychiatric disorders had increased odds of being classified as vulnerable/at-risk for school readiness. This increase in odds was evident for both maternal (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 1.37- 1.51) and paternal psychiatric disorders (aOR 1.38-1.50); and for a single admission of one day (aOR 1.32-1.59), a single admission of multiple days (aOR 1.30-1.47), and multiple admissions (aOR 1.35-1.63). Some variability in child outcome was found depending on the parents' psychiatric diagnosis (mood, anxiety, substance abuse or comorbid disorder).\nChildren of parents who have been hospitalised with psychiatric disorders are at risk for poor school readiness. These findings add support to recommendations that mental health professionals consider dependent children in discharge and treatment planning for adult psychiatric inpatients. It is also important to ensure that the impact of psychiatric illness in fathers is not overlooked in assessment and intervention.

Building on interview data drawn from an ethnographic study, the article shows how the professionals' articulations reflected a gender binary that framed how the feminized patients were often connected to psychiatric care while masculinized patients were referred to separate alcohol or substance use treatment outside the psychiatric institution. The article discusses the societal and institutional conditionality of gendered understandings in psychiatry. In spite of several limitations, the article elucidates how professionals' understandings might have wide-ranging implications for the accuracy of epidemiological research and policy, and how they reflect a power struggle between patients and professionals about the legitimate right to interpret patients' conditions and efforts to manage their illness-related problems."}, {"Title": "[Not Available].", "Abstract": "This study aimed to describe the practice of electroconvulsivotherapy (ECT) at the University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia).

Emerging evidence suggests that accurate biomarkers for psychiatric disorders might benefit from incorporating information regarding multiple brain regions and their interactions with one another, rather than considering local perturbations in brain structure and function alone. Recent advances in the field of applied mathematics generally - and network science specifically - provide a language to capture the complexity of interacting brain regions, and the application of this language to fundamental questions in neuroscience forms the emerging field of network neuroscience. This chapter provides an overview of the use and utility of network neuroscience for building biomarkers in psychiatry. The chapter begins with an overview of the theoretical frameworks and tools that encompass network neuroscience before describing applications of network neuroscience to the study of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. With reference to work on genetic, molecular, and environmental correlates of network neuroscience features, the promises and challenges of network neuroscience for providing tools that aid in the diagnosis and the evaluation of treatment response in psychiatric disorders are discussed."}, {"Title": "Faculty Development for Teaching Faculty in Psychiatry: Where We Are and What We Need.", "Abstract": "A Faculty Development Task Force surveyed the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training membership to assess faculty development for graduate medical education faculty in psychiatry departments and barriers to seeking graduate medical education careers.\nAn anonymous Survey Monkey survey was emailed to 722 American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training members. The survey included questions about demographics, the current state of faculty development offerings within the respondent's psychiatry department and institution, and potential American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training faculty development programming. Two open-response questions targeted unmet faculty development needs and barriers to seeking a career in graduate medical education. Results were analyzed as frequencies and open-ended questions were coded by two independent coders. We limited our analysis to general psychiatry program director responses for questions regarding faculty development activities in an attempt to avoid multiple responses from a single department.\nResponse rates were 21.0% overall and 30.4% for general program directors. General program directors reported that the most common existing departmental faculty development activities were educational grand rounds (58.7%), teaching workshops (55.6%), and funding for external conference attendance (52.4%). Of all survey respondents, 48.1% expressed the need for more protected time, 37.5% teaching skills workshops, and 16.3% mentorship. Lack of funding (56.9%) and time (53.9%) as well as excessive clinical demands (28.4%) were identified as the main barriers to seeking a career in graduate medical education.\nDespite increasing faculty development efforts in psychiatry departments and institutions, real and significant unmet faculty development needs remain.

Twenty children and adolescents underwent pharmacogenetic testing between June 2014 and May 2017. All children and adolescents were evaluated at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital-Majadahonda (Madrid, Spain). We report the proportion of patients achieving clinical improvement, amelioration of side effects, and changes in number of drugs. Data normality was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and changes of pre- and post-pharmacogenetic testing were analyzed with the Wilcoxon test for paired samples. A two-sided p value threshold of 0.05 was considered for significance. Pharmacogenetic testing helped to improve the clinical outcome as measured by the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale in virtually all children (95%; 19 out of 20 children). The CGI improvement (CGI-I) was 2 (0.79) (range 1-4), 2.1 (0.56) (range 1-3), and 1.9 (0.99) (range 1-4) in foster and non-foster care children, respectively. Pharmacogenetic testing also helped to reduce the number of children using polypharmacy (from 65 to 45%), the mean number of drugs per children (from 3.3 to 2.4 drugs, p\u2009=\u20090.017), and self-reported relevant side effects (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Pharmacogenetic testing helped to improve the clinical outcome, and to reduce polypharmacy and the number of drugs used in children and adolescents with severe mental disorders.

Utilization and uptake, however, appears to be lower than would be expected.\nThis study aimed to examine actual utilization of e-consult between PCPs and psychiatrists and investigate the perceptions of PCPs about this form of psychiatric advice to inform how to optimize the utility and thereby the uptake of this service.\nIn this mixed-methods study, we conducted a chart review of psychiatry e-consults (N=37) over 2 platforms during early implementation in Ontario, Canada, as well as 3 group interviews and 1 individual interview with PCPs (N=10) with variable experience levels and from a range of practice settings. The chart review assessed response times and referral content including the type of request, referral attachments, and consultant responses. Interviews explored the perceptions of the PCPs about the uses and barriers of psychiatry e-consult. Thematic content analysis of interview data identified common themes as well as themes unique to different provider profiles (eg, experienced PCPs vs new PCPs and rural vs urban practice). On the basis of interpretation of the quantitative and qualitative findings, we developed recommendations for the optimization of psychiatry e-consultation services.\nDuring the study period, psychiatry e-consults comprised 3.66% (49/1339) of all e-consults submitted on the studied platforms. Among the e-consults reviewed, different psychiatric diagnoses were represented: 70% of requests (26/37) queried about medication safety or side effects, whereas 59% (22/37) asked about psychiatric symptom management. Moreover, 81% (30/37) of e-consults were answered within 24 hours, and 65% (24/37) were addressed in a single exchange. Themes from the interview data included psychiatry having a complexity that differentiates it from other specialties and may limit the utility of e-consult, other than for psychopharmacology advice. Variability in awareness exists in the way e-consultation could be used in psychiatry, with new PCPs feeling unsure about the appropriateness of a question. In general, new PCPs and PCPs practicing in rural areas were more receptive to psychiatry e-consult. PCPs viewed e-consult as an opportunity to collaborate and desired that it be integrated with other available services. Recommendations include the need for appropriate specialist staffing to address a wide range of requests, adequate education to referrers regarding the use of psychiatry e-consult, and the need to integrate psychiatry e-consult with other geographically relevant services, given the complexity of psychiatric issues.\nE-consult is a viable and timely way for PCPs to get much-needed psychiatric advice. For optimizing its utility and uptake, e-consult needs to be integrated into reliable care pathways with adequate referrer and consultant preparation."}, {"Title": "Standardized patients in psychiatry - the best way to learn clinical skills?", "Abstract": "Standardized patients (SP) have been successfully utilized in medical education to train students' communication skills. At the Medical University of Vienna communication training with SPs in psychiatry is a mandatory part of the curriculum. In the training, the SP plays the role of four different patients suffering from depression/suicidal tendencies, somatoform disorder, anxiety disorder, or borderline disorder while the student attempts to gather the patient's medical history. Both the instructor and SP then give the student constructive feedback afterwards.\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of the SP's roleplay and feedback, using a self-created questionnaire. Additionally, we wanted to gauge the differences between the students' and teachers' evaluations of the SP's role playing performance and feedback.\nThe questionnaire was completed by 529 students and 29 teachers who attended the training. Overall, both students and teachers evaluated the SPs' performance and feedback very well. In comparison to the responses given by the teachers, more students reported that the \"SP overacted\" while fewer students believed that the \"SP could be a real patient\". The feedback given by the SP was evaluated similarly by students and teachers, suggesting that students are able to recognize the quality of constructive feedback. Furthermore, the SP's quality of roleplaying was evaluated as the poorest while playing the psychiatric disorder \"depression/suicidal tendencies.\"\nOur study showed that students and teachers appreciate SPs' competence of role play and of giving feedback. However, further studies should be performed to figure out why both students and teachers alike evaluated the played psychiatric disorder \"depression/suicidal tendencies\" to be the worst."}, {"Title": "Geographic variations in involuntary care and associations with the supply of health and social care: results from a nationwide study.", "Abstract": "Involuntary psychiatric care remains controversial. Geographic disparities in its use can challenge the appropriateness of the care provided when they do not result from different health needs of the population. These disparities should be reduced through dedicated health policies. However, their association with the supply of health and social care, which could be targeted by such policies, has been insufficiently studied. Our objectives were therefore to describe geographic variations in involuntary admission rates across France and to identify the characteristics of the supply of care which were associated with these variations.\nInvoluntary admission rate per 100,000 adult inhabitants was calculated in French psychiatric sectors' catchment areas using 2012 data from the national psychiatric discharge database. Its variations were first described numerically and graphically. Several factors potentially associated with these variations were then considered in a negative binomial regression with an offset term accounting for the size of catchment areas. They included characteristics of the supply of care (public and private care, health and social care, hospital and community-based care, specialised and non-specialised care) as well as adjustment factors related to epidemiological characteristics of the population of each sector's catchment area and its level of urbanization. Such variables were extracted from complementary administrative databases. Supply characteristics associated with geographic variations were identified using a significance level of 0.05.\nSignificant variations in involuntary admission rates were observed between psychiatric sectors' catchment areas with a coefficient of variation close to 80%. These variations were associated with some characteristics of the supply of health and social care in the sectors' catchment areas. Notably, an increase in the availability of community-based private psychiatrists and the capacity of housing institutions for disabled individuals was associated with a decrease in involuntary admission rates while an increase in the availability of general practitioners was associated with an increase in those rates.\nThere is evidence of considerable variations in involuntary admission rates between psychiatric sectors' catchment areas. Our results provide lines of thoughts to reduce such variations, in particular by supporting an increase in the availability of upstream and downstream care in the community."}, {"Title": "A Latent Variable Approach to Differentiating Neural Mechanisms of Irritability and Anxiety in Youth.", "Abstract": "Comorbidity is ubiquitous in psychiatry, but it is unclear how to differentiate neural mechanisms of co-occurring symptoms. Pediatric irritability and anxiety symptoms are prevalent and frequently co-occur. Threat orienting is pertinent to both phenotypes and is an ideal context in which to examine their unique and common neural mechanisms.\nTo decompose the unique and shared variances of pediatric irritability and anxiety symptoms and to determine neural correlates of these differentiated phenotypes during threat orienting.\nThis investigation was a cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The setting was a research clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health. Participants were youth aged 8 to 18 years spanning multiple diagnostic categories (141 youth with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 56 healthy youth). This combination provided wide variation in levels of irritability and anxiety symptoms. Data were acquired between June 30, 2012, and June 28, 2016.\nParticipants and parents rated youth's irritability on the Affective Reactivity Index and anxiety on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Bifactor analysis decomposed the unique and shared variances. A functional magnetic resonance imaging dot-probe task assessed attention orienting to angry (ie, threat) vs neutral faces. Whole-brain analyses examined associations between the bifactor-derived phenotypes and both neural activity and amygdala functional connectivity.\nAmong 197 participants included in the final analysis, the mean (SD) age was 13.1 (2.7) years, and 91 (46.2%) were female. The best-fit bifactor model (Comparative Fit Index, 0.959; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, 0.066) included unique factors of parent-reported irritability, youth-reported irritability, and anxiety, as well as a common factor of negative affectivity. When the task required attention away from threat, higher parent-reported irritability was associated with increased activity in the insula, caudate, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior parietal lobule (t189\u22654.15 for all, P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all). In contrast, higher anxiety was associated with decreased amygdala connectivity to the cingulate, thalamus, and precentral gyrus (t189\u2264-4.19 for all, P\u2009<\u2009.001 for all). These distinctive neural correlates did not emerge using a diagnostic approach.\nA latent variable approach to parsing co-occurring symptom dimensions revealed a novel double dissociation. During orientation away from threat, only irritability was associated with neural activity, whereas only anxiety was associated with amygdala connectivity.

This single dimension of general psychopathology has been termed \"p,\" because it conceptually parallels a dimension already familiar to behavioral scientists and clinicians: the \"g\" factor of general intelligence. As the g dimension reflects low to high mental ability, the p dimension represents low to high psychopathology severity, with thought disorder at the extreme. The dimension of p unites all disorders. It influences present/absent status on hundreds of psychiatric symptoms, which modern nosological systems typically aggregate into dozens of distinct diagnoses, which in turn aggregate into three overarching domains, namely, the externalizing, internalizing, and psychotic experience domains, which finally aggregate into one dimension of psychopathology from low to high: p. Studies show that the higher a person scores on p, the worse that person fares on measures of family history of psychiatric illness, brain function, childhood developmental history, and adult life impairment. A dimension of p may help account for ubiquitous nonspecificity in psychiatry: multiple disorders share the same risk factors and biomarkers and often respond to the same therapies. Here, the authors summarize the history of the unidimensional idea, review modern research into p, demystify statistical models, articulate some implications of p for prevention and clinical practice, and outline a transdiagnostic research agenda.

The objective of the web-based field study was to compare ICD-10 and ICD-11 (beta draft) for selected mental disorders, regarding consistency, accuracy and assessment of utility. The first study (TP1) focused on the diagnostic classification and the second (TP2) on assignment of diagnostic codes.In TP1, clinicians used either the ICD-10 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) version or a draft version of the ICD-11 CDDG to evaluate 10 case vignettes in a randomized study implemented through the WHO GCPN **. As hypothesized, consistency was in favor of the ICD-11 (p = .02; n = 319 expert participants) though there was some variability across the different diagnostic categories. In addition, time for diagnosis was shorter (p = .01) and clinicians' judgment of utility (ease of use; goodness of fit) was better for ICD-11 (p = .047 and p < .001 respectively).TP2 focused on consistency of diagnostic code assignment for 25 short case descriptions (including explicit diagnosis and additional clinical information) using both ICD-10 and ICD-11 in a randomized web-based field study which was run on the WHO ICD-FiT *** platform. Based on 531 code assignments by120 expert clinicians, consistency for ICD-11 was significantly lower compared to ICD-10 (71 % vs. 82 %, p < .001) contrary to study hypothesis, and time required was significantly higher for ICD-11 (p < .001). Nevertheless, utility assessments were in favor of ICD-11 (p < .005).In summary, in TP1, given vignettes with more complex clinical descriptions more similar to clinical cases, ICD-11 showed advantages in the consistency of correct diagnoses among clinicians, time required to reach a diagnosis, and clinicians' ratings of clinical utility. These results provide evidence for quality improvement of the diagnostic process due to the revision of the more complete diagnostic guidelines for ICD-11. In the coding task of TP2, coding by clinicians using the ICD-10 was more consistent and faster than coding using the ICD-11. This may be a result of the greater complexity for coding use of the ICD-11 (e. g., due to 'post-coordination'), as well as greater familiarity with the ICD-10 system (which German clinicians currently use) and lack of practice with the new ICD-11 codes and tools. In spite of this, users assessed the ICD-11 system as more useful than the ICD-10, in part also because of ICD-11's more systematic and comprehensive coding tools. In addition, time needed for coding improved with practice, indicating need for intense education and training initiatives when ICD-11 is adopted and implemented into clinical practice."}, {"Title": "The third New Zealand Psychiatry of Old Age services and workforce survey.", "Abstract": "To survey the Psychiatry of Old Age (POA) services and workforce in New Zealand (NZ).\nThe NZ branch of Faculty of POA contacted the POA lead clinician and/or service manager of the 20 district health boards (DHBs) and completed a survey based on variables used in two similar previous national surveys.\nSeventeen services responded.

Data were collected prospectively with standardized operating procedures on consecutive inpatient consultation requests to the University Clinical Hospital of Barcelona CLP service.\n9,808 psychiatric consultation were requested (referral rate=2.2%). The referrals to our CLP service were requested mainly by medical units. The most frequent psychiatric diagnoses were alcohol-related disorders, delirium and adjustment disorders. The mean percentage of patients treated with psychopharmacologic drugs was 81.6%. The mean length of the hospital stays of patients with psychiatric comorbidity referred to our CLP service was significantly longer than that of all the admissions to the hospital during that period. Most of the studied variables remained constant over the 10-year-period. However, some somatic diagnoses at admission, reasons for referral and recommendations of psychotropic drugs presented significant changes.\nDespite the continuous evolution and changes of several factors in the last two decades, like the health care systems, the clinical practice of CLP services has been quite stable over time. However, our results support the idea of a non-static specialty."}, {"Title": "A research study review of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients: needs assessment for future research and an impassioned plea.", "Abstract": "Rates of psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients (delirium, depression, anxiety disorders) remain unchanged. However, patient numbers have increased as the population has aged; indeed, cancer is a chief cause of mortality and morbidity in older populations. Effectiveness of psychiatric interventions and research to evaluate, inform, and improve interventions is critical to these patients' care. This article's intent is to report results from a recent review study on the effectiveness of interventions for psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients; the review study assessed the state of research regarding treatment effectiveness. Unlike previous review studies, this one included non-traditional/alternative therapies and spirituality interventions that have undergone scientific inquiry.\nA five-phase systematic strategy and a theoretic grounded iterative methodology were used to identify studies for inclusion and to craft an integrated, synthesized, comprehensive, and reasonably current end-product.\nPsychiatric medication therapies undoubtedly are the most powerful treatments. Among them, the most effective (i.e., \"best practices benchmarks\") are: (1) for delirium, typical antipsychotics-though there is no difference between typical vs. atypical and other antipsychotics, except for different side-effect profiles, (2) for depression, if patient life expectancy is \u22654-6\u00a0weeks, then a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and if <\u20093\u00a0weeks, then psychostimulants or ketamine, and these generally are useful anytime in the cancer disease course, and (3) for anxiety disorders, bio-diazepams (BDZs) are most used and most effective. A universal consensus suggests that psychosocial (i.e., talk) therapy and spirituality interventions fortify the therapeutic alliance and psychiatric medication protocols. However, trial studies have had mixed results regarding effectiveness in reducing psychiatric symptoms, even for touted psychotherapies.\nThis study's findings prompted a testable linear conceptual model of co-factors and their importance for providing effective psychiatric care for end-stage cancer patients. The complicated and tricky part is negotiating patients' diagnoses while articulating internal intricacies within and between each of the model's co-factors. There is a relative absence of scientifically derived information and need for more large-scale, diverse scientific inquiry. Thus, this article is an impassioned plea for accelerated study and better care for end-stage cancer patients' psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "Alzheimer's disease: clinical update on epidemiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis.", "Abstract": "To provide a clinical update for general psychiatrists on the assessment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting current issues regarding epidemiology, risk factors and pathophysiology from recent relevant research findings.\nPsychiatrists can apply their skills and training in the diagnosis of AD, which is based upon a comprehensive assessment comprising history, investigations, and cognitive and functional assessment, guided by accepted diagnostic criteria."}, {"Title": "The MAKE Biomarker Discovery for Enhancing anTidepressant Treatment Effect and Response (MAKE BETTER) Study: Design and Methodology.", "Abstract": "Depression is associated with a major disease burden, and many individuals suffer from depressive symptoms due to an insufficient response to ostensibly adequate antidepressant treatment.

Participants in the MAKE BETTER study were consecutively recruited from patients who visited the Psychiatry Department of Chonnam National University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea for treatment of a depressive disorder. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, genetic markers measured by whole-exome sequencing, and blood markers were obtained. The types and doses of antidepressants were determined based on the clinical judgment of the psychiatrist, and the treatment outcomes (e.g., depressive and other psychiatric symptoms and issues related to safety) were assessed.\nWe will be able to use the data collected in this study to develop a treatment-response prediction index composed of biomarkers.\nThe MAKE BETTER study will provide an empirical basis for a personalized medicine approach to depression by enabling the prediction of antidepressant treatment response according the characteristics of each patient. It will thereby support evidence-based decision-making that decreases the use of a trial-and-error approach to the treatment of depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "Who are the European youths willing to engage in radicalisation? A multidisciplinary review of their psychological and social profiles.", "Abstract": "A new model of radicalisation has appeared in Western countries since the 2010s. Radical groups are smaller, less hierarchical and are mainly composed of young, homegrown individuals. The aim of this review is to decipher the profiles of the European adolescents and young adults who have embraced the cause of radical Islamism and to define the role of psychiatry in dealing with this issue.\nWe performed a systematic search in several databases from January 2010 to July 2017 and reviewed the relevant studies that included European adolescents and/or young adults and presented empirical data.\nIn total, 22 qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed from various fields and using different methodologies. Psychotic disorders are rare among radicalised youths. However, they show numerous risk factors common with adolescent psychopathologies. We develop a comprehensive three-level model to explain the phenomenon of radicalisation among young Europeans: (1) individual risk factors include psychological vulnerabilities such as early experiences of abandonment, perceived injustice and personal uncertainty; (2) micro-environmental risk factors include family dysfunction and friendships with radicalised individuals; (3) societal risk factors include geopolitical events and societal changes such as Durkheim's concept of anomie. Some systemic factors are also implicated as there is a specific encounter between recruiters and the individual. The former use sectarian techniques to isolate and dehumanise the latter and to offer him a new societal model.\nThere are many similarities between psychopathological manifestations of adolescence and mechanisms at stake during the radicalisation process. As a consequence, and despite the rarity of psychotic disorders, mental health professionals have a role to play in the treatment and understanding of radical engagement among European youth. Studies with empirical data are limited, and more research should be promoted (in particular in females and in non-Muslim communities) to better understand the phenomenon and to propose recommendations for prevention and treatment."}, {"Title": "Physician-Specific Maximum Acceptable Risk in Personalized Medicine: Implications for Medical Decision Making.", "Abstract": "In discrete-choice experiments (DCEs), respondents are presented with a series of scenarios and asked to select their preferred choice. In clinical decision making, DCEs allow one to calculate the maximum acceptable risk (MAR) that a respondent is willing to accept for a one-unit increase in treatment efficacy. Most published studies report the average MAR for the whole sample, without conveying any information about heterogeneity. For a sample of psychiatrists prescribing drugs for a series of hypothetical patients with schizophrenia, this article demonstrates how heterogeneity accounted for in the DCE modeling can be incorporated in the derivation of the MAR.\nPsychiatrists were given information about a group of patients' responses to treatment on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the weight gain associated with the treatment observed in a series of 26 vignettes. We estimated a random parameters logit (RPL) model with treatment choice as the dependent variable.\nResults from the RPL were used to compute the MAR for the overall sample. This was found to be equal to 4%, implying that, overall, psychiatrists were willing to accept a 4% increase in the risk of an adverse event to obtain a one-unit improvement of symptoms - measured on the PANSS. Heterogeneity was then incorporated in the MAR calculation, finding that MARs ranged between 0.5 and 9.5 across the sample of psychiatrists.\nWe provided psychiatrists with hypothetical scenarios, and their MAR may change when making decisions for actual patients.\nThis analysis aimed to show how it is possible to calculate physician-specific MARs and to discuss how MAR heterogeneity could have implications for medical practice."}, {"Title": "The Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Depression and Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "Here, we review a novel concept namely the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS) as applied to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). There is evidence that a substantial subset of individuals with MDD and BD exhibit an activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), as indicated by an increased production of macrophagic M1 and T helper (Th)-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling, positive acute phase proteins (APPs), and complement factors. These immune aberrations appear to be evident during the course of major affective episodes of either depressive or (hypo) manic polarity. Here, we review (a) the current state of the art of CIRS functions in both mood disorders and (b) the possible role of CIRS-related biomarkers for the understanding of affective disorders within the framework of precision psychiatry that could also provide novel drug targets for both MDD and BD. CIRS-related abnormalities in mood disorders include elevated Th-2 and T regulatory (Treg) activities with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, classical IL-6 signaling, increased levels of sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1- receptors, and positive APPs, including haptoglobin, hemopexin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. It is concluded that CIRS is involved in MDD and BD by regulating the primary immune-inflammatory response, thereby contributing to spontaneous and antidepressant-promoted recovery from the acute phase of illness. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are observed in the remitted phases of both disorders indicating that there is no return to the original homeostasis after an acute episode, while later episodes of mood disorders are characterized by sensitized IRS and CIRS responses. New z-unit weighted composite biomarker scores are proposed, which reflect different aspects of IRS versus CIRS activation and may be used to estimate different IRS/CIRS activity ratios in mood and other neuroimmune disorders."}, {"Title": "Interactions Between Physicians and Skilled Home Health Care Agencies in the Certification of Medicare Beneficiaries' Plans of Care: Results of a Nationally Representative Survey.", "Abstract": "Physicians are required to certify a plan of care for patients who receive Medicare skilled home health care (SHHC) services.

How well they perform each of these tasks has a direct impact on patient outcomes. Measurement-based care has brought greater precision to these tasks and has improved outcomes. This article provides an overview of the types of biomeasures and biomarkers, the clinical uses of biomarkers, and the challenges in their development and clinical use. Although still in their infancy, biomarkers hold the promise of bringing even greater precision and even better outcomes in mental health. Biomeasures that could become biomarkers include genetic, proteomic, metabolomic, and immunologic measures, as well as physiological, functional, and brain structural measures. Mechanistic markers reflect and are based on the specific pathobiological processes that are involved in the development of a clinically defined condition. Some clinically relevant biomarkers may rely on this mechanistic understanding while others may not. Clinical biomarkers serve three broadly defined goals. Diagnostic markers define what is wrong. Prognostic markers define what will happen in the natural course of the condition, although they may also predict the course of illness during treatment. Theranostic markers address issues pertinent to treatment by defining whether, when, whom, and how to treat. Other biomarkers may be used to monitor the overall effect of treatment regardless of the therapeutic effects or to monitor the specific therapeutic effects of the intervention on the disorder itself. Biomarkers can also be used to estimate susceptibility/risk of developing the condition or the biological consequences of having had the disorder."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and clinical correlates of intermittent explosive disorder in Turkish psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is defined as the failure to resist aggressive impulses resulting in repeated acts of verbal and/or physical aggression.

Psychiatry has likewise been affected, and in this regard, the translational neurosciences have been the major drivers. This paper explores the conceptual underpinnings of this enterprise in relation to psychiatry. It shows that translation is used in a metaphorical sense in this context but that this can be misleading because of the resultant connotation that there is equivalence between neurobiological states and mental states. Furthermore, this equivalence is reinforced by the unidirectional flow or bottom up approach of the translational process. Given that the epistemological basis to psychiatry is fundamentally different to that underlying medicine, questions are raised concerning the application of the translational neurosciences approach to mental symptoms and mental disorders. The hybrid structure of mental symptoms and mental disorders demands that attention is paid to the \"semantic\" as well as the neurobiological constituents. Neglect of the former would carry implications for the validity of research findings as well as have ethical consequences for treating patients. Translational neurosciences may have greater validity in those mental disorders and mental symptoms whose constitution and sense are carried by the neurobiological elements."}, {"Title": "Supple bodies, healthy minds: yoga, psychedelics and American mental health.", "Abstract": "Much discussion about mental health has revolved around treatment models.

These data suggest that it may be possible to prevent the induction of affective disorders before they develop by administering prophylactic pharmaceuticals, a relatively nascent and unexplored strategy for psychiatry. Here, we performed metabolomics analysis of brain and plasma following prophylactic ketamine treatment in order to identify markers of stress resilience enhancement. We administered prophylactic ketamine in mice to buffer against fear expression. Following behavioral analyses, untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on both hemispheres of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC), and plasma. We found that prophylactic ketamine attenuated learned fear. Eight metabolites were changed in\u00a0the PFC and HPC upon ketamine treatment. Purine and pyrimidine metabolism were most significantly changed in the HPC, PFC, and, interestingly, plasma of mice two weeks after prophylactic administration. Moreover, most precursors to inhibitory neurotransmitters were increased whereas precursors to excitatory neurotransmitters were decreased. Strikingly, these long-term metabolomic changes were not observed when no stressor was administered. Our results suggest that prophylactic treatment differentially affects purine and pyrimidine metabolism and neurotransmission in brain and plasma following stress, which may underlie the long-lasting resilience to stress induced by a single injection of ketamine. These data may provide novel targets for prophylactic development, and indicate an interaction effect of prophylactic ketamine and stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies metabolomic alterations and biomarker candidates for prophylactic ketamine efficacy in mice."}, {"Title": "Antagonists in the medical management of opioid use disorders: Historical and existing treatment strategies.", "Abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition with potentially severe health and social consequences.

The purpose of this review is to address practices for managing persons with moderate to severe OUD with a focus on opioid withdrawal and naltrexone-based relapse-prevention treatment.\nLiterature available on PubMed was used to review the evolution of treatment strategies from the 1960s onward to manage opioid withdrawal and initiate treatment with naltrexone.\nEmerging practices for extended-release naltrexone induction include the use of agonist tapers and adjuvant medications. Clinical challenges frequently encountered when initiating this therapy include managing withdrawal and ongoing opioid use during treatment. Clinical factors may inform decisions regarding patient selection and length of naltrexone treatment, such as recent opioid use and patient preferences.\nTreatment strategies to manage opioid withdrawal have evolved, but many patients with OUD do not receive medication for the prevention of relapse. Clinical strategies for induction onto extended-release naltrexone are now available and can be safely and effectively implemented in specialty and select primary care settings.

Accumulating evidence shows that across several neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases, ER stress ensues, which is accompanied by over-activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although the UPR could initially serve adaptive purposes in conditions associated with higher cellular demands and after exposure to a range of pathophysiological insults, over time the UPR may become detrimental, thus contributing to neuroprogression. Herein, we propose that immune-inflammatory, neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative, as well as mitochondrial pathways may reciprocally interact with aberrations in UPR pathways. Furthermore, ER stress may contribute to a deregulation in calcium homoeostasis. The common denominator of these pathways is a decrease in neuronal resilience, synaptic dysfunction and even cell death. This review also discusses how mechanisms related to ER stress could be explored as a source for novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative and neuroprogressive diseases. The design of randomised controlled trials testing compounds that target aberrant UPR-related pathways within the emerging framework of precision psychiatry is warranted."}, {"Title": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: The \"New\" MRS for Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychiatry Research.", "Abstract": "Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) is a well-established technique for quantifying the brain regional biochemistry <i>in vivo</i>. In most studies, however, the <sup>1</sup>H MRS is acquired during rest with little to no constraint on behavior. Measured metabolite levels, therefore, reflect steady-state concentrations whose associations with behavior and cognition are unclear. With the recent advances in MR technology-higher-field MR systems, robust acquisition techniques and sophisticated quantification methods-<sup>1</sup>H MRS is now experiencing a resurgence. It is sensitive to task-related and pathology-relevant regional dynamic changes in neurotransmitters, including the most ubiquitous among them, glutamate. Moreover, high temporal resolution approaches allow tracking glutamate modulations at a time scale of under a minute during perceptual, motor, and cognitive tasks. The observed task-related changes in brain glutamate are consistent with new metabolic steady states reflecting the neural output driven by shifts in the local excitatory and inhibitory balance on local circuits. Unlike blood oxygen level differences-base functional MRI, this form of <i>in vivo</i> MRS, also known as functional MRS (<sup>1</sup>H fMRS), yields a more direct measure of behaviorally relevant neural activity and is considerably less sensitive to vascular changes. <sup>1</sup>H fMRS enables noninvasive investigations of task-related glutamate changes that are relevant to normal and impaired cognitive performance, and psychiatric disorders. By targeting brain glutamate, this approach taps into putative neural correlates of synaptic plasticity. This review provides a concise survey of recent technological advancements that lay the foundation for the successful use of <sup>1</sup>H fMRS in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, including a review of seminal <sup>1</sup>H fMRS studies, and the discussion of biological significance of task-related changes in glutamate modulation. We conclude with a discussion of the promises, limitations, and outstanding challenges of this new tool in the armamentarium of cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "Mental Disorder-The Need for an Accurate Definition.", "Abstract": "There are several reasons why a definition for mental disorder is essential. Among these are not only reasons linked to psychiatry itself as a science (nosology, research) but also to ethical, legal, and financial issues. The first formal definition of mental disorder resulted from a deep conceptual analysis led by Robert Spitzer. It emerged to address several challenges that psychiatry faced at the time, namely to serve as the starting point for an atheoretical and evidence-based classification of mental disorders, to justify the removal of homosexuality from classifications, and to counter the arguments of antipsychiatry. This definition has been updated, with some conceptual changes that make it depart from the main assumptions of Spitzer's original definition. In this article, we intend to review the factors that substantiated the emergence of the first formal definition of mental disorder that based all its later versions."}, {"Title": "Predicting Medical Students' Current Attitudes Toward Psychiatry, Interest in Psychiatry, and Estimated Likelihood of Working in Psychiatry: A Cross-Sectional Study in Four European Countries.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry as a medical discipline is becoming increasingly important due to the high and increasing worldwide burden associated with mental disorders. Surprisingly, however, there is a lack of young academics choosing psychiatry as a career. Previous evidence on medical students' perspectives is abundant but has methodological shortcomings. Therefore, by attempting to avoid previous shortcomings, we aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the predictors of the following three outcome variables: current medical students' attitudes toward psychiatry, interest in psychiatry, and estimated likelihood of working in psychiatry. The sample consisted of <i>N</i>\u2009=\u20091,356 medical students at 45 medical schools in Germany and Austria as well as regions of Switzerland and Hungary with a German language curriculum. We used snowball sampling <i>via</i> Facebook with a link to an online questionnaire as recruitment procedure. Snowball sampling is based on referrals made among people. This questionnaire included a German version of the Attitudes Toward Psychiatry Scale (ATP-30-G) and further variables related to outcomes and potential predictors in terms of sociodemography (e.g., gender) or medical training (e.g., curriculum-related experience with psychiatry). Data were analyzed by linear mixed models and further regression models. On average, students had a positive attitude to and high general interest in, but low professional preference for, psychiatry. A neutral attitude to psychiatry was partly related to the discipline itself, psychiatrists, or psychiatric patients. Female gender and previous experience with psychiatry, particularly curriculum-related and personal experience, were important predictors of all outcomes. Students in the first years of medical training were more interested in pursuing psychiatry as a career. Furthermore, the country of the medical school was related to the outcomes. However, statistical models explained only a small proportion of variance. The findings indicate that particularly curriculum-related experience is important for determining attitudes toward psychiatry, interest in the subject and self-predicted professional career choice. We therefore encourage the provision of opportunities for clinical experience by psychiatrists. However, further predictor variables need to be considered in future studies."}, {"Title": "Modafinil Dependence: A Case with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.", "Abstract": "Modafinil is generally known as a drug with low addiction potential. There are few case reports in the literature demonstrating that Modafinil, stated being capable of diminishing symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), causes addiction. In the present article a Modafinil addicted ADHD case, consuming usurious doses (5,000 mg/per day) of Modafinil is presented. The case presented to our psychiatry outpatient clinic due to: requirement of in taking high dose Modafinil in order to achieve the initial effects, difficulty in obtaining the drug, irritability, anxiousness, sleep irregularities, fatigue and unpleasant vivid dreams when he did not use the drug. It was realized that the patient, himself increased doses of Modafinil incrementally, in order to keep its effects on attention symptoms at the same level.

The objective of this article is to examine key trends and variables with implications for inpatient care as indicated by 30-day readmission and outpatient care as reflected by readmission within 5 years.\nUsing OMHRS data from 2005 to 2015, patients who had their first inpatient admission were followed for 5 years to examine their subsequent 30-day and overall admission rates stratified by discharge time and diagnosis.\nThe study cohort consisted of 42,280 patients. The 30-day and 5-year readmission rates for the entire cohort were 7.2% and 35.1%, respectively. Using a time course analysis of readmission for discharges in different years, both 30-day readmission and 5-year readmission rates decreased in a linear manner from 2005 to 2010, primarily because of readmission patterns for patients diagnosed with mood disorders and schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders. It was also evident that both demographic considerations such as age and gender and variables reflective of social determinants such as education level and employment were predictive of rehospitalization risk.\nThe trends of decreasing readmission rates may be reflective of improvements in the quality of hospital and community-based outpatient care. Such system-level indicators warrant tracking and may inform more effective tertiary prevention."}, {"Title": "Association of Brain Cortical Changes With Relapse in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "More than half of all patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience a relapse within 2 years after recovery. It is unclear how relapse affects brain morphologic features during the course of MDD.\nTo use structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify morphologic brain changes associated with relapse in MDD.\nIn this longitudinal case-control study, patients with acute MDD at baseline and healthy controls were recruited from the University of M\u00fcnster Department of Psychiatry from March 21, 2010, to November 14, 2014, and were reassessed from November 11, 2012, to October 28, 2016. Depending on patients' course of illness during follow-up, they were subdivided into groups of patients with and without relapse. Whole-brain gray matter volume and cortical thickness of the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, and insula were assessed via 3-T magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 2 years later.\nGray matter was analyzed via group (no relapse, relapse, and healthy controls) by time (baseline and follow-up) analysis of covariance, controlling for age and total intracranial volume. Confounding factors of medication and depression severity were assessed.\nThis study included 37 patients with MDD and a relapse (19 women and 18 men; mean [SD] age, 37.0 [12.7] years), 23 patients with MDD and without relapse (13 women and 10 men; mean [SD] age, 32.5 [10.5] years), and 54 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (24 women and 30 men; mean [SD] age, 37.5 [8.7] years). A significant group-by-time interaction controlling for age and total intracranial volume revealed that patients with relapse showed a significant decline of insular volume (difference, -0.032; 95% CI, -0.063 to -0.002; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and dorsolateral prefrontal volume (difference, -0.079; 95% CI, -0.113 to -0.045; P\u2009<\u2009.001) from baseline to follow-up. In patients without relapse, gray matter volume in these regions did not change significantly (insula: difference, 0.027; 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.066; P\u2009=\u2009.17; and dorsolateral prefrontal volume: difference, 0.023; 95% CI, -0.020 to 0.066; P\u2009=\u2009.30). Volume changes were not correlated with psychiatric medication or with severity of depression at follow-up. Additional analysis of cortical thickness showed an increase in the anterior cingulate cortex (difference, 0.073 mm; 95% CI, 0.023-0.123 mm; P\u2009=\u2009.005) and orbitofrontal cortex (difference, 0.089 mm; 95% CI, 0.032-0.147 mm; P\u2009=\u2009.003) from baseline to follow-up in patients without relapse.\nA distinct association of relapse in MDD with brain morphologic features was revealed using a longitudinal design. Relapse is associated with brain structures that are crucial for regulation of emotions and thus needs to be prevented. This study might be a step to guide future prognosis and maintenance treatment in patients with recurrent MDD."}, {"Title": "Sigmund Freud-early network theories of the brain.", "Abstract": "Since the early days of modern neuroscience, psychological models of brain function have been a key component in the development of new knowledge. These models aim to provide a framework that allows the integration of discoveries derived from the fundamental disciplines of neuroscience, including anatomy and physiology, as well as clinical neurology and psychiatry. During the initial stages of his career, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), became actively involved in these nascent fields with a burgeoning interest in functional neuroanatomy. In contrast to his contemporaries, Freud was convinced that cognition could not be localised to separate modules and that the brain processes cognition not in a merely serial manner but in a parallel and dynamic fashion-anticipating fundamental aspects of current network theories of brain function. This article aims to shed light on Freud's seminal, yet oft-overlooked, early work on functional neuroanatomy and his reasons for finally abandoning the conventional neuroscientific \"brain-based\" reference frame in order to conceptualise the mind from a purely psychological perspective."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of clinical teaching of mental health courses in nursing using clinical supervision and Kirkpatrick's model.", "Abstract": "Clinical experience associated with the fear and anxiety of nursing students in the psychiatric unit.

The students were selected by a non-probable convenient sampling method. After completing their clinical education, each student responded to checklist questions based on the four-level Kirkpatrick's model evaluation and open questions relating to clinical supervision. Finally, all data was analyzed using the SPSS version 16.\nThe students have evaluated clinical supervision as a useful approach, and appreciated the instructor's supportive behavior during teaching and imparting clinical skills. This has made them feel relaxed at the end of the clinical teaching course. In addition, in the evaluation through Kirkpatrick's model, more than 70% of the students have been satisfied with the method of conducting the teaching and average score of nursing students' attitude toward mental health students: Their mean self-confidence score was 18.33\u00b11.69, and the mean score of their performance in the study was evaluated to be 93.74\u00b15.3 from 100 points.\nThe results of clinical mental health teaching through clinical supervision and Kirkpatrick's model evaluation show that the satisfaction, self-esteem, attitude, and skill of nursing students are excellent, thereby portraying the effectiveness of clinical teaching.

We reviewed the peer-reviewed\u00a0literature on the use of involuntary admission in Norway, with the purpose of identifying the current state of knowledge and areas in need of further research.\nA systematic review following the PRISMA statement was conducted. We searched the electronic databases PsycInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase for studies relating to involuntary admission to Norwegian adult psychiatric hospitals published in the period 1 January 2001 to 8 August 2016. The database searches were supplemented with manual searches of relevant journals, reference lists, and websites.\nSeventy-four articles were included and grouped into six categories based on their main topics: Patients' experiences, satisfaction and perceived coercion (21 articles), the Referral and admission process (11 articles), Rates of admission (8 articles), Characteristics of the patients (17 articles), Staff attitudes (9 articles), and Outcomes (8 articles). Four of the included articles described intervention studies. Fifty-seven of the articles had a quantitative design, 16 had a qualitative design, and one a mixed-method design. There was a broad range of topics that were studied and considerable variation in study designs. The findings were largely in line with the international literature, but the particularities of Norwegian legislation and the Norwegian health services were reflected in the literature. The four intervention studies explored interventions for reducing rates of involuntary admission, such as modifying referring routines, improving patient information procedures, and increasing patients' say in the admission process, and represent an important avenue for future research on involuntary admission in Norway.\nThe review suggests that Norway has a relatively high rate of involuntary admissions.

In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of studies on pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Given this large body of research, busy clinicians might tend to rely on meta-analyses, rather than individual trials, to keep abreast of the evidence base supporting intervention strategies in child and adolescent psychiatry. Many meta-analyses focused on treatments for child and adolescent mental health problems have primarily addressed the question: Is treatment X more efficacious/effective (or safer) than the control condition? This is clearly an important starting point for clinicians when discussing with their patients and families the benefits and risks of treatment X, but clinicians need to know more. For instance, they might look for the evidence base to answer the following questions: Is treatment X the most efficacious and effective (or safest) option for my patient? When will treatment X likely start working? If the dose or intensity of the treatment does not seem to be effective, is it worthwhile to increase it?

Moreover, whether personality traits contribute to important career choices such as choosing to work in the private or public sector or with clinical patient contact, as well as change of specialty, have remained largely unexplored. In a nationally representative sample of Finnish physicians (N\u2009=\u20092837) we examined how personality traits are associated with medical career choices after graduating from medical school, in terms of employment sector, patient contact, medical specialty and change of specialty.\nPersonality was assessed using the shortened version of the Big Five Inventory (S-BFI). An analysis of covariance with posthoc tests for pairwise comparisons was conducted, adjusted for gender and age with confounders (employment sector, clinical patient contact and medical specialty).\nHigher openness was associated with working in the private sector, specializing in psychiatry, changing specialty and not practicing with patients. Lower openness was associated with a high amount of patient contact and specializing in general practice as well as ophthalmology and otorhinolaryngology. Higher conscientiousness was associated with a high amount of patient contact and specializing in surgery and other internal medicine specialties. Lower conscientiousness was associated with specializing in psychiatry and hospital service specialties. Higher agreeableness was associated with working in the private sector and specializing in general practice and occupational health. Lower agreeableness and neuroticism were associated with specializing in surgery. Higher extraversion was associated with specializing in pediatrics and change of specialty. Lower extraversion was associated with not practicing with patients.\nThe results showed distinctive personality traits to be associated with physicians' career and specialty choices after medical school independent of known confounding factors. Openness was the most consistent personality trait associated with physicians' career choices in terms of employment sector, amount of clinical patient contact, specialty choice and change of specialty.

Participants included 18 female Eritrean refugees aged 18-60, who had obtained refugee status and were still living in an asylum reception centre. A content-focused hermeneutic analytic approach was used.\nInterviewees described the challenges of pre-flight and flight trauma, conditions at the refugee centre, communication difficulties and the 'endless' waiting for transfer to a municipality. To cope, they found it helpful to focus on the future and to think positively. Fellowship with and support from fellow Eritrean refugees were essential as they became a proxy family and provided a strong ethnic identity. Their religious belief also helped them cope and gave them hope for the future.\nThe interviewees in this study perceived their psychological problems as a normal reaction to what they had been through. Religious belief was an important resilience factor, as was social support, especially from peers.\nThe interviewees' coping was based on the realization of their psychological reactions being normal while doing their utmost to focus on their aims and hopes for the future."}, {"Title": "Eric Wittkower and the foundation of Montr\u00e9al's Transcultural Psychiatry Research Unit after World War II.", "Abstract": "Eric Wittkower founded McGill University's Transcultural Psychiatry Unit in 1955.

Over the past few years, and facilitated by Latvia's progress along the route of Western democracy and participation in international organizations (EU, OECD), as well as funding support from the EU, several policy documents have been developed with the aim of improving healthcare quality. Simultaneously, several small-scale initiatives have emerged aiming at the promotion of quality of care, such as the quality award, and the quality comparison of psychiatric hospitals. Furthermore, the Psychiatric Inpatient Patient Experience Questionnaire for on-site measurement (PIPEQ-OS) has recently been adapted for use in Latvia. The first application of PIPEQ-OS in a psychiatric hospital in Riga reveals high patient responsiveness, interest and surprise about being asked to participate in the decision-making process regarding treatment and pharmaceutical choices.

A prospective multisite study in the DTRF Paris-Sud].", "Abstract": "In psychiatric inpatient settings seclusion is a last resort to ensure the safety of the patient, other patients, and staff from disturbed behaviors. Despite its major interest for patients, seclusion could negatively impact treatment adherence and patient/staff relationships. Indeed, some secluded patients report a feeling of guilt during the measure and do not consider seclusion to be a healthcare intervention. To be more beneficial and to reduce the feeling by patients of being forced, seclusions should be as short and rare as possible. In other words, measures to reduce seclusion are available and have been clearly identified. Such measures could be applied, in the first instance, in patients with longer duration. In this way, the aim of this study was to investigate predictive factors of a seclusion of long duration.\nOur study was based on the dataset of the EPIC study, an observational prospective French multicenter study of seclusion and restraint. The EPIC study occurred in seven French psychiatric hospitals in the southern region of Paris. Inclusions were realized for 73days and allowed a data collection of 302 seclusion measures. Of these measures 236 were effectively a seclusion in a standardized room. Because the median duration was 7days, we defined two groups of patients: duration<7days and duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days. Our variable to be explicated was duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days. Explicative variables available in EPIC study were age, sex, forced hospitalization, autoagressivity, heteroagressivity, use of sedative treatment (oral or intramuscular), history of seclusion and patient diagnoses. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to explore the association between a seclusion duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days and explicative variables. Diagnoses were classified as psychotic disorders, mood disorders and others diagnoses. To be included in multivariate logistic regressions, diagnoses were treated as dummy variables (mood disorder vs psychotic disorders; psychotic disorders vs others; mood disorders vs others). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software 20.0 and R 3.4.0.\nOf the 236 measures of seclusion the mean age was 38.2 (\u00b112.8), 196 (83%) patients were forcibly hospitalized prior to their seclusion, 147 (62%) had a diagnosis of psychotic disorder, 43 (18%) a diagnosis of mood disorder and 33 (14%) an \"other diagnosis\". Mean duration was 10.2 (1.5) days and median was 7.1\u00a0days. One hundred and thirty-five (47%) patients were in the group of duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days. In bivariate analyses, variables associated with a duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days were: being in forced hospitalization prior to the seclusion (P=0.04), administration of a sedative treatment (P=0.01) and against the group of others diagnoses the diagnosis of mood disorders (P<0.0005) and psychotic disorders (P=0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that, against the group of other diagnoses, the group of psychotic disorders [OR=3.3, CI 95% (1.3-8.4), P=0.01], the group of mood disorder [OR=2.7, CI 95% (1.4-4.9), P=0.002] and administration of sedative treatment [OR=8.1, CI 95% (2.0-32.5), P=0.003] were significantly associated with a duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days. These results were independent from other confusion variables. Considering the hospitalization status, psychotic disorders was the only diagnosis which showed an association between duration \u2265\u00a07\u00a0days and forced hospitalization [OR=2.9 CI 95% (1.1-7.8), P=0.03].\nOur study highlighted two profiles of higher risk to remain \u2265\u00a07days in seclusion.

Since the birth of CL psychiatry, a long set of theoretical books and articles has aimed at integrating CL psychiatry into the wider scope of psychosomatic medicine. In the year 2000, a circular issued by the Health Ministry defined the organization of \"CL addiction services\" in France. Official CL addiction teams are named \"\u00c9quipes de Liaison et de Soins en Addictologie\" (ELSAs) which are separated from CL psychiatry units. Though this separation can be questioned, it actually emphasizes that the work provided by CL addiction teams has some very specific features. The daily practice of ELSAs somewhat differs from that of psychiatric CL teams. Addictive behaviors often result from progressive substance misuse. In this respect, the ELSAs' practice frequently involves screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) interventions, which are rather specific of addiction medicine and consist more of prevention interventions than actual addiction treatment. Moreover, for patients with characterized substance use disorders substantial skills in motivational interviewing are required in ELSA consultations. Though motivational interviewing is not specific to addiction medicine, its regular use is uncommon for other liaison teams in France. Furthermore, substance misuse can induce many types of acute or delayed substance-specific medical consequences. These consequences are often poorly known and thus poorly explored by physicians of other specialties. ELSAs have therefore the role of advising their colleagues for a personalized somatic screening among patients with substance misuse. In this respect, the service undertaken by ELSAs is not only based on relational skills but also comprises a somatic expertise. This specificity differs from CL psychiatry. Moreover, several recent studies have shown that in some cases it was useful to extend liaison interventions for addiction into outpatient consultations that are directly integrated in the consultation units of certain specialties (e.g., hepatology, emergency, or oncology). Such a partnership can substantially enhance patients' motivation and addiction outcome. This specificity is also hardly transposable in CL psychiatry. In France, addiction medicine is an inter-specialty that is not fully-integrated into psychiatry. This separation is also applied for CL services which emphasizes real differences in the daily practices and in intervention frameworks. Regardless, CL psychiatry units and ELSAs share many other features and exhibit important overlaps in terms of targeted populations and overall missions. These overlaps are important to conjointly address, with the aim to offer integrated and collaborative services, within the hospital settings of other medical specialties."}, {"Title": "[Methods to improve suicidal adolescents' compliance to care after emergency discharge: A literature review].", "Abstract": "Suicidal adolescents admitted in an Emergency Department (ED) present a high risk of suicidal reattempts. Poor observance of follow-up in this particular group imped the efficacity of the treatment. We propose to summarize the international literature on ED interventions promoting suicidal adolescents' adherence to care.\nWe carried out a comprehensive review of papers listed in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINHAL databases using keywords about adolescence, suicide, and ED. We also manually consulted the main journals specialized in suicidology (Crisis and Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior) and adolescence (Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Journal of Adolescent Health, Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence). We selected the relevant articles describing or evaluating one or more interventions initiated in the ED and designed to promote adolescent adherence to post-emergency care. The results are presented in a narrative review form.\nInterventions are organized in three groups: interventions that take place solely at the ED (problem-solving interventions and educational interventions directed to families) and interventions that take place during and after emergency care (we included in this group the ED-Care program, the FISP program, and the SAFETY program), to which should be added interventions that take place prior to care, in particular specific trainings for medical and paramedical teams. Small samples and barriers in measuring adherence to care make statistical comparisons difficult, yet the interventions that seem most effective are those that target the time both during and after ED discharge, those which are implemented most rapidly after discharge, those which actively include parents, and those which involve an implication of the families about barriers to follow-up.\nOur results show an effectiveness of complete programs on short-term compliance but no conclusion can be drawn on long-term effects. Most comprehensive care programs are based on the principle of adolescent compliance, which remains problematic. Until today, no ideal protocol exists to improve short-term as well as long-term compliance to care among adolescents after a suicide attempt. We have to improve our understanding of facilitators and barriers to follow-up using quantitative as well as qualitative research studies. Although it is well established that parents' involvement in the early stages of care is essential, little is known about the underlying processes. In these situations, qualitative studies could help to better target interventions that lead more particularly to follow up compliance in adolescence."}, {"Title": "Accuracy, Authenticity, Fidelity: Aesthetic Realism, the \"Deficit Model,\" and the Public Understanding of Science.", "Abstract": "Argument \"Deficit model\" designates an outlook on the public understanding and communication of science that emphasizes scientific illiteracy and the need to educate the public. Though criticized, it is still widespread, especially among scientists. Its persistence is due not only to factors ranging from scientists' training to policy design, but also to the continuance of realism as an aesthetic criterion. This article examines the link between realism and the deficit model through discussions of neurology and psychiatry in fiction film, as well as through debates about historical movies and the cinematic adaptation of literature. It shows that different values and criteria tend to dominate the realist stance in different domains: accuracy for movies concerning neurology and psychiatry, authenticity for the historical film, and fidelity for adaptations of literature. Finally, contrary to the deficit model, it argues that the cinema is better characterized by a surplus of meaning than by informational shortcomings."}, {"Title": "Local adaptation in European populations affected the genetics of psychiatric disorders and behavioral traits.", "Abstract": "Recent studies have used genome-wide data to investigate evolutionary mechanisms related to behavioral phenotypes, identifying widespread signals of positive selection.

The study was conducted in 10 out of 30 public centres for psychiatric care in north-eastern Poland.\nGenerally, the patients liked and positively evaluated their psychiatrists. Patient's liking for the doctor was connected with the feeling that the doctor also liked the patient, as well as with perceiving the doctor as competent and willing to meet the patient. The longer the treatment with a particular psychiatrist and the rarer need to consult the doctor, the more positive attitude and evaluation of the doctor patients had. According to the patients, the most significant expectations were associated with both conversation with the doctor and receiving emotional support.\nThe key phase for forming the patient-psychiatrist relationship was the first stage of cooperation in which patients created their attitudes towards the doctor without modifying them at further stages.

Ovid Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for herbal medicines with both pharmacological and clinical evidence of psychotropic activity. This updated review now covers clinical trial evidence for 24 herbal medicines in 11 psychiatric disorders.

Biotypes can provide distinct treatment targets for optimized TMS interventions. We further discuss the utility of computational models in refining TMS personalization and efficiently establishing optimal cortical targets for distinct biotypes. Personalizing cortical stimulation targets, treatment frequencies, and intensities can improve the therapeutic efficacy of TMS and potentially establish noninvasive brain stimulation as a viable treatment for psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on forensic psychiatry: Evidence based assessment and treatment of mentally disordered offenders.", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry in Europe is a specialty primarily concerned with individuals who have either offended or present a risk of doing so, and who also suffer from a psychiatric condition.

We need this enthusiasm for sports and psychiatry for our patients with mental disorders and it is time now for a broadening of the scope. Optimized psychiatric prevention and treatment of athletes and ideal sport-related support for individuals with mental disorders should be our main purpose and goal."}, {"Title": "Self-harm scar revision.", "Abstract": "This report discusses in detail the case of a patient who underwent a scar revision procedure to have her characteristic self-harm scars altered. A detailed insight into the patient's perspective was gained through semistructured interviews conducted at 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively. The interviews found that an equally if not more conspicuous scar that was distinct from those created from self-harm had a pronounced psychological benefit for the patient. This article calls for more active management of the psychological sequelae of self-harm scars, with the need to facilitate access to surgical treatment in certain cases."}, {"Title": "Bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed literature in transgender health (1900 - 2017).", "Abstract": "Transgender community is marginalized and under-researched.

Due to increasing rates of a mood disorder diagnosis, and its accompanying risk of suicide, identification and management in childhood and adolescence is critical. Yet, fully effective and safe treatment options are lacking for child-onset mood disorders. Research investigating relationships between nutrition and psychiatry is a plausible avenue to improve prevention and treatment options. Epidemiological and observational evidence exists to support a protective effect of the Mediterranean diet in mood disorder prevalence and future diagnosis. To date, the majority of research has been conducted in adult populations. Future research is needed to examine if similar dietary relationships exist within a youth mood disorder population. Additionally, increased homogeneity in assessment methods of mood disorder symptoms and dietary patterns is needed; specifically, to determine more collective conclusions via meta-analyses. Results from youth studies could be used to formulate future randomized controlled trials, health promotion programs or clinical interventions, via diet or supplement interventions, for alternative mood disorder treatment or prevention purposes."}, {"Title": "Repetition of verbal fluency task attenuates the hemodynamic activation in the left prefrontal cortex: Enhancing the clinical usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy.", "Abstract": "In applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in clinical psychiatry settings in Japan, a phonemic verbal fluency test (VFT) that includes \"switching\" (the ability to shift efficiently to a new word subcategory) to assess phonemic fluency is employed to capture disease-specific hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this study, to extend the specific features of this test, the VFT was repeated to examine an activation change in NIRS measurements in 20 healthy males. Without task performance change, the hemodynamic activation induced by the VFT was significantly attenuated in the left PFC through repetition of the task. These findings suggest that the left PFC is involved in processing of the VFT. Further, it may be possible to extend the current VFT using this repetition to provide a more sensitive examination of the left PFC, whose dysfunction has been reported in several psychiatric diseases such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Name is a term in clinical terminology].", "Abstract": "The paper addresses cognitive mechanisms of nomination on the examples of using proper nouns in the names of clinical syndromes. The authors explore the names of syndromes in neurology and psychiatry which are underpinned by onomastic metaphors or metonymy. The most frequent sources of the secondary use of proper nouns in clinical terminology are literature, history, mythology, religion and cinematograph. A choice of name for a new syndrome is determined by objective as well as subjective factors. Syndrome names with an onomastic component are based on associative thinking. Designation of the new phenomenon is the result of identification of associations by similarity or adjacency between characteristics of nominated phenomenon and subjects's features that had earlier received the individualizing name in the language and had respective categorical signs. The use of proper nouns in secondary nomination allow updating rich information stored in the world as well as emotions that enrich our perception with contextual meaning, in particular, with the possibility of its clinical use."}, {"Title": "How Argentina is training their mental health residents to face its Silver Tsunami?", "Abstract": "In low- and middle-income countries, there is an increase in the percentage of aging population similar to or greater than that of high-income countries (World Population Ageing 1950-2050, UN, 2001).

The provision of easily accessible, evidence-based, and up-to-date information and resources about crystal methamphetamine for the community is a critical component of an effective public health response.\nThis paper aims to describe the codevelopment process of the Web-based Cracks in the Ice Community Toolkit, which was developed to improve access to evidence-based information and resources about crystal methamphetamine for the Australian community.\nDevelopment of the Cracks in the Ice Community Toolkit was conducted in collaboration with community members across Australia and with experts working in the addiction field. The iterative process involved the following: (1) consultation with end users, including community members, crystal methamphetamine users, families and friends of someone using crystal methamphetamine, health professionals, and teachers (n=451) via a cross-sectional Web-based survey to understand information needs; (2) content and Web development; and (3) user testing of a beta version of the Web-based toolkit among end users (n=41) and experts (n=10) to evaluate the toolkit's acceptability, relevance, and appeal.\nInitial end user consultation indicated that the most commonly endorsed reasons for visiting a website about crystal methamphetamine were \"to get information for myself\" (185/451, 41.0%) and \"to find out how to help a friend or a family member\" (136/451, 30.2%). Community consultation also revealed the need for simple information about crystal methamphetamine, including what it is, its effects, and when and where to seek help or support. Feedback on a beta version of the toolkit was positive in terms of content, readability, layout, look, and feel. Commonly identified areas for improvement related to increasing the level of engagement and personal connection, improving the ease of navigation, and balancing a \"low prevalence of use, yet high impact\" message. A total of 9138 users visited the website in the 3 months immediately post launch, and over 25,000 hard-copy Cracks in the Ice booklets and flyers were distributed across Australia. Of these resources, 60.93% (15,525/25,480) were distributed to relevant organizations and mailing list subscribers, and 39.07% (9955/25,480) were ordered directly by individuals, services, and community groups via the Cracks in the Ice website.\nThe codevelopment process resulted in an engaging Web-based resource for the Australian community to access up-to-date and evidence-based resources about crystal methamphetamine.

Prenatal interventions to ameliorate that risk have yet to be established for clinical use. A systematic review of prenatal nutrients and childhood emotional development and later mental illness was performed. Randomized trials of folic acid, phosphatidylcholine, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements assess effects of doses beyond those adequate to remedy deficiencies to promote normal fetal development despite genetic and environmental risks. Folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example. Vitamins A and D are currently recommended at maximum levels, but women's incomplete compliance permits observational studies of their effects. Folic acid and phosphatidylcholine supplements have shown evidence for improving childhood emotional development associated with later mental illnesses. Vitamins A and D decreased the risk for schizophrenia and autism in retrospective observations. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation during early pregnancy increased the risk for schizophrenia and increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but in later pregnancy it decreased childhood wheezing and premature birth. Studies are complicated by the length of time between birth and the emergence of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, compared with anomalies like facial clefts identified at birth. As part of comprehensive maternal and fetal care, prenatal nutrient interventions should be further considered as uniquely effective first steps in decreasing risk for future psychiatric and other illnesses in newborn children.

Psychiatric disease like depression is a very important comorbidity of COPD because it decreases the feeling of wellbeing in the patient and also interferes with the compliance with medication thereby increasing the risk of hospitalization in the COPD patient. A cross-sectional study was done for two years in the department of pulmonary medicine at Era's Lucknow medical college and hospital, Lucknow. A total of 150 patients were enrolled for the study after a clinico-radiological screening for the diagnosis confirmed on spirometry. After the confirmation of the diagnosis of COPD in these patients, they were screened for depression using the PHQ-9 scale in our department of pulmonary medicine. The confirmation of the diagnosis of depression was done according to the ICD-10 guidelines for depression and the severity of depression was graded using HAM-D scale in the department of psychiatry at our institute. The most common age group enrolled in the study was 51-60 years of age (40.67%). One hundred and fifteen patients (76.7%) of the enrolled patients were smokers while the remaining 35 patients (23.3%) were non-smokers. Depression was found to be present in 46 out of the total 150 patients in the study. Thus, the prevalence of depression in our study was 30.67%. Depression was seen in COPD groups B,C and D. Out of the 46 patients of COPD with depression,18 had mild depression (39.13%), 26 had moderate depression (56.52%) and 2 had severe depression (4.35%).

The consequence of medication nonadherence posttransplant is graft rejection and psychiatric decompensation, highlighting the importance of optimizing adherence to medication regimens. Pharmacists may work with transplant patients with psychiatric comorbidity to improve medication adherence through identifying patient-specific barriers and recommending an appropriate intervention. Multiple evidence-based practices for improving nonadherence have been detailed in the transplant and psychiatric population. Medication adherence aids, medication management, patient education, and motivational interviewing are all strategies that may be used to improve adherence. Selecting which interventions to make will be based on the reasons for a patient's nonadherence. Most patients benefit from medication management, patient education, and medication adherence aids. Selection of medication adherence aids may be based on patient demographics, technology literacy, and preference. Motivational interviewing may be considered in patients with intentional nonadherence relating to a lack of insight into their illness or the importance of taking medication. Pharmacists may promote adherence and potentially improve patient outcomes in transplant recipients with comorbid psychiatric disorders through assisting patients with designing a tailored medication adherence plan."}, {"Title": "Response heterogeneity: Challenges for personalised medicine and big data approaches in psychiatry and chronic pain.", "Abstract": "Response rates to available treatments for psychological and chronic pain disorders are poor, and there is a substantial burden of suffering and disability for patients, who often cycle through several rounds of ineffective treatment. As individuals presenting to the clinic with symptoms of these disorders are likely to be heterogeneous, there is considerable interest in the possibility that different constellations of signs could be used to identify subgroups of patients that might preferentially benefit from particular kinds of treatment. To this end, there has been a recent focus on the application of machine learning methods to attempt to identify sets of predictor variables (demographic, genetic, etc.) that could be used to target individuals towards treatments that are more likely to work for them in the first instance. Importantly, the training of such models generally relies on datasets where groups of individual predictor variables are labelled with a binary outcome category - usually 'responder' or 'non-responder' (to a particular treatment). However, as previously highlighted in other areas of medicine, there is a basic statistical problem in classifying <i>individuals</i> as 'responding' to a particular treatment on the basis of data from conventional randomized controlled trials. Specifically, insufficient information on the partition of variance components in individual symptom changes mean that it is inappropriate to consider data from the active treatment arm alone in this way. This may be particularly problematic in the case of psychiatric and chronic pain symptom data, where both within-subject variability and measurement error are likely to be high. Here, we outline some possible solutions to this problem in terms of dataset design and machine learning methodology, and conclude that it is important to carefully consider the kind of inferences that particular training data are able to afford, especially in arenas where the potential clinical benefit is so large."}, {"Title": "The screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry (SCIP) is associated with disease severity and cognitive complaints in major depression.", "Abstract": "To assess the relationship between the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) score and illness severity, subjective cognition and functioning in a cohort of major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.\nPatients (n\u2009=\u200940) diagnosed with MDD (DSM-IV-TR) completed the SCIP, a brief neuropsychological test, and a battery of self-administered questionnaires evaluating functioning (GAF, SDS, WHODAS 2.0, EDEC, PDQ-D5).

Nor is it clear why rates of involuntary admission often vary between hospitals within the same jurisdiction. We studied all admissions, voluntary and involuntary, in three inpatient psychiatry units in Dublin, Ireland, which cover a population of 552,019 people, over a one-year period (1 July 2014 until 30 June 2015, inclusive), as part of the Dublin Involuntary Admission Study (DIAS). During the study period, there was a total of 1136 admissions to these three units, of which 17% were involuntary for all or part of their admission. The overall admission rate (205.8 admissions per 100,000 population per year) was lower than the national rate (387.9) but this varied substantially across the three units studied. On multi-variable analysis, involuntary admission status was associated with male gender, being unmarried, and a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and was not significantly associated with age, occupation or which inpatient unit the person was admitted to. We conclude that variations in involuntary admission rates between different psychiatry admission units in Dublin are significantly explained by patient-level variables (such as gender, marital status and diagnosis) rather than centre-level variables, but that much of the variation in admission status between patients remains unexplained. Future, multi-level research could usefully focus on other patient-level factors of possible relevance (e.g. symptom severity), centre-level factors (e.g. local mental health service resourcing) and community-level factors (e.g. socio-economic circumstances in different areas) in order to further elucidate unexplained variance in admission status between patients."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic treatment of psychotic disorders in forensic psychiatry: Patients' perception of coercion and its predictors.", "Abstract": "Despite the major encroachment of coercive measures on the fundamental rights of affected forensic psychiatric patients, there is relatively few research done in this field.

The severity of symptoms (PANSS score) and the level of perceived coercion (aAES score) correlated weakly, participants with more severe symptoms perceived more coercion than those with less marked symptoms. A linear regression model showed that to what extent patients felt coerced to take the prescribed antipsychotic medication was mainly influenced by their attitude towards medication and the degree of insight into illness, to a lesser extent by symptom severity (R<sup>2</sup>\u202f=\u202f0.565, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Sociodemographic factors were not related to the extent to which patients felt coerced to take the antipsychotic medication.\nPredictors of the experience of coercion related to the prescribed antipsychotic medication of forensic psychiatric inpatients with schizophrenia and related disorders are not so much sociodemographic or illness-related factors as education or past medical history, but rather potentially influenceable variables such as insight into illness or attitude towards medication."}, {"Title": "Between authoritarian and dialogical approaches: Attitudes and opinions on coercion among professionals in mental health and addiction care in Norway.", "Abstract": "More knowledge is needed on how to reduce the prevalence of formal and informal coercion in Norwegian mental health care. To explore possible reasons for the widespread differences in coercive practice in psychiatry and drug addiction treatment in Norway, and the poor compliance to change initiatives, we performed a nationwide survey. Six vignettes from concrete and realistic clinical situations where coercive measures were among the alternative courses of action, and where the difference between authoritarian (paternalistic) and dialogical (user participation) practices was explicitly delineated, were presented in an electronic questionnaire distributed to five groups of professionals: psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, other professionals and auxiliary treatment staff. Non-coercive dialogical resolutions were more likely than coercive authoritative. However, there is a clear professional hierarchy with regard to authoritarian approaches, with the psychiatrists on top, followed by nurses and other professionals, and with psychologists as the least authoritarian. The majority of the respondents sometimes prefer actions that are illegal, which suggests that individual opinions about coercion often overrule legislation. The variation between and within professional groups in attitudes and opinions on coercion is extensive, and may account for some of the hitherto meagre results of two ministerial action plans for coercion reduction."}, {"Title": "Bee Stings and Chronic Pain Disorder.", "Abstract": "Chronic pain is a major problem of public health, and patients seek manifold forms of help to find relief.

In clinical settings, knowledge of their interests would be helpful for therapy. Therefore, we investigated the interests of Rett syndrome patients. [Subjects and Methods] In 2016, we sent a questionnaire regarding the interests of individuals with Rett syndrome to 1,016 directors of schools for special needs education and 204 directors of rehabilitation departments (130 facilities for persons with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, 73 wards for patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities, and the National Hospital Organization and National Center Hospital, and the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry) in Japan. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis to examine the answers to the questionnaires. [Results] Information was acquired from 216 individuals (3-53\u2005years old) with Rett syndrome. 92.9% of the individuals were reported to have some interests (e.g., in people, music, things to see, animation, or books). [Conclusion] Individuals with Rett syndrome were observed to be interested in various things despite their having severe motor and intellectual disabilities.

We will conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA), integrating direct and indirect comparisons from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to rank psychological treatments for schizophrenia according to their efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.\nWe will include all RCTs comparing a psychological treatment aimed at positive symptoms of schizophrenia with another psychological intervention or with a no treatment condition (waiting-list and treatment as usual). We will include studies on adult patients with schizophrenia, excluding specific subpopulations (eg, first-episode patients or patients with psychiatric comorbidities). Primary outcome will be the change in positive symptoms on a published rating scale. Secondary outcomes will be acceptability (dropout), change in overall and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, response, relapse, adherence, depression, quality of life, functioning and adverse events. Published and unpublished studies will be sought through database searches, trial registries and websites. Study selection and data extraction will be conducted by at least two independent reviewers. We will conduct random-effects NMA to synthesise all evidences for each outcome and obtain a comprehensive ranking of all treatments. NMA will be conducted in Stata and R within a frequentist framework. The risk of bias in studies will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the credibility of the evidence will be evaluated using an adaptation of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to NMA, recommended by the Cochrane guidance.

The cohort was youths with serious emotional and behavioral disorders who were enrolled in CCS from December 2009 through May 2014. The comparison group was youths with serious emotional and behavioral disorders who received outpatient mental health services during the same time. Administrative data from Medicaid, child welfare, and juvenile justice services were used. A difference-in-difference analysis with propensity score matching evaluated the CCS intervention by time effect on psychotropic polypharmacy.\nIn both groups, most youths were male, black, and 10-18 years old, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (54%-55%), mood disorder (39%-42%), depression (26%-27%), and bipolar disorder (25%-26%). About half of each group was taking an antipsychotic. The percentage reduction in polypharmacy from one year before CCS enrollment to one year after discharge was 28% for the CCS group and 29% for the non-CCS group, a nonsignificant difference. CCS youths excluded from the analysis had more complex mental health needs and a greater change in polypharmacy than the CCS youths who were included in the analytic sample.\nMental health care coordination had limited impact in reducing psychotropic polypharmacy for youths with less complex mental health needs.

Two established psychiatrist-to-population ratios were used to determine the estimated demand for psychiatrists and potential shortages.\nThe psychiatrist workforce will contract through 2024 to a projected low of 38,821, which is equal to a shortage of between 14,280 and 31,091 psychiatrists, depending on the psychiatrist-to-population ratio used. A slow expansion will begin in 2025. By 2050, the workforce of psychiatrists will range from a shortage of 17,705 psychiatrists to a surplus of 3,428.\nBecause of steady population growth and the retirement of more than half the current workforce, the psychiatrist workforce will continue to contract through 2024 if no interventions are implemented, leading to a significant shortage of psychiatrists. Despite an expected workforce expansion beginning in 2025, it is unclear whether the shortage will completely resolve by 2050. Future research should focus on developing strategies to address this quantified shortage in an effort to curb the worsening shortage through 2024 and over the coming decades."}, {"Title": "Introducing Specialist Integrated Mental Health Care in Lebanon: The Psychosis Recovery Outreach Program.", "Abstract": "The recognition of mental health needs in developing countries is growing in parallel with increased public awareness of and reduced stigma toward mental illness.

Investigators aimed to increase awareness regarding boundary issues among MS3s and assess the effect of using videotaped scenarios and case-based discussion on medical students' comfort in managing boundary issues.\nA nine-question pre-course survey was administered to MS3s enrolled at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University that asked students to rate their comfort in managing various boundary challenges. MS3s then viewed seven pre-recorded boundary-related cases followed by a 10-15-min discussion after each case. A post-course survey reassessed comfort in managing boundary challenges using the same nine questions, with three additional questions assessing satisfaction with the course. Change in pre- and post-course scores were analyzed using paired t tests and effect sizes. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.\nThere was a significant difference between pre- and post-course total scores as well as seven of the nine individual scores. Effect sizes were large (d >\u2009.08). These findings indicate that students became more comfortable managing boundary issues following the course. In addition, satisfaction ratings were high indicating the course was perceived favorably.\nMedical students perceived the course to be beneficial and reported that it increased their awareness of boundary issues. A boundary course at the beginning of the psychiatry clerkship can improve MS3s' comfort in managing boundary challenges. With increased comfort in managing boundary, students can better focus on other aspects of their psychiatry education and on building therapeutic alliances with their patients."}, {"Title": "Reduced Frequency of Cases with Seclusion Is Associated with \"Opening the Doors\" of a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit.", "Abstract": "Implementing an open door policy is a complex intervention comprising changes in therapeutic stance, team processes, and a change from locked to open doors.

A 50-item readmission survey was used to collect information on demographic and clinical factors associated with 30-day readmission, as well as to identify quality improvement opportunities by assessing related moderating factors. An analysis of acute readmission visits (occurring within 3 days of previous discharge) was also performed.\nPatients readmitted to the ED commonly present with a combination of acute psychiatric symptoms, substance use (especially in the case of acute readmission), and violent or suicidal behavior. The vast majority of cases reviewed found that readmitted patients had difficulties coordinating care outside the ED. A number of moderating factors were identified and targeted for quality improvement including additional support for filling prescriptions, transportation, communication with family and outside providers, drug and alcohol treatment, intensive case management, and housing.\nMany of the resources necessary to reduce psychiatric patient visits to hospital EDs are available within the community. There is no formal method of integrating and insuring the continuity of community services that may reduce the demand for psychiatric and related services in the ED. While agreements between community service providers may be challenging and require considerable vigilance to maintain equitable agreements between parties, this route of improving efficiency may be the only available method, given the current and projected patient care needs."}, {"Title": "Application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in psychiatric clinical evaluation: Controversies and avenues.", "Abstract": "In this study, we have attempted to replicate the findings of altered emotional processing in depressed patients compared with healthy controls by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging during passive viewing of positive, negative, and neutral pictures from the International Affective Pictures System.\nNineteen medicated depressed patients and 19 sex and age-matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during presentation of affective pictures in a block design. The differences between the blood oxygen level dependent signal elicited in the tree conditions were compared. Within-group and between-group analyses were performed with stringent criteria for statistical inference (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 with family-wise error correction).\nIn medicated depressed patients, positive pictures compared with neutral pictures activated predominantly the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, as well as occipital and middle temporal areas mainly on the left side, while in healthy controls, only the occipito-temporal areas demonstrated significant activation. The negative pictures elicited stronger activation of occipital and temporal regions in both groups and of inferior frontal gyrus only in control subjects. The difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. Positive correlation was demonstrated between activation levels of clusters located in left precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex and left inferior/middle occipital gyrus and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores in patients while viewing positive compared with neutral pictures.\nAlthough the within-group analysis demonstrated significant activations in both groups with apparent discrepancies, the between-group analysis did not reach statistical significance under the stringent criteria for statistical inference.

Individuals who consider VSED tend to be older, have a serious but not always imminently terminal illness, place a high value on independence, and have significant illness burden. VSED can theoretically be performed independent of clinician assistance and therefore avoids many of the ethical and legal concerns associated with physician-assisted dying or other palliative measures of last resort, However, VSED is an intense process fraught with new sources of somatic and emotional suffering for individuals and their caregivers, so VSED is best supervised by an experienced, well-informed clinician who can provide appropriate pre-intervention assessment, anticipatory guidance, medical treatment of symptoms, and emotional support. Before initiation of VSED, clinicians should carefully screen for inadequately treated psychiatric conditions, unaddressed symptoms, existential suffering, and evidence of coercion-consultation from palliative medicine, psychiatry, or ethics is often indicated. The most common symptoms encountered after starting VSED are extreme thirst, hunger, dysuria, progressive disability, delirium, and somnolence. Although physiologically similar to cessation of artificial nutrition and hydration, the onset and management of symptoms is often different. We propose an organized system for evaluating individual appropriateness for VSED, anticipatory guidance, and management of symptoms associated with VSED.

We present the results of a set of meta-analyses of human fear extinction studies in healthy participants, conducted with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reporting whole-brain results. Meta-analyses of fear extinction learning primarily implicate consistent activation of brain regions linked to threat appraisal and experience, including the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. An overlapping anatomical result was obtained from the meta-analysis of extinction recall studies, except when studies directly compared an extinguished threat stimulus to an unextinguished threat stimulus (instead of a safety stimulus). In this latter instance, more consistent activation was observed in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions, together with other areas including the hippocampus. While our results partially support the notion of a shared neuroanatomy between human and rodent models of extinction processes, they also encourage an expanded account of the neural basis of human fear extinction."}, {"Title": "The Nature of Nurture: Using a Virtual-Parent Design to Test Parenting Effects on Children's Educational Attainment in Genotyped Families.", "Abstract": "Research on environmental and genetic pathways to complex traits such as educational attainment (EA) is confounded by uncertainty over whether correlations reflect effects of transmitted parental genes, causal family environments, or some, possibly interactive, mixture of both. Thus, an aggregate of thousands of alleles associated with EA (a polygenic risk score; PRS) may tap parental behaviors and home environments promoting EA in the offspring. New methods for unpicking and determining these causal pathways are required. Here, we utilize the fact that parents pass, at random, 50% of their genome to a given offspring to create independent scores for the transmitted alleles (conventional EA PRS) and a parental score based on alleles not transmitted to the offspring (EA VP_PRS). The formal effect of non-transmitted alleles on offspring attainment was tested in 2,333 genotyped twins for whom high-quality measures of EA, assessed at age 17 years, were available, and whose parents were also genotyped. Four key findings were observed. First, the EA PRS and EA VP_PRS were empirically independent, validating the virtual-parent design. Second, in this family-based design, children's own EA PRS significantly predicted their EA (\u03b2 = 0.15), ruling out stratification confounds as a cause of the association of attainment with the EA PRS. Third, parental EA PRS predicted the SES environment parents provided to offspring (\u03b2 = 0.20), and parental SES and offspring EA were significantly associated (\u03b2 = 0.33). This would suggest that the EA PRS is at least as strongly linked to social competence as it is to EA, leading to higher attained SES in parents and, therefore, a higher experienced SES for children. In a full structural equation model taking account of family genetic relatedness across multiple siblings the non-transmitted allele effects were estimated at similar values; but, in this more complex model, confidence intervals included zero. A test using the forthcoming EA3 PRS may clarify this outcome. The virtual-parent method may be applied to clarify causality in other phenotypes where observational evidence suggests parenting may moderate expression of other outcomes, for instance in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A case-control study of sleep disturbances in pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Sleep disturbances, including delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) and disorders of sleep initiation and maintenance (DIMS), have repeatedly been identified in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

It is generally considered as an attractive specimen due to the noninvasive nature of the sampling procedure and the relation to the free fraction of drug in the blood. These features are of particular value in drug treatment of psychiatric disorders. To establish OF for the purpose of monitoring drug therapy, the relationship between concentrations in OF and serum/plasma must be documented. This study explored one promising sampling device and comprised the following 10 drugs: aripiprazole, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, mirtazapine, pipamperone, pregabalin, promethazine, quetiapine, and venlafaxine.\nFor this purpose, 100 paired serum and OF samples were collected from patients undergoing pharmacotherapy and analyzed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. A commercial method from Chromsystems for the determination of these drugs in plasma was used and was adapted for OF and ultrafiltrated (Centrifree device) serum.\nThe ratio of each individual pair of samples was used to calculate a mean and SD value between OF and serum free and total concentrations. The OF concentration ratios to serum total fraction differed markedly between substances and differed from 10-fold lower to 8-fold higher. The ratios to serum free fractions were always higher. The relation between the OF and serum concentrations was also evaluated by regression analysis and determination of slopes and correlation coefficients. For all measured relations, there was a statistically significant relation between the OF and serum concentrations. The degree of drug protein binding was in agreement with literature. The aripiprazole, duloxetine, pipamperone, pregabalin, and promethazine concentrations in ultrafiltrated serum were not possible to measure because of low concentrations and nonspecific binding.\nDespite a strong statistical correlation between OF and serum concentrations observed for most of the studied substances, it is still evident that OF concentrations cannot simply substitute serum/plasma as therapeutic drug monitoring specimen, but rather be considered as a unique specimen. We believe that OF is a promising matrix especially for compliance testing in psychiatry settings.

For a large majority of patients suffering from chronic psychiatric condition, the age of onset of psychiatric symptoms is less than 24 years, while the coverage in psychiatric care is the lowest between 16 and 24. Presenting a psychiatric pathology during childhood and adolescence constitutes an independent risk factor for the occurrence of adverse life events in adulthood. Furthermore, that population is at the edge between child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS). Transition is the deliberate and planned movement from CAMHS to AMHS. CAMHS and AMHS struggle to achieve optimal transitions between them. Many barriers exist at the interface of the two types of structure and some young people who require continuous care during this period do not have access to it. There are also too few specific psychiatric services for the population of adolescents and young adults. Some recommendations emerge to intend to guide practices, but the literature lacks data to better define this population and build guidelines about the transition between CAMHS and AMHS and about specific services for adolescents and young adults in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Can a digital medicine system improve adherence to antipsychotic treatment?", "Abstract": "A substantial proportion of people with mental health conditions do not adhere to prescribed pharmacological treatments.

Case mix correction for patient characteristics was done by a multi-level logistic regression analysis with patient characteristics as predictors and hours seclusion per admission hours as outcome. Seclusion use reduced significantly during the project phase, both in number (-73%) and duration (-80%) and was not substituted by the use of enforced medication. Patient compilation as analyzed by the multi- level regression seemed not to confound the findings. Findings show a slight increase in number and seclusion days over the last year of monitoring. Whether this should be interpreted as a continuous or temporary trend remains unclear and is subject for further investigation."}, {"Title": "Data Science in the Research Domain Criteria Era: Relevance of Machine Learning to the Study of Stress Pathology, Recovery, and Resilience.", "Abstract": "Diverse environmental and biological systems interact to influence individual differences in response to environmental stress. Understanding the nature of these complex relationships can enhance the development of methods to: (1) identify risk, (2) classify individuals as healthy or ill, (3) understand mechanisms of change, and (4) develop effective treatments. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative provides a theoretical framework to understand health and illness as the product of multiple inter-related systems but does not provide a framework to characterize or statistically evaluate such complex relationships. Characterizing and statistically evaluating models that integrate multiple levels (e.g. synapses, genes, environmental factors) as they relate to outcomes that a free from prior diagnostic benchmarks represents a challenge requiring new computational tools that are capable to capture complex relationships and identify clinically relevant populations.

Consequently, widespread alterations in neural structure and developmental and maturational trajectory would be expected. To date, there have been few quantitative and systematic studies of brain morphology in PWS, although alterations of volume and of cortical organisation have been reported. This study aimed to investigate, in detail, the structure of grey matter and cortex in the brain in a sample of young adults with PWS in a well-matched case-controlled analysis. 20 young adults with PWS, aged 19-27\u00a0years, underwent multiparameter mapping magnetic resonance imaging sequences, from which measures of grey matter volume, cortical thickness and magnetisation transfer saturation, as a proxy measure of myelination, were examined. These variables were investigated in comparison to a control group of 40 typically developing young adults, matched for age and sex. A voxel-based morphometry analysis identified large and widespread bilateral clusters of both increased and decreased grey matter volume in the brain in PWS. In particular, widespread areas of increased volume encompassed parts of the prefrontal cortex, especially medially, the majority of the cingulate cortices, from anterior to posterior aspects, insula cortices, and areas of the parietal and temporal cortices. Increased volume was also reported in the caudate, putamen and thalamus. The most ventromedial prefrontal areas, in contrast, showed reduced volume, as did the parts of the medial temporal lobe, bilateral temporal poles, and a small cluster in the right lateral prefrontal cortex. Analysis of cortical structure revealed that areas of increased volume in the PWS group were largely driven by greater cortical thickness. Conversely, analysis of myelin content using magnetisation transfer saturation indicated that myelination of the cortex was broadly similar in the PWS and control groups, with the exception of highly localised areas, including the insula. The bilateral nature of these abnormalities suggests a systemic biological cause, with possible developmental and maturational mechanisms discussed, and may offer insight into the contribution of imprinted genes to neural development."}, {"Title": "Central Institute of Psychiatry: A fictional journey to past in a time machine.", "Abstract": "A fictional journey was planned and carried out in a time machine, to know and understand the glorious past of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi.

To optimize care for these residents, it is important to study their care needs, since unmet needs lower quality of life. To date, knowledge about care needs of residents with mental-physical multimorbidity is limited. The aim of this study was to explore (un)met care needs of residents with mental-physical multimorbidity and determinants of unmet needs.\nCross-sectional cohort study among 141 residents with mental-physical multimorbidity without dementia living in 17 geronto-psychiatric nursing home units across the Netherlands. Data collection consisted of chart review, semi-structured interviews, (brief) neuropsychological testing, and self-report questionnaires. The Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) was used to rate (un)met care needs from residents' and nursing staff's perceptions. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were conducted.\nResidents reported a mean number of 11.89 needs (SD 2.88) of which 24.2% (n\u202f=\u202f2.88, SD 2.48) were unmet. Nursing staff indicated a mean number of 14.73 needs (SD 2.32) of which 10.8% (n\u202f=\u202f1.59, SD 1.61) were unmet. According to the residents, most unmet needs were found in the social domain as opposed to the psychological domain as reported by the nursing staff. Different opinions between resident and nursing staff about unmet needs was most common in the areas accommodation, company, and daytime activities. Further, nearly half of the residents indicated 'no need' regarding behavior while the nursing staff supposed that the resident did require some kind of support. Depression, anxiety and less care dependency were the most important determinants of unmet needs.\nSystematic assessment of care needs showed differences between the perspectives of resident and nursing staff. These should be the starting point of a dialogue between them about needs, wishes and expectations regarding care. This dialogue can subsequently lead to the most optimal individually tailored care plan.

The hypotheses in this paper have been deduced from the latest scientific research findings and clinical observations of patients with genetic disorders, behavioral phenotypes and other family members suffering mental disorders. The first hypothesis postulates that catatonia and the heterogeneity of catatonic signs and symptoms involve nucleolar dysfunction arising from abnormalities of the brain-specific, non-coding micro-RNA, SNORD115 genes (either duplications or deletions) which result in pathobiological dysfunction of various combinations in the downstream pathways (possibly along with other genes in these shared pathways). SNORD115 controls five genes CRHR1, PBRM1, TAF1, DPM2, and RALGPS1 as well as the alternative splicing of serotonin 2C receptor. SNORD115 abnormalities with varying downstream multigene involvement would account for catatonia across the life span within some subtypes of autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder, psychosis, genetic disorders, and in immune disorders such as anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibody encephalitis as well as the susceptibility to the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) if environmentally triggered. Furthermore, SNORD115 genes may underlie a genetic vulnerability when environmental triggers result in excess serotonin producing the serotonin syndrome, a condition similar to NMS in which catatonia may occur. Dysfunction of SNORD115-PBRM1 connecting with SMARCA2 as well as other proven schizophrenia-associated genes might explain why traditionally catatonia has been classified with schizophrenia. SNORD115-TAF1 and SNORD-DPM2 dysfunction introduce possible clues to the parkinsonism and increased creatinine phosphokinase in NMS, while abnormalities of SNORD115-RALGPS1 suggest links to both anti-NMDAR encephalitis and the proven predisposing catatonic SHANK3 gene. The second hypothesis postulates that periodic catatonia (PC) on 15q15 involves abnormalities of vacuolar protein sorting 39 (VPS39), a proven de novo schizophrenic gene in this chromosomal locus and part of the HOPS complex. These will impact the autophagic and endocytic pathways, thereby lowering lysosomal degradation. VPS39 mutations may be considered also to disrupt lysosome-mitochondria tethering and transport of lipids and calcium through membrane contact sites (MCSs). To account for the periodicity in PC it is speculated that the mammalian equivalent of the vacuole and mitochondria patch (vCLAMP) would be altered by VPS39 mutations and subsequently followed by the mammalian equivalent of endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) restoring mitochondrial homeostasis. Future precision psychiatry will require accurate pathophysiologically-defined psychiatric diagnoses to accelerate the discovery of specific molecular-targeted medications to improve therapeutic outcomes."}, {"Title": "Positive predictive value of medical student specialty choices.", "Abstract": "Although medical school programs oriented toward postgraduate specialty training have the potential to reduce the duration and cost of medical school for US medical students, success depends on the ability of students to predict their postgraduate specialties. It is clear that first-year choices are poorly predictive, but it is not known when predictions become sufficiently reliable to support specialty-oriented learning programs. We therefore examined the predictive value of specialty preferences expressed at the ends of the first, second and third years of medical school and asked whether concurrent expressions of confidence in choices improved predictive ability. We also investigated the possibility that discrepancies between predicted and actual postgraduate specialty training were related to scores on an examination of knowledge in basic biomedical sciences required for US medical school graduation (the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USLME) Step 1 examination).\nWe calculated positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) for specialty choices and the sensitivity and specificity of asking for choices for 634 University of Colorado School of Medicine students who trained in 23 accredited residencies from 2011 through 2015. We examined the effect of confidence in first choices in 609 students, and in 334 students, sought an association between USMLE Step 1 scores and switching from postgraduate training specialties predicted at the end of year 2.\nThe PPV of first choices improved from years 1 through 3. NPV was high throughout. PPVs of year 3 first choices ranged from 79% in Anesthesiology to 95% in Psychiatry. Expressions of confidence in first choices did not improve PPV. Sensitivity of asking for first choices increased with time; specificity was consistently high. USLME Step 1 scores were higher for students who ultimately trained in specialties more competitive than first-choice specialties at the end of year 2.\nSpecialty-oriented learning programs during medical school must accommodate students who change career plans.

This behavioral switch paralleled neurotransmitter switching from dopamine to somatostatin in hypothalamic neurons (receiving direct input from the photoperiod-processing center, the suprachiasmatic nucleus). Mice with reduced DAT expression exhibited hypersensitivity to these summer-like and winter-like photoperiods, including more extreme mania-relevant (including reward sensitivity during reinforcement learning), and depression-relevant (including punishment-sensitivity and loss-sensitivity during reinforcement learning) behaviors. DAT mRNA levels switched in wildtype littermate mice across photoperiods, an effect not replicated in DAT hypomorphic mice. This inability to adjust DAT levels to match photoperiod-induced neurotransmitter switching as a homeostatic control likely contributes to the susceptibility of DAT hypormophic mice to these switching photoperiods. These data reveal the potential contribution of photoperiod-induced neuroplasticity within an identified circuit of the hypothalamus, linked with reduced DAT function, underlying switching between states in BD. Further investigations of the circuit will likely identify novel therapeutic targets to block switching between states."}, {"Title": "Thiol/disulphide homeostasis in schizophrenia patients with positive symptoms.", "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate the dynamic thiol/disulphincide homeostasis in patients with schizophrenia who have positive psychotic indications.\nForty-four patients (26 males, 18 females; mean age\u2009=\u200934.40\u2009\u00b1\u20098.98\u00a0years) accepted at the Department of Psychiatry of the Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital and 33 healthy controls (15 males, 18 females; mean age of 30.30\u2009\u00b1\u20098.48\u00a0years) were included in the study. Serum native thiol and total thiol were measured with a novel colorimetric, automated method. The disulfide levels and disulfide/native thiol ratios were also calculated from these measured parameters.\nSerum native thiol and the total thiol concentration were significantly lower in schizophrenia compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Disulphide levels and disulfide/native thiol ratios were significantly higher in schizophrenia compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u2009.05). When the patients were divided into two groups according to those who used medication and those who did not for the last two months, it was found to be significantly higher in those who used disulfide and disulfide/native thiol medication than those who did not use medication.\nThe disulfide/native thiol ratio in patients with schizophrenia who have been using medication for the last 2\u00a0months has been found to be significantly higher than controls who have not been using medication, may be indicating that the level of native thiol does not increase in a correlation as high as the increase in disulfide levels. It demonstrates that thiol/disulfide equilibrium has shifted towards the disulfide. The excess disulfide amounts might associated with both disease itself and the using medication."}, {"Title": "Sleep-endocrine effects of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Changes in sleep-EEG after endocrine stimulation tests in patients with schizophrenia include reduced sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep latency and increased awaking after sleep onset Findings on sleep associated growth hormone (GH) secretion were ambiguous. The aim of this study was to elucidate the sleep-endocrine activity especially in the GH system of patients with schizophrenia after repeated administration of GHRH. The effect of repetitive injections of 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f\u03bcg GHRH between 22.00 and 01.00\u202fh on sleep endocrine parameters was investigated in 9 patients diagnosed for schizophrenia. Patients did not receive any medication for one week. Concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, prolactin and GH were determined. Patients spent three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. Blood was taken every 20min. Results were compared with matched healthy controls. A non-significant prolonged sleep onset latency and increased time awake was found in patients compared to controls. Sleep stage 2 was significantly reduced in patients. No significant difference in ACTH and cortisol was detected, whereas the GH secretion in patients following GHRH stimulation was significantly elevated compared to controls. Our results in drug free patients confirm already known changes in sleep-EEG in these patients. The GH response to GHRH-stimulation indicates a different regulatory sensitivity of the system between daytime and night-time."}, {"Title": "PET radioligands for the dopamine D1-receptor: Application in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) system is considered to be centrally involved in the pathophysiology of several major psychiatric disorders. Using positron emission tomography (PET), aberrations in dopamine D2/D3-receptors (D2-R) levels and uptake of the DA precursor FDOPA have been shown for schizophrenia, substance abuse and depression. Radioligands for the dopamine D1-receptor (D1-R) have been available for more than three decades, however this receptor subtype has received much less attention in psychiatry research. Here, studies investigating D1-R in psychiatric patients in comparison to healthy control subjects are summarized. Although small sample sizes, medication effects and heterogeneous methods of quantification limit the conclusions that can be drawn, the data is suggestive of higher levels of cortical D1-R in drug na\u00efve patients with psychosis, and lower D1-R in patients with affective disorders. Data sharing and reanalysis using harmonized methodology are important next steps towards clarifying the role of D1-R in these disorders."}, {"Title": "[Prescriptions in child psychiatry, on the use of antipsychotic drugs for children and Adolescents].", "Abstract": "In line with Evidence-based medicine and more recently with the emergence of Evidence-based practice in psychology, what are the current trends in medical prescriptions in child psychiatry?

Often, these in- or outpatients have low treatment motivation, suffer from multiple disorders, and have poor literacy skills. eHealth may be able to improve treatment outcomes because of its potential to increase motivation and engagement, and it can overcome the predominant one-size-fits-all approach by being tailored to individual patients.\nTo examine its potential, this systematic review studies the way that eHealth has been used and studied in forensic mental health and identifies accompanying advantages and disadvantages for both patients and treatment, including effectiveness.\nA systematic search in Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was performed up until December 2017. Studies were included if they focused on technological interventions to improve the treatment of forensic psychiatric patients.\nThe search resulted in 50 studies in which eHealth was used for treatment purposes. Multiple types of studies and technologies were identified, such as virtual reality, web-based interventions, and videoconferencing. The results confirmed the benefits of technology, for example, the acquisition of unique information about offenders, effectiveness, and tailoring to specific characteristics, but indicated that these are not fully taken advantage of.\nTo overcome the barriers and obtain the benefits, eHealth has to have a good fit with patients and the forensic psychiatric context. It has to be seamlessly integrated in existing care and should not be added as an isolated element. To bridge the gap between the current situation and eHealth's potential, further research on development, implementation, and evaluation should be conducted."}, {"Title": "Disturbed Experience of Time in Depression-Evidence from Content Analysis.", "Abstract": "Disturbances in the experience of time have been a commonly reported feature of depressive disorders since the beginning of modern psychiatry and psychological research. However, qualitative research approaches to investigate the phenomenon are rarely used. We employed content analysis to investigate disturbances of time experience in Major Depressive Disorder. Our analysis from 25 participants showed that individuals with Major Depressive Disorder subjectively seem to have lost the ability to influence or change the present, resulting in an impersonal and blocked future. The present is rendered meaningless, the past unchangeably negative, and the passage of time turned into a dragging, inexorable, and viscous continuance. The overall,-possibly intersubjective-concept of time experience, remains largely intact, causing or adding to depressive mood and suffering. We elaborate on how these findings reflect previous theories on the experience of time in depression. This study might encourage future inquiries into both the phenomenal and neuroscientific foundation of time experience under psychopathological conditions."}, {"Title": "Scope, Breadth, and Differences in Online Physician Ratings Related to Geography, Specialty, and Year: Observational Retrospective Study.", "Abstract": "Physician ratings websites have emerged as a novel forum for consumers to comment on their health care experiences. Little is known about such ratings in Canada.\nWe investigated the scope and trends for specialty, geographic region, and time for online physician ratings in Canada using a national data source from the country's leading physician-rating website.\nThis observational retrospective study used online ratings data from Canadian physicians (January 2005-September 2013; N=640,603). For specialty, province, and year of rating, we assessed whether physicians were likely to be rated favorably by using the proportion of ratings greater than the overall median rating.\nIn total, 57,412 unique physicians had 640,603 individual ratings. Overall, ratings were positive (mean 3.9, SD 1.3). On average, each physician had 11.2 (SD 10.1) ratings. By comparing specialties with Canadian Institute of Health Information physician population numbers over our study period, we inferred that certain specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, family practice, surgery, and dermatology) were more commonly rated, whereas others (pathology, radiology, genetics, and anesthesia) were less represented. Ratings varied by specialty; cardiac surgery, nephrology, genetics, and radiology were more likely to be rated in the top 50th percentile, whereas addiction medicine, dermatology, neurology, and psychiatry were more often rated in the lower 50th percentile of ratings. Regarding geographic practice location, ratings were more likely to be favorable for physicians practicing in eastern provinces compared with western and central Canada. Regarding year, the absolute number of ratings peaked in 2007 before stabilizing and decreasing by 2013. Moreover, ratings were most likely to be positive in 2007 and again in 2013.\nPhysician-rating websites are a relatively novel source of provider-level patient satisfaction and are a valuable source of the patient experience.

Office-based opioid treatment with buprenorphine (OBOT) is effective but often underutilized because of physicians' lack of experience prescribing this therapy. Little is known about US residency training programs' provision of OBOT and addiction medicine training.\nThe authors conducted a survey of residency program directors (RPDs) at all US residency programs in internal medicine, family medicine, and psychiatry to assess the frequency with which their residents provide care for OUD, presence and features of curricula in OBOT and addiction medicine, RPDs' beliefs about OBOT, and potential barriers to providing OBOT training.\nThe response rate was 49.5% (476 of 962). Although 76.9% of RPDs reported that residents frequently manage patients with OUD, only 23.5% reported that their program dedicates 12 or more hours of curricular time to addiction medicine, 35.9% reported that their program encourages/requires training in OBOT, and 22.6% reported that their program encourages/requires obtaining a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. Most RPDs believe that OBOT is an important treatment option for OUD (88.1%) and that increased residency training in OBOT would improve access to OBOT (73.7%). The authors also found that programs whose RPD had favorable views of OBOT were more likely to provide OBOT and addiction medicine training. Psychiatry programs were most likely to provide OBOT training and their RPDs most likely to have beliefs about OBOT that were positive. Commonly cited barriers to implementing OBOT training include a lack of waivered preceptors (76.9%), competing curricular priorities (64.1%), and a lack of support (social work and counseling) services (54.0%).\nInternal medicine, family medicine, and psychiatry residents often care for patients with OUD, and most RPDs believe that increased residency training in OBOT would increase access to this treatment.

In multivariate analysis, patients who had attended or completed college had much greater odds of accessing the Internet on mobile phones. Older patients were much less likely to access the Internet or use Twitter.\nOur findings indicate that use of several popular forms of media is not uncommon in a community psychiatry population, but that rates of use differ on the basis of age and education.

The current investigation sought to describe and directly compare the features of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for HD across four distinct cultural settings. Participants were 82 individuals meeting DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for HD, recruited and assessed by trained clinicians at one of four project sites: London, Barcelona, Fukuoka, and Rio de Janeiro. A series of semi-structured interviews and self-report scales were administered, including assessments of socio-demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, and severity of hoarding and related features. Results indicate that the severity and core features of HD, as well as the cognitions and behaviors commonly associated with this condition, are largely stable across cultures. However, some differences in patient demographics-in particular age, marital status, and clinical expression-as well as comorbid psychiatric features also emerged. These findings confirm that HD, as defined in DSM-5, exists and presents with similar phenomenology across the studied cultures. Future, more fine-grained, research will be needed to study the features of the disorder in additional cultures (e.g., non-industrialized nations) and to evaluate the impact of these cultural aspects on the design of interventions for the disorder."}, {"Title": "Plagiarised letters of recommendation submitted for the National Resident Matching Program.", "Abstract": "Residency is a critical step in the professional development of physicians. Given the high stakes of the process, it is not surprising, although nonetheless troubling, that professional misconduct may occur: multiple studies have, rightfully, condemned applicants for plagiarising personal statements or misrepresenting publications.

The software identified pairs of letters written by different authors with at least 75 words of shared language, counting only words present in contiguous phrases of at least eight words (Shared Wording Across People, SWAP). Independent reviewers determined whether the shared language reflected acceptable forms of common usage (e.g. describing a setting of care) or was intended to convey unique attributes of an applicant, thereby representing plagiarism.\nWe found that 5.1% of letters contained SWAP and 4.1% of letters contained plagiarism. In total, 11.8% of all applications included at least one plagiarised letter. By comparison, 2.6% of applicants' personal statements contained plagiarism.\nThe present data demonstrate a surprising prevalence of plagiarism in letters of recommendation written for residency applicants.

It focuses on how clinicians, staff, and management understand and utilize the concepts of culture, race, and ethnicity in their daily work, finding that a humanistic approach to care that that treats patients as \"individuals\" was dominant. Clinicians and staff categorized patients using descriptive, behavior based categories including language, propensity for violence, and whether patients are \"from the streets.\" They also used additional forms of difference such as the patient's pathway to care, their illness category or severity, and whether they use drugs. These forms of difference were shaped by the urgent needs of daily work. These local practices of categorization directly affected the quality of care when staff members assigned cultural characteristics to group members and treated them differently as a result. These findings suggest that anthropologists and clinicians should focus on the way new forms of cultural difference are constructed in small social settings in order to provide equitable treatment to all patients."}, {"Title": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.", "Abstract": "The objective was to evaluate efficacy/safety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) based on randomized controlled trials in adults.\nData sources.

Long-acting injections, for example, administered every month, could improve patient adherence and treatment outcomes. We review the state of the science for potential long-acting formulations of existing tuberculosis drugs, and propose a target product profile for new formulations to treat latent tuberculous infection (LTBI). The physicochemical properties of some anti-tuberculosis drugs make them unsuitable for long-acting formulation, but there are promising candidates that have been identified through modeling and simulation, as well as other novel agents and formulations in preclinical testing. An efficacious long-acting treatment for LTBI, particularly for those co-infected with HIV, and if coupled with a biomarker to target those at highest risk for disease progression, would be an important tool to accelerate progress towards TB elimination."}, {"Title": "Forty years of the Law 180: the aspirations of a great reform, its successes and continuing need.", "Abstract": "Italy pioneered deinstitutionalisation over the past 60 years and enforced a famous mental health (MH) reform law in 1978. Deinstitutionalisation has been completed with the very closure of all psychiatric hospitals over two decades.\nAfter 40 years of implementation, this article presents the main achievements and challenges of the Italian MH reform law, including its long-term effect and impact in Italy and abroad.\nThe Legislation of 1978 was based on the discovery of rights as a key tool in mental healthcare. At the climax of crisis of psychiatric hospitals as total institutions in this country, through the new community-based system of care, it has fostered the lowest rate of involuntary care and gave back the full citizenship to people with MH disorders. This act was also part of a social movement for expanding civil and social rights, and a promise of a true paradigm shift not only in psychiatry, but also in the way of providing an adequate welfare community for all citizens. According to the WHO, the Italian city of Trieste, together with its region, is a practical example of how the Italian movement achieved deinstitutionalisation, intended as a complex process resulting in the gradual relocation of the economic and human resources and subsequent creation of 24 h services together with the development of social inclusion programmes.\nEven if the great principles of the Italian reform law were anticipatory (e.g., the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities - CRPD), the law application has been poorly provided with resources and did not follow those avant-garde experiences as models. Limitations are evident today especially at the organisational levels, such as services capable to take up the challenge and transforming the field, left free from the imprint of total institutions. These endemic critical aspects concerning to implementation policies, together with the financial crisis of the Italian healthcare system, must be taken into consideration for a re-launch of this historical law. The rights-based approach opened by the Law 180 should now take into consideration the new legal situation caused by the CRPD worldwide in the area of individuals' human rights, especially about the issue of legal capacity and related involuntary care."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of stakeholders in psychiatry towards the inclusion of children in genomic research.", "Abstract": "Genomic sequencing of children in research raises complex ethical issues. This study aims to gain more knowledge on the attitudes towards the inclusion of children as research subjects in genomic research and towards the disclosure of pertinent and incidental findings to the parents and the child.\nQualitative data were collected from interviews with a wide range of informants: experts engaged in genomic research, clinical geneticists, persons with mental disorders, relatives, and blood donors. Quantitative data were collected from a cross-sectional web-based survey among 1227 parents and 1406 non-parents who were potential stakeholders in psychiatric genomic research.\nParticipants generally expressed positive views on children's participation in genomic research. The informants in the qualitative interviews highlighted the age of the child as a critical aspect when disclosing genetic information. Other important aspects were the child's right to an autonomous choice, the emotional burden of knowing imposed on both the child and the parents, and the possibility of receiving beneficial clinical information regarding the future health of the child. Nevertheless, there was no consensus whether the parent or the child should receive the findings. A majority of survey stakeholders agreed that children should be able to participate in genomic research. The majority agreed that both pertinent and incidental findings should be returned to the parents and to the child when of legal age. Having children does not affect the stakeholder's attitudes towards the inclusion of children as research subjects in genomic research.\nOur findings illustrate that both the child's right to autonomy and the parents' interest to be informed are important factors that are found valuable by the participants. In future guidelines governing children as subjects in genomic research, it would thus be essential to incorporate the child's right to an open future, including the right to receive information on adult-onset genetic disorders."}, {"Title": "Validation of Adolescent Suicide Assessment Protocol-20 (ASAP-20) to Sri Lankan adolescents.", "Abstract": "Youth suicide rates are rising worldwide, including Sri Lanka, where 46.5/100,000 among 15-19yrs was reported in 1986.

Certain self-harm methods might indicate a higher risk of suicide. The main aim of this study was to determine whether some methods of self-harm in adolescents (10-17\u00a0years) and young adults (18-24\u00a0years) are associated with a particularly high risk of suicide. A secondary aim was to ascertain how different self-harm methods might affect the probability of psychiatric follow-up.\nFive Swedish registers were linked in a national population-based cohort study. All nonfatal self-harm events recorded in specialist health care, excluding psychiatry and primary care services, among 10-24\u00a0year olds between 2000 and 2009 were included. Methods were classified as poisoning, cutting/piercing, violent method (gassing, hanging, strangulation/suffocation, drowning, jumping and firearms), other and multiple methods. Hazard Ratios (HR) for suicide were calculated in Cox regression models for each method with poisoning as the reference. Odds Ratios (OR) for psychiatric inpatient care were determined in logistic regression models. Analyses were adjusted for important covariates and stratified by age group and treatment setting (inpatient/outpatient).\nAmong adolescents with initial medical hospitalisation, use of a violent method was associated with a near eightfold increase in HR for suicide compared to self-poisoning in the adjusted analysis [HR 7.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2-19.0]. Among hospitalised young adult women, adjusted HRs were elevated fourfold for both cutting [4.0 (1.9-8.8)] and violent methods [3.9 (1.5-10.6)]. Method of self-harm did not affect suicide risk in young adult men. Adolescents using violent methods had an increased probability of psychiatric inpatient care following initial treatment for self-harm.\nViolent self-harm requiring medical hospitalisation may signal particularly high risk of future suicide in adolescents (both sexes) and in young adult women. For the latter group this is the case for cutting requiring hospitalisation as well."}, {"Title": "Greater prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in deployed Canadian Armed Forces personnel at risk for moral injury.", "Abstract": "A link between moral injury (i.e., the psychological distress caused by perceived moral transgressions) and adverse mental health outcomes (AMHO) has been recently proposed.

A series of logistic regressions were conducted, controlling for relevant sociodemographic, military, deployment, and trauma-related variables.\nOver half of the deployed personnel endorsed at least one PMIE. Several demographic and military variables were associated with exposure to PMIEs. Those exposed to PMIEs demonstrated a greater likelihood of having past-year PTSD and MDD; feeling responsible for the death of Canadian or ally personnel demonstrated the strongest association with PTSD and MDD. Mental health training was not a moderator for PMIE exposure and AMHO.\nExposure to PMIEs during deployments is common and represents an independent risk factor for past-year PTSD and MDD.

Advancements in how pain is understood, especially centralized pain, have helped inform both pharmacological and behavioral interventions for pain.

Drug discovery for disorders of the central nervous system is a long and challenging process, with a high attrition rate from the preclinical stages through to marketing a compound. Developing drugs for geriatric neuropsychiatric conditions presents additional challenges, due to the complexity of the symptoms, comorbid diagnoses, and the variability of the population. Despite there being limited success over the past two decades, a number of new approaches have identified potential targets for preclinical development and ultimately clinical testing.\nRecent approaches have tried to address specific mechanisms that relate to the disease progression. These approaches include combining a number of ligands into to multi-target compounds, or targeting specific types of cells such as protein kinases or myeloid cells. In addition, the increased use of induced pluripotent stem cell cultures has enabled new compounds to be tested on disease-specific tissues, increasing the success rate of the lead compounds going through the preclinical stages. New pharmacological agents designed with advanced screening techniques and the shift towards systems pharmacology is changing the landscape of drug discovery in geriatric psychiatry. There is potential for these new agents to produce targeted effects in the framework of disorders that have long been untreatable."}, {"Title": "Skepticism and pharmacophobia toward medication may negatively impact adherence to psychiatric medications: a comparison among outpatient samples recruited in Spain, Argentina, and Venezuela.", "Abstract": "Cultural differences in attitudes toward psychiatric medications influence medication adherence but transcultural studies are missing.

Patients completed the Drug Attitude Inventory - 10 Item (DAI-10), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire - Specific Scale (BMQ-Specific), the Sidorkiewicz adherence tool, and sociodemographic and clinical questionnaires. The study included 1,291 adult psychiatric outpatients using 2,308 psychotropic drugs from three Spanish-speaking countries, the Canary Islands (Spain) (N=588 patients), Argentina (N=508), and Venezuela (N=195).\nThe univariate analyses showed different mean scores on the DAI-10 and the BMQ - Necessity and Concerns subscales but, on the other hand, the percentages of non-adherent and skeptical patients were relatively similar in three countries. Argentinian patients had a very low level of pharmacophobia. Multivariate analyses (logistic regression and chi-squared automatic interaction detector segmentation) showed that pharmacophobia in general and skepticism about specific medications (high concern about adverse reactions and low belief in their necessity) were associated with non-adherence. Pharmacophobia was the major factor associated with non-adherence (Spain and Venezuela) but when pharmacophobia was rare (Argentina), skepticism was the most important variable associated with non-adherence.\nPsychiatric patients' attitudes and beliefs about their psychiatric treatment varied in these three Spanish-speaking countries, but pharmacophobia and skepticism appeared to play a consistent role in lack of adherence."}, {"Title": "Electronic Screen Media Use in Youth With Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "Electronic and social media play a prominent role in the lives of children and teenagers.

Our aim was to study whether social cognition discriminates bvFTD from other neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders in patients presenting with late-onset frontal symptoms. Next, we studied the association of social cognition with frontal symptoms and cognitive functioning.\nIn this longitudinal multicenter study, besides clinical rating scales for frontal symptoms, social cognition was determined by Ekman 60 Faces test and Faux Pas in addition to neuropsychological tests for other cognitive domains in patients with probable and definite bvFTD (N\u2009=\u200922), other neurodegenerative diseases (N\u2009=\u200924), and psychiatric disorders (N\u2009=\u200933).

Papers were included in the review if: (a) they were published in an English, Spanish or French-language peer-reviewed journal, (b) the study enrolled patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder, (c) the patients used a therapeutic video game or therapeutic virtual reality device.\nEighteen publications were included. The devices studied are mainly therapeutic software developed specifically for therapeutic care. They can be classified according to their therapeutic objectives. These targets corresponded to objectives of psychosocial rehabilitation: improvement of residual symptomatology, cognitive remediation, remediation of cognition and social skills, improvement of everyday life activities, support for occupational integration. Very different devices were proposed. Some researchers analysed programs developed specifically for patients with schizophrenia, while others were interested in the impact of commercial games. Most of the studies were recent, preliminary and European. The impact of these devices was globally positive, particularly concerning cognitive functions.\nComputer-assisted therapy, video games and virtual reality cannot replace usual care but could be used as adjunctive therapy. However, recommending their use seems premature because of the recent and preliminary character of most studies. Moreover, a link is still lacking between this field of research in psychiatry and other fields of research, particularly game studies. Finally, it might be interesting to analyse more precisely the neuropsychological impact of existing commercial games which could potentially be useful for psychosocial rehabilitation."}, {"Title": "The development of an outcome measure for liaison mental health services.", "Abstract": "Aims and methodTo develop and pilot a clinician-rated outcome scale to evaluate symptomatic outcomes in liaison psychiatry services.

However, the studies published to date have focused on subclinical subjects and psychiatric patients, rather than brain-damaged patients. Here, we used the French version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire to assess schizotypal traits in a sample of 97 patients having undergone surgical resection of a diffuse low-grade glioma. Patients having received other neurooncological treatments (including chemotherapy and radiotherapy) were not included. A combination of ROI-based based voxel-wise and tract-wise lesion-symptom mapping and a disconnectome analysis were performed, in order to identify the putative neural network associated with schizotypy. The ROI-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed a significant relationship between the cognitive-perceptual (positive) dimension of schizotypy and the left inferior gyrus (including the pars opercularis and the pars orbitalis). Importantly, we found that disconnection of the left uncinate fasciculus (UF) was a powerful predictor of the positive dimension of schizotypy. Lastly, the disconnection analysis indicated that the positive dimension of schizotypy was significantly associated with the white matter fibres deep in the left orbital and inferior frontal gyri and the left superior temporal pole, which mainly correspond to the spatial topography of the left UF. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that dysconnectivity of the neural network supplied by the left UF is associated with heightened positive schizotypal traits.

This article will examine the role and weight of severe persistent mental illness in the withdrawal of life support after attempted suicide.\nA 30-year-old gentleman with deafness and schizophrenia was admitted with multiple self-inflicted visceral stab wounds. He developed postoperative complications necessitating ongoing critical care. The parties involved were as follows: the patient, his parents, the critical care trauma service, the palliative and psychiatry consult services, and the ethics committee. Over the patient's hospital course, his parents struggled to reconcile his poor preinjury quality of life with his ongoing need for intensive medical intervention. The primary and consulting teams were required to integrate differing perspectives on the patient's past responsiveness to treatment and the extent to which additional efforts might advance his quality of life and limit his future suffering and suicidality.

Ultimately, the study of psychiatric and neurologic disorders is the study of brain disease, and accordingly, there is no substitution for human brain tissue."}, {"Title": "Pharmacological prophylaxis of postpartum exacerbation in depressive and anxiety symptoms: a retrospective study.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with antidepressants for the prevention of postpartum exacerbation in depressive or anxiety symptoms. The study included data on 33 patients who were followed from pregnancy to the postpartum period at the Department of Psychiatry of a university Hospital. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined by means of a structured clinical interview. The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed by means of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), respectively. Prophylactic treatment was initiated within the first 3\u00a0days after the delivery. The patients were assessed again with HAM-D and HAM-A at 4-week postpartum. Postpartum prophylaxis was carried out with administration of sertraline at 50\u2009mg/day (n\u2009=\u20097, 21.2%), paroxetine at 20\u2009mg/day (n\u2009=\u200924, 72.7%), and escitalopram at 10\u2009mg/day (n\u2009=\u20092, 6.1%). Statistical analyses indicated that the mean HAM-D and HAM-A scores before (9.45\u2009\u00b1\u20097.01 and 10.09\u2009\u00b1\u20096.42, respectively) and after (9.09\u2009\u00b1\u20096.65 and 9.54\u2009\u00b1\u20095.97, respectively) the delivery were not significant.

Specifically, they examined whether fetal exposure to placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a molecule conveying maternal signals to the fetus, predicts brain growth and neuropsychiatric outcomes in school-age children.\nIn a large, well-characterized prospective cohort, concentrations of placental CRH (pCRH) in maternal plasma were determined during five intervals during gestation. When the children reached school age, their brain structures were examined using MRI, and emotional and cognitive tests assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviors and attention were administered (N=97, 49 of them girls).\nLevels of pCRH during gestation predicted structural and functional brain outcomes in children. Specifically, fetal exposure to elevated pCRH levels was associated with thinning of selective cortical regions and with commensurate cognitive and emotional deficits. The relations among fetal exposure to pCRH, cortical thinning, and childhood function were sex specific.\nIn view of the established effects of CRH on maturation and arborization of cortical neurons, and the major contribution of dendrites to cortical volume, these findings position pCRH as an important mediator of the consequences of early-life adversity on neuropsychiatric outcomes."}, {"Title": "Factors Associated with Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms in Students Who Survived 20 Months after the Sewol Ferry Disaster in Korea.", "Abstract": "The Sewol ferry disaster caused national shock and grief in Korea. The present study examined the prevalence and associated factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among the surviving students 20 months after that disaster.\nThis study was conducted using a cross-sectional design and a sample of 57 students (29 boys and 28 girls) who survived the Sewol ferry disaster. Data were collected using a questionnaire, including instruments that assessed psychological status. A generalized linear model using a log link and Poisson distribution was performed to identify factors associated with PTSD symptoms.\nThe results showed that 26.3% of participants were classified in the clinical group by the Child Report of Post-traumatic Symptoms score. Based on a generalized linear model, Poisson distribution, and log link analyses, PTSD symptoms were positively correlated with the number of exposed traumatic events, peers and social support, peri-traumatic dissociation and post-traumatic negative beliefs, and emotional difficulties. On the other hand, PTSD symptoms were negatively correlated with psychological well-being, family cohesion, post-traumatic social support, receiving care at a psychiatry clinic, and female gender.\nThis study uncovered risk and protective factors of PTSD in disaster-exposed adolescents. The implications of these findings are considered in relation to determining assessment and interventional strategies aimed at helping survivors following similar traumatic experiences."}, {"Title": "Framingham coronary score in individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders: A review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Patients with mental disorders have a higher coronary morbidity and mortality as compared to the general population. However, it remains unclear whether their coronary risk scores are higher than those of the general population. We reviewed studies and meta-analyze case-control studies about coronary risk scores in individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders. Search was performed in Pubmed and clinical trial registration databases. Four case-control studies were identified, comprising 963 individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders and 1681 controls. They focused on the most validated coronary risk score, the Framingham Risk Score 1998 (FRS 1998). The mean FRS 1998 was significantly higher in individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders than in the general population 7.9(\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.9) vs. 5.0(\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.8).

The difference was driven by three FRS 1998 criteria: smoking, diabetes and HDL cholesterolemia. The mean FRS 1998 was significantly higher in men, and to a trend in women. In conclusion, individuals with symptoms or diagnoses of mental disorders have a higher coronary risk score than controls. The FRS 1998 should be used as a simple and objective way of monitoring coronary risk in order to improve prevention of coronary events in psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "[The reform of the Penitentiary Order. A cultural revolution that involve the Mental Health Services].", "Abstract": "The reform of the penitentiary system (law 103/2017) which is about to enter into force in Italy represents a Copernican revolution for the management of psychiatric patients who are also authors of a crime. The change would have consequences similar to what happened with the law 180 of 1978. The basic principles on which the new Law is based are: 1) the extension of the faculty to suspend the sentence also for inmates and prisoners affected by a serious mental illness; 2) the full integration of the National Health System (SSN) and DSM in the penitentiary institutions; 3) the establishment of \"sections for prisoners with disabilities\", special sections for exclusive management for individuals with mental disorders, to be implemented inside the prisons and jails; 4) the possibility probation and parole for prisoners with sentences up to 6 years if suffering from mental illness with a procedure similar to the one already enacted for persons with drug dependency. The article deals with the positive aspects of the reform, but also with the critical aspects it presents in its implementation aspects: training of prison police officers and health workers; substantial and decisive employment of psychiatry in penal institutions; control functions by the DSM on patients; lack of staff and funds. The final aim of the reform is to contain recidivism, and the system must be organized on this goal."}, {"Title": "Community-Academic Partnership: Establishing the Institute for Mental Health Research Early Psychosis Intervention Center.", "Abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that specialized, multicomponent intervention provided early in the course of a psychotic disorder may have a positive effect in ameliorating the morbidity and mortality associated with these disorders.

Latent-class analysis was used to identify empirically distinct and clinically meaningful patient subgroups. Rates of suicide attempts during a two-year follow-up period were compared across classes and treatment groups.\nThree latent classes corresponding to low (N=55), moderate (N=40), and high (N=57) suicide risk were identified. The classes significantly differed with respect to psychiatric symptom severity but not demographic or historical variables. Rates of suicide attempts during the two-year follow-up significantly varied across classes in treatment as usual but did not vary across classes in brief CBT (21% versus 10%, respectively, in the low-severity class, 8% versus 13% in the moderate-severity class, and 41% versus 10% in the high-severity class).

They commonly occur together, especially in older people, but clinical identification of these diseases in dementia is difficult in such circumstances. We therefore conducted a study using cases with both comprehensive prospective clinical assessments and complete neuropathological examination to determine if it is possible to identify such mixed cases clinically and to determine features which may identify DLB in the presence of AD dementia.\nAt Newcastle Brain Bank we identified subjects who had a clinical diagnosis of dementia and who also had autopsy diagnoses of pure AD, pure DLB, or mixed AD+DLB. All subjects had undergone prospective longitudinal clinical assessments. Mixed AD+DLB patients met neuropathological criteria for both DLB (limbic/neocortical Lewy body disease) and AD (Braak stage V/VI and CERAD B/C). The records of these subjects were carefully reviewed by two specialists in old-age psychiatry blind to autopsy findings to determine baseline and final clinical diagnoses based on these detailed records. The presence of characteristic Lewy body symptoms and other clinical information was also recorded.\nOf 59 subjects included, 19 were AD, 18 DLB, and 22 mixed AD+DLB. At baseline no subjects were correctly identified as having mixed AD+DLB and by final diagnosis only 23% were identified. The only symptom which helped in identifying the presence of Lewy body disease in the context of a mixed AD+DLB dementia was complex visual hallucinations.\nWhilst the identification of DLB in the context of a dementia with an AD pattern is difficult, the emergence of complex visual hallucinations in the context of such a degenerative dementia suggests the presence of Lewy body disease and should encourage a careful assessment.

And yet, efforts at renewal have also been suggested to have minimal impact on the pedagogy and outcomes of medical education. One reason may be misalignment between the components of the curriculum during design and implementation. The University of Toronto MD program recently renewed its undergraduate preclinical Foundations curriculum. Mindful of the pitfalls of misalignment, the renewal process focused deliberately on alignment between the various components of the curriculum: instructional methods, student assessment, faculty development, and the larger purpose of serving students and society.\nEducational evidence was used to drive the alignment process which resulted in three major changes. First, we created a spiral curriculum centered on 72 virtual patient cases designed to integrate content and prepare students for clinical learning. Second, we introduced a novel medical psychiatry component to address a core societal need in mental health. This exposed students early to experiences of complexity, ambiguity, and integrated patient care. Lastly, a shift to assessment for learning and programmatic assessment was designed and implemented concurrently to reinforce the pedagogy of the curriculum. Synchronous faculty development was developed for the new roles required of faculty.\nEarly program evaluation shows alignment of these curricular components requires ongoing attention and resources in order to be successful. The potential benefits of this alignment are well prepared students who can meet the needs of their patients and society in an increasingly complex health system."}, {"Title": "[Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult psychiatry: Data on 12-month prevalence, risk factors and comorbidity].", "Abstract": "To examine the 12-month prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity of ADHD in a collective of adult psychiatric patients admitted to an open general ward in a psychiatric hospital in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) over a period of one year (n\u200a=\u200a166).\nThe 12-month prevalence of ADHD was 59.0\u200a% (severe symptomatology: 33.1\u200a%), high rates of comorbid disorders (92.9\u200a% depression, 5.1\u200a% bipolar disorder, 28.6\u200a% anxiety disorder, 30.6\u200a% emotional unstable (Borderline) personality disorder, 31.6\u200a% avoidant personality disorder, 18.4\u200a% dependent personality disorder, 25.5\u200a% combined personality disorder, 10.2\u200a% obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, 26.5\u200a% PTSD, 25.5\u200a% restless legs syndrome, 24.5\u200a% adiposity, 11.2\u200a% eating disorder, 45.9\u200a% learning difficulty, 51.0\u200a% nicotine dependency, 4.1\u200a% alcohol dependency, 7.1\u200a% illegal substance dependency), risk factors for ADHD, a high genetic risk (72.4\u200a%) and problems in psychosocial functioning.\nBecause of the high prevalence of ADHD in hospitalized psychiatric patients, it is mandatory to examine these for the presence of ADHD using questionnaires and identify comorbid diseases."}, {"Title": "Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is increased in elderly patients with first episode depression, but not in recurrent depression.", "Abstract": "Association between inflammation and depression, especially in elderly patients, leads to conclusions about their shared influence on risk of cardiovascular disease and death.

There was a positive correlation with severity of symptoms. We found non-specific effect of treatment with antidepressants or antipsychotics on lower NLR. Increased NLR in patients with first episode of depression compared to recurrent depression and healthy control may have important clinical consequences. Severity of symptoms are positively correlated with NLR, which may indicate that with increasing severity of depression, the risk of cardiovascular events is also rising, which leads to higher mortality. In elderly patients with depression even a small reduction of such risk may translate into better prognosis and improve quality of live.

The authors discovered an error in the calculation of the response bias\u2013corrected pattern recognition score in this article, which has significantly changed the results for experiment 1. Specifically, the authors discovered that the response bias corrected pattern recognition score was erroneously computed as P(\u2018old\u2019|target) minus P(\u2018old\u2019|lure) rather than P(\u2018old\u2019|target) minus P(\u2018old\u2019|foil). After re-running statistical analyses with the correct values, the authors found a significant difference in the response bias\u2013corrected pattern recognition score in healthy volunteers (HV) compared with first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (HV: 84.13 \u00b1 10.96; FEP: 63.70 \u00b1 21.83; t = 4.01; p < .01) in experiment 1. This finding is not consistent with the original report, where the authors reported no group differences in bias-corrected pattern recognition scores (originally reported values: t = 0.93, p = .36). The authors again found no significant correlations between pattern completion scores and BPRS total, positive, or negative symptom scores or RBANS scores, consistent with the original report. In experiment 2, bias-corrected pattern recognition scores did not differ between the saline and ketamine conditions (saline: 78.29 \u00b1 28.04; ketamine: 73.59 \u00b1 18.94; t = 0.81; p = 0.43), which is consistent with the original report (originally reported values: t = \u22120.69, p = .50). Contrary to the original report, task performance during the saline and ketamine infusions was no longer correlated at trend level for pattern recognition. Repeat analyses showed no correlations between pattern recognition scores during the ketamine challenge and BPRS total, positive, and negative symptom scores, or ketamine plasma levels at either time point, consistent with the original report. The authors have verified that bias-corrected pattern separation scores were calculated correctly for both experiments in the initial report.

Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease.

A review of Freud's rationales (Kluft, 2018a/this issue) demonstrates that while some stemmed from what he considered advances, others appear strongly influenced by his promoting the superiority of his \"psycho-analysis\" at the expense of hypnosis. Mainstream psychoanalysis continues to endorse the perpetuation of rationales Freud asserted nearly a century ago, and an oral lore of related supportive statements. This oral lore proves difficult to sustain upon closer scrutiny. It bypasses concerns that, if studied in depth, would demonstrate significant shortcomings. Problems encountered in this oral lore include: (1) the importance of information unavailable to Freud; (2) the ongoing impact of certain errors of Freud's thinking; (3) the distorting force of Freud's compelling drive to be a \"conquistador\" of the mind and create a heroic theory; (4) the implausibility, upon inspection, of certain long-accepted assertions about Freud's motivations; and (5) Freud's discomfort with his own dissociative symptomatology. It is argued that the \"oral lore\" promulgated in connection with Freud's rejection of hypnosis, like Freud's decision to reject hypnosis itself, is not firmly grounded and deserves careful reassessment."}, {"Title": "Community treatment orders increase community care and delay readmission while in force: Results from a large population-based study.", "Abstract": "There is debate about the effectiveness of community treatment orders in the management of people with a severe mental illness. While some case-control studies suggest community treatment orders reduce hospital readmissions, three randomised controlled trials find no effects. These randomised controlled trials measure outcomes over a longer period than the community treatment order duration and assess the combined effectiveness of community treatment orders both during and after the intervention. This study examines the effectiveness of community treatment orders in a large population-based sample, restricting observation to the period under a community treatment order.\nAll persons ( n\u2009=\u20095548) receiving a community treatment order in New South Wales, Australia, over the period 2004-2009 were identified. Controls were matched using a propensity score based on demographic, clinical and prior care variables. A baseline period equal to each case's duration of treatment was constructed. Treatment effects were compared using zero-inflated negative binomial regression, adjusting for demographics, clinical characteristics and pre-community treatment order care.\nCompared to matched controls, people on community treatment orders were less likely to be readmitted (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.90, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u2009[0.84, 0.97]) and had a significantly longer time to their first readmission (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.47, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u2009[1.36, 1.58]), fewer hospital admissions (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20090.90, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u2009[0.84, 0.96]) and more days of community care (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.55, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u2009[1.51, 1.59]). Increased community care and delayed first admission were found for all durations of community treatment order care. Reduced odds of readmission were limited to people with 6\u2009months or less of community treatment order care, and reduced number of admissions and days in hospital to people with prolonged (>24\u2009months) community treatment order care.\nIn this large population-based study, community treatment orders increase community care and delay rehospitalisation while they are in operation. Some negative findings in this field may reflect the use of observation periods longer than the period of active intervention."}, {"Title": "Survey of recognition and treatment of at-risk mental state by Japanese psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The importance of early intervention in psychiatry is widely recognized among psychiatrists.

We mailed study documents to all eligible participants in November 2015 with a requested return date in December.\nTwo hundred and sixty (19.3%) psychiatrists responded to the survey. Their correct diagnosis rates for the patients in the at-risk mental state vignettes were low (14.6% for the vignette describing at-risk mental state with attenuated positive symptom syndrome; 13.1% for the vignette describing at-risk mental state with brief intermittent psychotic syndrome). Many psychiatrists selected pharmacotherapy and antipsychotics to treat patients in the at-risk mental state vignettes.

Understanding the nature of this continuum may better inform the construction of taxonomies for both categories of behaviour. Both temperament and mental illness refer to patterns of behaviour that manifest over long time scales (weeks to years) and they appear to share many underlying neuroregulatory systems. This continuum is discussed from the perspectives of nonlinear dynamical systems theory, neurobiology and psychiatry as applied to understanding such multiscale time-series behaviour. Particular emphasis is given to issues of generativity, fungibility, metastability, non-stationarity and contextuality. Implications of these dynamical properties for the development of taxonomies will be discussed. Problems with the over-reliance of psychologists on statistical and mathematical methods in deriving their taxonomies (particularly those based on factor analysis) will be discussed from a dynamical perspective.

It summarises Schwarz's publications from 1953 to 1966 regarding the impact of boxing on health, particularly craniocerebral injury. Also, the study analyses his work in the context of current discussions. It shows that Schwarz, who was a tenured professor and director of the Department of Psychiatry at the University Hospital of Leipzig and the physician of the GDR national boxing team, conducted systematic clinical surveys and pointed to the health impacts of boxing at an early point in time. He believed that risk exposure for athletes could be minimised through intensive and trained supervision by the coach and the physician as well as through changes to the\u00a0conditions of boxing matches. Schwarz opposed a ban on boxing. Instead, he picked up suggestions concerning the prevention of adverse health impacts and added his own recommendations, which are remarkably similar to current practices aimed at minimising risk. For instance, he advised that ring-side physicians be trained to recognise dangerous conditions. Today, physicians must obtain a license to be allowed to care for a boxer. In addition, Schwarz pursued the concept of integral medicine. He called for a diversified training of boxers and argued that injured athletes should be treated holistically. Being a neurologist, he emphasised the important role of psychotherapy in this context. He identified the key role of rehabilitation, and suggested that rehabilitation is complete only with the patient's successful social and professional reintegration."}, {"Title": "Resilience, Trauma, and Coping.", "Abstract": "The study and use of resilience is of the utmost importance to psychodynamic psychiatry.

It is defined by systematic attention to the \"common factors\" underlying both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology outcomes, which include the patient's subjective systems of meaning and the complex flow of the patient-provider relationship in addition to the patient's \"objective\" psychopathology. It allows for a non-reductionist milieu where the meaning of the illness and the full complexity of the treatment process can be explored in order to achieve a qualitative and lasting change in the patient's psychopathology. The author proposes an integrated psychobiological model of psychiatric care where attention to the patient's subjective experience and the unique flow of the patient-provider relationship stand on an equal footing with the patient's objective behavioral and symptomatic presentation. This model provides a common foundation for diverse psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions to enable a paradigm shift from symptom- or syndrome-focused approach to individualized, process-oriented philosophy of care. Psychodynamically informed treatment provision helps to unify psychiatric practice by integrating objective, subjective, and intersubjective science in order to construct a systematic science of experience."}, {"Title": "Race in Supervision: Let's Talk About It.", "Abstract": "Addressing race and racial trauma within psychotherapy supervision is increasingly important in psychiatry training.

The authors discuss the contextual and sociocultural dynamics that contributed to their own avoidance of race and racial trauma within the supervisory relationship. The authors examine the features that eventually led to a robust discussion of race and culture within the supervisory setting and identify salient themes that occurred during three phases of the conversation about race: pre-dialogue, the conversation, and after the conversation. These themes include building an alliance, supercompetence, avoidance, shared vulnerability, \"if I speak on this, I own it,\" closeness versus distance, and speaking up.

We introduce a workflow that investigates a narrowly defined psychiatric phenotype, makes use of the potent and cost-effective discovery technology of gene expression microarrays, applies Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to better capture complex and polygenic traits, and finally explores gene expression findings on the proteomic level using targeted mass-spectrometry (MS) technologies. To illustrate the effectiveness of the workflow, we present a proteomic analysis of peripheral blood plasma from patient's remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) who experience ongoing cognitive deficits. We show that co-expression patterns previous detected on the transcript level could be replicated for plasma proteins, as could the module eigengene correlation with cognitive performance. Further, we demonstrate that functional analysis of multi-omics data has the potential to point to cellular mechanisms and candidate biomarkers for cognitive dysfunction in MDD, implicating cell cycle regulation by cyclin D3 (CCND3), regulation of protein processing in the endoplasmatic reticulum by Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXND5), and modulation of inflammatory cytokines by Tripartite Motif Containing 26 (TRI26).\nThis paper discusses how data from multiple -omics platforms can be integrated to accelerate biomarker discovery in psychiatry. Using the phenotype of cognitive impairment in remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) as an example, we show that the application of a systems biology approach - weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) - in the discovery phase, and targeted proteomic follow-up of results, provides a structured avenue towards uncovering novel candidate markers and pathways for personalized clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Autoantibodies against N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1 in health and disease.", "Abstract": "Humoral autoimmunity has gained highest interest in neurology and psychiatry.

Original exclusivity claims (e.g. electroencephalogram, EEG or functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI findings) turned out not to be exclusive for 'anti-NMDAR encephalitis'. Systematic analyses of representative NMDAR1-AB positive sera of all immunoglobulin (Ig) classes showed comparable distribution of different epitopes, often polyspecific/polyclonal, across health and disease.

Despite adequate drug treatment, some patients develop pharmacoresistant disease. As a consequence, physicians are confronted with prescribing challenges, prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of adverse events, thus aggravating short-, medium-, and long-term prognosis. The majority of psychotropic treatments, particularly antipsychotics and antidepressants, are metabolized at hepatic level by cytochrome P450 (CYP), particularly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Several <i>CYP2D6</i> genetic polymorphisms are described to be associated with ultrarapid (UM) or poor drug metabolism (PM), inducing clinical resistance and/or adverse events, and might therefore be related to pharmacoresistant severe mental health disease.\nA total of nine pharmacoresistant patients (four females, five males) aged 11-16 (mean 14.1) years have been genotyped for <i>CYP2D6</i> between January, 2015 and April, 2016.

Processing of Emotion and Intention from Biological Motion in Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Social neuroscience offers a wide range of techniques that may be applied to study the social cognitive deficits that may underlie reduced social functioning-a common feature across many psychiatric disorders. At the same time, a significant proportion of research in this area has been conducted using paradigms that utilize static displays of faces or eyes. The use of point-light displays (PLDs) offers a viable alternative for studying recognition of emotion or intention inference while minimizing the amount of information presented to participants. This mini-review aims to summarize studies that have used PLD to study emotion and intention processing in schizophrenia (SCZ), affective disorders, anxiety and personality disorders, eating disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the reviewed studies: first, the social cognitive problems found in most of the psychiatric samples using PLD were of smaller magnitude than those found in studies presenting social information using faces or voices. Second, even though the information presented in PLDs is extremely limited, presentation of these types of stimuli is sufficient to elicit the disorder-specific, social cognitive biases (e.g., mood-congruent bias in depression, increased threat perception in anxious individuals, aberrant body size perception in eating disorders) documented using other methodologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that point-light stimuli may be a useful method of studying social information processing in psychiatry. At the same time, some limitations of using this methodology are also outlined."}, {"Title": "Dementia prevalence in a population at high vascular risk: the Trinidad national survey of ageing and cognition.", "Abstract": "To investigate the dementia prevalence in a country with high levels of cardiovascular risk factors DESIGN AND METHODS: Older people in Trinidad are recognised to have particularly high levels of cardiovascular risk factors. We carried out a survey in a nationally representative sample of people aged \u226570 years using household enumeration. Dementia status was ascertained using standardised interviews and algorithms from the 10/66 schedule and age-specific prevalence were compared with identically defined output from the 10/66 surveys of 16\u2009536 residents in eight other low-income and middle-income countries.\nOf 1832 participants (77.0% response rate), dementia was present in 442 (23.4%). Prevalences were 12.0% in persons aged 70-74 years, 23.5% at 75-79, 25.8% at 80-84, 41.3% at 85-89 and 54.0% in those aged \u226590 years. Prevalence ratios compared with averages from 10/66 surveys in these age groups were 2.2, 2.6, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.6, respectively, and were 2.7, 2.8, 1.7, 1.4 and 0.8, respectively, compared with previously published consensus estimates for the Latin American region. Dementia was significantly associated with reported stroke and diabetes in logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic status and other vascular risk factors (OR (95%\u2009CI) 4.40 (2.70 to 7.19) and 1.56 (1.20 to 2.03), respectively). Projected national numbers of people with dementia (18 206) were 70%-100%\u2009higher than those estimated using most recent regional consensus prevalences.\nIn a nation with high levels of vascular risk, dementia prevalence is higher than expected, particularly at the lower end of the 70+ age\u2009range.

Most patients' treatments are based on polypharmacy, but with no biological basis and little is known of the drugs' interactions. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of lithium, valproate, quetiapine, and lamotrigine, and the interactions between them, on markers of inflammation, bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress in neuron-like cells and microglial cells.\nNeuron-like cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells were treated with lithium (2.5 mM), valproate (0.5 mM), quetiapine (0.05 mM), and lamotrigine (0.05 mM) individually and in all possible combinations for 24 h. Twenty cytokines were measured in the media from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated C8-B4 cells. Metabolic flux analysis was used to measure bioenergetics, and real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of mitochondrial function genes in neuron-like cells. The production of superoxide in treated cells was also assessed.\nThe results suggest major inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine release as a therapeutic mechanism of these medications when used in combination. The various combinations of medications also caused overexpression of PGC1\u03b1 and ATP5A1 in neuron-like cells. Quetiapine appears to have a proinflammatory effect in microglial cells, but this was reversed by the addition of lamotrigine independent of the drug combination.\nPolypharmacy in bipolar disorder may have antiinflammatory effects on microglial cells as well as effects on mitochondrial biogenesis in neuronal cells."}, {"Title": "Changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and late-life depression: A two year population based longitudinal study.", "Abstract": "Longitudinal associations of cytokine levels with depression are unclear. This study aimed to investigate cross-sectional and prospective associations between five serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and late-life depression. 732 Korean people aged 65+ were evaluated at baseline. Of 631 without depression (Geriatric Mental State schedule) at baseline, 521 (83%) were followed over a 2\u202fyear period and incident depression was ascertained. Serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 levels were assayed at both baseline and follow-up. Associations between cytokine levels and depressive status were evaluated using linear regression models, considering potential covariates (demographics, cognitive function, disability, lifestyle factors, and vascular risk factors) and applying Bonferroni corrections. Prevalent depression at baseline was significantly associated with higher contemporaneous levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8, independent of relevant covariates and after applying Bonferroni corrections. In the analyses of the five cytokine levels in combination, independent associations were found between prevalent depression and increased numbers of cytokines at higher levels at baseline. Incident depression was significantly associated with increases in IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 levels during the follow-up independent of relevant covariates and after applying Bonferroni corrections. In combination analyses, incident depression was independently associated with higher numbers of cytokines showing increasing levels over the same follow-up period. However, incident depression was not predicted by higher baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in any analysis. Our findings suggest that depression might affect serum cytokines alterations and lead to inflammatory processes in late-life."}, {"Title": "A Recurrent Question: What Is Borderline?", "Abstract": "The status of borderline personality disorder (BPD) as a diagnostic category is a matter of continuing controversy. In the United States, BPD is one of the most frequent diagnoses of psychiatric inpatients, and a similar tendency emerges in Europe. Nearly all theoretical aspects of BPD have been questioned, including its very position as a personality disorder. In this article, we trace the evolution of the borderline concept from the beginning of the 20th century to the current psychometric research. We argue that the status of BPD is fraught with conceptual difficulties, including an unrecognized semantic drift of major phenomenological terms (e.g., identity), a lack of general principles for the distinction of BPD and the major psychiatric syndromes (e.g., schizophrenia spectrum disorders), and insufficient definitions of key nosological concepts. These difficulties illustrate general problems in today's psychiatry that require consideration."}, {"Title": "Knowledge transfer: a worldwide challenge in child mental health: a recommendation to the readership of CAPMH concerning the revised version of the IACAPAP Textbook of Child and Adolescent Mental Health.", "Abstract": "Transfer of knowledge is an important issue throughout all scientific disciplines, especially in the medical and psycho-social field. The issue of worldwide knowledge transfer in child mental health is one of the aims and goals of the journal <i>Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health</i> (CAPMH). The demand for mental health training is high worldwide, and especially in low- to lower-middle income countries, where inadequate access to knowledge resources in the field of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) is prevalent. At the same time, many of these countries are showing an increased risk for mental health issues in children and adolescents. The International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP) <i>Textbook of Child and Adolescent Mental Health</i> counters this problem. It is an open-access e-textbook aiming to provide an overview of current and established treatment and practical approaches for child and adolescent psychiatrists, psychotherapists and allied (mental health) professionals worldwide. First published in 2012, the updated and revised version was launched in 2015. The aim of this commentary is to review and disseminate the usefulness and practicability of content and further material included in the new version of the textbook.\nOverall, the textbook contains ten sections divided into 59 chapters, with a total of 1435 pages. The original version of the textbook was written in English. The revised version contains translations of 49 chapters into different languages (to date French, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Norwegian and/or Japanese), with additional material for knowledge dissemination and self-directed learning (e.g. videos and quizzes) for several chapters. The textbook and the add-on materials for dissemination are of high quality and convey a great introduction to important topics concerning mental health. Apart from knowledge transfer, there is a pragmatic focus on clinical practice and on regional and cultural differences.\nThe textbook is a new and unique opportunity for professionals all over the world to improve their knowledge, skills and expertise in CAMH.

Patients who do not respond to traditional monoaminergic antidepressant treatments have an especially difficult-to-treat type of MDD termed treatment-resistant depression. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine-a glutamatergic modulator-have shown great promise for rapidly treating patients with the most severe forms of depression. As such, ketamine represents a promising probe for understanding the pathophysiology of depression and treatment response. Through neuroimaging, ketamine's mechanism may be elucidated in humans. Here, we review 47 articles of ketamine's effects as revealed by neuroimaging studies. Some important brain areas emerge, especially the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, ketamine may decrease the ability to self-monitor, may increase emotional blunting, and may increase activity in reward processing. Further studies are needed, however, to elucidate ketamine's mechanism of antidepressant action."}, {"Title": "Validation of the DSM-5 Alternative Model Personality Disorder Diagnoses in Turkey, Part 1: LEAD Validity and Reliability of the Personality Functioning Ratings.", "Abstract": "This study addresses longitudinal, expert, all data (LEAD) validity and reliability of the personality functioning ratings in Turkey, which are essential in assessing Criterion A for the entire DSM-5 alternative model for personality disorders (AMPD) diagnoses. A total of 120 consenting patients recruited at a university psychiatry clinic were rated by individual clinicians with respect to DSM-III-R and AMPD criteria. Subsequently, a LEAD panel consisting of 3 senior clinicians convened to reach a consensus personality disorder diagnosis for each participant. Blind personality functioning ratings of a subgroup of 20 participants by the same set of 4 clinicians were obtained for test-retest reliability investigation. Concordance between the LEAD and AMPD diagnoses was as good as that between the LEAD and DSM-III-R diagnoses (kappas = .68). The personality functioning scores correlated strongly (r > .50) with the sum of specific DSM-III-R diagnoses. Reliability estimates pertaining to the personality functioning scores and resultant AMPD Criterion A decisions were mostly in the good range. In conclusion, DSM-5 alternative model-oriented personality functioning ratings yield total or composite scores that are evidently valid and reliable tools to diagnose general personality disorder and to estimate its global severity."}, {"Title": "Great boast, small roast on effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: response to a critique of our systematic review.", "Abstract": "Our systematic review in BMC Psychiatry concluded that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo significantly increase the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with major depression and the potential beneficial effects of SSRIs seem to be outweighed by the harms. Hieronymus et al. accused us of methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. In their post-hoc analysis of our data, they reported that SSRIs only increase the risk of SAEs in elderly and seems safe for non-elderly patients. They also found our review misleading because our efficacy analyses were based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; we included suboptimal SSRI doses; and we missed some 'pivotal trials'. We do not agree with Hieronymus et al. regarding several of the 'errors' they claim that we have made. However, we acknowledge that they have identified minor errors and that we missed some trials. After rectifying the errors and inclusion of the missed trials by us and Hieronymus et al., we re-analysed the data. The updated analyses are even more robust and confirm our earlier conclusions. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of an SAE both in non-elderly (p=0.045) and elderly (p=0.01) patients [overall odds ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.73; p=0.002; I2=0%].

Study protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data.", "Abstract": "Short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) is an empirically supported treatment that is often used to treat depression. However, it is largely unclear if certain subgroups of depressed patients can benefit specifically from this treatment method. We describe the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) aimed at identifying predictors and moderators of STPP for depression efficacy.\nWe will conduct a systematic literature search in multiple bibliographic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase.com, Web of Science and Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials), 'grey literature' databases (GLIN and UMI ProQuest) and a prospective trial register (http://www.controlled-trials.com). We will include studies reporting (a) outcomes on standardised measures of (b) depressed (c) adult patients (d) receiving STPP. We will next invite the authors of these studies to share the participant-level data of their trials and combine these data to conduct IPD meta-analyses. The primary outcome for this study is post-treatment efficacy as assessed by a continuous depression measure. Potential predictors and moderators include all sociodemographic variables, clinical variables and psychological patient characteristics that are measured before the start of treatment and are assessed consistently across studies. One-stage IPD meta-analyses will be conducted using mixed-effects models.\nInstitutional review board approval is not required for this study. We intend to submit reports of the outcomes of this study for publication to international peer-reviewed journals in the fields of psychiatry or clinical psychology. We also intend to present the outcomes at international scientific conferences aimed at psychotherapy researchers and clinicians.

We hypothesized that trauma-focused counseling prevents the incidence of ACS-induced PTSS.\nWithin 48 h of hospital admission, 190 patients with high distress during ACS were randomized to a single-session intervention of either trauma-focused counseling or an active control intervention targeting the general role of stress in patients with heart disease. Blind interviewer-rated PTSS (primary outcome) and additional health outcomes were assessed at 3 months of follow-up. Trial results about prevalence were compared with data from previous studies on the natural incidence of ACS-induced PTSS/PTSD.\nIntention-to-treat analyses revealed no difference in interviewer-rated PTSS between trauma-focused counseling (mean, 11.33; 95% Cl, 9.23-13.43) and stress counseling (9.88; 7.36-12.40; p = 0.40), depressive symptoms (6.01, 4.98-7.03, vs. 4.71, 3.65-5.77; p = 0.08), global psychological distress (5.15, 4.07-6.23, vs. 3.80, 2.60-5.00; p = 0.11), and the risk for cardiovascular-related hospitalization/all-cause mortality (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.37-1.23).

A previous add-on trial with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) led to negative symptom reductions in chronic patients. We aim to study NAC's impact on symptoms and neurocognition in early psychosis (EP) and to explore whether glutathione (GSH)/redox markers could represent valid biomarkers to guide treatment. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 63 EP patients, we assessed the effect of NAC supplementation (2700 mg/day, 6 months) on PANSS, neurocognition, and redox markers (brain GSH [GSHmPFC], blood cells GSH levels [GSHBC], GSH peroxidase activity [GPxBC]). No changes in negative or positive symptoms or functional outcome were observed with NAC, but significant improvements were found in favor of NAC on neurocognition (processing speed). NAC also led to increases of GSHmPFC by 23% (P = .005) and GSHBC by 19% (P = .05). In patients with high-baseline GPxBC compared to low-baseline GPxBC, subgroup explorations revealed a link between changes of positive symptoms and changes of redox status with NAC. In conclusion, NAC supplementation in a limited sample of EP patients did not improve negative symptoms, which were at modest baseline levels. However, NAC led to some neurocognitive improvements and an increase in brain GSH levels, indicating good target engagement. Blood GPx activity, a redox peripheral index associated with brain GSH levels, could help identify a subgroup of patients who improve their positive symptoms with NAC. Thus, future trials with antioxidants in EP should consider biomarker-guided treatment."}, {"Title": "Dark Classics in Chemical Neuroscience: Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD).", "Abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is one of the most potent psychoactive agents known, producing dramatic alterations of consciousness after submilligram (\u226520 \u03bcg) oral doses. Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods.

However, it remains unknown whether such shifts in self-evaluation are due to specific alterations in metacognition and/or a downstream consequence of changes in decision-making processes.\nUsing perceptual decision making as a model system, we employed a computational psychiatry approach to relate parameters governing both decision formation and metacognitive evaluation to self-reported transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in a large general population sample (N\u00a0= 995).\nVariability in psychopathology was unrelated to either speed or accuracy of decision formation. In contrast, leveraging a dimensional approach, we revealed independent relationships between psychopathology and metacognition: a symptom dimension related to anxiety and depression was associated with lower confidence and heightened metacognitive efficiency, whereas a dimension characterizing compulsive behavior and intrusive thoughts was associated with higher confidence and lower metacognitive efficiency. Furthermore, we obtained a robust double dissociation-whereas psychiatric symptoms predicted changes in metacognition but not decision performance, age predicted changes in decision performance but not metacognition.\nOur findings indicate a specific and pervasive link between metacognition and mental health.

However, only few studies investigated the Pituitary gland (PG) in Bipolar Disorder (BD) and the results are so far contrasting. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the integrity of the PG as well as the role of gender and the impact of clinical measurements on this structure in a sample of BD patients compared to healthy controls (HC).\n34 BD patients and 41 HC underwent a 1.5\u202fT MRI scan. PG volumes were manually traced for all subjects. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by means of the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Bech Rafaelsen Mania Rating Scale.\nWe found decreased PG volumes in BD patients compared to HC (F\u202f=\u202f24.9, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Interestingly, after dividing the sample by gender, a significant PG volume decrease was detected only in female BD patients compared to female HC (F\u202f=\u202f9.1, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), but not in male BD compared to male HC (F\u202f=\u202f-0.12, p\u202f=\u202f0.074). No significant correlations were observed between PG volumes and clinical variables.\nOur findings suggest that BD patients have decreased PG volumes, probably due to the long-term hyperactivity of the HPAA and to the consequent strengthening of the negative feedback control towards the PG volume itself. This alteration was particularly evident in females, suggesting a role of gender in affecting PG volumes in BD. Finally, the absence of significant correlations between PG volumes and clinical variables further supports that PG disruption is a trait feature of BD, being independent of symptoms severity and duration of treatment."}, {"Title": "Substance Use Disorder Among Current Cancer Patients: Rates and Correlates Nationally in the Department of Veterans Affairs.", "Abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) are known to cause or complicate treatment of many types of cancers.\nWe sought to systematically assess rates of current SUDs among patients currently in treatment for cancer.\nThe National Veteran Health Administration administrative data from fiscal year 2012 were used to compare veterans with both cancer and comorbid SUDs to veterans with cancer but no SUDs and those with a SUD but no cancer. Bivariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression were used to compare groups on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and mental health diagnoses, service use, and psychotropic and opioid medication fills.\nOf 482,688 veterans with cancer diagnoses, 32,037 (6.64%) had a comorbid SUD diagnosis. Veterans with cancer and a SUD had more medical and psychiatric disorders than those with cancer alone, a greater risk of homelessness, and a greater use of both mental and medical health services, with 60% receiving mental health outpatient treatment. These veterans had fewer differences from veterans with SUDs only, although they were older and had more medical illnesses. Notably the cancer SUD group had higher rates of hepatic disease and received a greater number of opioid prescriptions than both veterans with cancer alone and veterans with SUD alone.\nVeterans with cancer and SUD showed a specific risk for liver disease and a higher use of opioids.

In the current debate on whether the \"food addiction\" phenotype should be considered as an addictive disorder, assessment of the personality traits associated with this phenotype would provide arguments for or against the \"food addiction\" phenotype and its inclusion in the \"substance-related and addictive disorder\" category.\nTo assess the personality characteristics associated with the \"food addiction\" phenotype in obesity surgery candidates (i.e., big five personality dimensions, alexithymia and impulsivity).\nWe assessed food addiction (Yale Food Addiction Scale), personality dimensions (Big Fig Inventory), impulsivity (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11<sup>th</sup> version) and alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 items) in 188 bariatric surgery candidates recruited between July 2013 and November 2015 in the Nutrition Department of the University Hospital of Tours. We used chi-squared tests and Student's tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests to determine the factors associated with food addiction.\nPrevalence of current food addiction was 16.5%. Patients with (vs. without) food addiction had lower conscientiousness (p = .047), higher neuroticism and lower extraversion (p<sub>s</sub> < 0.001), but there was no difference in terms of agreeableness (p = 0.42) or openness (p = 0.16). They were more frequently single (p = .021) and reported higher alexithymia (p<sub>s</sub> < .001) and higher impulsivity sub-scores (p<sub>s</sub><.05). Conclusions/Importance: Food addiction shares personality traits with substance-related disorders (regarding neuroticism, conscientiousness, impulsivity, alexithymia), and one distinctive trait (low extraversion).

Data were collected at three hospitals in Germany. Demographic and clinical data, including the previous psychoactive medications and an assessment of the suitability of the previous medications, were recorded and analyzed.\nData on the previous psychiatric medications were available for 972 patients. In 16.6% of patients, at least one psychoactive drug had been prescribed off-label, 20.2% had received on-label medication, and 63.2% had not received any psychiatric medication. Among all patients receiving psychiatric medication, 45.1% had received off-label medication. The logistic regression analysis showed a significant influence of age on the likelihood of receiving off-label medication (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Benzodiazepines were the most frequent off-label prescription (25.8% of off-label prescriptions), followed by atypical antipsychotics (18.2%) and low-potency antipsychotics (17.2%). Notably, 57.1% of off-label prescriptions were judged to be 'not indicated' by experienced psychiatrists.\nOur data show a high frequency of the off-label prescription of psychoactive drugs by physicians treating patients with somatic illnesses in general hospitals. Because more than half of these cases were judged to be \"not indicated\", these prescriptions indicate a potential risk to patients. Furthermore, the classes of drugs that were most frequently prescribed off-label, benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, both show a substantial risk profile, particularly for elderly patients."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with prescribing costs: analysis of a nationwide administrative database.", "Abstract": "All health care systems in the world struggle with rising costs for drugs.

Treatment and prevention guidelines highlight the key role of information and evidence-based psychosocial interventions not only for individuals but also for their families and carers. Engaging young people in prevention and early intervention programs is a challenge, and early treatment and prevention of adolescent depression is a major public health concern. There has been growing interest in psychoeducational interventions to provide accurate information about health issues and to enhance and develop self-management skills. However, for adolescents with, or at high risk of depression, there is a lack of engaging Web-based psychoeducation programs that have been developed with user input and in line with research guidelines and targeted at both the individual and their family or carer. There are also few studies published on the process of development of Web-based psychoeducational interventions.\nThe aim of this study was to describe the process underlying the design and development of MoodHwb (HwbHwyliau in Welsh): a Web-based psychoeducation multimedia program for young people with, or at high risk of, depression and their families, carers, friends, and professionals.\nThe initial prototype was informed by (1) a systematic review of psychoeducational interventions for adolescent depression; (2) findings from semistructured interviews and focus groups conducted with adolescents (with depressive symptoms or at high risk), parents or carers, and professionals working with young people; and (3) workshops and discussions with a multimedia company and experts (in clinical, research, and multimedia work). Twelve interviews were completed (four each with young people, parents or carers, and professionals) and six focus groups (three with young people, one with parents and carers, one with professionals, and one with academics).\nKey themes from the interviews and focus groups were: aims of the program, design and content issues, and integration and context of the program.

While several studies have established this immune-psychosis association in adult schizophrenia patients, there is very limited data associating inflammation with acute psychosis in children and adolescents. The ratio between neutrophils and lymphocyte, computed from routine blood counts, has been shown to correlate with traditional markers of inflammation, and is therefore considered a proxy-marker for inflammation. Here we report elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and total leukocyte count in psychotic adolescent inpatients (n = 81, mean age 14.7 years, 52% males) compared to non-psychotic adolescent inpatient (n = 285, mean age 15.9 years, 58% males), in a population of adolescent inpatients with no affective symptomatology. The elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio remained significant after controlling for confounders such as age, BMI, smoking and antipsychotic medication. In a subset of psychotic adolescent inpatients (n = 20, mean duration between blood test 157 days), we found significant decrease in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio at clinical remission compared with the acute psychotic state. The results suggest that psychosis is associated with peripheral markers of inflammation early in the course of psychiatric pathology, and that inflammation may represent a state that accompanies psychosis and decreases during clinical remission."}, {"Title": "Improving the health of mental health staff through exercise interventions: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Exercise interventions are efficacious in reducing cardiometabolic risk and improving symptoms in people with severe mental illness, yet evidence guiding the implementation and scalability of such efforts is lacking.

Blood samples were obtained and the bone resorption marker, C-telopeptide (CTx) and formation marker, type 1 procollagen amino-terminal-propeptide (PINP) were measured. Anthropometry and socio-economic status (SES) were determined and information on medication use and lifestyle was obtained via questionnaire. Lifetime mood disorders were assessed using semi-structured clinical interviews. Thirty-seven (3.3%) men reported using SSRIs. Age was an effect modifier in the association between SSRIs and markers of bone turnover. Among younger men (20-60\u00a0year; n\u2009=\u2009557), adjusted mean CTx and PINP values were 12.4% [16.7 (95% CI 14.6-18.8) vs 19.1 (95% CI 18.7-19.4)\u00a0pg/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.03] and 13.6% [5.6 (95% CI 4.9-6.3) vs 6.4 (95% CI 6.3-6.6)\u00a0pg/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.02] lower among SSRI users compared to non-users, respectively.

These patterns persisted after further adjustment for activity, alcohol, smoking, SES, depression, bone active medications and other antidepressants. Our data suggest that SSRI use is associated with alterations in bone turnover markers among younger men. The observed decreases in both CTx and PINP are likely to contribute to a low bone turnover state and increased skeletal fragility with this potential imbalance between formation and resorption resulting in subsequent bone loss."}, {"Title": "Discrepancy in Taiwanese psychiatrists' preferences for long-acting injectable antipsychotics across facilities: a nationwide questionnaire survey.", "Abstract": "Although many studies have discussed psychiatrists' attitudes toward long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), no previous study has focused on differences in preference based on the facilities in which the psychiatrists practiced.\nA pilot survey was conducted in a medical center in northern Taiwan, and a questionnaire was then distributed at the annual conference of the Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry in 2013.

All the groups had a larger proportion of older individuals (>\u200950%, 45-64\u00a0years), except for the 'increasing low' group, where younger individuals were in majority (>\u200960%, 18-44\u00a0years), who more frequently exited labour market due to 'anxiety disorders', with lower education and more specialised healthcare before DP than the other groups.\nThe heterogeneity among the five trajectory groups was partly explained by age, the severity of the mental disorder and the DP diagnoses. DDDs of ADs, though on different levels, varied marginally before and after granted DP in the majority. Moreover, AD levels were very low in one third of the individuals. Early identification and focus on the 'increasing low' group might be important in order to identify individuals at risk for further increase in annual DDDs of ADs even after granted DP, and might also contribute in prevention of DP.

The patient recovered well from the surgery and was reviewed by the psychiatry service prior to discharge.\nTrichobezoar is a challenging diagnosis and as clinician, we must always include it in our differential diagnosis. The clinical presentation, signs and symptoms depend on the size of the trichobezoar and the presence of complications. Management is almost always surgical.\nThis case illustrates the infrequent perforation risk of gastric bezoars and the important role of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosis, particularly in a population who must not be exposed to excessive radiation."}, {"Title": "Pre-post, mixed-methods feasibility study of the WorkingWell mobile support tool for individuals with serious mental illness in the USA: a pilot study protocol.", "Abstract": "Successful competitive employment has been found to be related to enhanced self-esteem, higher quality of life and reduced mental health service use for individuals living with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The effectiveness of the individual placement and support model has been demonstrated in multiple randomised controlled trials in many countries. The management of stress, depression and anxiety in the workplace may be effectively enhanced through digital mental health interventions. The WorkingWell mobile support tool ('app') is specifically designed to meet the need for illness management support for individuals with SMI in the workplace, as an adjunct to professional treatment.\nThe WorkingWell app, grounded in evidence-based supported employment, is informed by user experience design. It will be tested in a pre-post design, mixed-methods pilot study to explore issues of feasibility, acceptability and usefulness, and to provide preliminary data on the impact of use. Putative mediators of improved job tenure and psychological well-being, including postintervention changes in social support, self-efficacy and work-related motivation, will be investigated. Forty individuals at least 18 years of age, meeting the eligibility requirements for supported employment services (ie, diagnosed with a mental illness meeting the criteria for severity, duration and treatment), working a minimum of 10\u2009hours per week at study enrolment, and speaking, reading and writing in English will be recruited for the pilot study. Research staff will recruit individuals at community-based mental health agencies; provide orientation to the study, the study smartphones and the WorkingWell app; conduct research interviews including standardised measures as well as semistructured items; and provide technical assistance in telephone calls and inperson meetings. A sample of 10 agency staff will be recruited to obtain further information on the feasibility, acceptability and usefulness of WorkingWell.\nThe study design and procedures are approved by the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health Central Office Research Review Committee and the Vermont Agency of Human Services Institutional Review Board. Study findings will be disseminated to agency partners, state agencies and funders, and to the research and technology development communities. Findings from the study will inform the design, data collection procedures and protocol for future full-scale randomised controlled trial testing of the effectiveness of the WorkingWell app, as well as investigations of work-related variables as mediators of psychological well-being and quality of life for individuals with SMI."}, {"Title": "[Staging and profiling of patients with dual disorders].", "Abstract": "Although there is a great need for staging and profiling in psychiatry, no-one has so far devised a staging and profiling model to aid diagnosis and treatment.\nTo devise a basic staging and profiling strategy that can be used to treat patients suffering from both substance abuse disorder and a psychiatric disorder.\nOn the basis of existing staging model for addiction, we explore how staging could also be useful for the treatment of comorbidity in psychiatry.\nSince there is hardly any evidence of the use of staging for this kind of comorbidity, we present a staging model that might help to provide a solution.

Currently, there is no internationally accepted standard to assess the functioning of individuals with ADHD. WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-child and youth version (ICF) can serve as a conceptual basis for such a standard. The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive, a common brief, and three age-appropriate brief ICF Core Sets for ADHD. Using a standardised methodology, four international preparatory studies generated 132 second-level ICF candidate categories that served as the basis for developing ADHD Core Sets. Using these categories and following an iterative consensus process, 20 ADHD experts from nine professional disciplines and representing all six WHO regions selected the most relevant categories to constitute the ADHD Core Sets. The consensus process resulted in 72 second-level ICF categories forming the comprehensive ICF Core Set-these represented 8 body functions, 35 activities and participation, and 29 environmental categories. A Common Brief Core Set that included 38 categories was also defined. Age-specific brief Core Sets included a 47 category preschool version for 0-5\u00a0years old, a 55 category school-age version for 6-16\u00a0years old, and a 52 category version for older adolescents and adults 17\u00a0years old and above.

Purity, progress and the origins of first-episode psychosis.", "Abstract": "First-episode psychosis has garnered significant attention and resources within mental health services in North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand since the 1990s. Despite this widespread embrace, little scholarship exists that examines underlying concepts, ideologies and imagery embedded within the early intervention paradigm. In this paper, I offer a sociohistorical analysis of the emergence of first-episode psychosis and early intervention as entities in psychiatry, drawing on contemporary philosophical thought to explore various concepts embedded in them. Although scattered references to 'prodrome' and 'incipient cases' exist in the historic psychiatric literature, the notion of first-episode psychosis as a distinct chronological stage emerged in the late 1980s. This occurred in response to a desire for a homogeneous, medication-naive population within schizophrenia research. Thematically, concerns regarding 'purity' as well as notions of 'progress' can be read off of the body of work surrounding the creation of the term and its development into a clinical organising concept. Furthermore, examining the sociohistorical context of the term demonstrates its entanglement with the course of atypical antipsychotic drug development, the expansion of clinical rating scales and wider neoliberal biopolitics within healthcare. Within psychiatry, the early intervention model has been termed a 'paradigm shift,' with the promise that earlier interventions will translate into shorter durations of untreated illness, improved utilisation of services and better prognoses for recovery. While these are laudable goals, they are tied to assumptions about biomedical progress and idealisations of clinical populations that feminist and disability critiques problematise."}, {"Title": "Bipolar Disorder and Heart Transplantation: A Case Report.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent mood disease that includes symptoms that fluctuate from euphoria to depression.

Data on dispensed prescriptions of AEDs were collected from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and linked to diagnosis data from the National Patient Register covering all in- and outpatient consultations from Swedish hospitals. Children aged 0-17 years who had received at least one prescription for AEDs were selected. We calculated proportions of patients stratified by indication, sex and type of AED. A total of 18,131 patients (mean age 9.5 years, 50% boys) were initiated on AED treatment between January 2007 and December 2014. Epilepsy was the most frequent diagnosis (46%) recorded within the year prior to the first AED dispensing. Psychiatric and pain diagnoses were more common in girls (sex distribution 70/30 and 59/41, respectively). In epilepsy, the most frequently initiated AED was valproic acid in boys and lamotrigine in girls. Lamotrigine was the most frequently initiated drug in psychiatry, in both boys and girls. This nationwide study provides new knowledge on AED use in children and adolescents. The use of AEDs during the study period was mainly restricted to epilepsy, and the individual AEDs used seems to be in accordance with approved indications. However, the use of AED on non-epilepsy diagnoses, especially pain disorders, raises concerns."}, {"Title": "Individual biological sensitivity to environmental influences: testing the differential susceptibility properties of the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in relation to depressive symptoms and delinquency in two adolescent general samples.", "Abstract": "The gene-environment interaction research field in psychiatry has traditionally been dominated by the diathesis-stress framework, where certain genotypes are assumed to confer increased risk for adverse outcomes in a stressful environment. In later years, theories of differential susceptibility, or biological sensitivity, suggest that candidate genes that interact with environmental events do not exclusively confer a risk for behavioural or psychiatric disorders but rather seem to alter the sensitivity to both positive and negative environmental influences. The present study investigates the susceptibility properties of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR) in relation to depressive symptoms and delinquency in two separate adolescent community samples: n\u00a0=\u00a01457, collected in 2006; and n\u00a0=\u00a0191, collected in 2001. Two-, three-, and four-way interactions between the 5HTTLPR, positive and negative family environment, and sex were found in relation to both depressive symptoms and delinquency. However, the susceptibility properties of the 5HTTLPR were distinctly less pronounced in relation to depressive symptoms. If the assumption that the 5HTTLPR induces differential susceptibility to both positive and negative environmental influences is correct, the previous failures to measure and control for positive environmental factors might be a possible explanation for former inconsistent findings within the research field."}, {"Title": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in the Elderly.", "Abstract": "This article aims to review select applications of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) that have significant relevance in geriatric psychiatry.\nSmall study sizes and parameter variability limit the generalizability of many TMS studies in geriatric patients.

Cognitive impairment, neuropathic pain, and smoking cessation are experimental applications with special significance to the elderly. Cognitive impairment has been researched the most in this population and evidence thus far suggests that TMS has potential therapeutic benefit. There is also evidence to suggest benefit from TMS for neuropathic pain and smoking cessation in working age adults. TMS is consistently reported as a safe and well-tolerated treatment modality with no adverse cognitive side effects.

Most questions were based on the Royal College of Psychiatry's ECT guidelines.\nA total of 85 responses were analyzed from trainees at all 3 levels of core training and from all health boards across Scotland. Almost 90% of trainees felt that their ECT training was sufficient, with more senior trainees rating their training better than those in the first year of training. Trainees who had theoretical teaching before their practical sessions rated their training better than those with purely observational training. Most trainees felt confident delivering ECT under supervision, and nearly 75% of trainees felt confident preparing a patient for ECT. The areas in which trainees felt least confident were in practical aspects such as dosing protocols and electroencephalogram interpretation.\nWhile ECT training and trainee confidence in delivering ECT were generally good, there are variations in trainees' experience that could be addressed by having a standardized ECT training, including theoretical teaching and practical competencies, in line with current guidelines.

In ecology, advances have been made to clearly distinguish resilience definitions based on underlying mechanistic assumptions. Engineering resilience (rebound) is used for describing the ability of subjects to recover from adverse conditions (disturbances), and is the rate of recovery. In contrast, the ecological resilience definition considers a systemic change: when complex systems (including humans) respond to disturbances by reorganizing into a new regime (stable state) where structural and functional aspects have fundamentally changed relative to the prior regime. In this context, resilience is an emergent property of complex systems. We argue that both resilience definitions and uses are appropriate in psychology and psychiatry, but although the differences are subtle, the implications and uses are profoundly different.\nWe borrow from the field of ecology to discuss resilience concepts in the mental health sciences.\nIn psychology and psychiatry, the prevailing view of resilience is adaptation to, coping with, and recovery (engineering resilience) from adverse social and environmental conditions. Ecological resilience may be useful for describing vulnerability, onset, and the irreversibility patterns of mental disorders. We discuss this in the context of bipolar disorder.\nRebound, adaptation, and coping are processes that are subsumed within the broader systemic organization of humans, from which ecological resilience emanates. Discerning resilience concepts in psychology and psychiatry has potential for a mechanistically appropriate contextualization of mental disorders at large. This might contribute to a refinement of theory and contextualize clinical practice within the broader systemic functioning of mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Reliability and Validity of a New Comprehensive Tool for Assessing Challenging Behaviors in Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Korean Comprehensive Scale for the Assessment of Challenging Behavior in Developmental Disorders (K-CSCB).\nIn total, the parents of 189 patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 168 controls completed the K-CSCB, the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).

This paper examines how new constructs such as \"experimental neurosis\" emerged as tools to enable psychiatric comparison across species. From 1923 to 1962, the Cornell \"Behavior Farm\" was a leading interdisciplinary research center pioneering novel techniques to experimentally study nonhuman psychopathology. Led by the psychobiologist Howard Liddell, work at the Behavior Farm formed part of an ambitious program to develop new preventative and therapeutic techniques and bring psychiatry into closer relations with physiology and medicine. At the heart of Liddell's activities were a range of nonhuman animals, including pigs, sheep, goats and dogs, each serving as a proxy for human patients. We examine how Pavlov's conceptualization of 'experimental neurosis' was used by Liddell to facilitate comparison across species and communication between researchers and clinicians. Our close reading of his experimental system demonstrates how unexpected animal behaviors and emotions were transformed into experimental virtues. However, to successfully translate such behaviors from the animal laboratory into the field of human psychopathology, Liddell increasingly reached beyond, and, in effect, redefined, the Pavlovian method to make it compatible and compliant with an ethological approach to the animal laboratory. We show how the resultant Behavior Farm served as a productive \"hybrid\" place, containing elements of experiment and observation, laboratory and field. It was through the building of close and more naturalistic relationships with animals over extended periods of time, both normal and pathological, and within and outside of the experimental space, that Liddell could understand, manage, and make useful the myriad behavioral complexities that emerged from the life histories of experimental animals, the researchers who worked with them, and their shared relationships to the wider physical and social environments."}, {"Title": "Depressive residual symptoms are associated with illness course characteristics in a sample of outpatients with bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Rates of 50-70% of residual symptoms referring to subsyndromal manifestations between episodes that do not meet the required criteria for episode definition were reported in bipolar disorder (BD).

Although it drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme. Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we investigated a brain network of anxiety shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an anxiety-related brain network derived from whole brain. We first conducted the anxiety provocation task with healthy participants who tended to feel anxiety related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in their daily life. We found a common state anxiety brain network across participants (1585 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants' behavioral trait anxiety scale scores (879 participants from the Human Connectome Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety shared the same brain network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the brain network between common to state and trait anxiety could detect patients with OCD, which is characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that different dimensions of anxiety have a substantial biological inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the perspective of anxiety."}, {"Title": "Geographic Clustering of Admissions to Inpatient Psychiatry among Adults with Cognitive Disorders in Ontario, Canada: Does Distance to Hospital Matter?", "Abstract": "This study examined relationships among hospital accessibility, socio-economic context, and geographic clustering of inpatient psychiatry admissions for adults with cognitive disorders in Ontario, Canada.\nA retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted using admissions data from 71 hospitals with inpatient psychiatry beds in Ontario, Canada between 2011 and 2014. Data included 7,637 unique admissions for 4,550 adults with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic and other Cognitive Disorders. Bayesian spatial Poisson regression was employed to examine the relationship between accessibility of general hospitals with psychiatric beds and psychiatric hospitals, area-level marginalization, and hospitalization rate with the risk of admission to inpatient psychiatry among adults with cognitive disorders across 516 Forward Sortation Areas (FSA) in Ontario.\nResidential instability and the overall hospitalization rate were significantly associated with an increase in the relative risk of admissions to inpatient psychiatry. Accessibility to general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals were marginally insignificant at the 95% credible interval in the final model. Significant geographic clustering of admissions was identified where individuals residing in FSA's with the highest relative risk were 2.0 to 7.1 times more likely to be admitted to inpatient psychiatry compared to the average.\nGeographic clustering of inpatient psychiatry admissions for adults with cognitive disorders exists across the Province of Ontario, Canada. At the geographic level, the risk of admission was positively associated with residential instability and the overall hospitalization rate, but not distance to the closest general or psychiatric hospital."}, {"Title": "Housing environment influences stress-related hippocampal substrates and depression-like behavior.", "Abstract": "Rats are widely used animal models for biological psychiatry and neuroscience. Laboratory rats are typically housed in impoverished sensory environments. The lack of species-typical sensory environment might radically change the response of individual animals to stressful and/or threatening episodes. In this report, we demonstrate that behavioral and neural sequelae of chronic stress were modified by sensory environment of adult male rats. This includes effects of stress on the density of spines on CA3 hippocampal neurons, hippocampal neurogenesis and abundance of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors. Enrichment also reduced depression-like behavior in a forced swim task. Stress and sensory enrichment evoked opposing effects on all the above endpoints. The sensory enrichment used in this report is of a relatively short duration provided during adulthood. This period excludes critical windows of greater plasticity during pre- and peripubertal stages. Our results suggest that standard housing practices for laboratory rats remain austere concerning sensory requirements of this species. Thus, even a moderate sensory enrichment is capable of reducing high stress-sensitivity and depressive-like behavior in standard laboratory rats."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Spanish and Catalan versions of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA).", "Abstract": "Outcome measurement in outpatient and day-care mental health facilities for children and adolescents in Spain remains limited, in part due to a lack of validated scales. To address this issue, we translated HoNOSCA (glossary, score sheet, self-rated questionnaire, and parent/legal guardian questionnaire) into Spanish and Catalan using a reverse translation approach. We ascertained the validity and psychometric quality of the HoNOSCA in Spanish by assessing correlation with the Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS). We recruited 64 participants 7-17 years of age in five day-care Psychiatry hospitals in Catalonia (Spain). Two evaluators administered both instruments twice, two weeks apart. Patients and parents/legal guardians completed the corresponding HoNOSCA versions. We calculated Cronbach's alpha for assessing internal consistency, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) for inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and Pearson's correlation coefficients for validity. We found that all HoNOSCA versions in Spanish presented satisfactory internal consistency, inter-rater and test-retest reliability. Concurrent validity for HoNOSCA-Glossary was also acceptable, with Pearson's coefficients of -0.543 and -0.519 for evaluators in the first administration, and of -0.675 and -0.685 in the second administration.

Here, we used a machine learning algorithm applied to natural speech to ask whether language properties measured before psilocybin for treatment-resistant can predict for which patients it will be effective and for which it will not.\nA baseline autobiographical memory interview was conducted and transcribed. Patients with treatment-resistant depression received 2 doses of psilocybin, 10\u202fmg and 25\u202fmg, 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided before, during and after all dosing sessions. Quantitative speech measures were applied to the interview data from 17 patients and 18 untreated age-matched healthy control subjects. A machine learning algorithm was used to classify between controls and patients and predict treatment response.\nSpeech analytics and machine learning successfully differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls and identified treatment responders from non-responders with a significant level of 85% of accuracy (75% precision).\nAutomatic natural language analysis was used to predict effective response to treatment with psilocybin, suggesting that these tools offer a highly cost-effective facility for screening individuals for treatment suitability and sensitivity.\nThe sample size was small and replication is required to strengthen inferences on these results."}, {"Title": "Overview and systematic review of studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the leading causes of disability, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. In addition to being serious mental illnesses, these disorders are associated with considerable systemic physiological dysfunction, including chronic inflammation and elevated oxidative stress. The advent of sophisticated sequencing techniques has led to a growing interest in the potential role of gut microbiota in human health and disease. Advances in this area have transformed our understanding of a number of medical conditions and have generated a new perspective suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in the development and maintenance of brain/mental health. Animal models have demonstrated strong though indirect evidence for a contributory role of intestinal microbiota in psychiatric symptomatology and have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions. We present a systematic review of clinical studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The published literature has a number of limitations; however, the investigations suggest that these disorders are associated with reduced microbial diversity and show global community differences compared to non-psychiatric comparison samples. In some reports, specific microbial taxa were associated with clinical disease characteristics, including physical health, depressive and psychotic symptoms, and sleep, but little information on the functional potential of those community changes. Studies also suggest increased intestinal inflammation and permeability, which may be among the principal mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis impacts systemic physiological functioning. We highlight gaps in the current literature and implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions, and outline future directions for microbiome research in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Progress and challenges in deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "This narrative review summarizes the recent literature on deep brain stimulation for treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder highlighting both progress and challenges of this novel treatment. Common targets of psychiatric deep brain stimulation involve both white matter trajectories (anterior limb of the internal capsule, inferior thalamic peduncle, and medial forebrain bundle) and grey matter subcortical nuclei (nucleus accumbens, nucleus subthalamicus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) each of which have been reported with a relevant beneficial effect on obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The mechanisms of action are only partially understood but increasing evidence points towards network effects involving the prefrontal cortex, the striatum and possibly anxiety-related anatomical structures. Deep brain stimulation is a promising therapeutical technique for otherwise treatment refractory patients, but many major issues are unresolved and thorough investigations are needed. Relevant topics for future investigations include treatment predictors and therapeutical augmentation. An international registry of patients treated with deep brain stimulation could improve our understanding of adverse events and target specific effects.

Our main aim was to examine age-neutrality of the Short Form of the Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-SF; Criterion A) and Personality Inventory for DSM-5-Brief Form (PID-5-BF; Criterion B). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses and more specifically the impact on scale level through differential test functioning (DTF) analyses made clear that the SIPP-SF was more age-neutral (6% DIF, only one of four domains showed DTF) than the PID-5-BF (25% DIF, all four tested domains had DTF) in a community sample of older and younger adults. Age differences in convergent validity also point in the direction of differences in underlying constructs. Concurrent and criterion validity in geriatric psychiatry inpatients suggest that both the SIPP-SF scales measuring levels of personality functioning (especially self-functioning) and the PID-5-BF might be useful screening measures in older adults despite age-neutrality not being confirmed."}, {"Title": "Toward valid and reliable brain imaging results in eating disorders.", "Abstract": "Human brain imaging can help improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying brain function and how they drive behavior in health and disease. Such knowledge may eventually help us to devise better treatments for psychiatric disorders. However, the brain imaging literature in psychiatry and especially eating disorders has been inconsistent, and studies are often difficult to replicate. The extent or severity of extremes of eating and state of illness, which are often associated with differences in, for instance hormonal status, comorbidity, and medication use, commonly differ between studies and likely add to variation across study results. Those effects are in addition to the well-described problems arising from differences in task designs, data quality control procedures, image data preprocessing and analysis or statistical thresholds applied across studies. Which of those factors are most relevant to improve reproducibility is still a question for debate and further research. Here we propose guidelines for brain imaging research in eating disorders to acquire valid results that are more reliable and clinically useful."}, {"Title": "The EFPA Test-Review Model: When Good Intentions Meet a Methodological Thought Disorder.", "Abstract": "The European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) has issued sets of test standards and guidelines for psychometric test reviews without any attempt to address the critical content of many substantive publications by measurement experts such as Joel Michell. For example, he has argued that the psychometric test-theory which underpins classical and modern IRT psychometrics is \"pathological\", with the entire profession of psychometricians suffering from a methodological thought disorder. With the advent of new kinds of assessment now being created by the \"Next Generation\" of psychologists which no longer conform to the item-based, statistical test theory generated last century, a new framework is set out for constructing evidence-bases suitable for these \"Next Generation\" of assessments, which avoids the illusory beliefs of equal-interval or quantitatively structured psychological attributes. Finally, with no systematic or <i>substantive</i> refutations of the logic, axioms, and evidence set out by Michell and others; it is concluded psychologists and their professional associations remain in denial. As with the eventual demise of a similar attempt to maintain the status quo of professional beliefs within forensic clinical psychology and psychiatry during the last century, those following certain EFPA guidelines might now find themselves required to justify their professional beliefs in legal rather than academic environments."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Extreme Sports: Three Case Studies.", "Abstract": "Extreme sports, defined as sporting or adventure activities involving a high degree of risk, have boomed since the 1990s. These types of sports attract men and women who can experience a life-affirming transcendence or \"flow\" as they participate in dangerous activities. Extreme sports also may attract people with a genetic predisposition for risk, risk-seeking personality traits, or underlying psychiatric disorders in which impulsivity and risk taking are integral to the underlying problem. In this report, we attempt to illustrate through case histories the motivations that lead people to repeatedly risk their lives and explore psychiatry's role in extreme sports. A sports psychiatrist can help with therapeutic management, neuromodulation of any comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and performance enhancement (eg, risk minimization) to cultivate improved judgment which could include identifying alternative safer recreational options.

In particular in psychiatry it is greatly needed given the huge societal costs of psychiatric disorders and given the long time needed to observe benefit from treatments and the response variability. The future will be based on biological determinants, however until such an interesting but still futuristic aim will be reached, at present we may only rely on clinical features to guide our individualized prescription which is currently still frequently based on personal opinion and subjective previous experiences. The aim of this review is to offer an overview of the main aspects to take into consideration when prescribing an antidepressant treatment to reach the best precision medicine using clinical information. More than 40 compounds are available for treating depression and a similar amount of compounds for other psychiatric disorders. The process of matching the profile of the patient with all different profiles of available compounds is therefore quite complex. Our everyday prescribing procedure should take into consideration a number of factors such as the knowledge of the profile of available compounds versus the symptomatology profile of the subject, previous efficacy, medical comorbidities, tolerability profile, individual preferences, and family history. While we are waiting more complex algorithms including biological or genetic measures, it is possible to optimize our current prescription practice by using all available information in order to obtain as much as possible an evidence based precision medicine prescription."}, {"Title": "How medical technologies shape the experience of illness.", "Abstract": "In this article we explore how diagnostic and therapeutic technologies shape the lived experiences of illness for patients. By analysing a wide range of examples, we identify six ways that technology can (trans)form the experience of illness (and health). First, technology may create awareness of disease by revealing asymptomatic signs or markers (imaging techniques, blood tests). Second, the technology can reveal risk factors for developing diseases (e.g., high blood pressure or genetic tests that reveal risks of falling ill in the future). Third, the technology can affect and change an already present illness experience (e.g., the way blood sugar measurement affects the perceived symptoms of diabetes). Fourth, therapeutic technologies may redefine our experiences of a certain condition as diseased rather than unfortunate (e.g. assisted reproductive technologies or symptom based diagnoses in psychiatry). Fifth, technology influences illness experiences through altering social-cultural norms and values regarding various diagnoses. Sixth, technology influences and changes our experiences of being healthy in contrast and relation to being diseased and ill. This typology of how technology forms illness and related conditions calls for reflection regarding the phenomenology of technology and health. How are medical technologies and their outcomes perceived and understood by patients? The phenomenological way of approaching illness as a lived, bodily being-in-the-world is an important approach for better understanding and evaluating the effects that medical technologies may have on our health, not only in defining, diagnosing, or treating diseases, but also in making us feel more vulnerable and less healthy in different regards."}, {"Title": "Open Notes in Swedish Psychiatric Care (Part 1): Survey Among Psychiatric Care Professionals.", "Abstract": "When the Swedish version of Open Notes, an electronic health record (EHR) service that allows patients online access, was introduced in hospitals, primary care, and specialized care in 2012, psychiatric care was exempt. This was because psychiatric notes were considered too sensitive for patient access. However, as the first region in Sweden, Region Sk\u00e5ne added adult psychiatry to its Open Notes service in 2015. This made it possible to carry out a unique baseline study to investigate how different health care professionals (HCPs) in adult psychiatric care in the region expect Open Notes to impact their patients and their practice. This is the first of two papers about the implementation of Open Notes in adult psychiatric care in Region Sk\u00e5ne.\nThe objective of this study was to describe, compare, and discuss how different HCPs in adult psychiatric care in Region Sk\u00e5ne expect Open Notes to impact their patients and their own practice.\nA full population Web-based questionnaire was distributed to psychiatric care professionals in Region Sk\u00e5ne in late 2015. The response rate was 28.86% (871/3017). Analyses show that the respondents were representative of the staff as a whole. A statistical analysis examined the relationships between different professionals and attitudes to the Open Notes service.\nThe results show that the psychiatric HCPs are generally of the opinion that the service would affect their own practice and their patients negatively. The most striking result was that more than 60% of both doctors (80/132, 60.6%) and psychologists (55/90, 61%) were concerned that they would be less candid in their documentation in the future.\nOpen Notes can increase the transparency between patients and psychiatric HCPs because patients are able to access their EHRs online without delay and thus, can read notes that have not yet been approved by the responsible HCP. This may be one explanation as to why HCPs are concerned that the service will affect both their own work and their patients."}, {"Title": "Conceptual endophenotypes: A strategy to advance the impact of psychoneuroendocrinology in precision medicine.", "Abstract": "Psychobiological research has generated a tremendous amount of findings on the psychological, neuroendocrine, molecular and environmental processes that are directly relevant for mental and physical health, but have overwhelmed our capacity to meaningfully absorb, integrate, and utilize this knowledge base. Here, we reflect about suitable strategies to improve the translational success of psychoneuroendocrinological research in the era of precision medicine. Following a strategy advocated by the National Research Council and the tradition of endophenotype-based research, we advance here a new approach, termed \"conceptual endophenotypes\". We define the contextual and formal criteria of conceptual endophenotypes, outline criteria for filtering and selecting information, and describe how conceptual endophenotypes can be validated and implemented at the bedside. As proof-of-concept, we describe some of our findings from research that has adopted this approach in the context of stress-related disorders. We argue that conceptual endophenotypes engineer a bridge between the bench and the bedside. This approach readily lends itself to being continuously developed and implemented. Recent methodological advances, including digital phenotyping, machine learning, grassroots collaboration, and a learning healthcare system, may accelerate the development and implementation of this conceptual endophenotype approach."}, {"Title": "Computer aided sentiment analysis of anorexia nervosa patients' vocabulary.", "Abstract": "Diagnosing and treating anorexia nervosa is an important challenge for modern psychiatry. Taking into account a connection between the mental state of a person and the characteristics of their language, this paper presents developed and tested method for analyzing the written statements of patients with anorexia nervosa and healthy individuals, including the identification of keywords.\nDue to the short nature of the texts, which is related to the difficulty of expressing oneself about one's body when suffering from anorexia, the bag of words approach was used for documents' information representation. The document is represented as a vector, where its various elements indicate the number of individual words. Then, a rule-based model was created, where as a collection of rules, dictionary files were used corresponding to three groups of positive, negative and neutral sounds for each subcategory. Next in the analyzed texts were searched and counted keywords. Based on the keywords found, each of the documents was categorized into one of the groups in every subcategory.\nIt is possible to indicate a set of characteristics sentiment for every person. Additionally, the results of specific patient could be analyzed in six specific subcategories: self-esteem, acceptance of the assessment of the environment, emotions, autoimmune, functioning of the body and body image.\nThe described analysis indicates the existence of a relationship between the mental state of the author's textual health and the vocabulary he or she uses.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders asserts that major depressive disorder (MDD) may present with peripartum onset, without suggesting any other differences between MDD and PPD. The absence of any distinct features calls into question the nosologic validity of PPD as a diagnostic category. The present study investigates whether symptom profiles differ between PPD and depression occurring outside the postpartum phase.\nIn a prospective, longitudinal study of parturient women (N\u00a0=\u00a0239), we examine the manifestation of depression symptoms. We assess factor structure of symptom profiles, and whether factors are differentially pronounced during and after the postpartum period.\nFactors were revealed representing: Worry, Emotional/Circadian/Energetic Dysregulation, Somatic/Cognitive, Appetite, Distress Display, and Anger symptoms. The factor structure was validated at postpartum and after-postpartum timepoints. Interestingly, the Worry factor, comprising anxiety and guilt, was significantly more pronounced during the postpartum timepoint, and the Emotional/Circadian/Energetic Dysregulation factor, which contained sadness and anhedonia, was significantly less pronounced during the postpartum period.\nThese results suggest that PPD may be a unique syndrome, necessitating research, diagnosis, and treatment strategies distinct from those for MDD. Results indicate the possibility that Worry is an enhanced feature of PPD compared to depression outside the postpartum period, and the crucial role of sadness/anhedonia in MDD diagnosis may be less applicable to PPD diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Assessing Correlation of Residency Applicants' Interview Dates With Likelihood of Matching.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether the timing of an interview relative to the recruitment season was associated with being ranked or matched at an academic medical center.\nEleven specialties (anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, emergency medicine, family medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedic surgery, and psychiatry) that participated in the National Resident Matching Program were included in the study.

Among patients who utilize psychiatric emergency services, a small percentage (\"high utilizers\") contributes a disproportionate share of the total cost, yet little is known about the context of care for these patients. This study employed qualitative methods to identify barriers to and facilitators of reducing use of psychiatric emergency services among high utilizers.\nSemistructured phone interviews were conducted with 31 directors of mental health services and providers of psychiatric emergency services across 22 Veterans Health Administration medical centers. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to guide the interviews to evaluate the context of care for high utilizers. Thematic coding was used to identify barriers to and facilitators of reducing utilization.\nBarriers emerged at the patient level (for example, treatment nonadherence and transiency), provider level (for example, stigma toward high utilizers and lack of expertise and training in the management of psychiatric issues among ED staff), and system level (for example, lack of specialized services to address short- and long-term care needs). Facilitators included recovery-oriented care; interdisciplinary care coordination and case management, with emphasis on the role of psychiatric social workers; and predictive analytics to flag high utilizers.\nThe findings lay the groundwork for the design of novel approaches to care for high utilizers of psychiatric emergency services while limiting provider burnout, managing costs, and optimizing treatment outcomes."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry's Role in Improving the Physical Health of Patients With Serious Mental Illness: A Report From the American Psychiatric Association.", "Abstract": "The American Psychiatric Association Integrated Care Workgroup recently convened an expert panel charged with addressing the role of psychiatry in improving the physical health of persons with serious mental illness.

Clinically, it has often been applied in the United States but rarely in most other countries. A meta-analysis (Van Meter et al., Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, , 72, 1250) claimed that the prevalence of PBD was similar to adults at 1.8% with no difference between the United States and other countries. This conclusion has been highly cited.\nThe heterogeneous nature of the original 12 epidemiological surveys warrants a qualitative analysis, rather than statistical meta-analysis as performed by Van Meter et\u00a0al.

Thus, the meta-analysis and each of the 12 studies (six from the United States; six from other countries) were reexamined.\nMost of the 12 surveys predated the emergence of the PBD hypothesis. The 12 surveys were mainly of adolescents and at times young adults with few prepubertal children. Prevalence rates in the 12 studies suggest a lower rate of bipolar disorder, especially in non-US samples. For example, the Van Meter et\u00a0al. (Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 2011, 72, 1250) meta-analysis chose a rate of 2.8% by summation of adolescent and parent responses in a Dutch survey, however the rate fell to 0% if requiring concordance of adolescent and parent responses. Indeed, it could be argued that four of the non-US studies show 0% rates of PBD.\nRates of PBD were generally substantially lower than 1.8%, particularly in non-US surveys, and if both parent and adolescent reports were required to meet the diagnostic threshold they fell to close to zero.

Although current treatment approaches are effective in reducing acute depressive symptoms, rates of relapse are high. Chronic and inflexible retrieval of autobiographical memories, and in particular a bias towards negative and overgeneral memories, is a reliable predictor of relapse. This randomised controlled single-blind trial will determine whether a therapist-guided self-help intervention to ameliorate autobiographical memory biases using Memory Flexibility training (MemFlex) will increase the experience of depression-free days, relative to a psychoeducation control condition, in the 12 months following intervention.\nIndividuals (aged 18 and above) with a diagnosis of recurrent MDD will be recruited when remitted from a major depressive episode. Participants will be randomly allocated to complete 4\u2009weeks of a workbook providing either MemFlex training, or psychoeducation on factors that increase risk of relapse.

However, the subcellular distribution of TAAR1 is still unclear, since TAAR1 signal is largely intracellular. <i>In vitro</i>, TAAR1 is activated with nanomolar to micromolar affinity by some endogenous amines, particularly <i>p</i>-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), the latter representing a novel branch of thyroid hormone signaling. In addition, TAAR1 responds to a number of psychoactive drugs, i.e., amphetamines, ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and lisuride. Trace amines have been identified as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, and they are considered as potential neuromodulators. In particular, beta-phenylethylamine and <i>p</i>-tyramine have been reported to modify the release and/or the response to dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA, while evidence of cross-talk between TAAR1 and other aminergic receptors has been provided. Systemic or intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous T1AM produced prolearning and antiamnestic effects, reduced pain threshold, decreased non-REM sleep, and modulated the firing rate of adrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus. However each of these substances may have additional molecular targets, and it is unclear whether their endogenous levels are sufficient to produce significant TAAR1 activation <i>in vivo</i>. TAAR1 knock out mice show a worse performance in anxiety and working memory tests, and they are more prone to develop ethanol addiction. They also show increased locomotor response to amphetamine, and decreased stereotypical responses induced by apomorphine. Notably, human genes for TAARs cluster on chromosome 6 at q23, within a region whose mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For human TAAR1, around 200 non-synonymous and 400 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, but their functional consequences have not been extensively investigated yet. In conclusion, the bulk of evidence points to a significant physiological role of TAAR1 in the modulation of central nervous system function and a potential pharmacological role of TAAR1 agonists in neurology and/or psychiatry. However, the specific effects of TAAR1 stimulation are still controversial, and many crucial issues require further investigation."}, {"Title": "Blood-based biomarkers predicting response to antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common, serious and in some cases, life-threatening condition and affects approximately 350 million people globally.

Promising findings arise from studies investigating inflammatory pathways and immune markers that may identify patients suitable for anti-inflammatory based treatment regimes.

Genetic markers within the serotonergic system may identify patients who are vulnerable because of stressful life events, but evidence for guiding treatment regimes still is inconsistent.

A recent area of growing interest is individual differences in discounting levels, as these may predispose to (or protect from) mental health disorders, addictive behaviors, and other diseases. At the same time, more and more studies have been dedicated to the quantification of individual attitudes towards risk, which have been measured in many clinical and non-clinical populations using closely related techniques. Economists have pointed to interactions between measurements of time preferences and risk preferences that may distort estimations of the discount rate. However, although becoming standard practice in economics, discount rates and risk preferences are rarely measured simultaneously in the same subjects in other fields, and the magnitude of the imposed distortion is unknown in the assessment of individual differences. Here, we show that standard models of temporal discounting -such as a hyperbolic discounting model widely present in the literature which fails to account for risk attitudes in the estimation of discount rates- result in a large and systematic pattern of bias in estimated discounting parameters. This can lead to the spurious attribution of differences in impulsivity between individuals when in fact differences in risk attitudes account for observed behavioral differences. We advance a model which, when applied to standard choice tasks typically used in psychology and neuroscience, provides both a better fit to the data and successfully de-correlates risk and impulsivity parameters.

The final end point of this multilevel latent variable analysis will be standardised assessments that can be developed into clinical tools to help clinicians predict outcomes and select the best intervention for each individual, thereby reducing the burden of mental disorders, and taking psychiatry a step closer towards personalised medicine.\nEthical approval was obtained from Western Institutional Review Board screening protocol #20101611.

Neuromodeling represents a powerful framework for overcoming this translational deadlock, and the development of computational models to solve clinical problems has become a major scientific goal over the last decade, as reflected by the emergence of clinically oriented neuromodeling fields like Computational Psychiatry, Computational Neurology, and Computational Psychosomatics. Generative models of brain physiology and connectivity in the human brain play a key role in this endeavor, striving for computational assays that can be applied to neuroimaging data from individual patients for differential diagnosis and treatment prediction. In this review, we focus on dynamic causal modeling (DCM) and its use for Computational Psychiatry. DCM is a widely used generative modeling framework for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG) data. This article reviews the basic concepts of DCM, revisits examples where it has proven valuable for addressing clinically relevant questions, and critically discusses methodological challenges and recent methodological advances. We conclude this review with a more general discussion of the promises and pitfalls of generative models in Computational Psychiatry and highlight the path that lies ahead of us.

To date, none of the proposed models received strong empirical support. The present study tested common and distinct effects of personal relevance and reward values by de-componenting different stages of perceptual decision making using a drift-diffusion approach. We employed a recently developed associative matching paradigm where participants (N\u2009=\u200940) formed mental associations between five geometric shapes and five labels referring personal relevance in the personal task, or five shape-label pairings with different reward values in the reward task and then performed a matching task by indicating whether a displayed shape-label pairing was correct or incorrect. We found that common effects of personal relevance and monetary reward were manifested in the facilitation of behavioural performance for high personal relevance and high reward value as socially important signals. The differential effects between personal and monetary relevance reflected non-decisional time in a perceptual decision process, and task-specific prioritization of stimuli. Our findings support the parallel processing model (Northoff & Hayes, Biol Psychiatry 69(11):1019-1025, Northoff, Hayes, Biological Psychiatry 69(11):1019-1025, 2011) and suggest that self-specific processing occurs in parallel with high reward processing.

Tremor is a common adverse effect associated with lithium at both therapeutic and toxic serum levels. We present a case of dose-dependent changes in the quality and intensity of a stroke-related, chronic cerebellar tremor with lithium treatment at serum levels within the therapeutic range. On admission, the patient in this case had a baseline fine, postural tremor, which increased in frequency and evolved to include myoclonic jerks once lithium therapy was initiated. Although the patient's serum lithium level was never in the toxic range, his tremor returned to baseline on reduction of his serum lithium level. This case highlights that a pre-existing, baseline tremor may lower the threshold for developing myoclonus. It also suggests that caution may be warranted with lithium therapy in the setting of known cerebellar disease."}, {"Title": "The incidence, psychiatric co-morbidity and pharmacological treatment of severe mental disorders in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Antipsychotic drug use among children and adolescents is increasing, and there is growing concern about off-label use and adverse effects.

Not really: Why network structures block reductionism in psychopathology research.", "Abstract": "In the past decades, reductionism has dominated both research directions and funding policies in clinical psychology and psychiatry. The intense search for the biological basis of mental disorders, however, has not resulted in conclusive reductionist explanations of psychopathology. Recently, network models have been proposed as an alternative framework for the analysis of mental disorders, in which mental disorders arise from the causal interplay between symptoms. In this target article, we show that this conceptualization can help explain why reductionist approaches in psychiatry and clinical psychology are on the wrong track. First, symptom networks preclude the identification of a common cause of symptomatology with a neurobiological condition; in symptom networks, there is no such common cause. Second, symptom network relations depend on the content of mental states and, as such, feature intentionality. Third, the strength of network relations is highly likely to depend partially on cultural and historical contexts as well as external mechanisms in the environment. Taken together, these properties suggest that, if mental disorders are indeed networks of causally related symptoms, reductionist accounts cannot achieve the level of success associated with reductionist disease models in modern medicine. As an alternative strategy, we propose to interpret network structures in terms of D. C. Dennett's (1987) notion of real patterns, and suggest that, instead of being reducible to a biological basis, mental disorders feature biological and psychological factors that are deeply intertwined in feedback loops. This suggests that neither psychological nor biological levels can claim causal or explanatory priority, and that a holistic research strategy is necessary for progress in the study of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Early Intervention in Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a recurrent disorder that affects more than 1% of the world population and usually has its onset during youth. Its chronic course is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, making bipolar disorder one of the main causes of disability among young and working-age people. The implementation of early intervention strategies may help to change the outcome of the illness and avert potentially irreversible harm to patients with bipolar disorder, as early phases may be more responsive to treatment and may need less aggressive therapies. Early intervention in bipolar disorder is gaining momentum. Current evidence emerging from longitudinal studies indicates that parental early-onset bipolar disorder is the most consistent risk factor for bipolar disorder. Longitudinal studies also indicate that a full-blown manic episode is often preceded by a variety of prodromal symptoms, particularly subsyndromal manic symptoms, therefore supporting the existence of an at-risk state in bipolar disorder that could be targeted through early intervention. There are also identifiable risk factors that influence the course of bipolar disorder, some of them potentially modifiable. Valid biomarkers or diagnosis tools to help clinicians identify individuals at high risk of conversion to bipolar disorder are still lacking, although there are some promising early results. Pending more solid evidence on the best treatment strategy in early phases of bipolar disorder, physicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of each intervention. Further studies will provide the evidence needed to finish shaping the concept of early intervention.

To improve our understanding of the development of psychosis, a different approach to psychopathology may be productive. We propose to reconceptualise psychopathology from a network perspective, according to which symptoms act as a dynamic, interconnected system, impacting on each other over time and across diagnostic boundaries to form symptom networks. Adopting this network approach, the Mapping Individual Routes of Risk and Resilience study aims to determine whether characteristics of symptom networks can predict illness course and outcome of early psychotic symptoms.\nThe sample consists of n=100 participants aged 18-35 years, divided into four subgroups (n=4\u00d725) with increasing levels of severity of psychopathology, representing successive stages of clinical progression. Individuals representing the initial stage have a relatively low expression of psychotic experiences (general population), whereas individuals representing the end stage are help seeking and display a psychometric expression of psychosis, putting them at ultra-high risk for transition to psychotic disorder. At baseline and 1-year follow-up, participants report their symptoms, affective states and experiences for three consecutive months in short, daily questionnaires on their smartphone, which will be used to map individual networks. Network parameters, including the strength and directionality of symptom connections and centrality indices, will be estimated and associated to individual differences in and within-individual progression through stages of clinical severity and functioning over the next 3\u2009years.\nThe study has been approved by the local medical ethical committee (ABR no.

In this study, we used effort-based and delay-based decision tasks and showed that ACEA, a potent cannabinoid agonist induced apathetic and impulsive patterns of choice in rats in a dose-dependent manner when locally injected into the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), respectively. Pre-treatment with AM251, a selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist, reversed ACEA-induced impulsive and apathetic patterns of choice in doses higher than a minimally effective dose. Unlike CB1 receptor antagonist, pretreatment with capsazepine, a transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel antagonist, was effective only at an intermediary dose. Furthermore, capsazepine per se induced impulsivity and apathy at a high dose suggesting a basal tonic activation of TRPV1 channels that exist in the ACC and OFC to support cost-benefit decision making and to help avoid apathetic and impulsive patterns of decision making. Taken together, unlike previous reports supporting opposing roles for the CB1 receptors and TRPV1 channels in anxiety and panic behavior, our findings demonstrate a different sort of interaction between endocannabinoid and endovanilloid systems and suggest that both systems contribute to the cognitive disrupting effects of cannabinoids.

Patients with AD displayed lower relative power of high frequency (rHF) HRV and higher relative power of very low frequency (rVLF) HRV compared with HC at baseline. Inversely, the rHF of patients with AD remained higher and their rVLF remained lower compared with HC parameters after the single stress task, which suggests a reversed sympathovagal balance in AD. Mean heart rate and skin conductance increased during stress tasks in patients, although to a lesser extent than in HC. Skin temperature remained unchanged in all tasks in patients with AD. The tension of the frontalis muscle was higher in patients compared with HC from the second stress task onward. Thoracic breathing was more prevalent in patients with AD.

This has particularly been the case for the immune system. As a consequence of its ties with pathology and microbiology, immunology as a discipline has largely grown independently of physiology. Accordingly, it has taken a long time for immunologists to accept the concept that the immune system is not self-regulated but functions in close association with the nervous system. These associations are present at different levels of organization. At the local level, there is clear evidence for the production and use of immune factors by the central nervous system and for the production and use of neuroendocrine mediators by the immune system. Short-range interactions between immune cells and peripheral nerve endings innervating immune organs allow the immune system to recruit local neuronal elements for fine tuning of the immune response. Reciprocally, immune cells and mediators play a regulatory role in the nervous system and participate in the elimination and plasticity of synapses during development as well as in synaptic plasticity at adulthood. At the whole organism level, long-range interactions between immune cells and the central nervous system allow the immune system to engage the rest of the body in the fight against infection from pathogenic microorganisms and permit the nervous system to regulate immune functioning. Alterations in communication pathways between the immune system and the nervous system can account for many pathological conditions that were initially attributed to strict organ dysfunction. This applies in particular to psychiatric disorders and several immune-mediated diseases. This review will show how our understanding of this balance between long-range and short-range interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system has evolved over time, since the first demonstrations of immune influences on brain functions. The necessary complementarity of these two modes of communication will then be discussed. Finally, a few examples will illustrate how dysfunction in these communication pathways results in what was formerly considered in psychiatry and immunology to be strict organ pathologies."}, {"Title": "A dimensional approach to assessing psychiatric risk in adults born very preterm.", "Abstract": "Individuals who were born very preterm have higher rates of psychiatric diagnoses compared with term-born controls; however, it remains unclear whether they also display increased sub-clinical psychiatric symptomatology.

Using both systems in parallel, with their contributions weighted based on performance, should allow us to leverage the best of each system: rapid early learning, supplemented by long-term robust acquisition. However, this assumes that using one process does not interfere with the other. We use computational modeling to investigate the interactions between the two processes in a behavioral experiment and show that working memory interferes with reinforcement learning. Previous research showed that neural representations of reward prediction errors, a key marker of reinforcement learning, were blunted when working memory was used for learning. We thus predicted that arbitrating in favor of working memory to learn faster in simple problems would weaken the reinforcement learning process. We tested this by measuring performance in a delayed testing phase where the use of working memory was impossible, and thus participant choices depended on reinforcement learning. Counterintuitively, but confirming our predictions, we observed that associations learned most easily were retained worse than associations learned slower: Using working memory to learn quickly came at the cost of long-term retention. Computational modeling confirmed that this could only be accounted for by working memory interference in reinforcement learning computations. These results further our understanding of how multiple systems contribute in parallel to human learning and may have important applications for education and computational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric sequelae of corticosteroid use in hematology in Australia: A qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Despite widespread steroid usage for treating hematological conditions, minimal attention focuses on associated psychiatric side-effects. In the present study, we examined hematology patients' experiences of high-dose steroid treatment. This was undertaken by the use of a qualitative, descriptive design, which included convenience sampling and the inductive, cyclic, and constant comparative thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Eighteen patients participated, who were diagnosed with lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, or idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. Four themes emerged: side-effects, misattribution of cause, self-management, and fragmented information. The study results revealed that hematology patients administered steroids can experience negligible to extensive erratic side-effects, with severe adverse repercussions. Psychological reactions to steroids are often misattributed. Patients mostly self-manage adverse effects experienced and receive only fragmented preparatory information, often not understanding steroid side-effects. Nurses could provide helpful \"in the moment\" education for inpatients who misunderstood steroid-related adverse effects, such as aggressive urges. Adverse repercussions for family were occasionally evident. Education, support, and ongoing care for patients experiencing adverse steroid side-effects are inadequate. Health professionals need to develop patient- and family-centered educational resources for potential, unpredictable, and usually adverse steroid side-effects."}, {"Title": "Assessing and addressing cognitive impairment in bipolar disorder: the International Society for Bipolar Disorders Targeting Cognition Task Force recommendations for clinicians.", "Abstract": "Cognition is a new treatment target to aid functional recovery and enhance quality of life for patients with bipolar disorder. The International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Targeting Cognition Task Force aimed to develop consensus-based clinical recommendations on whether, when and how to assess and address cognitive impairment.\nThe task force, consisting of 19 international experts from nine countries, discussed the challenges and recommendations in a face-to-face meeting, telephone conference call and email exchanges. Consensus-based recommendations were achieved through these exchanges with no need for formal consensus methods.\nThe identified questions were: (I) Should cognitive screening assessments be routinely conducted in clinical settings? (II) What are the most feasible screening tools? (III) What are the implications if cognitive impairment is detected? (IV) What are the treatment perspectives? Key recommendations are that clinicians: (I) formally screen cognition in partially or fully remitted patients whenever possible, (II) use brief, easy-to-administer tools such as the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry and Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment, and (III) evaluate the impact of medication and comorbidity, refer patients for comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation when clinically indicated, and encourage patients to build cognitive reserve. Regarding question (IV), there is limited evidence for current evidence-based treatments but intense research efforts are underway to identify new pharmacological and/or psychological cognition treatments.\nThis task force paper provides the first consensus-based recommendations for clinicians on whether, when, and how to assess and address cognition, which may aid patients' functional recovery and improve their quality of life."}, {"Title": "Job-related stress in psychiatric assistant nurses.", "Abstract": "We aimed to clarify how stress among psychiatric assistant nurses (PANs) differed from Registered Nurses (PRNs).\nCross-sectional survey study was conducted with PRNs and PANs working in six psychiatric hospitals in Japan.\nThe Psychiatric Nurse Job Stressor Scale (PNJSS) and the job stressor and stress reaction subscales of the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire measured stress in 68 PANs and 140 PRNs.

So far, however, there are no clear criteria for evaluating the actual competence of the procedure.<br/> AIM: To develop a relational ethical model, including criteria and methodology, which can be used to assess and enhance decision-making competence mainly from a relational and ethical perspective.<br/> METHOD: Combination of a review of the literature and ethical reflection. First of all, a limited study was made of the literature relating to the concept of and criteria for decision-making competence. On the basis of the literature and relational ethical reflection, ten criteria were developed for decision-making competence and a method was devised for assessing the procedure.<br/> RESULTS: The criteria that have to be satisfied can be summarised as follows: the persons involved must understand the information, and must be able to apply it to their own situation. They must be able to gain insight into their own situation and be able to weigh up the available options, and be able to estimate consequences for themselves, as well as for others. They must be able to motivate choices in a sensible and comprehensible manner without being subject to coercive influences coming from internal and external sources. Participants' choices should be motivated on the basis of their own personal values. The decision-making competence is assessed and enhanced by giving a score to the individual criteria and by making an overall evaluation. This is achieved by a dialogue including all the persons involved: the care seeker (as far as possible), close relatives and the care-providers.<br/> CONCLUSION: The persons involved can attain greater objectivity by exchanging views orally on the ten proposed criteria for decision-making competence."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the current state of the art of Huntington disease research: a scientometric analysis.", "Abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant mutation on the 4th chromosome.

Therefore, a quantitative study was performed to examine the current state-of-the-art approaches that foster researchers' understandings of the current knowledge, research trends, and research gaps regarding this disorder. We performed literature searches of articles that were published up to September 2016 in the \"ISI Web of Science\u2122\" (http://apps.webofknowledge.com/). The keyword used was \"Huntington disease\". Of the initial 14,036 articles that were obtained, 7732 were eligible for inclusion in the study according to their relevance. Data were classified according to language, country of publication, year, and area of concentration. The country leader regarding the number of studies published on HD is the United States, accounting for nearly 30% of all publications, followed by England and Germany, who have published 10 and 7% of all publications, respectively. Regarding the language in which the articles were written, 98% of publications were in English. The first publication to be found on HD was published in 1974. A surge of publications on HD can be seen from 1996 onward. In relation to the various knowledge areas that emerged, most publications were in the fields of neuroscience and neurology, likely because HD is a neurodegenerative disorder.

The 40th anniversary of the Italian mental health care reform.", "Abstract": "On 13 May 1978, the Italian Parliament approved Law 180, universally known as 'Basaglia Law' after the name of the leader of the anti-institutional movement which promoted this radical community mental health care reform. Forty years later, Italian psychiatry still runs a community care system, albeit with degrees of solidity and quality very varied along the peninsula. Mental health care is still an integral part of the National Health System, with liberal regulations on coercion and a lowest number of general hospital and residential facilities beds. Recently, Italy has also closed the special forensic psychiatric institutions and brought the care of the mentally ill offenders within the responsibilities of local Mental Health Departments. Over time, psychiatric deinstitutionalisation inspired policies in other sectors of Italian society, such as those regarding physical and intellectual disabilities, education of children with special needs, drug addictions and management of deviant minors. Furthermore, debate about Law 180 has reached and maintained an international dimension, becoming a term of reference for international agencies such as the World Health Organization and the European Commission, for good and for evil. The overall balance sheet of the Reform process would seem mostly positive, though the last decade has seen many threats challenging the system. Mental health care services have been asked to do much more, in terms of care to a larger population with very diversified needs, but with much less resources, due to the financial consequences of the economic crisis. Although there is no evidence of a trend towards re-institutionalisation, intensity and quality of care may have fallen below acceptable standards in some parts of Italy."}, {"Title": "What Are the Psychosocial Factors Associated With Migraine in the Child?

Here we used the lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, to attempt to potentiate the effects of nilotinib against leukemia cells. For this purpose, a K562 leukemia cell line and bone marrow cells from untreated Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients, prior to any exposure to TKIs, were used as a model. Our results demonstrated that the combination of lithium\u202f+\u202fnilotinib (L\u202f+\u202fN) induced K562-cell death and cleaved caspase-3 when compared to lithium or nilotinib alone, accompanied by GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation and Bcr-Abl oncoprotein levels reduction. Interestingly, these events were related to autophagy induction, expressed by increased LC3II protein levels in the group treated with L\u202f+\u202fN. Furthermore, the clonogenic capacity of progenitor cells from CML patients was drastically reduced by L\u202f+\u202fN, as well as lithium and nilotinib when used separately. The number of cell aggregates (clusters), were increased by all treatments (L\u202f+\u202fN, lithium, and nilotinib).

This resulted from a complex conceptual analysis carried out by Spitzer, chair of the committee on nomenclature and statistics. The criteria of harm (distress-disability) arise as main defining characteristics for mental illness, being added that \"there is an inference\" that there is a dysfunction. The distress-disability model was later developed by Wakefield. This author argued that in a medical or psychiatric disorder there had to be a dysfunctional component (value free) and another one of harm (value laden). In this article, we intend to review the emergence and evolution of the definition of mental disorder and the importance that the criteria of distress and disability always had in this definition. This happened until the advent of DSM-5 when these criteria came to play a secondary role."}, {"Title": "[Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and therapy of substance use disorders in general hospital (general section)].", "Abstract": "Substance use disorders are becoming an increasingly significant problem in general hospitals and hence play a key role in consultation- and liaison psychiatry. Diverse psychotropic effects of various substances mimic psychiatric disorders. An alcohol intoxication can present depressive or manic symptoms, a cannabis delirium can present as a psychosis while stimulants use can suggest the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Obtaining dual diagnoses by identifying substance-induced and non-substance-induced psychopathologies is clinically challenging.The aim of this article is to systematically describe the psychopathology, pathophysiology and therapeutic options of substance-use disorders particularly relevant for consultation and liaison psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Association between bullying and pediatric psychiatric hospitalizations.", "Abstract": "Bullying is a serious public health issue. We sought to demonstrate an association between bullying victimization and hospital admissions for acute psychiatric problems. We described the demographics and types of bullying in a sample of hospitalized patients in Staten Island, NY, and compared bullying victimization scores with psychiatric versus medical admissions.\nPatients in grades 3-12 were recruited from the Staten Island University Hospital Inpatient Pediatrics unit and emergency department. Patients completed the validated <i>Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (OBQ)</i> was analyzed to formulate a report of bullying in our sample as well as a sub-score measurement of bullying victimization. Pediatric residents simultaneously documented whether the subject was a medical versus an in-patient psychiatry admission. Statistical analysis was performed to look for an association between the victimization sub-score and a psychiatric indication for admission.\nA total of 185 surveys were analyzed. Peak bullying occurred in 7th and 8th grades. Demographics and types of bullying in our sample were described. A strong association between bullying victimization and hospitalization for in-patient psychiatry was demonstrated. Association between bullying victimization and suicidal ideation, psychiatry, and social work consults was also shown. Concern for an association between hospitalization for psychogenic illness and bullying victimization was also raised.\nThere is a significant association between bullying victimization and psychiatric hospital admissions. This raises the specter of the serious consequences of bullying as it is the first study to prospectively link hospital admissions to bullying. Studies using a valid measure of psychogenic illness to look for an association with bullying victimization are needed."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenomic Testing in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: An Evidence-Based Review.", "Abstract": "Significant advances have been made in the application of pharmacogenomic testing for the treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders. Over the past decade, a number of studies have evaluated the utility of pharmacogenomic testing in pediatric patients with psychiatric disorders. The evidence base for pharmacogenomic testing in youth with depressive and anxiety disorders as well as attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is reviewed in this article. General pharmacogenomic principles are summarized and functional polymorphisms in P450 enzymes (and associated metabolizer phenotypes), the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphisms, serotonin 2A receptor genes (e.g., HT2AR) and catecholamine pathway genes (e.g., COMT) are reviewed. These commonly tested pharmacogenomic markers are discussed with regard to studies of drug levels, efficacy and side effects. The translation of pharmacogenomics to individualized/precision medicine in pediatric patients with ADHD, anxiety and depressive disorders has accelerated; however, its application remains challenging given that there are numerous divergent pathways between medication/medication dose and clinical response and side effects. Nonetheless, by leveraging variations in individual genes that may be relevant to medication metabolism or medication target engagement, pharmacogenomic testing may have a role in predicting treatment response, side effects and medication selection in youth with ADHD, depressive and anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Catatonia Under-Diagnosis in the General Hospital.", "Abstract": "Catatonia is under-diagnosed in psychiatric settings. No studies have explored the under-diagnosis of catatonia in general hospitals. The authors conducted a retrospective chart review using DSM-5 criteria to diagnose catatonia in medical inpatients between 2011 and 2013. Of 133 case subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for catatonia retrospectively, 79 had never been diagnosed and 54 had a documented diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression revealed that psychiatry consultation significantly decreased the odds of under-diagnosis of catatonia, whereas presence of agitation, grimacing, or echolalia increased the likelihood of under-diagnosis. Under-diagnosed case subjects received significantly lower doses of lorazepam, and increased mortality during admission and increased length of hospital stay both fell short of statistical significance in this group. Catatonia appears to be frequently under-diagnosed in the general hospital, and psychiatry consultation services play a crucial role in its detection and treatment. Strategies to improve recognition and treatment of catatonia should be implemented."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal Association of Amyloid Beta and Anxious-Depressive Symptoms in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.", "Abstract": "To understand the role of depressive symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to define their temporal relationship to Alzheimer's proteinopathies in cognitively normal older adults. The study objective was to examine associations of brain amyloid beta and longitudinal measures of depression and depressive symptom clusters in a cognitively normal sample of older adults.\nA total of 270 community-dwelling, cognitively normal elderly individuals underwent baseline Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) measures of cortical aggregate amyloid beta and annual assessments with the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The authors evaluated continuous PiB binding as a predictor of GDS score or GDS cluster, calculated as total scores and mean scores for three GDS item clusters (apathy-anhedonia, dysphoria, and anxiety-concentration), across time (1-5 years; mean=3.8 years) in separate mixed-effects models with backward elimination. Initial predictors included PiB binding, age, sex, Hollingshead score, American National Adult Reading Test (AMNART) score, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status, depression history, and their interactions with time.\nHigher PiB binding predicted accelerated rates of increase in GDS score over time, adjusting for depression history. Higher PiB binding also predicted steeper rates of increase for anxiety-concentration scores, adjusting for depression history and the AMNART score-by-time interaction. In a post hoc model estimating anxiety scores without concentration disturbance items, the PiB binding-by-time interaction remained significant.\nHigher amyloid beta burden was associated with increasing anxious-depressive symptoms over time in cognitively normal older individuals. Prior depression history was related to higher but not worsening symptom ratings. These results suggest a direct or indirect association of elevated amyloid beta levels with worsening anxious-depressive symptoms and support the hypothesis that emerging neuropsychiatric symptoms represent an early manifestation of preclinical Alzheimer's disease."}, {"Title": "Readmission in psychiatry inpatients within a year of discharge: The role of symptoms at discharge and post-discharge care in a Brazilian sample.", "Abstract": "Readmission into inpatient psychiatric beds is a useful outcome for patients, care providers, and policymakers. This study aims to investigate the role of level of symptoms at discharge and type of post-discharge care in determining readmissions after a year before a psychiatric admission.\nWe performed a prospective and observational study in a general hospital psychiatric facility. Patients were assessed at admission, discharge, and one year after discharge. We used a multivariable logistic regression to determine predictors of readmission.\nIn total, 488 patients were included at admission, and 401 (82,17%) were accessed in the follow-up period. Psychiatric readmissions occurred in 29.17% of the followed patients. The number of previous admissions represents a 38% higher chance of being readmitted (OR 1.38; CI 1.16-1.60). For patients admitted in a depressive episode, not being in remission at discharge increases 140% the chance to be readmitted (OR 2.40; CI 1.14-5.07) as well as the follow-up at primary (OR 5.27; CI 1.06-26.15). For those with Schizophrenia and related disorders, higher scores in BPRS at discharge increases the chance to be readmitted (OR 1.28, CI 1.11-1.48).\nLevel of symptoms at discharge was related to higher chance to be readmitted in patients admitted in a depressive episode and those with schizophrenia and related disorders. Findings of the type of care raise the need for further investigation.

Studies across multiple health care settings demonstrate that those with a known PD have higher incidences of health problems, higher utilization of the health care system, and have a life expectancy 17.7\u00a0years less than that of the population in general. Despite these data, little attention has been directed toward detecting, managing, and treating patients with personality pathology in primary care settings. Consequently, it is argued that more attention be devoted to detecting PDs in this population, training physicians and primary care professionals in the rapid screening of personality pathology, the management of patients with personality pathology, and utilizing behavioral health specialists and reliable referral sources to address these problems as part of their overall health care management. Suggestions for how to implement these ideas are offered."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric diagnoses and their influencing factors in patients complaining of sleep problems: A study of a psychiatric consultation-liaison service.", "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to identify misdiagnosed or undiagnosed psychiatric disorders and the factors associated with these disorders in patients with sleep problems who are referred to a consultation-liaison service. Method Records of all inpatients receiving a consultation from the Psychiatry Department between January and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Psychiatric diagnoses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the factors associated with the risk of these disorders in patients with sleep problems were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 331 referral patients whose referral reason was simply having trouble in sleeping, only 97 patients were diagnosed with primary sleep disorder after consultation. The recognition rate of psychiatric disorders in inpatients with sleep problems among nonpsychiatric physicians was 29.3%. Anxiety (107, 45.7%) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis in patients with sleep problems followed by organic mental disorder (83, 35.5%), depression (37, 15.8%), and other mental disorders (8, 3.4%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a course >1 month (OR\u2009=\u20093.656, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.171-6.156, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and sleep-wake rhythm disturbances (OR\u2009=\u200925.008, 95% CI\u2009=\u20095.826-107.341, p\u2009=\u20090.000) were associated with increased risks of psychiatric disorders. Conclusions The study showed that recognition rate of psychiatric disorders in inpatients with sleep problems was very low.

The modern DSM has relied on a consensus of experts to define categorical syndromes based on clusters of symptoms and signs, and, to some extent, external validators, such as longitudinal course and response to treatment. In the absence of an established etiology, psychiatry has struggled to validate these descriptive syndromes, and to define the boundaries between disorders and between normal and pathologic variation. Recent advances in genomic research, coupled with large-scale collaborative efforts like the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, have identified hundreds of common and rare genetic variations that contribute to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. At the same time, they have begun to address deeper questions about the structure and classification of mental disorders: To what extent do genetic findings support or challenge our clinical nosology? Are there genetic boundaries between psychiatric and neurologic illness? Do the data support a boundary between disorder and normal variation? Is it possible to envision a nosology based on genetically informed disease mechanisms? This review provides an overview of conceptual issues and genetic findings that bear on the relationships among and boundaries between psychiatric disorders and other conditions.

We recruited 200 detainees undergoing forensic psychiatric evaluation and 390 general psychiatric patients at discharge. At baseline, they were asked about violent ideation; at the 20-week follow-up, information about violent acts was gathered from crime conviction registry, interviews, and records. The lifetime prevalence of violent ideation was 32.5% for offenders and 35.6% for patients; the corresponding two-month prevalence was 22.5% and 21.0%, respectively. For the both samples combined, those with violent ideation in their lifetime were significantly more prone to commit violent acts during follow-up than those without such ideation, OR = 2.65. The same applied to the patient sample, OR = 3.41. In terms of positive predictive values, fewer than 25% of those with violent ideation committed violent acts. Contrary to our hypothesis, the prevalence of violent ideation did not differ significantly between offenders and patients.

Although life expectancy for people with ID is increasing, people with ID coexisting with epilepsy have a higher mortality rate, particularly those who had recent seizures. There have been few observational studies of the prevalence and patterns of anti-epileptic prescribing among older people with ID and epilepsy. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalence and patterns of anti-epileptic prescribing in the treatment of epilepsy in a representative population of older people with ID and epilepsy.\nThis was an observational cross-sectional study from wave 1 (2009/2010) of Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging, a nationally representative sample of 753 persons with ID aged between 41 and 90\u00a0years. Participants and/or proxies recorded medicines used on a regular basis and reported doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy; medication data were available for 736 (98%). Prescribing of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) for epilepsy in those with a doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy (N\u00a0=\u00a0205) was the primary exposure of interest for this study. Participant exposure to these AEDs was then categorised into AED monotherapy and polytherapy. Participants/carers reported seizure frequency, when epilepsy was last reviewed and which practitioner reviewed epilepsy. In addition, medications that may lower the seizure threshold that were listed in the Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry were examined.\nOf the 736 participants with reported medicines use, 38.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a0287) were exposed to AEDs, and 30.6% (225) had a doctor's diagnosis of epilepsy. Of those with epilepsy (n\u00a0=\u00a0225), 90.9% (n\u00a0=\u00a0205) reported concurrent use of AEDs and epilepsy. Of these 205 participants, 50.3% (n\u00a0=\u00a0103) were exposed to AED polytherapy, and 63 different polytherapy regimes were reported. The most frequently reported AEDs were valproic acid (n\u00a0=\u00a0100, 48.7%), carbamazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a089, 46.3%) and lamotrigine (n\u00a0=\u00a057, 27.8%). In total, 13.7% had a concurrent psychotropic, which should be avoided in epilepsy, and 32.6% had a psychotropic where caution is required. Antipsychotics with potential epileptogenic potential accounted for 80% of these medications. Of those with AED polytherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a0103), 29.5% (28) reported being seizure free for the previous 2\u00a0years.\nPrevalence of epilepsy was high among older people with ID, and half were exposed to two or more AEDs. Despite the use of AED therapy, over half had seizures in the previous 2\u00a0years. As the primary goals of optimal AED treatment are to achieve seizure freedom without unacceptable adverse effects, this was not achievable for many older patients with ID and epilepsy. Our findings indicated that people with ID and epilepsy were often exposed to psychotropic medications that may lower the seizure threshold. Regular review of epilepsy and medicines (including medicines that may interact with AEDs or lower the seizure threshold) by multidisciplinary teams working to agreed standards may improve quality of prescribing. Improved exchange of information and coordination of care between specialists and primary care practitioners in line with expert consensus recommendations could bring substantial benefit."}, {"Title": "Associability-modulated loss learning is increased in posttraumatic stress disorder.", "Abstract": "Disproportionate reactions to unexpected stimuli in the environment are a cardinal symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we test whether these heightened responses are associated with disruptions in distinct components of reinforcement learning. Specifically, using functional neuroimaging, a loss-learning task, and a computational model-based approach, we assessed the mechanistic hypothesis that overreactions to stimuli in PTSD arise from anomalous gating of attention during learning (i.e., associability). Behavioral choices of combat-deployed veterans with and without PTSD were fit to a reinforcement learning model, generating trial-by-trial prediction errors (signaling unexpected outcomes) and associability values (signaling attention allocation to the unexpected outcomes). Neural substrates of associability value and behavioral parameter estimates of associability updating, but not prediction error, increased with PTSD during loss learning. Moreover, the interaction of PTSD severity with neural markers of associability value predicted behavioral choices. These results indicate that increased attention-based learning may underlie aspects of PTSD and suggest potential neuromechanistic treatment targets."}, {"Title": "In honor of Jurgen Ruesch: Remembering his work in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In a highly technical civilization like ours, in which the interest in human communication transcends academic barriers and clinical practice, it seems necessary to look back to Ruesch's work in psychiatry. The main reason of it rests upon the idea that he was one of the few truly outstanding clinicians, researchers, and theoretical in the field of normal and abnormal communication. In fact, he did not only present a wealth of observational and clinical data; more importantly, he used these data to formulate creative hypotheses about the conflict between man and other human beings.\nThe main purpose of this article is to pay tribute to Dr. Jurgen Ruesch (1909-1995), distinguished psychiatrist, communications experts and psychotherapist. For that reason, here we want to pay tribute to the enormous value of his work for the promotion of mental health and the clinical assessment of normal and pathological communication behavior.\nIn working out his theoretical stance toward communication, all Ruesch's works here have been reviewed. In line with this, the author also mentions similarities between Ruesch and other psychiatric/psychotherapeutic authors. Also similarities have been established between Ruesch and Frank on \"non specific factors in psychotherapy\", and tensions within contemporary training of psychiatrists, almost predicted by Ruesch.\nWhile some of Ruesch's ideas about the nature and origins of communication has been discounted, many of his preoccupations are now part of the mainstream, and it is to here that we should look for evidence of his legacy. In fact, he has been the author of rich and fruitful ideas, which are essential to clinical understanding of mental diseases and their treatments. It is not surprising, therefore, that Ruesch's burning interest in the clinical assessment of normal and pathological communicative behavior finds a significant echo in today's proliferation of books, papers, and conferences on communication.

As a small ion, lithium is omnipresent, and consequently, its molecular mechanisms and targets are widespread. Currently, lithium is a crucial pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute mood episodes, prophylactic therapy, and suicide prevention in BD. Besides, lithium blood level is the most widely used biomarker in clinical psychiatry. The concept of stress in BD characterizes short- and long-term deleterious effects at multiple levels (from genes to behaviors) and the ability to establish homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to either prevent or reverse these effects. Within this concept, lithium has consistently shown anti-stress effects, by normalizing components across several levels associated with BD-induced impairments in cellular resilience and plasticity.\nA literature search for biomarkers associated with lithium effects at multiple targets, with a particular focus on those related to clinical outcomes was performed. An extensive search of the published literature using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar was performed. Example search terms included lithium, plasticity, stress, efficacy, and neuroimaging. Articles determined by the author to focus on lithium's impact on neural plasticity markers (central and periphery) and clinical outcomes were examined in greater depth. Relevant papers were evaluated, selected and included in this review.\nLithium induces neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in a wide range of preclinical and translational models. Lithium's neurotrophic effects are related to the enhancement of cellular proliferation, differentiation, growth, and regeneration, whereas its neuroprotective effects limit the progression of neuronal atrophy or cell death following the onset of BD. Lithium's neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects seem most pronounced in the presence of pathology, which again supports its pivotal role as an active homeostatic regulator.\nFew studies associated with clinical outcomes. Due to space limitations, the author was unable to detail all findings, in special those originated from preclinical studies.\nThese results support a potential role for biomarkers involved in neuroprotection and activation of plasticity pathways in lithium's clinical response. Evidence supporting this model comes from results evaluating macroscopic and microscopic brain structure as well neurochemical findings in vivo from cellular to sub-synaptic (molecules and intracellular signaling) compartments using central and peripheral biomarkers. Challenges to precisely decipher lithium's biological mechanisms involved in its therapeutic profile include the complex nature of the illness and clinical subtypes, family history and comorbid conditions. In the context of personalized medicine, it is necessary to validate predictive biomarkers of response to lithium by designing longitudinal clinical studies during mood episodes and associated clinical dimensions in BD."}, {"Title": "The therapeutic discharge II: An approach to documentation in the setting of feigned suicidal ideation.", "Abstract": "The therapeutic discharge of patients assessed as misrepresenting suicidal ideation, though in the best interests of the patient, physician, and health care system, is an inherently risk-assuming action.

The history of present illness follows the sequence, rather than the re-organization of the information obtained. The past medical history requires and reflects a more granular chart review than is usually warranted. The mental status exam is less cross-sectional than usual. The assessment and plan incorporates several components that reflect a reasoning process specific to the therapeutic discharge.\nWhile labor-intensive, the documentation approach advocated for and exemplified here reaffirms aspects of one's identity as a physician, ensures responsible execution of a risk-involving decision, and potentially simplifies subsequent patient encounters."}, {"Title": "[Professional identity of Hungarian psychiatrist.

The complexity of psychiatry in biological, psychological and sociological aspects is a typical instance of the necessity for integration.\nBased on the bio-psycho-social dimensions and on their opinion about acceptance of psychiatry, we explored the professional identities of physicians working in Hungarian contemporary psychiatry.\nVoluntary, anonymous responses were collected by using a 10-point evaluation scale on professional attitude, appreciation of psychiatry from lay society and other medical professions, and the importance of biology, psychology and sociology within psychiatry.\nThe 228 respondents showed a highly significant effect of basic sciences: biology was the most relevant followed by psychology and sociology. Specialists in psychiatry (n = 171) showed a more marked preference for biology than the trainees, while specialists in psychotherapy (n = 74) considered the psychological component significantly more important than other respondents. The public acceptance of psychiatry was low as compared with other medical professions.\nThe consistency between self-image and profession shows that the multidimensionality of psychiatry is not primarily an individual challenge.

Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these symptoms and syndromes vary substantially across and within medical specialties from biomedicine to psychiatry. Patients may become frustrated with the lack of effective treatment, doctors may experience these disorders as difficult to treat, and this type of health problem forms an important component of the global burden of disease. This review intends to develop a unifying perspective on the understanding and management of FSS and bodily distress. Firstly, we present the clinical problem and review current concepts for classification. Secondly, we propose an integrated etiological model which encompasses a wide range of biopsychosocial vulnerability and triggering factors and considers consecutive aggravating and maintaining factors. Thirdly, we systematically scrutinize the current evidence base in terms of an umbrella review of systematic reviews from 2007 to 2017 and give recommendations for treatment for all levels of care, concentrating on developments over the last 10 years. We conclude that activating, patient-involving, and centrally acting therapies appear to be more effective than passive ones that primarily act on peripheral physiology, and we recommend stepped care approaches that translate a truly biopsychosocial approach into actual management of the patient."}, {"Title": "Gender differences in C-reactive protein and homocysteine modulation of cognitive performance and real-world functioning in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Cognitive and psychosocial impairment has been associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine in bipolar disorder, but gender differences have seldom been studied.\nTwo hundred and twenty-four bipolar outpatients were included. Cognitive performance was assessed through the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP). Psychosocial functioning was evaluated using the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and the General Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Homocysteine and CRP levels were determined. Separate analyses were performed by gender. Partial correlations were calculated to test for associations between biomarkers and cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess factors predicting cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Covariates were: age, education, duration of illness, hospital admissions, depressive symptoms, tobacco consumption, and BMI.\nA better performance was noted in women in delayed verbal learning (p = 0.010), along with better occupational functioning (p = 0.027) and greater leisure time impairment (p = 0.034). In men, CRP and homocysteine levels were associated with psychosocial dysfunction (interpersonal relationships and financial functioning, respectively). In women, CRP levels correlated with cognitive performance (SCIP total raw score, immediate and delayed verbal learning, and verbal fluency). CRP was a predictor of cognitive performance in women only.\nThe choice of the cognitive scale and covariates and the lack of a control group may be the main limitations.\nA gender difference was found in biomarker modulation of cognition and psychosocial functioning. A gender-based approach to cognition and real-world functioning should be considered in bipolar disorder to ensure an optimal outcome."}, {"Title": "Efficacy and safety of maintenance electroconvulsive therapy for sustaining resolution of severe aggression in a major neurocognitive disorder.", "Abstract": "We report a novel electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) regimen for sustaining the resolution of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) using alternating acute and maintenance ECT (M-ECT) trials. A 64-year-old man presenting with major neurocognitive disorder was admitted for acute behavioural disturbances and physical aggression. With few treatment options, the impact on patients' quality of life often supersedes cognitive symptoms and is a predictor of long-term institutionalisation. Recent studies indicate that ECT may be an effective and safe way to address BPSD. Clinicians have little information about when and how to stop a successful course of acute ECT or the long-term advantages of M-ECT with subsequent intermittent acute ECT. This case emphasises the benefit of M-ECT and describes potential challenges associated with abrupt discontinuation. This case is the first to detail tapering ECT for treatment of aggression in dementia by interchanging acute and M-ECT courses in response to symptom burden."}, {"Title": "Testing decision-making competency of schizophrenia participants in clinical trials. A meta-analysis and meta-regression.", "Abstract": "The process of assessing the decision-making capacity of potential subjects before their inclusion in clinical trials is a legal requirement and a moral obligation, as it is essential for respecting their autonomy. This issue is especially important in psychiatry patients (such as those diagnosed with schizophrenia). The primary purpose of this article was to evaluate the degree of impairment in each dimension of decision-making capacity in schizophrenia patients compared to non-mentally-ill controls, as quantified by the (MacCAT-CR) instrument. Secondary objectives were (1) to see whether enhanced consent forms are associated with a significant increase in decision-making capacity in schizophrenia patients, and (2) if decision-making capacity in schizophrenia subjects is dependent on the age, gender, or the inpatient status of the subjects.\nWe systematically reviewed the results obtained from three databases: ISI Web of Science, Pubmed, Scopus. Each database was scrutinised using the following keywords: \"MacCAT-CR\u2009+\u2009schizophrenia\", \"decision-making capacity + schizophrenia\", and \"informed consent + schizophrenia.\"\nWe included 13 studies in the analysis. The effect size between the schizophrenia and the control group was significant, with a difference in means of -4.43 (-5.76; -3.1, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for understanding, -1.17 (-1.49, -0.84, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for appreciation, -1.29 (-1.79, -0.79, p\u2009<\u20090.001) for reasoning, and -0.05 (-0.9, -0.01, p\u2009=\u20090.022) for expressing a choice.\nEven if schizophrenia patients have a significantly decreased decision-making capacity compared to non-mentally-ill controls, they should be considered as competent unless very severe changes are identifiable during clinical examination. Enhanced informed consent forms decrease the differences between schizophrenia patients and non-mentally-ill controls (except for the reasoning dimension) and should be used whenever the investigators want to include more ill patients in their clinical trials. Increased age, men gender and an increased percentage of inpatients might increase the differential of decision-making incompetence compared to non-mentally-ill subjects in various dimensions of the decision-making competence as analysed by the MacCAT-CR scale, but the small number of subjects did not allow us (except for one instance) to reach statistical significance."}, {"Title": "Relationship between childhood trauma and suicide probability in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between childhood trauma with the probability of suicide in obsessive compulsive disorders. Sixty-seven patients who were diagnosed with OCD were included in the study out of the patients who were admitted to Malatya Training and Research Hospital psychiatry outpatient clinic. The research data were collected using Yale Brawn Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Beck Depression (BDS) and Beck Anxiety Scales (BAS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 (CTQ-28), and Suicide Probability Scale (SPS). CTQ was detected as \u2265 35 in 36 of 67 patients who were included in the study. Aggression (p = 0.003), sexual (p = 0.007) and religious (p = 0.023) obsessions and rituelistic (p = 0.000) compulsions were significantly higher in the group with CTQ \u2265 35. Mild correlation was detected between the SPS score and the scores of CTQ. Correlation remained even when the effect of BAS and BDS scores were excluded.

Six patients received a 20 mg/kg dose of IV valproic acid as an add-on therapy to their standard therapy with second-generation antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Agitation and general psychopathology were measured at baseline and after the first injection using the Modified Overt Aggression Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale.

This study aimed to evaluate the sociodemographic and clinical features of children and adolescents who applied to an outpatient clinic of child and adolescent psychiatry department in Turkey and were prescribed atypical antipsychotics.\nPatients with prescription codes of ATC N05A (except N05AN lithium) were accepted to denote those with atypical antipsychotic treatment. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, pharmacological mechanisms and groups and use of multiple agents for 212 patients with atypical antipsychotic treatment were collected and recorded.\nPatients (6.6%) evaluated within a year were prescribed antipsychotic agents (APs). The majority of the sample consisted of adolescents and especially females. The most common diagnoses managed with atypical antipsychotic were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, MDD, and mental retardation/intellectual disability in decreasing frequency. Males with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, CD, and autism spectrum disorders and females with MDD and PTSD were more frequently prescribed APs. Most common indications were irritability, impulsivity, and self-harming behaviors. Most common agents were risperidone, aripiprazole, and quetiapine in decreasing order of frequency. Most common adverse effects were reported as sedation, increased appetite, and hyperprolactinemia.\nOur results support the prevalence of off-label use of AP agents in managing various childhood psychopathologies also in Turkey.

This model is also extended to GP trainees who are on placement in psychiatry.\nTo explore the experiences of the '1-hour protected supervision model' for GP trainees in psychiatry placements in the UK. Methods Using a mixed methods approach, an anonymous online questionnaire was sent to GP trainees in the North West of England who had completed a placement in Psychiatry between February and August 2015. Results Discussing clinical cases whilst using the e-portfolio was the most useful learning event in this model. Patient care can potentially improve if a positive relationship develops between trainee/supervisor, which is impacted by the knowledge of this model at the start of the placement. Trainees found that clinical pressures were impacting on the occurrence of supervision. Conclusion The model works best when both GP trainees and their supervisors understand the model. The most frequently used and educationally beneficial aspect for GP trainees in psychiatry is the exploration of clinical cases using the learning portfolio as an educational tool. For effective delivery of this model of supervision, organisations must reflect on the balance between service delivery and allowing the supervisor and trainee adequate time for it to occur."}, {"Title": "Trends in MD/PhD Graduates Entering Psychiatry: Assessing the Physician-Scientist Pipeline.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify trends in MD/PhD graduates entering psychiatry, to compare these trends with other specialties, and to review strategies for enhancing the physician-scientist pipeline.\nData on 226,588 medical students graduating from Liaison Committee on Medical Education accredited programs between 1999 and 2012 (6626 MD/PhDs) were used to evaluate the number, percentage, and proportion of MD/PhDs entering psychiatry in comparison with other specialties (neurology, neurosurgery, internal medicine, family medicine, and radiation oncology). Linear regression and multiple linear regression determined whether these values increased over time and varied by sex.\nOver 14\u00a0years, an average of 18 MD/PhDs (range 13-29) enrolled in psychiatry each year. The number of MD/PhDs going into psychiatry significantly increased, although these gains were modest (less than one additional MD/PhD per year). The proportion of students entering psychiatry who were MD/PhDs varied between 2.9 and 5.9 per 100 residents, with no significant change over time. There was also no change in the percentage of MD/PhDs entering psychiatry from among all MD/PhD graduates. The rate of increase in the number of MD/PhDs going into psychiatry did not differ significantly from other specialties except for family medicine, which is decreasing. The rate of MD/PhDs going into psychiatry was higher for women, suggesting closure of the sex gap in 17\u00a0years.\nDespite the increase in the number of MD/PhDs entering psychiatry, these numbers remain low. Expanding the cohort of physician-scientists dedicated to translational research in psychiatry will require a multipronged approach."}, {"Title": "Vantage sensitivity: a framework for individual differences in response to psychological intervention.", "Abstract": "People differ significantly in their response to psychological intervention, with some benefitting more from treatment than others. According to the recently proposed theoretical framework of vantage sensitivity, some of this variability may be due to individual differences in environmental sensitivity, the inherent ability to register, and process external stimuli. In this paper, we apply the vantage sensitivity framework to the field of psychiatry and clinical psychology, proposing that some people are more responsive to the positive effects of psychological intervention due to heightened sensitivity.\nAfter presenting theoretical frameworks related to environmental sensitivity, we review a selection of recent studies reporting individual differences in the positive response to psychological intervention.\nA growing number of studies report that some people benefit more from psychological intervention than others as a function of genetic, physiological, and psychological characteristics. These studies support the vantage sensitivity proposition that treatment response is influenced by factors associated with heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. More recently, studies have also shown that sensitivity can be measured with a short questionnaire which appears to predict the response to psychological intervention.\nVantage sensitivity is a framework with significant relevance for our understanding of widely observed heterogeneity in treatment response. It suggests that variability in response to treatment is partly influenced by people's differing capacity for environmental sensitivity, which can be measured with a short questionnaire. Application of the vantage sensitivity framework to psychiatry and clinical psychology may improve our knowledge regarding when, how, and for whom interventions work."}, {"Title": "Genetic testing as a supporting tool in prescribing psychiatric medication: Design and protocol of the IMPACT study.", "Abstract": "Pharmacotherapy is one of the primary treatments for psychiatric disorders.

As IMPACT's eligibility criteria includes all diagnoses and comorbidities, the participant population will reflect the diversity amongst mental health consumers. IMPACT's innovative study design will demonstrate the utility of this testing within the health care system.\nIMPACT has successfully implemented pharmacogenetic testing on a relatively large scale, and in both tertiary level and primary care settings.

Across many temporal and spatial scales, network neuroscience has emerged as a central focus of intellectual efforts, seeking meaningful descriptions of brain networks and explanatory sets of network features that underlie circuit function in health and dysfunction in disease. However, the tools of network science commonly deployed provide insight into brain function at a fundamentally descriptive level, often failing to identify (patho-)physiological mechanisms that link system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain function. Here we describe recently developed techniques stemming from advances in complex systems and network science that have the potential to overcome this limitation, thereby contributing mechanistic insights into neuroanatomy, functional dynamics, and pathology. Finally, we build on the Research Domain Criteria framework, highlighting the notion that mental illnesses can be conceptualized as dysfunctions of neural circuitry present across conventional diagnostic boundaries, to sketch how network-based methods can be combined with pharmacological, intermediate phenotype, genetic, and magnetic stimulation studies to probe mechanisms of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "ADHD in acute care psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and motor hyperactivity. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD, in the general adult population, has been estimated to be 2.8%. Patients with ADHD have a high incidence of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Those with a psychiatric disorder as well as ADHD have more psychosocial difficulties than those without ADHD. Despite knowing that ADHD is often comorbid with other psychiatric diagnoses, there are currently no studies elucidating the prevalence of ADHD in the inpatient psychiatric population, nor is there significant information about its impact. The lack of research into this topic suggests more needs to be done in the field of adult ADHD, especially in the inpatient psychiatric population and with respect to impairment in patient function. Knowing the prevalence of ADHD and its impact on quality of life in adult inpatients will help lay the groundwork for effective screening and management. The purpose of this study was to understand the prevalence rates of ADHD among psychiatric acute care inpatients. Other objectives included comparing the quality of life and functioning between patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis and ADHD (treated or untreated) versus those with a primary psychiatric diagnosis and no ADHD. Thirty-three (N\u00a0=\u00a031) psychiatric inpatients were screened using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale. Those that screened positive for ADHD received a full diagnostic assessment for ADHD. All patients completed the Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (WFIRS) to assess level of functioning and a Clinical Global Impression of Severity/Improvement Scale (on admission and discharge). Demographic information was also obtained. Of the 31 patients analyzed, 12 had a diagnosis of ADHD (36.4%). The participants diagnosed with ADHD scored significantly higher on the WFIRS, suggesting decreased functioning compared to patients without comorbid ADHD. Patients with ADHD also scored significantly higher in the individual domains of this rating scale, suggesting impairment in family, work and social functioning as well as decreased life-skills, poor self-concept and increased risk-taking behavior. In this sample, the prevalence of ADHD is significantly higher among acute care psychiatric inpatients than in the general population. Patients with concomitant ADHD suffer more functional impairment than those without. These findings merit further investigation into the value of routine screening and patient-specific treatment of ADHD in this patient population."}, {"Title": "The 2016 Survey of the Association of Directors of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The members of the Association of Directors of Medical Student Education in Psychiatry (ADMSEP) had been last surveyed in 2010 to identify trends in medical student education in psychiatry, teaching methods, academic productivity, and administrative issues.

The current survey expanded past surveys with questions about current issues in medical education. Questions included categorical and scaled items (1\u2009=\u2009strongly disagree to 5\u2009=\u2009strongly agree). All ADMSEP members were invited to complete the survey, but half of the questions were for those who identified as clerkship directors.

Although critically important, this approach reduces assessment to cross-sectional observations that miss essential information about disease course. The mental health provider makes all medical decisions based on this limited information. Thanks to recent technological advances such as mobile phones and other personal devices, electronic health (eHealth) data collection strategies now can provide access to real-time patient self-report data during the interval between visits. Since mobile phones are generally kept on at all times and carried everywhere, they are an ideal platform for the broad implementation of ecological momentary assessment technology. Integration of these tools into medical practice has heralded the eHealth era. Intelligent health (iHealth) further builds on and expands eHealth by adding novel built-in data analysis approaches based on (1) incorporation of new technologies into clinical practice to enhance real-time self-monitoring, (2) extension of assessment to the patient's environment including caregivers, and (3) data processing using data mining to support medical decision making and personalized medicine.

Patients participate in health infomediaries to learn from other patients' experiences and knowledge. Knowledge sharing is an important aspect of the success of a health infomediary. Factors related to self-concept have been widely studied in the domains of psychiatry and psychology, in settings such as mental health and behavioural well-being, but remain unexplored in the digital health context. In particular, it is not known how self-concept influences knowledge sharing behaviours in health infomediaries. This study posits that self-efficacy, social identity, and self-stigma drive knowledge sharing in an infomediary through emotional empowerment and appearance-contingent self-esteem. We use the health belief model as a foundation to propose a two-stage model and testable hypotheses. We used secondary archival data of 222 patients participating in a health infomediary specialising in reconstructive surgery. Analyses using structural equation modelling and econometric methods support the hypotheses. Findings broadly suggest that there are distinct paths through emotional empowerment and appearance-contingent self-esteem that can motivate users to contribute knowledge in health infomediaries.

Despite an increasing scientific effort to find the pathophysiological explanations for the disease, the neurobiological links remain unclear. A large amount of evidence suggests that pathological processes taking place in early embryonic neurodevelopment might be responsible for later manifestation of autistic symptoms. This dysfunctional development includes altered maturation/differentiation processes, disturbances in cell-cell communication, and an unbalanced ratio between certain neuronal populations. All those processes are highly dependent on the interconnectivity and three-dimensional organizations of the brain. Moreover, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex neurobiology of autism spectrum disorders, valid disease models are pivotal. Induced pluripotent stem cells could potentially help to elucidate the complex mechanisms of the disease and lead to the development of more effective individualized treatment. The induced pluripotent stem cells approach allows comparison between the development of various cellular phenotypes generated from cell lines of patients and healthy individuals. A newly advanced organoid technology makes it possible to create three-dimensional in\u00a0vitro models of brain development and structural interconnectivity, based on induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the respective individuals. The biggest challenge for modeling psychiatric diseases in\u00a0vitro is finding and establishing the link between cellular and molecular findings with the clinical symptoms, and this review aims to give an overview over the feasibility and applicability of this new tissue engineering tool in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The Australasian Approach to the Definition of Mental Disorder in a Mental Health Act.", "Abstract": "How should the mental element be defined in the legal standards governing a person's 'sectioning' or placement under the Mental Health Act (MHA)? This article considers how this mental element is defined in many MHAs in Australasia: via a statutory list of disorders of mental function said to 'characterise' the necessary state of mind. This article assesses the assumptions behind the adoption of this approach. It discusses the views of several English law reform committees that have explored how the mental element should be defined. It examines the philosophy of psychiatry, expounded clearly by Aubrey Lewis, that lies behind the Australasian approach, one that emphasises the need to identify mental disturbance by reference to disorders of 'part-function of the mind', not by reference to behaviour alone. It considers how the Australasian statutes address the question of personality disorder's covered by the Act. In conclusion, it endorses cautiously the Australasian approach, principally on the ground that it may contribute positively to the conduct of review proceedings for compulsory patients under the Act. It may concentrate the attention of tribunals on particular features of the patient's mental state, on how those features are linked to associated dangers or risks, and on how the presence of those features may justify placing decisions about the patient's treatment in others' hands.

Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications, instruct the cell/tissue to correctly interpret external signals and adjust its functions accordingly. Given that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to environment, stable, and reversible, epigenetic studies in psychiatry could represent a promising approach to better understanding and treating disease. In the present review, we aim to discuss the clinical opportunities and challenges arising from the epigenetic research in psychiatry. Using selected examples, we first recapitulate key findings supporting the role of adverse life events, alone or in combination with genetic risk, in epigenetic programming of neuropsychiatric systems. Epigenetic studies further report encouraging findings about the use of methylation changes as diagnostic markers of disease phenotype and predictive tools of progression and response to treatment. Then we discuss the potential of using targeted epigenetic pharmacotherapy, combined with psychosocial interventions, for future personalized medicine for patients. Finally, we review the methodological limitations that could hinder interpretation of epigenetic data in psychiatry. They mainly arise from heterogeneity at the individual and tissue level and require future strategies in order to reinforce the biological relevance of epigenetic data and its translational use in psychiatry. Overall, we suggest that epigenetics could provide new insights into a more comprehensive interpretation of mental illness and might eventually improve the nosology, treatment, and prevention of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Description of the inpatient population and care received at a psychiatric unit in Lilongwe, Malawi.", "Abstract": "Like in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, descriptive data about psychiatric inpatients and inpatient psychiatric care in Malawi is limited.

The ready availability of these remedies over the counter and their generally good tolerability and safety contribute to this popularity, and many people have benefited from them, often in cases when conventional treatments have failed or caused intolerable side effects. Despite many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved psychotropic medications on the market, efficacy has been inconsistent for some, and many treatment responders will eventually relapse. Continued research on the efficacy and safety of these alternative therapies is, therefore, important. This article reviews six of the most commonly used natural remedies for psychiatric conditions, including the antidepressants St. John's wort, omega-3 fatty acids, and <i>S</i>-adenosyl methionine (SAMe); the sedative-hypnotics valerian and melatonin; and the nootropic ginkgo biloba. We outline the general indications for use, suggested doses, possible mechanisms, and adverse effects to give clinicians a good summary of the benefits and liabilities of each. Although there is growing evidence of efficacy and safety to support the use of these remedies, clinicians must be aware of the limitations of the evidence base and take that into account with all the other factors that contribute to clinical decision making."}, {"Title": "Preliminary Outcomes of a Computerized CBT/MET Intervention for Depressed Cannabis Users in Psychiatry Care.", "Abstract": "Although depression is common among cannabis users, there is a paucity of targeted interventions addressing depression and cannabis use disorders concurrently.

Adults with MDD and CUD (N=26) recruited from mental health care settings were enrolled in a 10-week, computer-assisted psychosocial intervention: Self-Help for Alcohol and other Drug Use and Depression (SHADE). Feasibility, acceptability, perceived helpfulness, treatment retention, completion, and clinical outcomes including cannabis use and depression were assessed. Participants found the SHADE intervention to be acceptable and helpful in facilitating action towards their therapeutic goals concerning depression and cannabis use. Treatment completion, achieved by the majority (85%) of participants, was excellent. On average, participants reduced their past 30 day cannabis use from baseline (mean percentage of days using = 69%) to follow-up (M=44%) (t(22)= 2.3, p<0.05; Effect Size= 0.79). Concurrently, they evidenced reductions in depressive symptom severity, from the moderately severe range at baseline to the mild range at follow-up (t(24)=7.3, p<0.001; Effect Size=1.52).

In addition, each participant was rated by a relative and by one or two clinicians on the pertinent WHODAS forms. In order to collect evidence for validity and reliability of WHODAS general disability and domain scores, we employed a series of Student's t-tests, ROC analyses, logistic regression analyses, intraclass and Pearson's correlation analyses, Cronbach's alpha and item-total statistics.\nRegarding general disability scores, in both clinical sample and healthy controls, all three types of 36-item WHODAS displayed satisfactory or higher validity and reliability coefficients. On the other hand, for 12-item version, only the interviewer-rated form demonstrated satisfactory results only in the clinical sample. Domain disability scores yielded by the 36-item forms were generally associated with adequate or acceptable coefficients in the clinical sample, while the coefficients were unacceptable in the control group.\nThe 36-item WHODAS interviewer-, proxy- and self-rated forms are suitable to assess general disability in Turkish mental health consumers and in healthy subjects. Among the 12-item WHODAS forms, the interviewer-rated form emerges as the sole instrument with comparable validity and reliability for measuring general disability in psychiatric patients.

In total, 213 patients who had experienced coercion and 51 patient controls (patients staying voluntarily on a closed ward with no coercive treatment) from three acute wards were examined via expert interviews and questionnaires in the framework of a naturalistic trial. Assessments included a new self-developed questionnaire as well as instruments measuring psychopathology. Patients who had experienced coercion differed from controls in both symptoms and insight into their illness.

Past, present & future.", "Abstract": "The classical psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide and mescaline, were used extensively in psychiatry before they were placed in Schedule I of the UN Convention on Drugs in 1967. Experimentation and clinical trials undertaken prior to legal sanction suggest that they are not helpful for those with established psychotic disorders and should be avoided in those liable to develop them. However, those with so-called 'psychoneurotic' disorders sometimes benefited considerably from their tendency to 'loosen' otherwise fixed, maladaptive patterns of cognition and behaviour, particularly when given in a supportive, therapeutic setting. Pre-prohibition studies in this area were sub-optimal, although a recent systematic review in unipolar mood disorder and a meta-analysis in alcoholism have both suggested efficacy. The incidence of serious adverse events appears to be low. Since 2006, there have been several pilot trials and randomised controlled trials using psychedelics (mostly psilocybin) in various non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. These have provided encouraging results that provide initial evidence of safety and efficacy, however the regulatory and legal hurdles to licensing psychedelics as medicines are formidable. This paper summarises clinical trials using psychedelics pre and post prohibition, discusses the methodological challenges of performing good quality trials in this area and considers a strategic approach to the legal and regulatory barriers to licensing psychedelics as a treatment in mainstream psychiatry.

No empirical research has examined the validity of the CUB in a day hospital programme. WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This study was the first to address the validity of this questionnaire within a psychiatric day hospital setting. This now allows other mental health service providers to use this questionnaire following administration of patient engagement interventions (such as behavioural activation), which are routinely used within this type of a setting. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Our results can enable healthcare providers to employ an effective and psychometrically validated tool in a day hospital setting to measure treatment outcomes and provide reflections of patients' approach behaviours and avoidance behaviours.\nIntroduction We evaluated the Checklist of Unit Behaviours (CUBs) questionnaire in a novel mental health setting: a day hospital within a large acute care general hospital. No empirical evidence exists, as of yet, to look at the validity of this measure in this type of a treatment setting. The CUB measures two factors, avoidance or approach, of the patients' engagement with the treatment milieu within the previous 24\u00a0hr.

Methods Psychiatric outpatients (n\u00a0=\u00a0163) completed the CUB daily while participating in a day hospital programme in Toronto, Canada.

Although the care manager is the key person in the collaborative care model, there is little knowledge about this role and the challenges involved in it. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Our study shows that before the CMs could start treating patients in a routine collaborative relationship with GPs, they needed to carry out an extensive amount of implementation work. This included solving practical problems of location and logistics, engaging GPs in the intervention, and tailoring collaboration to meet the GP's particular preferences. Implementing the role requires high commitment and an enterprising approach on the part of the care managers. The very experienced mental health nurses of this study had these skills. However, the same expertise cannot be presumed in a disseminated model. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: When introducing new collaborative care interventions, the care manager role should be well defined and be well prepared, especially as regards the arrival of the care manager in general practice, and supported during implementation by a coordinated leadership established in collaboration between hospital psychiatry and representatives from general practice.\nIntroduction In collaborative care models for anxiety and depression, the care manager (CM), often a mental health nurse, has a key role. However, the work and challenges related to this role remain poorly investigated. Aim To explore CMs' experiences of their work and the challenges they face when implementing their role in a collaborative care intervention in the Capital Region of Denmark. Methods Interviews with eight CMs, a group interview with five CMs and a recording of one supervision session were analysed by thematic analysis. Results The CM carried out considerable implementation work. This included finding suitable locations; initiating and sustaining communication with the GPs and maintaining their engagement in the model; adapting to the patient population in general practice; dealing with personal security issues, and developing supportive peer relations and meaningful supervision. Discussion We compare our findings to previous studies of collaborative care and advanced nursing roles in general practice. The importance of organizational leadership to support the CM's bridge-building role is emphasized. Implications for practice The planners of new collaborative care interventions should not only focus on the CM's clinical tasks but also on ensuring the sufficient organizational conditions for carrying out the role."}, {"Title": "Aripiprazole-induced transient myopia: A rare entity.", "Abstract": "Aripiprazole is a new drug for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia.

Results Overall 30-day readmission rate was not significantly different between intervention and nonintervention groups. However, in subgroups with high risk of mortality or severe illness, the intervention group had a 0% 30-day readmission rate for both high risk of mortality and severe illness subgroups, while the nonintervention group's readmission rate was 5% for high risk of mortality group and 3% for severely ill patients. Annual hospital cost saving is estimated between a quarter million and 1.5 million dollars for these subgroups.

Targeted Training in Illness Management is a group-based self-management training approach which targets serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus concurrently. This analysis examines data from a randomized controlled trial of Targeted Training in Illness Management intervention to examine the impact of comorbid anxiety on baseline psychiatric symptomatology and diabetic control, and on longitudinal treatment outcomes. Methods We conducted secondary analyses on data from a prospective, 60-week, randomized controlled trial testing Targeted Training in Illness Management versus treatment as usual in 200 individuals with serious mental illness and diabetes. Primary outcomes included measures related to serious mental illness symptoms, functional status, general health status, and diabetes control. Measures were compared between those participants with anxiety disorders versus those without anxiety at baseline as well as over time using linear mixed effects analyses. Results Forty seven percent of the participants had one or more anxiety disorders. At baseline, those with an anxiety diagnosis had higher illness severity, depressive, and other psychiatric symptomatology and disability. Diabetic control (HbA1c) was not significantly different at baseline. In the longitudinal analyses, no significant mean slope differences over time (group-by-time interaction effect) between those with anxiety diagnoses and those without in treatment as usual group were found for primary outcomes. Within the Targeted Training in Illness Management arm, those with anxiety disorders had significantly greater improvement in mental health functioning. Those with anxiety comorbidity in the Targeted Training in Illness Management group demonstrated significantly lower HbA1c levels compared to no anxiety comorbidity and also demonstrated a greater improvement in HbA1c over the first 30 weeks compared to those without anxiety comorbidity. Conclusion Comorbid anxiety in serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus population is associated with increased psychiatric symptomatology and greater disability. Individuals from this population appear to experience greater improvement in functioning from baseline with the Targeted Training in Illness Management intervention. Anxiety comorbidity in the serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus population does not appear to have a negative impact on diabetic control.

However, training on real ASAs raises technical and ethical issues, whereas lecture-based teaching hardly addresses some educational objectives, e.g., improving relational skills and team-based coordination. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is a promising medium to train students on managing ASAs. We have recently implemented a role-playing training module on ASAs. In this scenario, four to five students play the role of the staff, while a trained professional actor plays the agitated patient. A subsequent standardized debriefing is conducted by a senior psychiatrist. A first wave of 219 students participated in a one-session training of this ASA module in June 2015. They completed pre-session and post-session questionnaires aiming to collect \"proof-of-concept\" data.\nThe pre-session questionnaire investigated: previous experience of ASA among students during their clinical training; previous participation in a role-playing SBME; and perceived knowledge of the good practice rules for managing ASAs. The post-session questionnaire investigated among the students if: they thought having been able to appropriately manage the simulated ASA; they found the SBME medium more fitted for training than real situations; they found that the SBME session faithfully reproduced a real ASA; and the session was found useful for transmitting the skills on correct management of ASA. The average level of stress induced by the training was assessed using a numerical rating scale (0-10).\nTwo hundred and six of the 219 students completed the pre-session questionnaire (63% females; response rate 96.7%). A hundred and thirty four students played the scenario and completed the post-session questionnaire (65.7% females; response rate 100%). 38.3% of the responders reported having previously experienced a situation of ASA in their practice, and 31.1% deemed to know the good practices rules for managing an ASA. In post-session, 29.9% of the participants considered that they appropriately managed the ASA, 79.9% deemed that the role-playing session faithfully reproduced a real ASA, and 97% deemed that this SBME was more fitted and useful than a real clinical situation to improve their medical skills.

In 2013, we published a review of QT prolongation, TdP, and psychotropic medications.\nWe provide an update over the past 5 years on the specific concerns most relevant to clinicians who see medically ill patients.\nIn this nonsystematic review, we aimed to carefully and intensively identify new articles by utilizing a structured PubMed search from 2012-present.\nQT prolongation remains an imperfect, though well-established marker of risk for TdP. Among antidepressant medications, citalopram does appear to prolong the QT interval more than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, though the clinical significance of this prolongation remains unclear. Escitalopram appears to prolong the QT interval to a lesser extent. Haloperidol carries a risk for QT prolongation, but the assertion that intravenous haloperidol is inherently riskier may be confounded by its primary use in medically ill populations. Among atypical antipsychotic agents, ziprasidone-and possibly iloperidone-is associated with the greatest QT prolongation, whereas aripiprazole appears safest from this standpoint.\nThe evidence for clinically meaningful QT prolongation with most classes of psychiatric agents remains minimal. The most important risk-reducing intervention clinicians can make is undertaking a careful analysis of other QT risk factors when prescribing psychiatric medications."}, {"Title": "Issues on the diagnosis and etiopathogenesis of mood disorders: reconsidering DSM-5.", "Abstract": "The authors present a narrative review from the diagnostic and nosologic viewpoints of mood disorders (bipolar and depressive ones) by revisiting the revision from the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Text Revision to DSM-5, including the following: the separation of the bipolar and depressive sections; the addition of increased energy and continuation of symptoms to the hypo/manic criteria; the elimination of mixed episodes; the creation of new categories and specifiers (\"other specified bipolar and related disorder\", \"disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\", \"with anxious distress\", \"with mixed features\", \"with peripartum onset\"); the categorization of hypo/manic episodes during antidepressant treatment into bipolar disorder; the elimination of the \"bereavement exclusion\"; the ambiguous separation between bipolar I and II; the insufficient distinction between \"other specified bipolar and related disorders\" and major depressive disorder; the differentiation regarding borderline personality disorder; agitation; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; and society and psychiatry. Through this analysis, we point out both the achievements and limitations of DSM-5. In addition, to examine the future direction of psychiatry, we introduce our cohort study regarding maternal depression and an outline of the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria project in the US.

The purpose of this study is to identify consults and complications during the perioperative period that increase financial burden.\nWe combined CMS payment data for inpatient, professional, and postoperative with retrospective review of patients undergoing primary TJA and developed profiles of patients included in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement bundle undergoing TJA. Statistical comparison of episode inpatient events and payments was conducted. Multiple regression analysis was adjusted for length of stay, disposition, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity profile.\nMedian total payment was $21,577.36, which exceeded the median bundle target payment of $20,625.00. Adjusted analyses showed that psychiatry consults (increase of $73,123.32; P < .001), internal medicine consults ($5789.38; P \u2264 .001), pulmonary embolism ($35,273.68; P < .001), intensive care unit admission ($14,078.37; P < .001), and deep vein thrombosis ($9471.26; P\u00a0= .019) resulted in increased payments using multivariate analysis adjusted for length of stay, Charlson-Deyo comorbidities, and discharge disposition.\nPatients with inpatient complications such as pulmonary embolism and/or deep vein thrombosis, intensive care unit admission, and medical/psychiatric consultation exceeded the CMS target. Although study results showed typical complication rates, acute inpatient consultation significantly increased utilization beyond the CMS target even when adjusted for length of stay, patient comorbidities, and discharge.

Its pathophysiology, initiation, development and course involve a range of different receptors and transmitters. The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are being attributed to an increasingly larger significance in pain aetiology. Over the last few years, the mechanism of ASICs action, influence of their antagonists/agonists and clinical applications have been well described. However, the importance of this protein is significantly larger, not only from the perspective of pain management, but also in psychiatry of addiction or fear. Recently discovered peptides from three-finger toxin group, called mambalgins (isolated from Dendroaspis polylepis polylepsis) exhibit potent analgesic mechanisms of action on ASICs in animal model.\nThe article reviews current knowledge in the field of mambalgins and assesses their potential analgesic application, based on the recent experimental evidence.\nThe mambalgins seem to decrease the intensity of the inflammatory, neuropathic and mechanic pain. This has been demonstrated in animal studies of different pain models, including carrageenan- induced inflammatory pain, chronic constrictive injury-induced neuropathic pain and thermal pain. The mechanism of mambalgin action is not clearly defined, but it is suspected that they bind directly to the pH-sensitive region of the ASIC.\nIn this short review, we attempted to summarise the current knowledge about mambalgins and their potential applications as a new substance in searching for the ideal analgesia without common side effects of the other drug groups."}, {"Title": "Subthreshold autism spectrum disorder in patients with eating disorders.", "Abstract": "Increasingly data suggest a possible overlap between psychopathological manifestations of eating disorders (EDs) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

A secondary outcome was to determine the effect of a psychiatric observation unit on inpatient psychiatric bed utilization.\nThis study was a before-and-after analysis conducted in a 1,541-bed tertiary care academic medical center including an adult ED with annual census over 90,000 between February 2013 and July 2014. All adult patients (age\u00a0>\u00a017 years) requiring evaluation by the acute psychiatry service in the crisis intervention unit (CIU) within the ED were included. Patients who left without being seen, left against medical advice, or were dispositioned to the pediatric hospital, hospice, or court/law enforcement were excluded. In December 2013, a 12-bed locked psychiatric observation unit was opened that included dedicated behavioral health staff and was intended for psychiatric patients requiring up to 48 hours of care. The primary outcomes were ED LOS, CIU LOS, and total LOS. Secondary outcomes included the hold rate defined as the proportion of acute psychiatry patients requiring subsequent observation or inpatient admission and the inpatient psychiatric admission rate. For the primary analysis we constructed ARIMA regression models that account for secular changes in the primary outcomes. We conducted two sensitivity analyses, first replicating the primary analysis after excluding patients with concurrent acute intoxication and second by comparing the 3-month period postintervention to the identical 3-month period of the prior year to account for seasonality.\nA total of 3,501 patients were included before intervention and 3,798 after intervention. The median ED LOS for the preintervention period was 155 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0= 19-346 minutes), lower than the median ED LOS for the postintervention period of 35 minutes (IQR\u00a0= 9-209 minutes, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Similar reductions were observed in CIU LOS (865 minutes vs. 379 minutes, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and total LOS (1,112 minutes vs. 920 minutes, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The psychiatric hold rate was statistically higher after intervention (before\u00a0= 42%, after\u00a0= 50%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), however, coupled with a statistically lower psychiatric admission rate (before\u00a0= 42%, after\u00a0= 25%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).\nCreation of an acute psychiatric observation improves ED and acute psychiatric service throughput while supporting the efficient allocation of scare inpatient psychiatric beds.

The majority of the literature on factitious disorder comes from case reports or case series. This particular case is unusual because it describes a patient who initially presented with purely physical complaints, but over time, the symptoms transitioned into predominantly psychiatric concerns. This case describes the patient's unique presentation and is followed by a discussion of the management of factitious disorder. Methods The patient was seen during the course of an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Electronic chart review was conducted, and information from each prior hospitalization was gathered between the dates of first initial documented presentation available in the electronic record in 1995 to most recent hospitalization in 2017. Results The patient still continues to present to the emergency department. Upon each presentation, staff work to objectively assess his complaints to be sure that there is no true underlying medical emergency. There is also a focus on providing non-judgmental, supportive, and compassionate care. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of corroborating objective findings with the patient's subjective reports gathered during a history and physical, and to recognize that patients with this disorder can present to any specialty.

Methods A four-year survey ( N\u2009=\u20092518 individuals) based on clinical and care variables selected from the basic documentation.\nChi-square tests, analysis of variance, logistic and multivariate regression analyses, considering statistical modeling assumptions. Results A current psychiatric comorbidity has been found in 75% (less in cancer patients), mainly adjustment and anxiety (45%), mood (22%), and organic mental disorders (12%). The functioning score (Global Assessment of Functioning) was 59.4 and was especially low in patients suffering from unclear medical conditions. The performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) amounted to 1.63 and was especially high in patients suffering from orthopedic conditions, infections, and cancer. Each patient received on average of 2.26 (SD\u2009=\u20092.81) contacts and 111 minutes (SD\u2009=\u2009160) of total treatment time. In multivariate models, care differences among medical conditions are reduced. Men and older people have received less than the average amount of treatment, but psychiatrically comorbid patients and those with lower functionality and performance status have received more intensive psychological support. Conclusions As a quality feature of consultation and liaison service, patients suffering from psychiatric comorbidity, lower functionality, and lower performance status receive more intensive care and more post-discharge recommendations. Cancer patients and patients with pain as a leading diagnosis as well as strained mothers of hospitalized children have received more intensive treatment by consultation and liaison service despite lower psychiatric comorbidity levels. More attention has to be paid to men and older people independently of their physical condition."}, {"Title": "From Information to Simulation: Improving Competency in ECT Training Using High-Fidelity Simulation.", "Abstract": "This study was intended to develop a new educational model that supplements ECT didactics with simulation-based procedural training and to evaluate the learning gains conferred by such a curriculum.\nTwo types of curricula were evaluated for educational efficacy in this prospective randomized controlled trial.

They were then block-randomized to receive either a didactic ECT curriculum (non-SIM) or one augmented by simulation training (SIM). Three months post-completion of the two types of instruction, all residents were re-administered the surveys and a procedural post-assessment.\nThe median number of ECTs performed prior to the study was similar between the two groups (SIM group = 3, non-SIM group = 4.) The SIM group showed significant improvement on pre- and post- survey theoretical knowledge scores: 51% (95% CI = 41 to 61%) and 69% (95% CI = 64 to 74%), respectively, p = .02; this difference was not significant in the non-SIM group, p = .2. Improvement between pre- and post- proficiency scores were seen in the SIM group: 22% (95% CI = 13 to 32%) and 51% (95% CI = 53 to 59%), p < .001 while the effect was less pronounced in the non-SIM group. Inter-rater agreement for the proficiency assessment was excellent: k, = .9.\nResidents showed significant improvement in knowledge, comfort, and skills following ECT simulation training.

However, they also report lower identification accuracies when using historical neuroimaging acquisitions with low spatial and temporal resolution. The authors suggest that their results indicate connectomes derived from historical imaging data may be similar across individuals, to the extent that this connectome-based approach may be inappropriate for precision psychiatry and the goal of drawing inferences based on subject-level data. Here we note that the authors did not take into account factors affecting data quality and hence identification rates, independent of whether a low spatiotemporal resolution acquisition or a high spatiotemporal resolution acquisition is used. Specifically, we show here that the amount of data collected per subject and in-scanner motion are the predominant factors influencing identification rates, not the spatiotemporal resolution of the acquisition. To do this, we investigated identification rates in the HCP dataset as a function of the amount of data and motion. Using a dataset from the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), we investigated the impact of multiband versus non-multiband imaging parameters; that is, high spatiotemporal resolution versus low spatiotemporal resolution acquisitions. We show scan length and motion affect identification, whereas the imaging protocol does not affect these rates.

As many as half of women today experience childbirth as traumatic and no evidence suggests that the figure was lower a half-century ago. Drawing on women's birth narratives and psychiatric literature, this article highlights the striking consistency over time in how women describe their experiences of traumatic birth. By the 1970s, however, women proved less ready to accept their trauma as the product of their own psychological shortcomings. Under the sway of second-wave feminism, they pushed back against care they defined as inhumane in both conventional maternity care and in natural childbirth. Psychiatry too demonstrates change over time. Hegemonic at midcentury, Freudian thinking began to yield to critiques that questioned gender norms and the preeminence of the subconscious. Based on private letters to maternity caregivers and between physicians, as well as a wide array of medical journal articles, popular magazines, and newsletters from childbirth education and birth advocacy organizations, this article argues that, despite different approaches to trauma in birth and clarity about how best to minimize it, contemporary maternity care has to date proven unable to heed the lessons of history."}, {"Title": "(\u00b1)-MDMA and its enantiomers: potential therapeutic advantages of R(-)-MDMA.", "Abstract": "The use of (\u00b1)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ((\u00b1)-MDMA) as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral disorders dates back over 50\u00a0years. Only in recent years have controlled and peer-reviewed preclinical and clinical studies lent support to (\u00b1)-MDMA's hypothesized clinical utility.

We review the unmet needs of patients with SZ and the scientific rationale behind the DBS targets proposed in the literature in order to guide future development of DBS to treat this vulnerable patient population. SZ remains a devastating disorder despite treatment. Relapse, untreated psychosis, intolerable side effects and the lack of effective treatment for negative and cognitive symptoms contribute to poor outcome. Novel therapeutic interventions are needed to treat SZ and DBS is emerging as a potential intervention. Convergent genetic, pharmacological and neuroimaging evidence implicating neuropathology associated with psychosis is consistent with SZ being a circuit disorder amenable to striatal modulation with DBS. Many of the DBS targets proposed in the literature may modulate striatal dysregulation. Additional targets are considered for treating tardive dyskinesia and negative and cognitive symptoms. A need is identified for the concurrent development of neurophysiological biomarkers relevant to SZ pathology in order to inform DBS targeting. Finally, we discuss the current clinical trials of DBS for SZ, and their ethical considerations.

The authors review critiques of Kraepelin's work published in his lifetime by Adolf Meyer, Friedrich Jolly, Eugenio Tanzi, Alfred Hoche, Karl Jaspers, and Willy Hellpach. These critics made six major points. First, Kraepelin's new categories of dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity were too broad and too heterogeneous. Second, his emphasis on course of illness was misconceived, as the same disease can result in brief episodes or a chronic course. Third, the success of his system was based on the quality of his textbooks and his academic esteem, rather than on empirical findings. Fourth, his focus on symptoms and signs led to neglect of the whole patient and his or her life story. Fifth, Kraepelin's early emphasis on experimental psychology did not bear the expected fruit. Sixth, Kraepelin was committed to the application of the medical disease model. However, because of the many-to-many relationship between brain pathology and psychiatric symptoms, true natural disease entities may not exist in psychiatry. Most of the ongoing debates about Kraepelin's nosology have roots in these earlier discussions and would be enriched by a deeper appreciation of their historical contexts. As authoritative as Kraepelin was, and remains today, his was only one among many voices, and attention to them would be well repaid by a deeper understanding of the fundamental conceptual challenges in our field.

If the mini-CEX is to be used in multidisciplinary contexts, then validity evidence should be gathered in similar settings. The purpose of this study was to gather further validity evidence for the mini-CEX but in a broader context. Specifically we sought to explore the effects of discipline and rater type on mini-CEX scores, internal structure, and the relationship between mini-CEXs and OSCEs in a multidisciplinary context.\nDuring clerkship, medical students completed eight different rotations (family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency, anesthesiology and obstetrics and gynecology). During each rotation, mini-CEX forms and a written examination were completed. Two multidisciplinary OSCEs (in Clerkship Year 3 and start of Year 4) assessed clinical skills. The reliability of the mini-CEX was assessed using Generalizability analyses. To assess the influence of discipline and rater type, mean scores were analyzed using a factorial analysis of variance. The total mini-CEX score was correlated to scores from the students' respective OSCEs and corresponding written exams.\nEighty-two students met inclusion criteria for a total of 781 ratings (average of 9.82 mini-CEX forms per student). There was a significant effect of discipline (p < .001, = .16), and faculty provided lower scores than nonfaculty raters (7.12\u00a0vs. 7.41; p = .002, = .02). The g-coefficient was .53 when discipline was included as a facet and .23 when rater type was a facet. There were low, but statistically significant correlations between the mini-CEX and scores for the 4th-year OSCE Total Score and the OSCE communication scores, r(80) = .40, p < .001 and r(80) = .29, p = .009. The mini-CEX was not correlated with the written examination scores for any of the disciplines.\nOur results provide conflicting findings for validity evidence for the mini-CEX. Mini-CEX ratings were correlated to multidisciplinary OSCEs but not written examinations, supporting the validity argument. However, reliability of the mini-CEX was low to moderate, and error accounted for the greatest amount of variability in scores. There was variation in scores due to discipline and resident raters gave higher scores than faculty.

Cross-talk between psychiatry and sociology developed through seminal sociological analyses of psychiatric institutions and the interest taken in medical institutions in a number of sociological texts. Inter-disciplinary joint studies (of sociologists and psychiatrists) affected the research interest and professional behaviour of psychiatrists involved in the process on the way to the Psychiatrie-Enquete.\nTenacity of psychiatrists' systems of opinion was dissolved by impulses from the sociological thought community.

Because the onset of most psychiatric diseases is in late adolescence or early adulthood, testing minors could lead to early identification that may prevent or delay the development of these disorders. However, due to their complex aetiology, psychiatric genetic testing does not provide the immediate medical benefits that current guidelines require for testing minors. While several authors have argued non-medical benefits may play a crucial role in favour of predictive testing for other conditions, little research has explored such a role in psychiatric disorders. This paper outlines the potential non-medical benefits and harms of psychiatric genetic testing in minors in order to consider whether the non-medical benefits could ever make such testing appropriate. Five non-medical themes arise in the literature: psychological impacts, autonomy/self-determination, implications of the biomedical approach, use of financial and intellectual resources, and discrimination. Non-medical benefits were prominent in all of them, suggesting that psychiatric genetic testing in minors may be appropriate in some circumstances. Further research needs to empirically assess these potential non-medical benefits, incorporate minors in the debate, and include normative reflection to evaluate the very purposes and motivations of psychiatric genetic testing in minors."}, {"Title": "Building Healthcare Capacity in Pediatric Neurosurgery and Psychiatry in a Post-Soviet System: Ukraine.", "Abstract": "Many academic centers in North America are initiating global partnerships to build physician capacity in resource-poor countries. An opportunity arose to develop a pediatric program (Ukraine Paediatric Fellowship Program, UPFP) in Ukraine, a large European country in transition from a Soviet/communist political and social system. This entailed dealing with a centralized and rigid healthcare system based on the Semashko model of the former Soviet Union.\nOur capacity-building model has several key features: endowed philanthropic funding for sustainability, bilateral exchange of knowledge, a focus primarily on pediatric brain disorders, and team building. Centers for partnering are selected on the basis of need, receptivity to change, and participants' fluency in English. Ukrainian physicians attend month-long observerships in Toronto, and biannual teaching visits are conducted by Canadian clinicians.\nOver 5 years, 7 teaching visits have taken place, and 20 physicians have trained at SickKids Hospital in Toronto. Six Ukrainian children's hospitals are now collaborating with UPFP. New surgical procedures have been introduced, such as endoscopic ventriculostomy and corpus callosotomy. Patient referrals to regional institutions have increased, and new projects that affect fetal and infant neurodevelopment have been initiated (e.g., treatment of perinatal maternal depression and folic acid fortification of flour).

We analyzed change from baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) total score using the mixed model repeated measures approach. We compared the least squares means and the 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect among three different trial durations, 4, 6, and 8weeks. We considered two definitions of discontinuation: (i) all-cause discontinuation, (ii) discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. We compared the two-sided log-rank p-values with the p-values from the protocol-specified primary analysis.\nOur findings suggest that MDD trials in the acute setting may be shortened to 6weeks provided that the treatment difference between drug and placebo on HAMD-17 total score reaches approximately 2units at Week 6.

Occasionally, this violence involves acts of aggression between patients in emergency psychiatric units or hospital wards. Such events can lead to the development or worsening of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nTo establish the context, we first examined the epidemiology data concerning posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric patients who were frequently exposed to assaults. Secondly, we examined the issue of sexual and physical assaults between patients receiving treatment in a psychiatric ward. In this context, we studied possible occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder associated with exposure to assaults of this kind.\nIn certain cases, potentially traumatic exposure to violence was unknown to the medical staff or not taken into consideration. This would induce a risk of later development of posttraumatic stress disorder that would not be treated during the stay in psychiatry.\nTo date, few scientific studies have focused on the proportion of patients assaulted by other patients during treatment in a psychiatric ward and the subsequent development of peritraumatic reactions and/or posttraumatic stress disorder associated with these assaults. We know that an insufficient number of public and private health institutions report the existence of such facts to the competent authorities.

Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiatric emergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the first Norwegian emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of therapeutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the 'video-mediated gaze' in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the 'real' expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's 'voice' in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness. With a sociological approach to video-conferenced emergency psychiatry, the identification of symbolic affordances adds necessary nuances to the application of new technologies into fragile therapeutic communication."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Structured Assessment and Mediating Factors of Suicide-Focused Group Therapy for Veterans Recently Discharged from Inpatient Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The current study investigated the impact of adding the Suicide Status Form (SSF) to a suicide-focused group therapy for veterans recently discharged from an inpatient psychiatry setting.

They were compared with a similar cohort of 3047 patients from the entire 2015 ED population. The BAU resulted in a decreased wait to be seen (40 min [interquartile range (IQR): 17-86] vs 68 min [IQR: 24-130], P <\u20090.001), a decreased wait for a mental health review (117 min [IQR: 49-224] vs 139 min [IQR: 57-262], P\u2009=\u20090.001) and a decreased ED length of stay (180 min [IQR: 101-237] vs 328 min [IQR: 227-534], P <\u20090.001).

Its sources are located in the primary auditory cortex and the asymmetry of the planum temporale has previously been associated with hand preference and gender-related differences; thus subject's handedness and gender could potentially influence ASSRs. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies of ASSRs are mainly dominated by right-handed participants and the observed findings can only be generalized to the right-handed populations. However, for a potential use of 40\u00a0Hz ASSR as a translational biomarker of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is important to investigate the response in association to handedness and gender. We included an equal number of left-handed and right-handed males and females and recorded EEG responses during left-ear, right-ear and both ears stimulation. The results of the study suggest that the processing of 40\u00a0Hz auditory stimulation depends on the subjects' gender and handedness: significantly lower phase-locking and strength of 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs were observed in left-handed females as compared to left-handed males, but right-handers did not differ in 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs. Our observation of the opposite impact of gender in the examined handedness groups stresses the importance of careful consideration of handedness and gender factors when evaluating the determinants of inter individual variability of 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs. This finding is of particular importance for clinical studies in psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Response to letter to the editor from Dr Rahman Shiri: The challenging topic of suicide across occupational groups.", "Abstract": "We thank Dr Rahman Shiri (1) for his careful reading of our systematic review and meta-analysis on suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (2). Our paper had the objective of providing a pooled effect size of suicide for this occupational group. Suicide is a crucial issue in public and occupational health. Suicide has a multifactorial etiology and recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have pointed out the role of occupational exposures, mainly psychosocial work stressors, as risk factors for suicide (3, 4). Suicide is a very rare event in the general population and still more seldom in the working population. Indeed, unemployed and economically inactive people have a higher risk of suicide compared to employed people (5, 6). However, the total number of suicides is greater in the employed population than among the economically inactive or unemployed (6). Shiri's letter (1) questioned several aspects of our review and meta-analysis. One comment related to the single reference database used in our review and a suggestion that our review could not be considered to be systematic. The review was based on Medline because our main interest was in quantitative epidemiologic studies. This is the largest database for biomedical literature and we would argue the most pertinent. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of the most recent papers and literature reviews, and Shiri did not report any paper that was missing. No review, whether searching one or more databases, can expect to be totally exhaustive. There may always be missing studies, especially if we consider grey literature. Thus we assert that our review was systematic, while acknowledging that it may not be perfectly comprehensive. Shiri suggested an absence of quality assessment of the studies included in our meta-analysis. First, quality was considered in the context of our comments in the discussion section. Second, as suggested by Rothman et al (7), quality assessment was replaced by regression analyses of the effect of each quality item (study characteristics, ie, study design, effect measure, reference group, and adjustment). Third, because most studies included in this review were based on objective data (census, administrative, or register data), they were free of many of the sources of bias that exist in studies where information on exposure and outcome must be collected from participants. Consequently, many of the items related to quality were not pertinent, such as response and follow-up rates, coverage and representativeness of the sample, selection, etc. Contrary to what Shiri suggested, all study designs can be informative in this topic because all of them are able to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect size. In addition, the prospective and case-control studies may have shortcomings. For example, we excluded five studies including three prospective and case-control studies in the sensibility analysis because the group of interest was defined on the basis of the exposure to chemicals (pesticides) rather than job title. Our choice to retain the least adjusted models was justified because aggregated data were used for the meta-analysis. Therefore, unless all included studies adjusted for the same covariates measured in the same way, adjusted estimates cannot be meaningfully provided in an aggregate data meta-analysis. In addition, as the objective was above all descriptive and not etiological or explanatory, and as it is the norm in the exploration of social inequalities in health (8), the results from the least (gender- and age-) adjusted models were in line with the objective. Indeed, including more adjustment variables could lead to overadjustment as they may be intermediate variables on the causal pathways between occupation and suicide. Our strategy was in line with previous meta-analyses on similar topics (9-11). Consequently, we would argue that our results are not likely to be largely due to confounding, contrary to the comment by Shiri. Indeed, the study of the contribution of underlying factors in explaining social inequalities in health outcomes is a fully-fledged topic of research (12-15), but this is relevant research to conduct after demonstrating that inequalities exist between social or occupational groups. Several of Shiri's comments were about statistical aspects of our analyses. First, it was suggested that we did not correctly extract the confidence intervals for the estimates of several studies. We disagree. We used the STATA metan suite of commands using log-transformed effect sizes and standard errors. Our figure 1 and the values of effect sizes and confidence intervals were provided by STATA, this explains why there may be small differences in these values compared with the results published in some studies. Using log-transformed effect sizes and confidence intervals, the analysis provided the same results. Second, our subgroup comparison was based on subsamples that were independent. As not all studies provided information for these subgroups, each subgroup was treated as a unit of analysis. This strategy allows the use of all relevant subgroups and comparisons between them (16). Third, we were also criticized for the use of random-effects models. Random-effects models are generally more plausible for meta-analysis based on studies from the published literature, because the fixed-effect model assumed that the entire corpus of literature has been obtained, ie, that every study has been or ever will be written on the topic has been included, which is an implausible assumption. We also assumed differences in effect size between studies and between subgroups, and the use of random-effects models was consistent with such an assumption. However, random-effects models produce wider confidence intervals compared to fixed-effect models (16). These models are thus more conservative, making our results all the more robust. One of Shiri's comments related to the reference group used in the studies for the comparison of agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. Although we reported that the studies using a specific occupational group as reference group provided a higher effect size than the studies using other reference groups, we did not explicitly recognize and state in the paper that the results for Japan were based on two studies using a specific occupational group as reference; we concede that this may explain why we found a much more elevated effect size for Japan. Shiri's results (1) allow to conclude that the difference between Japan and the other geographic areas could be explained by the choice of reference group-we are grateful to him for raising this point. However, we would note that the effect size of suicide was still elevated and significant for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers even after this change in the reference group for these two studies. Nevertheless, the choice of the optimal reference group is not obvious. If we consider the general population as the reference group, as unemployed people and economically inactive people (including people who may not be working due to illness or disability) are part of it and have a higher risk of suicide than employed people, the effect size provided by the nine studies using the general population as the reference is likely to be underestimated, which may contribute to an underestimation of the observed effect size of suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers in our study. The comparison was made in our paper with the other occupational groups (ie, the working population except the group of interest) as the reference, which was used by nine other studies, but this did not allow to determine the exact rank of the group of interest in the occupational hierarchy. Another relevant choice would have been to retain the group with the lowest suicide risk (for example, the high-skilled occupational group) as the reference, which would have led to a much higher effect size of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. To conclude, as statistical power in detecting differences between subgroups may be low in subgroup analyses and meta-regression, the absence of significant results according to subgroups found in our results cannot be interpreted as evidence that the effect size is the same across subgroups. Consequently, our meta-analysis reporting a significant excess of risk of suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers may also be a good incentive for more research among this group of workers to (i) confirm this observed excess of risk using differing methodological approaches to meta-analysis and (ii) explore the potential differences within this group and the underlying factors that may explain this excess of risk.

Initially, the questionnaire consisted of 12 questions. One hundred adult medical inpatients were asked to perform the questionnaire. Explorative factor analysis was used to examine construct validity. Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparison with the Korean versions of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\nFive questions were removed from the preliminary questionnaire by explorative factor analysis and seven questions remained to comprise the Suicide Risk Scale for Medical inpatients (SRSM). Explorative factor analysis showed that the SRSM is composed of a single factor. SRSM was highly reliable in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.91).

Metabolic monitoring is the systematic physical health assessment of antipsychotic users utilized to detect cardiovascular and endocrine side effects and prevent adverse events such as weight gain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia, and arrhythmias. This practice ensures safe and efficacious SGA use among children and adolescents. Despite widely available, evidence-based metabolic monitoring guidelines, rates of monitoring continue to be suboptimal; this exposes children to the unnecessary risk of developing poor cardiovascular health and long-term disease. In this discursive paper, existing approaches to metabolic monitoring as well as challenges to implementing monitoring guidelines in practice are explored. The strengths and weaknesses of providing metabolic monitoring across outpatient psychiatry, primary care, and collaborative community settings are discussed. We suggest that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to improving metabolic monitoring care for children and adolescents using SGA in all settings.

Positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabeled ligands selective for the 18\u2009kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become the most widely used technique to assess putative neuroimmune abnormalities in vivo. Originally used to detect discrete neurotoxic damages, TSPO has generally turned into a biomarker of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation'. Psychiatric research has mostly accepted these denotations of TSPO, even if they may be inadequate and misleading under many pathological conditions. A reliable and neurobiologically meaningful diagnosis of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation' is unlikely to be achieved by the sole use of TSPO PET imaging. It is also very likely that the pathological meanings of altered TSPO binding or expression are disease-specific, and therefore, not easily generalizable across different neuropathologies or inflammatory conditions. This difficulty is intricately linked to the varying (and still ill-defined) physiological functions and cellular expression patterns of TSPO in health and disease. While altered TSPO binding or expression may indeed mirror ongoing neuroinflammatory processes in some cases, it may reflect other pathophysiological processes such as abnormalities in cell metabolism, energy production and oxidative stress in others. Hence, the increasing popularity of TSPO PET imaging has paradoxically introduced substantial uncertainty regarding the nature and meaning of neuroinflammatory processes and microglial activation in psychiatry, and likely in other neuropathological conditions as well. The ambiguity of conceiving TSPO simply as a biomarker of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation' calls for alternative interpretations and complimentary approaches. Without the latter, the ongoing scientific efforts and excitement surrounding the role of the neuroimmune system in psychiatry may not turn into therapeutic hope for affected individuals."}, {"Title": "Compulsivity-related neurocognitive performance deficits in gambling disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Compulsivity is a core feature of addictive disorders, including gambling disorder.

The data linking hearing impairment to incident late-life depression are more mixed but suggest that diminished hearing does increase risk for depression. Behavioral mechanisms may explain these associations, such as the withdrawal of older adults from situations in which they may have difficulty hearing and communicating, which may contribute to the development of social isolation, loneliness, and consequent cognitive decline and depression. At a neural level, chronic hearing loss leads to reduced activation in central auditory pathways, resulting in compensatory increased activation in the cognitive control network, dysfunctional auditory-limbic connectivity, and deafferentation-induced atrophy in frontal brain regions. These pathologic changes decrease cognitive performance and increase depression risk by reducing cognitive reserve, increasing executive dysfunction, and disrupting normative emotion reactivity and regulation. Based on the available data and informed by this model, evidence-based suggestions are proposed for clinicians treating older adults, and a research agenda is advanced to facilitate the development of rationally designed and age-appropriate psychiatric treatments for older adults with age-related hearing loss. First and foremost, treating hearing loss should be investigated as a means of improving cognitive and depressive outcomes in well-designed studies incorporating comprehensive psychiatric assessments, randomization, objective documentation of compliance, and analyses of treatment mediators that will facilitate further therapeutic development. Multimodal neuroimaging studies integrating audiometric, neuropsychological, and clinical assessments also are needed to further evaluate the model proposed.

This study was planned to explore the factors determining patient participation in clinical trials. A random sample of 123 consenting psychiatry inpatients were provided the information and consent-form of a hypothetical clinical drug trial. They were interviewed regarding their decision, the decision maker and factors that led to the decision. Family members tended to be the decision makers when patients were females, had low-income, were from rural background or had severe illnesses. Anticipated side effects and not wanting to interfere with existing treatment were the common reasons for refusal to participate while hope of betterment of the patient and benefit to humanity were cited for consent. The educated, urban, affluent class had more awareness regarding unethical trials and tended to be mistrustful of the medical community leading to higher rates of non-participation. Those who were adherent with ongoing treatment were also unwilling to participate. The lesser educated, low-income patients and rural domicile patients on the other hand had lesser awareness regarding clinical trials, trusted doctors and were more likely to participate. A good doctor-patient relationship, detailed explanations and clarification regarding the study and its conduct, and building awareness regarding clinical trials among vulnerable groups is necessary to ensure a valid consent involving no coercion, removal of prejudices, and ethical conduct of trials."}, {"Title": "Healing a Sick World: Psychiatric Medicine and the Atomic Age.", "Abstract": "The onset of nuclear warfare in Hiroshima and Nagasaki had far-reaching implications for the world of medicine. The study of the A-bomb and its implications led to the launching of new fields and avenues of research, most notably in genetics and radiation studies. Far less understood and under-studied was the impact of nuclear research on psychiatric medicine. Psychological research, however, was a major focus of post-war military and civilian research into the bomb. This research and the perceived revolutionary impact of atomic energy and warfare on society, this paper argues, played an important role in the global development of post-war psychiatry. Focusing on psychiatrists in North America, Japan and the United Nations, this paper examines the reaction of the profession to the nuclear age from the early post-war period to the mid 1960s. The way psychiatric medicine related to atomic issues, I argue, shifted significantly between the immediate post-war period and the 1960s. While the early post-war psychiatrists sought to help society deal with and adjust to the new nuclear reality, later psychiatrists moved towards a more radical position that sought to resist the establishment's efforts to normalise the bomb and nuclear energy. This shift had important consequences for research into the psychological trauma suffered by victims of nuclear warfare, which, ultimately, together with other research into the impact of war and systematic violence, led to our current understanding of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)."}, {"Title": "Boyish Mannerisms and Womanly Coquetry: Patients with the Diagnosis of Transvestitismus in the Helsinki Psychiatric Clinic in Finland, 1954-68.", "Abstract": "This article examines the case files of patients diagnosed with Transvestitismus [transvestism] in the Psychiatric Clinic of the Helsinki University Central Hospital in the years 1954-68. These individuals did not only want to cross-dress, but also had a strong feeling of being of a different sex from their assigned one. The scientific concept of transsexuality had begun to take form, and this knowledge reached Finland in phases. The case files of the transvestism patients show that they were highly aware of their condition and were very capable of describing it, even if they had no medical name for it. Psychiatrists were willing to engage in dialogue with the patients, and did not treat them as passive objects of study. Although some patients felt that they had been helped, many left the institution as frustrated, angered or desperate as before. They had sought medical help in the hope of having their bodies altered to correspond to their identity, but the Clinic psychiatrists insisted on seeing the problem in psychiatric terms and did not recommend surgical or hormonal treatments in most cases.

Some infrequent callers had gained skills through MCPAP before 2010 and now called only for complex cases. Other reasons for infrequent calling: PCPs have other consultation sources, have fear of being asked to manage more than they are comfortable, or have misperceptions of MCPAP's offerings.\nMCPAP enhanced PCPs' ability to deliver mental health care consistent with families' preferences. PCPs applied knowledge gained from calls to subsequent patients.

From a clinical, legal and ethical perspective, CCC continues to be a controversial practice in psychiatry, and perhaps even more so when applied to patients with severe substance use disorder (SUD). Several reasons make it controversial. The lack of consensus about the benefits of CCC and professional disagreement about what mental illness and autonomy mean in the case of SUD make it difficult to apply ethically sound clinical decision-making in CCC. Also, the medico-legal framework underlying CCC use sometimes appears to foster the use of reductionist clinical evaluation. Layered on top of these issues is how stakeholders view coercion. There is a discrepancy between clinicians' and patients' perception of coercion, which leads to clinician-patient differences on whether CCC is necessary. Moreover, the way in which the evaluation is typically carried out influences patients' perception of coercion and subsequently their motivation for participating fully in treatment. In this article, we explore the value of care ethics, often applied to care practices such as nursing, when applied to more procedural medical practices, such as decision-making regarding CCC. The care-ethical approach views decision-making as part of a dynamic care process, within which the lived experience, interpretative dialogue and promotion of dignity are core features. Embracing this new framework means a paradigm shift in when the therapeutic relationship begins, namely, investing in it occurs while conducting an evaluation for a possible CCC procedure. Unlike in current typical evaluations, early cultivation of the therapeutic relationship enables the patient to participate in the definition of his needs, reduces perceived coercion and negative emotions and enhances treatment motivation. Finally, implications of this novel approach for clinical practice are formulated and discussed."}, {"Title": "Simulating Clinical Psychiatry for Medical Students: a Comprehensive Clinic Simulator with Virtual Patients and an Electronic Medical Record System.", "Abstract": "A number of programs representing virtual patients for use in teaching settings have been developed in the field of psychiatry; however, they simulate only the interview process, not the entire scope of treatment.

This investigation aims to elucidate latent dimensions in the usage of \"understanding\" in psychiatry and psychotherapy. In more detail the operation of assignment and attribution will be discussed as well as the elucidation of individual meaning and supraindividual significance.\nThe term analysis shows that \"to understand\" as a predicate is gradually and polysemic; its definition must take the different logically additive meanings into account.

Finally, we outline \"understanding\" as a medical stance related to the healing relationship, which implies a disposition to get involved in a participative communication. We put forward the hypothesis that acceptance of the otherness of the patient, without the intention of a complete appropriation of meaning, could be noted as crucial feature of the anthropological approach.\nIn clinical medicine, especially in psychiatry, \"not understood\" is threefold: as \"misunderstanding\", as \"not-understanding\" (as a temporary lack of understanding), and as incomprehensibility (to understand, that there is nothing to be understood). Incomprehensibility may only allow for interpretative operations up to a certain limit. This unidirectional understanding as a diagnosing subsumption or as a psychological explanation in order to grasp meanings has to be completed by a bi-directional personal approach based on an engaging attitude (dialogical as well as quiescent) while acknowledging the incomprehensible.\nA second-person-perspective emphasizes the healing relationship as an existential encounter, especially in personal liminal situations for the patient. From an anthropological perspective \"to understand\" has not only to be grasped as a semantic agreement, but also as an attitude towards participative communication. That means a disposition to get involved in the encounter with the mentally ill without aiming for grasping rationally significances or even to attribute meanings. The stance therefore should be based on an awareness for the patient's idiosyncrasy as well as on the empathetic production of a shared space of resonance within the healing relationship."}, {"Title": "[Big data approaches in psychiatry: examples in depression research].", "Abstract": "The exploration and therapy of depression is aggravated by heterogeneous etiological mechanisms and various comorbidities.

All papers published before June 1st citing the target paper were independently rated by two investigators. The primary outcome coded dichotomously was whether the citation was used to justify a small or modest effect observed for a given treatment. Secondary outcomes regarded mentioning any caveats when citing the target paper, the point the citation was making (treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine, others), the type of condition (psychiatric, medical or both), specific disease, treatment category and specific type. We also extracted information about the type of citing paper, financial conflict of interest (COI) declared and any industry support.

We sought to gather information on the specific problems and needs occurring during the transition of mentally ill adolescents from child and adolescent to adult psychiatry.\nProfessionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists) working in child and adolescent psychiatry and adult psychiatry (N = 86) were assessed by means of an online survey concerning their experience with the transition of young adults.\nAlmost all of the subjects queried (98.8 %) considered the current system inappropriate, and the majority (70.9 %) thought that patients would not tolerate transition from youth to adult psychiatric institutions very well. Only 16.3 % reported having a structured transition protocol at their workplace. Further 83.7 % expressed the need to improve collaboration between adolescent and adult psychiatry.\nThis sample of Austrian healthcare professionals describes large deficits regarding transitional issues in psychiatry. There is an urgent need to establish structured protocols for transition, especially since experiences occurring during this vulnerable period are crucial to the mental health of young people later in life."}, {"Title": "Delirium is associated with increased mortality in the geriatric population.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of delirium and its association with mortality rates in elderly inpatients.\nThe medical records of 1435 patients over 65\u00a0years old who were treated at a regional university hospital and were referred to the university's Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry Clinic for psychological evaluation were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with and without a diagnosis of delirium were compared. The National Survival Database was used to determine mortality rates.\nThe prevalence of delirium was 25.5%. The delirium group was older (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and had a larger proportion of males (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Mortality rate was higher in the delirium group at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\u00a0years (p\u2009<\u2009.0001 for all). Age, gender, lower urinary system diseases, chronic liver disease, solid hematologic malignancy, infections, and Alzheimer's disease emerged as significant parameters associated with mortality. Multivariate analysis of these parameters indicated that comorbid diseases (lower urinary system diseases, chronic liver disease, solid hematologic malignancy, infections, and Alzheimer's disease) are risk factors for mortality independent of demographic data such as age and gender.\nIndependent of all other factors, delirium is associated with higher mortality risk."}, {"Title": "Impact of SSRI Therapy on Risk of Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Dementia in Individuals With Previous Depression.", "Abstract": "Depression is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Research has shown that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram decreases amyloid-\u03b2 generation and plaque load. The authors evaluated the impact of SSRI treatment on CSF biomarkers and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's dementia.\nData sets from 755 currently nondepressed participants from the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and analyses of variance and covariance with ApoE4 status and age as covariates.\nIn MCI patients with a history of depression, long-term SSRI treatment (>4 years) was significantly associated with a delayed progression to Alzheimer's dementia by approximately 3 years, compared with short-term SSRI treatment, treatment with other antidepressants, or no treatment and compared with MCI patients without a history of depression. No differences in CSF biomarker levels were observed between treatment groups.\nLong-term SSRI treatment may delay progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia."}, {"Title": "Cost Analysis of Community Based Family Support of Patients with Severe Mental Illness.", "Abstract": "Community-based family support is a new option to patients with severe mental illness in which the patient and a volunteer family meet on a regular basic. This study examined whether this support could reduce patients' use of psychiatric services. This matched case-control study included 86 patients with severe mental illness. 40 patients were offered the intervention: community-based family support intervention. Patients' use of psychiatric hospital services was followed from 2 years before to 2 years after the intervention using a difference-in-difference analytical approach. Although community-based family support seemed to reduce hospital admission, the reduction in cost did not compensate the cost of the programme. However, this does not rule out the potential cost effectiveness, and future studies should assess the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of community-based family support. The present study does not provide sufficient basis for recommending the general implementation of community-based family support."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disease in an adolescent as a harbinger of cerebral X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.", "Abstract": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD) typically presents as a childhood cerebral demyelinating form, as an adult-onset adrenomyeloneuropathy or as adrenocortical insufficiency. Cerebral demyelination presenting in adolescence is unusual. We present an 17-year-old boy with adolescent-onset XALD initially manifesting with slowly progressive psychiatric symptoms. He was initially diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and an acute psychosis. However, he was ultimately diagnosed with XALD based on his clinical course, neuroimaging findings and biochemical abnormalities. This case reiterates the atypical presentations of adolescent-onset cerebral XALD that may go unrecognised and misdiagnosed as a neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disease. Treatments for cerebral ALD are potentially life-saving, particularly when given early in the disease course."}, {"Title": "A right amygdalohippocampectomy: A diagnostic challenge.", "Abstract": "Amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) is the resective surgery for medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. To date no study has investigated a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms in right AHE outpatients.\nThree patients with right AHE participated in this study. The control group are patients with cognitive complaints with no history of epilepsy or neurological impairment and no structural abnormalities on the MRI/CT. We expected no difference in verbal memory compared to the controls. Concerning affective Theory of Mind (ToM) we expect a difference between controls and AHE patients. In terms of behavior it is expected that coping and behavioral questionnaires do not significantly differ between AHE and controls, but that proxies of AHE patients do report more behavioral/psychiatric symptoms.\nNo significant difference was found between groups concerning the cognitive functions. For affective ToM we did find a significant difference (p=0.044). A significant difference for the use of more reassuring thoughts (p=0.006) and a trend for less passive reactions on the coping questionnaire, suggesting an 'active coping style'. Overall, AHE patients report fewer problems the self- reported questionnaires. Proxies of the AHE patients reported a trend for more behavioral disinhibition compared to proxy ratings of the control group.\nRight AHE patients underestimate their behavioral and emotional changes due to self-awareness deficits. Ratings of significant others are of immense importance for the detection of psychiatric and behavioral problems.

Of these, some may report patterns that are inconsistent with typical patterns of depressive symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the validity of person-fit statistics to identify inconsistent symptom reports and to assess the clinical usefulness of providing clinicians with person-fit score feedback during depression assessment.\nInconsistent symptom reports on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR) were investigated quantitatively with person-fit statistics for both intake and follow-up measurements in the Groningen University Center of Psychiatry (n = 2036). Subsequently, to investigate the causes and clinical usefulness of on-the-fly person-fit alerts, qualitative follow-up assessments were conducted with three psychiatrists about 20 of their patients that were randomly selected.\nInconsistent symptom reports at intake (12.3%) were predominantly characterized by reporting of severe symptoms (e.g. psychomotor slowing) without mild symptoms (e.g. irritability). Person-fit scores at intake and follow-up were positively correlated (r = 0.45). Qualitative interviews with psychiatrists resulted in an explanation for the inconsistent response behavior (e.g. complex comorbidity, somatic complaints, and neurological abnormalities) for 19 of 20 patients. Psychiatrists indicated that if provided directly after the assessment, a person-fit alert would have led to new insights in 60%, and be reason for discussion with the patient in 75% of the cases.\nProviding clinicians with automated feedback when inconsistent symptom reports occur is informative and can be used to support clinical decision-making."}, {"Title": "A Mother's Love? Postpartum Disorders, the DSM-5 and Criminal Responsibility\u00a0-\u00a0A South African Medicolegal Perspective.", "Abstract": "The interface between criminal law and the field of psychiatry has manifested predominantly with reference to the defence of pathological criminal incapacity, more commonly referred to as the insanity defence. The threshold requirement for establishing the defence of pathological criminal incapacity entails that the accused at the time of the commission of the offence should have suffered from a 'mental illness' or 'mental defect'. Once it is established that the accused suffered from a mental illness or mental defect at the time of the commission of the offence, an assessment is conducted to determine whether the illness or defect rendered the accused either incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of the act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation. The problem that inevitably arises during the assessment of the defence relates to the fact that the terms 'mental illness' and 'mental defect' are not defined. Mental health practitioners mainly rely on the DSM for answers, yet the DSM cautions that the disorders contained may not be wholly relevant for legal purposes. Postpartum disorders are generally classified as postpartum depression and the more serious manifestation, postpartum psychosis. Postpartum disorders were not provided for in the DSM-IV (1994) or the DSM-IV-TR (2000) as distinct mental disorders. The DSM-5 came into operation in 2013, and yet again these disorders fall outside the scope of the DSM-5. Research indicates that the mental health professional plays a vital and pivotal role in explaining these disorders and the various complexities associated with them. The focus of this article is to illustrate the phenomena of postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis against the backdrop of the defence of pathological criminal incapacity within the context of South African criminal law. The vital and essential role of the mental health expert within this context is explored."}, {"Title": "SLC6A3 polymorphism and response to methylphenidate in children with ADHD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most commonly used treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. However, the response to MPH is not similar in all patients. This meta-analysis investigated the potential role of SLC6A3 polymorphisms in response to MPH in children with ADHD. Clinical trials or naturalistic studies were selected from electronic databases. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Cohen's d effect size and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were performed. Q-statistic and Egger's tests were conducted to evaluate heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the quality of evidence. Sixteen studies with follow-up periods of 1-28 weeks were eligible. The mean treatment acceptability of MPH was 97.2%. In contrast to clinical trials, the meta-analysis of naturalistic studies indicated that children without 10/10 repeat carriers had better response to MPH (Cohen's d: -0.09 and 0.44, respectively). The 9/9 repeat polymorphism had no effect on the response rate (Cohen's d: -0.43). In the meta-regression, a significant association was observed between baseline severity of ADHD, MPH dosage, and combined type of ADHD in some genetic models. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of our findings. No publication bias was observed in our meta-analysis. The GRADE evaluations revealed very low levels of confidence for each outcome of response to MPH. The results of clinical trials and naturalistic studies regarding the effect size between different polymorphisms of SLC6A3 were contradictory. Therefore, further research is recommended."}, {"Title": "Basal blood DHEA-S/cortisol levels predicts EMDR treatment response in adolescents with PTSD.", "Abstract": "In literature, recent evidence has shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can be dysregulated in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HPA axis hormones may predict the psychotherapy treatment response in patients with PTSD. In this study, it was aimed to investigate changing cortisol and DHEA-S levels post-eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and the relationship between treatment response and basal cortisol, and DHEA-S levels before treatment.\nThe study group comprised 40 adolescents (age, 12-18 years) with PTSD. The PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPSRI) and the blood cortisol and DHEA-S were measured with the chemiluminescence method before and after treatment. A maximum of six sessions of EMDR therapy were conducted by an EMDR level-1 trained child psychiatry resident. Treatment response was measured by the pre- to post-treatment decrease in self-reported and clinical PTSD severity.\nPre- and post-treatment DHEA-S and cortisol levels did not show any statistically significant difference. Pre-treatment CDI scores were negatively correlated with pre-treatment DHEA-S levels (r: -0.39). ROC analysis demonstrated that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio predicts treatment response at a medium level (AUC: 0.703, p: .030, sensitivity: 0.65, specificity: 0.86).\nThe results of this study suggested that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio may predict treatment response in adolescents with PTSD receiving EMDR therapy. The biochemical parameter of HPA-axis activity appears to be an important predictor of positive clinical response in adolescent PTSD patients, and could be used in clinical practice to predict PTSD treatment in the future."}, {"Title": "Corrigendum.", "Abstract": "Corrigendum to: Carter G, Page A, Large M, et al.

Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes. One such feature is persistent mood instability, and efforts are underway to understand its mechanisms and its therapeutic potential.

Thus, we investigated this association among adults aged \u226550 years across six LMICs.\nA cross-sectional analysis using data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa) was conducted. A perceived stress score [range 0 (lowest stress) -100 (highest stress)] was computed based on two questions from the Perceived Stress Scale. Thirteen chronic conditions were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted.\n34,129 adults with a mean age of 62.4 (SD=16.0)years (52.1% females) were included. Overall, 56.6% (95% CI=55.0%-58.2%) had multimorbidity. In the adjusted model including all countries, compared with those with no chronic conditions, higher numbers of chronic conditions were significantly associated with higher stress levels, dose dependently. In a countrywide meta-analysis, multimorbidity was associated with significantly higher stress levels in all countries (especially India and Ghana) although characterized by moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=54.6%). For single chronic conditions, notably high stress scores were observed for depression, stroke, and hearing problems.\nChronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with higher levels of stress in older adults in LMICs.

The enlightened discussion of 60 clinicopathological cases provided by Louis Florentin Calmeil in his 1826 treatise greatly improved our knowledge of general paralysis. However, Calmeil was unable to relate this symptom to syphilis, although the latter was quite widespread at that time. Following a detailed reanalysis of Calmeil's observations with special attention to his clinical and demographic data, we conclude that this eminent clinician was unable to define the cause of general paralysis because his early 19th century mind was still under the influence of traditional knowledge and moral prejudices. For Calmeil, general paralysis belonged entirely to the realm of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Developing End-of-Training Entrustable Professional Activities for Psychiatry: Results and Methodological Lessons.", "Abstract": "To develop entrustable professional activities (EPAs) for psychiatry and to demonstrate an innovative, validity-enhancing methodology that may be relevant to other specialties.\nA national task force employed a three-stage process from May 2014 to February 2017 to develop EPAs for psychiatry.

In stage 2, the task force interviewed four nonpsychiatric experts in EPAs and further revised the EPAs. In stage 3, the task force performed a Delphi study of national experts in psychiatric education and assessment. All survey participants completed a brief training program on EPAs. Quantitative and qualitative analysis led to further modifications. Essentialness was measured on a five-point scale. EPAs were included if the content validity index was at least 0.8 and the lower end of the asymmetric confidence interval was not lower than 4.0.\nStages 1 and 2 yielded 24 and 14 EPAs, respectively.

However, this is not a common practice in psychiatric genetics research. Furthermore, psychiatry researchers often generate findings that do not meet all of these criteria, yet there may be ethically compelling arguments to offer selected results. Here, we review the return of results debate in genomics research and propose that, as for genomic studies of other medical conditions, psychiatric genomics researchers should offer findings that meet the minimum criteria stated above. Additionally, if resources allow, psychiatry researchers could consider offering to return pre-specified 'clinically valuable' findings even if not medically actionable-for instance, findings that help corroborate a psychiatric diagnosis, and findings that indicate important health risks. Similarly, we propose offering 'likely clinically valuable' findings, specifically, variants of uncertain significance potentially related to a participant's symptoms. The goal of this Perspective is to initiate a discussion that can help identify optimal ways of managing the return of results from psychiatric genomics research."}, {"Title": "Definition of Traumatic Brain Injury, Neurosurgery, Trauma Orthopedics, Neuroimaging, Psychology, and Psychiatry in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.", "Abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts the normal function of the brain. This condition can adversely affect a person's quality of life with cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physical symptoms that limit interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning. Although many systems exist, the simplest classification includes mild, moderate, and severe TBI depending on the nature of injury and the impact on the patient's clinical status. Patients with TBI require prompt evaluation and multidisciplinary management. Aside from the type and severity of the TBI, recovery is influenced by individual patient characteristics, social and environmental factors, and access to medical and rehabilitation services."}, {"Title": "Everywhere and Nowhere: Grief in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Pediatric Clinical Populations.", "Abstract": "Grief is ubiquitous in the experience of children and adolescents with illness but not always recognized or named, and as a result grief is not always treated effectively by child/adolescent psychiatrists or pediatricians.

To assess medication exposure for psychotropic and other medication classes, we enrolled 115 highly adherent psychiatry patients prescribed five or more medications. In these patients, we measured 21 psychotropic and 38 nonpsychotropic medications comprising a 59 medication multiplex assay panel. Strict enrollment criteria and reconciliation of the electronic health record medication list prior to study initiation produced a patient cohort that was adherent with 91% of their prescribed medications as determined by comparing medications detected empirically in blood to the electronic health record medication list. In addition, 13% of detected medications were not in the electronic health record medication list. We found that only 53% of detected medications were within the literature-derived reference range with 41% below and 6% above the reference range specific to each medication. When psychotropic medications were analyzed near trough-level, only sertraline was found to be within the literature-derived reference range for all patients tested. Concentrations of the remaining medications indicated extensive exposure below the reference range. This is the first study to empirically and comprehensively assess medication exposure obtained in comorbid polypharmacy patients, minimizing the important behavioral factor of adherence in the study of medication exposure. These data indicate that low medication exposure is extensive and must be considered when therapeutic issues arise, including the lack of response to medication therapy."}, {"Title": "Validity of routine clinical diagnoses in acute psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "To examine the validity of diagnoses obtained by clinicians during routine clinical examination on acute psychiatric inpatient wards.\nN=100 inpatients with a broad spectrum of major mental disorders were randomly selected in a mental hospital's department of general psychiatry.

A likely neural substrate for these motivational deficits is the brain dopamine (DA) system. In particular, DA signalling in the nucleus accumbens, which originates from DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), has been identified as a crucial substrate for effort-related and activational aspects of motivation. Unravelling how VTA DA neuronal activity relates to motivational behaviours is required to understand how motivational deficits in psychiatry can be specifically targeted. In this study, we therefore used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) in TH:Cre rats, in order to determine the effects of chemogenetic DA neuron activation on different aspects of motivational behaviour. We found that chemogenetic activation of DA neurons in the VTA, but not substantia nigra, significantly increased responding for sucrose under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. More specifically, high effort exertion was characterized by increased initiations of reward-seeking actions. This effect was dependent on effort requirements and instrumental contingencies, but was not affected by sucrose pre-feeding. Together, these findings indicate that VTA DA neuronal activation drives motivational behaviour by facilitating action initiation. With this study, we show that enhancing excitability of VTA DA neurons is a viable strategy to improve motivational behaviour."}, {"Title": "Increasing HIV Testing in Inpatient Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "People with serious mental illness (SMI) are at elevated risk of HIV infection, but do not receive HIV tests regularly.

Relationships among interventions, length of stay, patient demographics, and receipt of an HIV test were examined using general estimating equation methods.\nIn the year prior to the intervention, 7.2% of psychiatric inpatients received HIV tests. After 1 year of administrative advocacy, 11.2% received tests. Following the HIV counseling intervention, 25.1% of patients were tested. After the counseling intervention ended, continued administrative and clinical advocacy was associated with further increases in testing. In the final year studied, 30.3% of patients received HIV tests. Patients with shorter inpatient stays and those of Black or Asian race/ethnicity were less likely to be tested. Further, 1.6% of HIV tests were positive.\nThree interventions of varying intensity were associated with a 5-fold increase in HIV testing on an acute inpatient psychiatry service.

Bulgarians struggling with psychological disorders in the present day experience polar forms of marginalization: non-recognition on one extreme, and chronic medicalization on the other. Both tendencies can be traced to the Communist-period remodeling of mental healthcare, which outlawed private practice and individual-centered therapy, which reified empirically observable, physiological underpinnings of pathology while suppressing therapies that engaged with the existential context of mental illness. I argue that the reproduction of a Soviet psychiatric model instigated a modernization process but failed to anticipate the idiosyncrasy of economic and social conditions within the country. Furthermore, that this model rejected a therapeutic focus on the individual but developed no effective alternative for identifying and treating subjective characteristics of mental illness. Bulgaria's history of psychiatry has received little scholarly attention beyond Bulgarian psychiatrists who documented the development of their field. This article presents archival, literary and oral history footholds towards the development of a social history of Bulgarian psychiatry-a perspective that is especially and problematically missing."}, {"Title": "Impact of oral ketamine augmentation on hospital admissions in treatment-resistant depression and PTSD: a retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Depressive episodes are the leading cause of mental health-related hospital admissions in Australia, and 44% of those admitted have a previous history of hospitalisations for depression (Admitted patient mental health-related care: (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Aust Hospital Stat 2011-12, 2013). Despite numerous available antidepressant treatments, many patients do not respond to conventional therapy, having what is called 'treatment resistance' (Fava Biol Psychiatry 53:649-659, 2003). In recent years, ketamine has risen to prominence as an effective, rapidly acting antidepressant (Ketamine: a light in the darkness: Paleos and Ross 28-33, 2013). However, customary intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes of administration and relapse rates after cessation remain barriers to more widely adopted usage.\nThis study represents the largest retrospective review of patients receiving long-term oral ketamine for treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our purpose was to examine the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine therapy in an outpatient setting as measured by changes in hospitalisation for psychiatric episodes.\nHospital records of 37 patients who received oral ketamine treatment were reviewed to compare the number and duration of psychiatric hospital admissions before and after treatment. Records were also screened for adverse medical events and changes in ketamine dosage over time.\nFollowing treatment, inpatient hospital days were reduced by 70%, and hospital admissions were reduced by 65%. The dose of ketamine patients required was stable over time with no evidence of tolerance building. There were no serious adverse events and no long-term negative effects associated with ketamine.\nOral ketamine offers a promising pharmacologic adjunct to depression treatment. It may offer a more approachable alternative to IV or IM ketamine. The results warrant further investigation into the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine for psychiatric treatment."}, {"Title": "Atypical depression and non-atypical depression: Is HPA axis function a biomarker? A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The link between the abnormalities of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and depression has been one of the most consistently reported findings in psychiatry. At the same time, multiple studies have demonstrated a stronger association between the increased activation of HPA-axis and melancholic, or endogenous depression subtype. This association has not been confirmed for the atypical subtype, and some researchers have suggested that as an antinomic depressive subtype, it may be associated with the opposite type, i.e. hypo-function, of the HPA-axis, similarly to PTSD. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarise existing studies addressing the abnormalities of the HPA-axis in melancholic and/or atypical depression.\nWe conducted a systematic review in the literature by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OvidSP and Embase databases until June 2017. The following search items were used: \"hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\" OR \"HPA\" OR \"cortisol\" OR \"corticotropin releasing hormone\" OR \"corticotropin releasing factor\" OR \"glucocorticoid*\" OR \"adrenocorticotropic hormone\" OR \"ACTH\" AND \"atypical depression\" OR \"non-atypical depression\" OR \"melancholic depression\" OR \"non-melancholic depression\" OR \"endogenous depression\" OR \"endogenomorphic depression\" OR \"non-endogenous depression\". Search limits were set to include papers in English or German language published in peer-reviewed journals at any period. All studies were scrutinized to determine the main methodological characteristics, and particularly possible sources of bias influencing the results reported.\nWe selected 48 relevant studies. Detailed analysis of the methodologies used in the studies revealed significant variability especially regarding the samples' definition comparing the HPA axis activity of melancholic patients to atypical depression, including healthy controls. The results were subdivided into 4 sections: (1) 27 studies which compared melancholic OR endogenous depression vs. non-melancholic or non-endogenous depression or controls; (2) 9 studies which compared atypical depression or atypical traits vs. non-atypical depression or controls; (3) 7 studies which compared melancholic or endogenous and atypical depression subtypes and (4) 5 studies which used a longitudinal design, comparing the measures of HPA-axis across two or more time points. While the majority of studies did confirm the association between melancholic depression and increased post-challenge cortisol levels, the association with increases in basal cortisol and basal ACTH were less consistent. Some studies, particularly those focusing on reversed vegetative symptoms, demonstrated a decrease in the activity of the HPA axis in atypical depression compared to controls, but the majority did not distinguish it from healthy controls.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that there is a difference in the activity of the HPA-axis between melancholic and atypical depressive subtypes. However, these are more likely explained by hypercortisolism in melancholia; and most often normal than decreased function in atypical depression. Further research should seek to distinguish a particular subtype of depression linked to HPA-axis abnormalities, based on symptom profile, with a focus on vegetative symptoms, neuroendocrine probes, and the history of adverse childhood events. New insights into the dichotomy addressed in this review might be obtained from genetic and epigenetic studies of HPA-axis related genes in both subtypes, with an emphasis on the presence of vegetative symptoms."}, {"Title": "Human Accelerated Regions and Other Human-Specific Sequence Variations in the Context of Evolution and Their Relevance for Brain Development.", "Abstract": "The review discusses, in a format of a timeline, the studies of different types of genetic variants, present in Homo sapiens, but absent in all other primate, mammalian, or vertebrate species, tested so far. The main characteristic of these variants is that they are found in regions of high evolutionary conservation. These sequence variations include single nucleotide substitutions (called human accelerated regions), deletions, and segmental duplications. The rationale for finding such variations in the human genome is that they could be responsible for traits, specific to our species, of which the human brain is the most remarkable. As became obvious, the vast majority of human-specific single nucleotide substitutions are found in noncoding, likely regulatory regions. A number of genes, associated with these human-specific alleles, often through novel enhancer activity, were in fact shown to be implicated in human-specific development of certain brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex. Human-specific deletions may remove regulatory sequences, such as enhancers. Segmental duplications, because of their large size, create new coding sequences, like new functional paralogs. Further functional study of these variants will shed light on evolution of our species, as well as on the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Plasma copeptin levels in patients with restless legs syndrome.", "Abstract": "Copeptin, the C-terminal fragment of antidiuretic hormone, is a new biomarker that has been found to be elevated in several disorders and could be related with prognosis.

RLS patients were divided into subgroups as mild-moderate, severe, and very severe according to the severity of symptoms. Sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness were determined according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, respectively, and sleep quality scores were analyzed statistically among the groups divided according to disease severity. Copeptin levels in all the patients were compared to the controls. RLS subgroups were compared with each other to evaluate association between copeptin levels and disease severity.\nPlasma copeptin levels in RLS patients were significantly higher than controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). However, there was no association between copeptin levels and disease severity. Excessive daytime sleepiness was found as 14.63% and low sleep quality as 68.29% in patients.\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation and sympathetic hyperactivity in RLS might be responsible for increased Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and copeptin release. We think that copeptin might have a potential role in the pathogenesis of RLS and be a biomarker for this disease."}, {"Title": "The Neurodevelopmental Basis of Early Childhood Disruptive Behavior: Irritable and Callous Phenotypes as Exemplars.", "Abstract": "The arrival of the Journal's 175th anniversary occurs at a time of recent advances in research, providing an ideal opportunity to present a neurodevelopmental roadmap for understanding, preventing, and treating psychiatric disorders. Such a roadmap is particularly relevant for early-childhood-onset neurodevelopmental conditions, which emerge when experience-dependent neuroplasticity is at its peak. Employing a novel developmental specification approach, this review places recent neurodevelopmental research on early childhood disruptive behavior within the historical context of the Journal. The authors highlight irritability and callous behavior as two core exemplars of early disruptive behavior. Both phenotypes can be reliably differentiated from normative variation as early as the first years of life. Both link to discrete pathophysiology: irritability with disruptions in prefrontal regulation of emotion, and callous behavior with abnormal fear processing. Each phenotype also possesses clinical and predictive utility. Based on a nomologic net of evidence, the authors conclude that early disruptive behavior is neurodevelopmental in nature and should be reclassified as an early-childhood-onset neurodevelopmental condition in DSM-5. Rapid translation from neurodevelopmental discovery to clinical application has transformative potential for psychiatric approaches of the millennium.

Exploiting existing European infrastructures and initiatives, we hope to make major conceptual, methodological and analytical contributions towards large integrative cohorts and their efficient exploitation. We will thus provide novel information on BCM health maintenance, as well as the onset and course of BCM disorders. This will lay a foundation for earlier diagnosis of brain disorders, aberrant development and decline of BCM health, and translate into future preventive and therapeutic strategies. Aiming to improve clinical practice and public health we will work with stakeholders and health authorities, and thus provide the evidence base for prevention and intervention."}, {"Title": "Suicides by hanging and its association with meteorological conditions in S\u00e3o Paulo.", "Abstract": "The main goal of this study was to evaluate the association between daily cases of hanging suicides and meteorological conditions in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

For each MS patient, we selected five controls using density sampling from the entire Danish population, matching controls to children with MS by sex and birthdate. We analyzed data as a nested case-control study with psychiatric morbidity as exposure and MS as outcome, and a matched cohort study with MS as exposure and psychiatric co-morbidity as outcome. Hazard ratios (HR) including 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression.\nWe identified 212 children with MS and 1060 controls. No association between psychiatric morbidity and the rate of MS was found before MS onset. After MS onset, children with MS had two times higher hazard for psychiatric co-morbidity compared with children without MS (HR=2.0; 95% CI=1.3-3.1; p<0.001).\nPsychiatric morbidity seems to commence after MS onset, making screening for neuropsychiatric conditions pertinent in newly-diagnosed children with MS."}, {"Title": "Syncope in Pediatric Practice.", "Abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, self-limited loss of consciousness and postural tone followed by spontaneous and complete recovery without any neurological sequelae. It is one of the most common paroxysmal disorders in children and adolescents. The three major causes of syncope in children are neural, cardiovascular and other non-cardiovascular causes. The common unifying mechanism is transient global hypoperfusion of the brain. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and objective laboratory investigations add little to the diagnosis in children especially in neurocardiogenic subtype. Specific management depends on the underlying cause of syncope in children. For cardiac causes, management includes early referral to the pediatric cardiology specialist. When paroxysmal non-epileptic events are suspected, child psychology or psychiatry consultation should be sought to identify the stressors and counseling. For neurocardiogenic syncope, the main objective of treatment is to prevent recurrent events to improve the quality of life, psychological stress and school absenteeism by behavior and lifestyle modifications followed by drugs in refractory cases. The prognosis is excellent for neurocardiogenic syncope and is variable based on the underlying pathology in cardiogenic cases. As syncope is not a disease in itself but a symptom of an underlying disorder; hence, all children with syncope require assessment to exclude an underlying life-threatening cardiac or non-cardiac disorder."}, {"Title": "[The Dawn of Modernity: Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\" and the Tradition of Genetic Understanding].", "Abstract": "\"The Decameron\" by Giovanni Boccaccio is a work which stands between the Middle Ages and Modernity.

Because attitudes are formed early in life, the current study aimed to investigate if teaching psychiatry in secondary school nursing students (i.e., adolescents) changes attitudes toward three prevalent psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. A pilot quasi-experimental study was conducted with 51 fourth-year students in secondary nursing school who completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes toward these disorders on the first and last day of their Nursing in Psychiatry course. Results show that the stigma attached to all three disorders was significantly reduced after students completed the course. Students attached greater stigma to schizophrenia than PTSD, and to PTSD than depression, before and after the course. The study indicates that education in psychiatry helps reduce negative attitudes toward PTSD, schizophrenia, and depression.

Several clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong association between depressive symptoms and the expression of factors that increase inflammation. Conversely, administration of anti-inflammatory agents has been shown to ameliorate depressive symptoms, demonstrating the importance of inflammation as a mediator of depression. Although it is clear that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, the mechanism by which inflammation is activated in mood disorders remains unclear. To address this issue, studies have investigated the role of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation in stress-induced inflammation and mood disorders. However, the identification of the endogenous factors, referred to as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) that activate these receptors remains understudied. Here we review the role of DAMPs in depression and highlight the clinical evidence for elevation of DAMP signaling in MDD patients and in pre-clinical animal stress models of depression."}, {"Title": "[The psychiatric comorbidity of anorexia nervosa: A comparative study in a population of French and Greek anorexic patients].", "Abstract": "The current study had two objectives: (1) to access the psychiatric comorbidity in axis I and axis II (according to DSM-IV) of anorexia nervosa in a sample of 60 anorexic patients; (2) to compare the features of the psychiatric comorbidity between the two groups of French and Greek anorexic patients who participated in the study, as well as to compare some psychological and behavioral aspects of their anorectic psychopathology.\nSixty anorexic patients, thirty French and thirty Greek, aged between 18 and 60 years, referred for evaluation and therapy at the unit of eating disorders at the \"Institut national Marcel-Rivi\u00e8re of the MGEN\" (h\u00f4pital de La Verri\u00e8re, France) and at the unit of eating disorders of the First Department of Psychiatry of EGINITIO University Psychiatric Hospital in Athens (Greece), were accessed with the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT26), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL90R), Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Version 5.0.0 and the International Personality Disorder Examination.\nThe comparison between the Greek and French patient populations did not show significant differences in age, socio-educational status, family status and BMI. French patients were hospitalized more regularly than Greek patients (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> (1)=6.65, P=0.01) and psychotropic drug therapy was more common in French anorexic patients (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> (1)=4.59, P=0.06). The results of the EAT 26 questionnaire in Greek and French patients show an average of 34.93 (\u00b118.54) in total, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The results of EDI show a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the subscale 3 (body dissatisfaction) in which the Greeks scored on average at 9.40 and the French at 14.90 (t (58)=3.09, P<0.01). According to the results of the MINI scale, 47% of the patients in our total sample had a restrictive anorexia nervosa and 47% had anorexia nervosa of binge-eating/purging type. The most frequent comorbid disorder was the major depressive episode (40%) and the obsessive compulsive disorder (18.3%). The only statistically significant difference between the two groups was the frequency of the major depressive episode, which appeared statistically higher among the French (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> (1)=6.94, P=0.01). According to the results of IPDE, 73.3% of patients in total (76.6% of the French and 70% of the Greeks) showed a personality disorder. The most common personality disorder was borderline personality disorder (40%), followed by obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (26.6%) and avoidant personality disorder (21.7%), with no statistically significant differences between the two groups.\nThe profile of anorexic patients who are addressed to the specialized units of eating disorders in both cities (Paris, Athens) had many points in common (demographic parameters, BMI, subtype of anorexia). The results of the EAT-26 and EDI questionnaires did not differ between the two groups, except for the EDI questionnaire subscale 3, which showed body dissatisfaction, where the French had higher scores; this fact underlines the influence of cultural factors on some psychological and behavioral aspects of the psychopathology of the anorexia nervosa. The rates of comorbidity of anorexia nervosa in axis I and axis II found in our study are in agreement with data from various literature reviews and studies in the recent years. The most interesting point of the comorbidity comparison on axis I between the two groups of patients concerns the difference in the frequency of the major depressive episode, for which the results show higher rates in French patients. We can consider that this finding follows the general trend of mood disorder rates in Western countries and we can assume an explanation based on cultural influences. Finally, we can consider that the differences concerning the hospitalization of French patients in a more regular way than Greek patients and the higher rates of psychotropic treatment in French patients reflect the differences in the health systems between the two countries.\nOur study has shown high rates of major depressive episode, as well as personality disorders. There were statistically significant differences in four parameters between our two patient groups, explained by the influence of cultural factors."}, {"Title": "Garcinia mangostana Linn displays antidepressant-like and pro-cognitive effects in a genetic animal model of depression: a bio-behavioral study in the Flinders Sensitive Line rat.", "Abstract": "There is abundant evidence for both disorganized redox balance and cognitive deficits in major depressive disorder (MDD). Garcinia mangostana Linn (GM) has anti-oxidant activity. We studied the antidepressant-like and pro-cognitive effects of raw GM rind in Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a genetic model of depression, following acute and chronic treatment compared to a reference antidepressant, imipramine (IMI). The chemical composition of the GM extract was analysed for levels of \u03b1- and \u03b3-mangostin. The acute dose-dependent effects of GM (50, 150 and 200\u00a0mg/kg po), IMI (20\u00a0mg/kg po) and vehicle were determined in the forced swim test (FST) in FSL rats, versus Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) control rats. Locomotor testing was conducted using the open field test (OFT). Using the most effective dose above coupled with behavioral testing in the FST and cognitive assessment in the novel object recognition test (nORT), a fixed dose 14-day treatment study of GM was performed and compared to IMI- (20\u00a0mg/kg/day) and vehicle-treated animals. Chronic treated animals were also assessed with respect to frontal cortex and hippocampal monoamine levels and accumulation of malondialdehyde. FSL rats showed significant cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior, with disordered cortico-hippocampal 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and noradrenaline (NA), as well as elevated hippocampal lipid peroxidation. Acute and chronic IMI treatment evoked pronounced antidepressant-like effects. Raw GM extract contained 117\u00a0mg/g and 11\u00a0mg/g \u03b1- and \u03b3-mangostin, respectively, with acute GM demonstrating antidepressant-like effects at 50\u00a0mg/kg/day. Chronic GM (50\u00a0mg/kg/d) displayed significant antidepressant- and pro-cognitive effects, while demonstrating parity with IMI. Both behavioral and monoamine assessments suggest a more prominent serotonergic action for GM as opposed to a noradrenergic action for IMI, while both IMI and GM reversed hippocampal lipid peroxidation in FSL animals. Concluding, FSL rats present with cognitive deficits and depressive-like behaviors that are reversed by acute and chronic GM treatment, similar to that of IMI."}, {"Title": "Heritable Variation, With Little or No Maternal Effect, Accounts for Recurrence Risk to Autism Spectrum Disorder in Sweden.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has both genetic and environmental origins, including potentially maternal effects. Maternal effects describe the association of one or more maternal phenotypes with liability to ASD in progeny that are independent of maternally transmitted risk alleles. While maternal effects could play an important role, consistent with association to maternal traits such as immune status, no study has estimated maternal, additive genetic, and environmental effects in ASD.\nUsing a population-based sample consisting of all children born in Sweden from 1998 to 2007 and their relatives, we fitted statistical models to family data to estimate the variance in ASD liability originating from maternal, additive genetic, and shared environmental effects. We calculated sibling and cousin family recurrence risk ratio as a direct measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk factors and repeated the calculations on diagnostic subgroups, specifically autistic disorder (AD) and spectrum disorder (SD), which included Asperger's syndrome and/or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\nThe sample consisted of 776,212 children of whom 11,231 had a diagnosis of ASD: 4554 with AD, 6677 with SD. We found support for large additive genetic contribution to liability; heritability (95% confidence interval [CI]) was estimated to 84.8% (95% CI: 73.1-87.3) for ASD, 79.6% (95% CI: 61.2-85.1) for AD, and 76.4% (95% CI: 63.0-82.5) for SD.\nThere was modest, if any, contribution of maternal effects to liability for ASD, including subtypes AD and SD, and there was no support for shared environmental effects.

The sample consisted of 307 psychiatry outpatients with mild to severe depression and past 30-day hazardous drinking/drug use, who participated in a trial of substance use treatment. Participants were assessed for AUD based on DSM-IV criteria. Measures of marijuana use, depression symptoms, and functional status related to mental health were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Differences in these outcomes were analyzed among patients with and without AUD using growth models, adjusting for treatment effects. Marijuana was examined as both an outcome (patterns of use) and a predictor (impact on depression and functioning). Forty percent used marijuana and about half the sample met AUD criteria. Fewer patients with AUD used marijuana than those without AUD at baseline. Over 6 months, the proportion of patients with AUD using marijuana increased compared to those without AUD. Patients with AUD using marijuana had greater depressive symptoms and worse functioning than those without AUD. These findings indicate that marijuana use is clinically problematic for psychiatry outpatients with depression and AUD.

This WFSBP guideline has been developed to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence pertaining to the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar mixed states in adults.\nMaterial used for these guidelines is based on a systematic literature search using various data bases. Their scientific rigour was categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F), and different grades of recommendation to ensure practicability were assigned. We examined data pertaining to the acute treatment of manic and depressive symptoms in bipolar mixed patients, as well as data pertaining to the prevention of mixed recurrences after an index episode of any type, or recurrence of any type after a mixed index episode.\nManic symptoms in bipolar mixed states appeared responsive to treatment with several atypical antipsychotics, the best evidence resting with olanzapine. For depressive symptoms, addition of ziprasidone to treatment as usual may be beneficial; however, the evidence base is much more limited than for the treatment of manic symptoms. Besides olanzapine and quetiapine, valproate and lithium should also be considered for recurrence prevention.\nThe concept of mixed states changed over time, and recently became much more comprehensive with the release of DSM-5. As a consequence, studies in bipolar mixed patients targeted slightly different bipolar subpopulations. In addition, trial designs in acute and maintenance treatment also advanced in recent years in response to regulatory demands.\nCurrent treatment recommendations are still based on limited evidence, and there is a clear demand for confirmative studies adopting the DSM-5 specifier with mixed features concept."}, {"Title": "SMART-R: A Prospective Cohort Study of a Resilience Curriculum for Residents by Residents.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a resident-led resiliency curriculum developed by residents, for residents.\nThe Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program for Residents (SMART-R) is a 6-h group-based curriculum that teaches meditation, behavioral skills, and positive perspective-taking strategies.

New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of \"digital phenotype\" is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood disorders by means of a selective review of the literature.\nWe conducted a selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included.\nFor unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve.\nAll these systems can be used to computerize the clinical characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data."}, {"Title": "Genetically determined schizophrenia is not associated with impaired glucose homeostasis.", "Abstract": "Here, we used data from large genome-wide association studies to test the presence of causal relationships, conducting a Mendelian randomization analysis; and shared molecular mechanisms, calculating the genetic correlation, among schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and impaired glucose homeostasis.

After successful implementation, the curriculum was formalized into a Women's Mental Health Area of Concentration within the Department of Psychiatry's residency training program. Participants found the WMHSG to be interesting, to increase knowledge and improve clinical practice, and to facilitate mentorship opportunities. The creation and evolution of a WMHSG into an Area of Concentration offers an example for enhancing training in WMH topics and principles that can be extended to other medical specialties."}, {"Title": "Cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers for neurodegenerative dementias: An update of the Consensus of the Task Force on Biological Markers in Psychiatry of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In the 12 years since the publication of the first Consensus Paper of the WFSBP on biomarkers of neurodegenerative dementias, enormous advancement has taken place in the field, and the Task Force takes now the opportunity to extend and update the original paper. New concepts of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the conceptual interactions between AD and dementia due to AD were developed, resulting in two sets for diagnostic/research criteria. Procedures for pre-analytical sample handling, biobanking, analyses and post-analytical interpretation of the results were intensively studied and optimised. A global quality control project was introduced to evaluate and monitor the inter-centre variability in measurements with the goal of harmonisation of results. Contexts of use and how to approach candidate biomarkers in biological specimens other than cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), e.g. blood, were precisely defined. Important development was achieved in neuroimaging techniques, including studies comparing amyloid-\u03b2 positron emission tomography results to fluid-based modalities. Similarly, development in research laboratory technologies, such as ultra-sensitive methods, raises our hopes to further improve analytical and diagnostic accuracy of classic and novel candidate biomarkers. Synergistically, advancement in clinical trials of anti-dementia therapies energises and motivates the efforts to find and optimise the most reliable early diagnostic modalities. Finally, the first studies were published addressing the potential of cost-effectiveness of the biomarkers-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders."}, {"Title": "Online parenting guidelines to prevent adolescent depression and anxiety: Evaluating user characteristics and usefulness.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to evaluate user characteristics and the perceived usefulness of a set of online parenting guidelines to prevent adolescent depression and anxiety.\nUpon downloading the online guidelines, users were invited to complete a brief demographic survey assessing user characteristics (Survey 1). Consenting respondents were emailed an evaluation survey 1 month later, which assessed perceived usefulness of the guidelines (Survey 2).\nOver 22 months, 2631 users completed Survey 1 and 233 completed Survey 2.

It is of importance to obtain more knowledge about mechanisms leading to mechanical restraint in the attempt of reducing it.\nTo analyse for associations between incidence of mechanical restraint (MR) and staffing level, staff demographics, patient characteristics, type of shift (day/evening/night) and change of shifts.\nA naturalistic descriptive method was used to study cases of MR in a psychiatric ward. Data for each case of MR was obtained from an electronic reporting system. Care workers from each shift were identified using duty rosters. Analyses included binary logistic regression analyses.\nIn 82% of the 114 cases of MR, the patient was diagnosed with personality disorders. In the multiple regression analysis, a significant association was found between the use of MR and the presence of male care workers on the ward (OR:1.44, 95% CI: 1.01-2.05; p\u2009=\u2009.04). Moreover, MR was associated with evening shifts, compared with day and night shifts (OR\u2009=1,29, 95% CI: 1.14-2.57, p\u2009=\u2009.01). Besides, months from January to December was associated with a decrease in MRs (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83-0.94; p\u2009=\u20097.3 E-6). No significant associations were found between MR and staffing level or experience.\nMR was associated with evening shifts, higher number of male care workers on duty and a decrease from January to December."}, {"Title": "Fran\u00e7ois Leuret: the last moral therapist.", "Abstract": "By the 1840s French psychiatrists had abandoned Moral Treatment as an individual psychological therapy, as opposed to an institutional practice. One advocate of Moral Treatment, however, would not go along with this movement. In three books and several papers published between 1834 and 1846, Fran\u00e7ois Leuret (1797-1851) advocated aggressive psychological treatment. Recent commentators have understandably concentrated on the controversies surrounding Leuret's practices. What such an approach has failed to make clear, however, is that Leuret had a complex, systematic psychological theory supporting his clinical judgements. In addition to reviewing the controversies that surrounded Leuret, this paper spells out Leuret's psychological theory and shows how he used this theory to think about the individual psychotherapy he provided for his patients."}, {"Title": "Clinical characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder: older vs. young adults.", "Abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older people. Although GAD in older adults seems to differ in many aspects like clinical presentation, severity and treatment response, there is a paucity of comparative research.\nThe aim of the study is to compare the clinical presentation of GAD between older and young adults.\nOne hundred and two non-demented older patients (age \u226565) and 64 young patients (age <45) who were diagnosed with GAD according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria were included to the study. Socio-demographic Data Form, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-1 (SCID-1), the Questionnaire for the Suggested Behavioral Criteria of GAD for DSM-5, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale (GADSS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) were applied to both groups.\nOlder GAD patients had more disturbances of sleep, less reassurance seeking behaviors, higher rates of depression and higher depression severity when compared to the young patients. Although older people seemed to have a lower severity of GAD, they had higher disability due to worries. Older patients worried more about their own health and family well-being, whereas young patients worried more about future and other's health."}, {"Title": "Public mental health crisis management and Section 136 of the Mental Health Act.", "Abstract": "The interface between mental health services and the criminal justice system presents challenges both for professionals and patients. Both systems are stressed and inherently complex. Section 136 of the Mental Health Act is unusual being both an aspect of the Mental Health Act and a power of arrest. It has a long and controversial history related to concerns about who has been detained and how the section was applied. More recently, Section 136 has had a public profile stemming from the use of police cells as places of safety for young, mentally disturbed individuals. This paper explores the current state of health of this piece of legislation. Specifically, we consider whether alternative approaches are more suitable for those individuals in crisis and/or distress who come into contact with the police. This requires careful thought as to the proper role of both health and criminal justice professionals who are daily grappling with an ethically contentious domain of multiagency work."}, {"Title": "Suicide by Medication Overdose in Prison: A Study of Three Cases.", "Abstract": "Suicide is one of the principal causes of mortality in a prison environment. Although suicide by medication overdose is less frequent than suicide by hanging, self-strangulation, or vein cutting, it raises questions as to how the medications are obtained, particularly in view of the specific organization of the medication circuit in prisons. We present three cases of suicide by medication overdose involving different therapeutic classes with different distribution circuits and review the regulatory requirements and the measures that could be taken to prevent such suicides."}, {"Title": "A protocol for interagency collaboration and family participation: Practitioners' perspectives on the Client Network Consultation.", "Abstract": "Interagency collaboration has many advantages, but seems hard to realise in practice. In Belgium, the need for collaboration between the practitioners in the field of child welfare and child psychiatry, especially for children and adolescents with complex health care needs, was identified. Children with complex health care needs require coordinated care and collaboration between the different sectors in child mental health care (child welfare, child psychiatry, disability care). The authors have developed a standardised protocol based on the wraparound principles, which support interagency collaboration with family participation, named Client Network Consultation (CNC). Focus groups evaluated the CNC by eliciting practitioners' views on the structure, content and impact of collaborative interagency protocols with family involvement. Thematic analysis revealed four core themes: (1) Empowering the child and the family; (2) Utilising the strength of the collective; (3) Being considerate versus constructive a dilemma for participants in CNC; and (4) The structure of a protocol offers opportunities and challenges. Results of the study offer implications for daily practice. Several challenges for interprofessional (IP) practice in the complex field of child and adolescent mental health care are described. The value of the CNC protocol to engage families in a clinical process is also discussed."}, {"Title": "Primary schools and the amplification of social differences in child mental health: a population-based cohort study.", "Abstract": "This paper examines socioeconomic inequalities in mental health at school entry and explores changes in these inequalities over the first 3 years of school.\nThe study utilises routinely collected mental health data from education records and demographic data at ages 4 and 7 years, along with administrative school-level data. The study was set in preschool establishments and schools in Glasgow City, Scotland. Data were available on 4011 children (59.4%)at age 4 years, and 3166 of these children were followed at age 7 years (46.9% of the population). The main outcome measure was the teacher-rated Goodman's Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (4-16 version) at age 7 years, which measures social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.\nChildren living in the most deprived area had higher levels of mental health difficulties at age 4 years, compared with their most affluent counterparts (7.3%vs4.1% with abnormal range scores). There was a more than threefold widening of this disparity over time, so that by the age of 7 years, children from the most deprived area quintile had rates of difficulties 3.5 times higher than their more affluent peers. Children's demographic backgrounds strongly predicted their age 7 scores, although schools appeared to make a significant contribution to mental health trajectories.\nAdditional support to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds at preschool and in early primary school may help narrow inequalities. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds started school with a higher prevalence of mental health difficulties, compared with their more advantaged peers, and this disparity widened markedly over the first 3\u2009years of school."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and Correlates of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Quebec: Pr\u00e9valence et corr\u00e9lats des troubles du spectre de l'autisme au Qu\u00e9bec.", "Abstract": "To estimate the prevalence, comorbidities, and service use of people with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) based on data from Quebec Integrated Chronic Diseases Surveillance System (QICDSS).\nWe included all residents up to age 24 eligible for health plan coverage who were in Quebec for at least 1 day from January 1, 1996, to March 31, 2015.

Most of these patients have severe neurocognitive deficits. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has proved effective and safe in the treatment of TRS, but because of potential neurocognitive adverse effects, it is associated with many controversies. The aim of this prospective, open study was to evaluate the effects of ECT augmentation of antipsychotics on cognitive functions in patients with TRS.\nOverall, 31 inpatients with TRS were included, 16 men, with an average (SD) age of 34.1 (11.187) years. The evaluation of clinical symptoms and global impression, as well as verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, and executive functioning, was conducted before and after the completion of ECT treatment.\nWe ran a series of paired-samples t tests, and the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons reduced the significance level to P = 0.004. The neurocognitive domains that demonstrated statistically significant improvement were immediate and delayed verbal memory, and executive functioning, whereas statistical trend was observed for visual memory and psychomotor speed. None of the neurocognitive functions exhibited significant deterioration after the ECT treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy was effective in reducing general symptoms of schizophrenia, resulting in more than 30% decrease in the overall symptom severity measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.\nNotwithstanding some limitations of this study, the combination of ECT and antipsychotics has improved several neurocognitive domains, without evidence of worsening of any cognitive functions."}, {"Title": "Is the Danish Version of MATE Feasible?

However, it is not a unitary disease-it is a heterogeneous syndrome, with patients differing remarkably in symptom profile, pathophysiology and treatment responsiveness. Previous attempts to subtype major depressive disorder have showed limited clinical applicability. We present a classification of major depressive disorder episodes based on the proximate mechanisms that led to the original mood change that caused the depressive episode. We identify discrete depression subtypes that are induced by: 1) infection, 2) long-term stress, 3) loneliness, 4) traumatic experience, 5) hierarchy conflict, 6) grief, 7) romantic rejection, 8) postpartum events, 9) the season, 10) chemicals, 11) somatic diseases and 12) starvation. We further examine the ultimate functions of these subtypes and show that not all types of mood changes that trigger depression are adaptive. Instead, some are clearly maladaptive and some are byproducts of other adaptations. In modern societies, low mood after adverse life events may turn into a pathological depressive state. Modern lifestyle increases susceptibility to inflammatory dysregulation and chronic stress, both of which increase the amount of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood, leading to low mood and sickness behaviour. Proinflammatory cytokines may aggravate the previously adaptive short-term mood changes to a chronic maladaptive depressive state by preventing the normalization of mood after adverse life events. Subtyping depression enables an effective and intelligent long-term treatment of patients in each subtype by treating the underlying causes of depression."}, {"Title": "Gene-environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions.", "Abstract": "Empirical studies suggest that psychiatric disorders result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

One possible approach to avert it is the preventive treatment of individuals with a sexual interest in children. The aim of the current eye tracking study was to compare people with a self-reported sexual interest in children who participate in the outpatient preventive treatment project \"PsM\", pedophilic forensic inpatients, and a non-pedophilic control group. Groups were compared with respect to sexual interest and attentional control in the presence of sexual stimuli, both assessed independently of self-report. Two approaches were applied, namely the initial orientation approach for measuring sexual interest, and a sexual distractor task for measuring attentional control. Our data showed for the first time that outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children differed from pedophilic forensic inpatients with respect to attentional control but not with regard to sexual interest. Outpatients showed similar sexual interest in children as pedophilic forensic inpatients. They demonstrated significantly better attentional control than pedophilic forensic inpatients in the face of adult sexual stimuli, but the difference regarding child sexual stimuli did not reach significance. This might reflect a higher capacity for self-control and self-regulation in these patients. Nevertheless, child stimuli remain to be important distractors for them. Our results provide valuable additional information for the diagnosis and therapy of outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children.

Progress notes are intended to be an evaluation of a patient's nursing diagnoses, interventions and outcomes. Within this template, a patient's status and the care provided are to be recorded. The therapeutic nurse-patient relationship is recognised as a key component of psychiatric care today. At the same time, the biomedical model remains strong. Research literature exploring nursing staff's experiences with writing progress notes in psychiatric contexts, and especially the space given to staff-patient relations, is sparse.\nQualitative design.\nFocus group interviews with mental health staff working in one acute and one subacute psychiatric ward were conducted. Systematic text condensation, a method for transverse thematic analysis, was used.\nTwo main categories emerged from the analysis: the position of the professional as an expert and distant observer in the progress notes, and the weak position of professional-patient interactions in progress notes.\nThe participants did not perceive that the current recording model,\u00a0which is based on the nursing process, supported a focus on patients' resources or reporting professional-patient interactions.

This review focuses on prospective longitudinal studies in 22q11DS, which capture fluctuations in psychosis symptoms over time and may provide insights into potential demographic, clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging predictors of psychosis-spectrum outcomes in the general population. Findings are compared and contrasted with those from idiopathic psychosis-spectrum populations. Onset of psychotic disorders in 22q11DS can occur over a wide range of ages, peaking in late adolescence. Symptoms may be gradually progressive or episodic in nature, highlighting the importance and challenge of risk and resilience prediction models. Converging results suggest that psychosis-spectrum outcomes in 22q11DS are predicted by lower baseline functioning, higher baseline psychosis-spectrum symptoms, presence of mood disturbance or anxiety, and lower baseline and subsequent decline in global measures of cognition. Predictors of transition to threshold psychotic disorders and ages of onset are similar in idiopathic clinical risk. They also share similarly global cognitive deficits, but not to the same extent as in 22q11DS. While neuroimaging studies in idiopathic clinical risk suggest loss of prefrontal gray matter, there is no consistent evidence yet emerging in the limited literature in 22q11DS. Interventional efforts in 22q11DS aimed at halting progression to psychosis or mitigating outcomes in early psychosis may be best implemented during the adolescent age range.

Unlike somatic medicine, most psychological and psychiatric phenomena have no gold standard to establish their presence beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, prevalence estimates are based on the average agreement of imperfect evaluators. K\u00fcchenhoff, Augustin, and Kunz (2012) provided a statistical method for estimating confidence intervals of the prevalence based on the well-known kappa coefficient of interrater agreement. We expand this method and derive confidence intervals for the probability of a diagnosis being true (i.e., the positive predictive value). We illustrate the method and its results with empirical data for a particular type of paraphilia (pedophilia) in sexual offenders. The findings indicate that up to 1 in 3 diagnoses of pedophilia may be wrong.

Unfortunately, studies including a comprehensive set of explanatory variables altogether are still scare and most studies have failed to present their analyses split by sex and age groups. Also, urban-rural differences in suicide in Spain have been rarely investigated. The present study aimed at explaining rural-urban differences in suicidality in the province of Castellon (Spain). A comprehensive set of sociodemographic and psychiatric factors was investigated and analyses were split by sex and age.\nThe sample comprised all suicides recorded in the province of Castellon from January 2009 to December 2015 (n=343). Sociodemographic data included sex, age, and suicide method. Psychiatric data included the history of mental health service utilization, psychiatric diagnosis, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalization.\nConsistent with past research, suicide rates were highest in rural areas, especially in men and older people. We also found that urban-rural differences in sociodemographic and psychiatric variables were sensitive to sex and age. Our results indicated that specialized mental health service use and accessibility to suicide means might help understand urban-rural differences in suicide, especially in men.

Nevertheless, many were preventable, and the study provides data with which to target future initiatives that may improve the safety of this vulnerable patient population."}, {"Title": "The Use of Telepsychiatry to Provide Cost-Efficient Care During Pediatric Mental Health Emergencies.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated a videoconference-based psychiatric emergency consultation program (telepsychiatry) at geographically dispersed emergency department (ED) sites that are part of the network of care of an academic children's hospital system. The study compared program outcomes with those of usual care involving ambulance transport to the hospital for in-person psychiatric emergency consultation prior to disposition to inpatient care or discharge home.\nThis study compared process outcomes in a cross-sectional, pre-post design at five network-of-care sites before and after systemwide implementation of telepsychiatry consultation in 2015. Clinical records on 494 pediatric psychiatric emergencies included ED length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. Satisfaction surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians.\nCompared with children who received usual care, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ED lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p<.001) and lower total patient charges ($3,493 and $8,611, p<.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported high satisfaction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition.\nMeasured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediatric psychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consultation at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs."}, {"Title": "A Change in Perspective: From Dual Diagnosis to Multimorbidity.", "Abstract": "There has been increasing interest within psychiatry in the concept of multimorbidity because psychiatric patients typically present with multiple concurrent disorders, these disorders mutually exacerbate one another, and their interaction shapes treatment options.

Collaborative care networks in both arms involved health care and other agencies in five service sectors. This study examined six- and 12-month outcomes for CPIC participants with serious mental illness.\nThis secondary analysis focused on low-income CPIC participants from racial-ethnic minority groups with serious mental illness in underresourced Los Angeles communities (N=504). Serious mental illness was defined as self-reported severe depression (\u226520 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at baseline or a lifetime history of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Logistic and Poisson regression with multiple imputation and response weights, controlling for covariates, was used to model intervention effects.\nAmong CPIC participants, 50% had serious mental illness. Among those with serious mental illness, CEP relative to RS reduced the likelihood of poor mental health-related quality of life (OR=.62, 95% CI=.41-.95) but not depression (primary outcomes); reduced the likelihood of having homelessness risk factors and behavioral health hospitalizations; increased the likelihood of mental wellness; reduced specialty mental health medication and counseling visits; and increased faith-based depression visits (each p<.05) at six months. There were no statistically significant 12-month effects.\nFindings suggest that a coalition approach to implementing expanded collaborative depression care, compared with technical assistance to individual programs, may reduce short-term behavioral health hospitalizations and improve mental health-related quality of life and some social outcomes for adults with serious mental illness, although no evidence was found for long-term effects in this subsample."}, {"Title": "Patient experiences with care across various types of mental health care: Questionnaire development, measurement invariance, and patients' reports.", "Abstract": "To describe the development, validation, and findings of a patient experience questionnaire across 7 types of residential and ambulatory mental health care services. Thirty-five items were hypothesized to cover information, participation, therapeutic relationship, personalized care, organization and collaboration, safety, patient rights, outcomes of care, and discharge preparation and after-care. Also included were 2 overall rating items (scoring and recommending the organization). This Dutch questionnaire was applied in 79 organizations in Belgium (N patients\u00a0=\u00a05,168). Exploratory structural equation modelling was conducted on a random split-half sample to examine dimensionality. Confirmatory factor analysis and multiple group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the holdout sample to confirm dimensionality and assess measurement invariance across type of service and patient characteristics. Multilevel logistic regression models linking subscale top box scores to overall rating items were used to assess criterion validity. The hypothesized dimensionality was partly confirmed, and configural and scalar invariance were demonstrated across types of organizations and patient characteristics. Subscale scores were significantly associated with overall ratings. Process evaluation showed that participating organizations strongly support continued use of this questionnaire.

This contentious question, which attracted widespread public attention during the 1964 U.S. presidential election involving Barry Goldwater, received renewed scrutiny during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, when many mental health professionals raised pointed questions concerning the psychiatric status of Donald Trump. Although the Goldwater Rule prohibits psychiatrists from offering diagnostic opinions on individuals they have never examined, no comparable rule exists for psychologists. We contend that, owing largely to the Goldwater Rule's origins in psychiatry, a substantial body of psychological research on assessment and clinical judgment, including work on the questionable validity of unstructured interviews, the psychology of cognitive biases, and the validity of informant reports and of L (lifetime) data, has been overlooked in discussions of its merits. We conclude that although the Goldwater Rule may have been defensible several decades ago, it is outdated and premised on dubious scientific assumptions. We further contend that there are select cases in which psychological scientists with suitable expertise may harbor a \"duty to inform,\" allowing them to offer informed opinions concerning public figures' mental health with appropriate caveats."}, {"Title": "Predictors of Electroconvulsive Therapy Use in a Large Inpatient Psychiatry Population.", "Abstract": "There is limited research on reliable and clinically useful predictors of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) use.

The study includes all psychiatric inpatients 18 years or older in Ontario, Canada, assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument for Mental Health (RAI-MH) within the first 3 days of admission between 2009 and 2014 (n = 153,023). The RAI-MH is a validated assessment tool which includes a breadth of information on symptoms, self-harm, functioning, social support, comorbid medical diagnoses, and risk appraisal. Multivariable analyses were performed using SAS.\nOne hundred forty-five thousand seven hundred (95.2%) of patients admitted had no history of ECT treatment and were not scheduled to receive ECT. A total of 7323 (or 4.8% of the patient population) had either a history of ECT use or were scheduled to receive ECT. Overall rate of ECT use was highest in patients with a provisional diagnosis of mood disorder (7.2%) compared with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorder (3.1%) or substance-related disorder (1.7%). Women were more likely to receive ECT compared with men (overall rates of ECT use 6.2% and 3.4%, respectively). Overall rate of ECT use increased significantly with increasing age. Number of prior hospitalizations was also a strong predictor of ECT use. Conversely, patients with elevated Risk of Harm to Others, schizophrenia, or a substance use disorder were all significantly less likely to receive ECT. All variables examined were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Higher Severity of Self Harm Scores predicted past use, but not scheduled use of ECT.\nThis is the largest study to date on predictors of ECT use. Utilization of RAI-MH is a novel and clinically useful method for evaluating predictors of ECT use. Predictors of ECT use within an inpatient population include: presence of a mood disorder, female sex, older age, low risk of harm to others, number of lifetime hospitalizations, lack of substance use disorder, and inability to care for self."}, {"Title": "Irritable temperament and lifetime psychotic symptoms as predictors of anxiety symptoms in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Affective temperaments, hopelessness, alexithymia, and anxiety/agitation symptoms may play a significant role in the psychopathological characteristics of bipolar disorder (BD).

Participants were assessed using specific psychometric instruments. Anxiety/agitation symptoms have been evaluated using the 11-item of the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).\nOverall, 53.8% of participants presented with anxiety/agitation symptoms and 46.2% without. The two groups significantly differed about socio-economic status, lifetime psychotic symptoms, and residual depressive symptoms between episodes.

By 1900, it closely resembled its modern form. This paper reviews the descriptions of mania in Western psychiatry from 1880 to 1900, when Kraepelin was training and developing his concept of manic-depressive illness. Psychiatric textbooks published 1900-1960 described 22 characteristic manic symptoms/signs the presence of which were recorded in 25 psychiatric textbooks and three other key documents published 1880-1900. Descriptions of mania in these nineteenth century textbooks closely resembled those in the twentieth century, recording a mean (s.d.) of 15.9 (2.3) and 17.0 (2.3) of the characteristic symptoms, respectively (p = 0.12). The frequency with which individual symptoms were reported was substantially correlated in these two periods (r = +0.64). Mendel's 1881 monograph, Kraepelin's first description of mania in 1883 and the entry for mania in Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine (1892) described a mean (s.d.) of 19 (1.7) of these characteristic symptoms. These descriptions of mania often contained phenomenologically rich descriptions of euphoria, hyperactivity, grandiosity, flight of ideas, and poor judgment. They also emphasized several features not in DSM criteria including changes in character, moral standards and physical appearance, and increased sense of humor and sexual drive. Fifteen authors described key symptoms/signs of mania most reporting elevated mood, motoric hyperactivity and accelerated mental processes. By 1880, the syndrome of mania had been largely stabilized in its modern form. In the formation of his concept of manic-depressive illness, Kraepelin utilized the syndrome of mania as described in the psychiatric community in which he was trained."}, {"Title": "PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM): a pilot group randomized controlled trial of two approaches to improving depression among perinatal women.", "Abstract": "This pilot study was designed to inform a larger effectiveness trial by: (1) assessing the feasibility of the PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM) and our study procedures; and, (2) determining the extent to which PRISM as compared to an active comparison group, the Massachusetts Child Access Psychiatry Program (MCPAP) for Moms alone, improves depression among perinatal women.\nFour practices were randomized to either PRISM or MCPAP for Moms alone, a state-wide telephonic perinatal psychiatry program.

Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant increased odds ratio (OR) of medical clearance testing based on age (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.01, 1.03), among visits involving an injury or poisoning (OR 2.38, 95%CI 1.54, 3.68), and in the Midwest region as compared to the Northeast region (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 4.46), after adjusting for other predictors.\nOur study demonstrated that, on a national level, 4 out of 5 ED visits resulting in a psychiatric facility admission had a medical clearance test ordered.

Residual depressive symptoms may be associated with disability and functional impairment but few studies evaluated clinical correlates associated with these symptoms and their impact on functioning after adjustment for potential confounders. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate factors associated with residual depressive symptoms and their impact on the course of MDD. The sample consisted of 210 consecutive MDD euthymic outpatients (67.6% females; mean age = 52.1 \u00b1 15.5), admitted to the Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa (Italy). Residuals depressive symptoms were significantly associated with female gender; use of short half-life benzodiazepines; longer duration of the current depressive episode; higher number of illness episodes; and higher duration of illness. Conversely, prior treatment with first-generation antipsychotics, later age of illness onset and first hospitalization were less frequently observed among patients with residual symptoms. After multivariate analyses, only duration of current illness episodes (\u00df = 0.003; p = <0.005) and substance abuse (\u00df = 0.042; p = <0.05) remained significantly associated with residual symptoms. Our findings indicate that residual depressive symptoms conferred a pernicious illness course in this specific cohort of MDD patients.

This study aimed to characterize students' experiences on C-L rotations.\nThis cross-sectional survey study, sponsored by the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine Subcommittee on Medical Student Education, was conducted at 5 US medical schools between 2012 and 2016. After the C-L rotation, students completed a voluntary 17-item survey.\nA total of 235 surveys were collected (mean response rate = 92%). The most frequently endorsed benefit of C-L was learning to manage psychiatric disorders in the context of medical illness (89%). The most frequently endorsed drawback was inconsistent/excessively variable workload (40%). Overall, 82% of respondents recommended C-L to other students; 80% reported that the ideal clerkship would include exposure to both C-L and inpatient psychiatry. Overall, 38% reported that their C-L experience increased their interest in psychiatry as a career. Effect of C-L on interest in psychiatry did not differ by study site, age, sex, clerkship length, or time spent on C-L. Respondents who noted more positive role-modeling on C-L compared to other clerkship rotations were more likely to report increased interest in a psychiatry career (odds ratio = 2.70).\nMost medical students perceive C-L rotations favorably. Positive role modeling may increase their consideration of psychiatry specialization. The findings that C-L rotation length did not correlate with attitudes and that most students preferred exposure to both inpatient and C-L psychiatry suggest that C-L exposure can beneficially be integrated into core clerkships containing other elements."}, {"Title": "Children in out-of-home care are at high risk of somatic, dental and mental ill health.", "Abstract": "The Swedish Social Board has implemented a support strategy to guide out-of-home care for children, which translates as children's needs in focus (CNIF) and includes a systematic health assessment.

The authors explored how the two different patient case formats influenced students' perceptions of psychiatric patients and students' reflections on meeting and communicating with psychiatric patients.\nThe authors conducted group interviews with 30 medical students who volunteered to participate in interviews and applied inductive thematic content analysis to the transcribed interviews.\nStudents taught with text-based patient cases emphasized excitement and drama towards the personal clinical narratives presented by the teachers during the course, but never referred to the patient cases. Authority and boundary setting were regarded as important in managing patients. Students taught with video-based patient cases, in contrast, often referred to the patient cases when highlighting new insights, including the importance of patient perspectives when communicating with patients.\nThe format of patient cases included in teaching may have a substantial impact on students' patient-centeredness. Video-based patient cases are probably more effective than text-based patient cases in fostering patient-centered perspectives in medical students.

Which other possible causes have been discussed by psychiatrists from the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first century? What approaches have major psychiatrists adopted towards suicidal patients and threatened suicide? What treatment and preventive strategies have been suggested?\nFirst, we compiled a\u00a0list of the, in our view, most influential textbooks on psychiatry of German-speaking school psychiatry from 1803 until the present. These textbooks were then skim-read for relevant passages on suicidality. The material gained was elicited, classified and analyzed in relation to the questions at hand. Futhermore, an attempt was made to arrive at contextual estimations.\nSeveral authors named a certain set of psychiatric illnesses that are assumed to involve or increase the risk of suicide. These illnesses include depression, schizophrenia and also physical illnesses. In nineteenth century textbooks heredity, anatomical anomalies and nationality were discussed as potential influencing factors. In contrast, more recent books discuss models of how suicidal behavior emerges and often refer to the Werther effect. With respect to therapy there is a trend towards therapeutic discussions and modern psychopharmacotherapy.\nOver time, there have been continuities and changes in psychiatrists' approach to suicidality not only as far as clinical aspects are concerned but also the general approach to and management of suicidal patients."}, {"Title": "Pediatric chronic patients at outpatient clinics: a study in a Latin American University Hospital.", "Abstract": "To describe the characteristics of children and adolescentes with chronic diseases of outpatient clinics at a tertiary university hospital.\nA cross-sectional study was performed with 16,237 patients with chronic diseases followed-up in one year.

In this paper, I examine how the concept of chronicity participates in present-day mental health care settings. Using ethnomethodology and material-semiotic theory within science and technology studies, I investigate how the classification 'chronically mentally ill' interacts with the everyday socio-material shaping of public mental health care in the context of professional institutions.\u00a0Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a psychiatric day hospital and in a community day care centre in Berlin, Germany, I demonstrate how the classification of chronicity acts as a tool of description (of people or their conditions), regulation (of therapy, health care or administration), and connection to infrastructures of care (practised technologies or standards of various kinds). In these ways, I argue, the classification engages in actions of producing treatability, arranging resources, demarcating responsibilities, practicing accountability, and doing presence. Notably, community mental health care has developed into a designated territory of the concept: explicitly arranged for 'the chronically mentally ill' as a human kind, we can take everyday life in these institutions as instructive of how chronicity is defined in daily practice."}, {"Title": "The influence of coercive measures on patients' stances towards psychiatric institutions.", "Abstract": "To examine the impact of coercive interventions (CI) on patients' evaluations of psychiatric hospitals as adversaries versus allies.\nSelf-constructed interviews were conducted relating to quantitative and subjective aspects of coercion and the attitude towards psychiatry of 79 patients with psychotic and bipolar disorders.

Instruments measuring psychopathological symptoms and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were applied alongside the Schedule for the Assessment of Illness (SAI) and the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). Using a logistic regression approach, considered influencing factors such as number, type and patients' subjective experiences of CI, cognitive and clinical insight, psychopathological symptoms and patients' global perceptions of their hospitalisation were analysed for their predictive value of patients' attitudes towards psychiatry.\nBinary logistic regression revealed that the subjective experience of CI and the perception of fairness and effectiveness during the treatment process predict patients' attitudes towards psychiatry to a greater extent than symptom-related measures or the quantity of CI.

Partly this success has been possible by progressing from simple experimental tasks to paradigms that incorporate more ecological features. More specifically, the premise is that to understand cognitions and brain functions relevant for real life, we need to introduce some of the ecological challenges that we have evolved to solve. This often entails an increase in task complexity, which can be managed by using computational models to help parse complex behaviours into specific component mechanisms. Here we propose that using computational models with tasks that capture ecologically relevant learning and decision-making processes may provide a critical advantage for capturing the mechanisms underlying symptoms of disorders in psychiatry. As a result, it may help develop mechanistic approaches towards diagnosis and treatment. We begin this review by mapping out the basic concepts and models of learning and decision-making. We then move on to consider specific challenges that emerge in realistic environments and describe how they can be captured by tasks. These include changes of context, uncertainty, reflexive/emotional biases, cost-benefit decision-making, and balancing exploration and exploitation. Where appropriate we highlight future or current links to psychiatry. We particularly draw examples from research on clinical depression, a disorder that greatly compromises motivated behaviours in real-life, but where simpler paradigms have yielded mixed results. Finally, we highlight several paradigms that could be used to help provide new insights into the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Developing capacity-building activities for mental health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries for service users and caregivers, service planners, and researchers.", "Abstract": "There is increasing international recognition of the need to build capacity to strengthen mental health systems.

The MRI substudy demonstrated that systolic BPV was associated with cognitive decline via interactions with depression and total WMH volume, but this was not dependent on either deep or periventricular WMH volumes.\nThe findings show that the interaction between systolic BPV with symptomatic depression and WMH increases cognitive decline in persons \u2a7e65 years of age. Future work could extend these findings by examining systolic BPV in relation to cognitive decline and WMH in older populations with depression."}, {"Title": "Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Reduce Suicide Risk Among Hospital Emergency Department Patients.", "Abstract": "This study estimated the expected cost-effectiveness and population impact of outpatient interventions to reduce suicide risk among patients presenting to general hospital emergency departments (EDs), compared with usual care. Several such interventions have been found efficacious, but none is yet widespread, and the cost-effectiveness of population-based implementation is unknown.\nModeled cost-effectiveness analysis compared three ED-initiated suicide prevention interventions previously found to be efficacious-follow-up via postcards or caring letters, follow-up via telephone outreach, and suicide-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-with usual care. Primary outcomes were treatment costs, suicides, and life-years saved, evaluated over the year after the index ED visit.\nCompared with usual care, adding postcards improved outcomes and reduced costs. Adding telephone outreach and suicide-focused CBT, respectively, improved outcomes at a mean incremental cost of $4,300 and $18,800 per life-year saved, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 repetitions) revealed the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness to be a certainty for all three interventions, assuming societal willingness to pay \u2265$50,000 per life-year. These main findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses, including conservative assumptions about effect size and incremental costs. Population impact was limited by low sensitivity of detecting ED patients' suicide risk, and health care delivery inefficiencies.\nThe highly favorable cost-effectiveness found for each outpatient intervention provides a strong basis for widespread implementation of any or all of the interventions. The estimated population benefits of doing so would be enhanced by increasing the sensitivity of suicide risk detection among individuals presenting to general hospital EDs."}, {"Title": "Syndromic Surveillance of Mental and Substance Use Disorders: A Validation Study Using Emergency Department Chief Complaints.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated whether emergency department (ED) patient presentations for problems related to mental and substance use disorders could be validly monitored by a syndromic surveillance system that uses chief complaints to identify mental disorders.\nThe study used syndromic surveillance data on 146,315 ED visits to participating Fresno County, California, hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2013. Free-text patient chief complaints are automatically classified into syndromes based on the developer's algorithms. Agreement was assessed between the algorithm's syndrome classification of mental health and substance abuse (MHSA) disorders and ICD-9-CM discharge diagnostic codes. Diagnosis and ED utilization patterns among patients with at least one visit with an MHSA syndrome classification were also examined.\nApproximately 8% of ED visits during the study period received an MHSA syndrome classification. Overall agreement between MHSA syndrome classification and psychiatric- or substance use-related ICD-9 discharge diagnoses was high (\u03ba=.92, 95% confidence interval=.91-.92). Sensitivity (100%) and specificity (98.6%) of the MHSA syndrome classification were also very high. MHSA syndrome-classified patients exhibited high levels of health care and morbidity burden compared with other patients.\nED chief complaints can be utilized to reliably and validly ascertain the incidence of patient presentations for mental and substance use disorders in contexts in which discharge diagnoses are not routinely available. Wider adoption of MHSA-related syndrome algorithms by syndromic surveillance systems could be valuable for public mental health surveillance, service delivery, and resource planning efforts."}, {"Title": "Short overview on metabolomic approach and redox changes in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are severe mental disorders and complicated diagnostic entities, due to their phenotypic, biological and genetic heterogeneity, unknown etiology, and poorly understood alterations in biological pathways and biological mechanisms. Disturbed homeostasis between overproduction of oxidant species, overcoming redox regulation and a lack of cellular antioxidant defenses, resulting in free radical-mediated pathology and subsequent neurotoxicity contributes to development of depression, schizophrenia and PTSD, their heterogeneous clinical presentation and resistance to treatment. Metabolomics is a discipline that combines different strategies with the aim to extract, detect, identify and quantify all metabolites that are present in a biological sample and might provide mechanistic insights into the etiology of various psychiatric disorders. Therefore, oxidative stress research combined with metabolomics might offer a novel approach in dissecting psychiatric disorders, since these data-driven but not necessarily hypothesis-driven methods might identify new targets, molecules and pathways responsible for development of schizophrenia, depression or PTSD. Findings from the oxidative research in psychiatry together with metabolomics data might facilitate development of specific and validated prognostic, therapeutic and clinical biomarkers. These methods might reveal bio-signatures of individual patients, leading to individualized treatment approach. In reviewing findings related to oxidative stress and metabolomics in selected psychiatric disorders, we have highlighted how these novel approaches might make a unique contribution to deeper understanding of psychopathological alterations underlying schizophrenia, depression and PTSD."}, {"Title": "Historical and conceptual aspects of motor disorders in the psychoses.", "Abstract": "Historical epistemology is a useful method to understand the longitudinal construction of the movement disorders in psychiatry. Four periods can be identified in such a process. The first, extending from Classical times to the work of Griesinger, included disorders such as catalepsy, crocidism, epilepsy and paralysis. The second period, stretching from Griesinger to Kahlbaum, concentrated on the study of melancholia attonita, stupor and catatonia. The third period, covering the time from Kahlbaum to WWI, witnessed important conceptual shifts such as: the transformation of madness into psychoses; the redefinition of movement and motility in psychiatry; the appearance of self-contained syndromes as dyskinesias, tics, akathisia, complex disorders like the cases of encephalitis lethargica, etc.; the advent of functional and psychodynamic explanations; and the description by Wernicke, Kleist and others of the motility psychoses. The fourth period stretches from WWI to the present and since it corresponds to the views and work reported in the rest of this Special issue it has not been touched upon in this paper. In spite of an increasing methodological refinement, empirical research is yet to clarify what is the clinical meaning of the movement disorders in the context of the psychoses and to explain whether such disorders are primary (i.e. issuing directly from the brain and parallel to the rest of psychotic symptomatology) or secondary (i.e. mediated by cognitive and emotional phenomena characteristic of the psychoses)."}, {"Title": "Patient participation as discursive practice-A critical discourse analysis of Danish mental healthcare.", "Abstract": "Patient participation is one of the most prevalent focus areas in the Danish healthcare debate. Patient participation is generally presented as a fundamental democratic right, and is stated in an objective language with legal requirements for healthcare professionals to ensure that patients systematically participate in their own courses of care and treatment. In the research literature, it is not clear what is meant by 'patient participation', and several discourses on patient participation exist side by side. This study explores how discourses of patient participation unfold and are at play in the articulations in official legal and political documents and patient records relating to a Danish psychiatric context. The documents and patient records have been analyzed using a Fairclough-inspired critical discourse approach which is concerned with how power is exercised through language. The research findings show that patient participation within Danish psychiatric healthcare is governed within a neoliberal discourse where underlying discourses; discourse of biomedicine, paternalism, management, evidence and ethics of care are embedded, and a discourse that seems to ascribe stigmatizing traits to mentally ill patients."}, {"Title": "Residents Perceive Limited Education on Family Planning and Contraception for Patients with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness.", "Abstract": "The primary goal of this study was to assess perceived adequacy of training by residents from multiple specialties on contraceptive prescribing and family planning for patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Secondary goals included the following: (1) explore resident knowledge, attitudes, and behavior towards patients with SPMI and (2) identify barriers to meeting the reproductive health needs of patients with SPMI.\nThe target population was 44,237 residents from four medical specialties. Participants were from a stratified, self-selected sample. Program coordinators were asked to forward a survey link to residents. Consenting residents were provided access to a questionnaire via a secure, web-based application (REDCap). The survey assessed resident education on the reproductive health needs of patients with SPMI and included demographics (age, gender, year of residency, and specialty), perceived adequacy of training, knowledge, and attitudes, and barriers regarding contraception and family planning. Responses were summarized with frequency and compared by medical specialty.\nA total of 768 residents consented: 49% female, 20% male, and 31% did not indicate their gender; 19% were first year residents, 21% second year residents, 21% third year residents, 8% fourth year residents, and 30% did not indicate their year of training. By specialty, 30.6% of residents were from family medicine programs (n\u00a0=\u00a0235), 10.8% were from internal medicine programs (n\u00a0=\u00a083), 18.1% were from OBGYN programs (n\u00a0=\u00a0139), and 10.4% were from psychiatry programs (n\u00a0=\u00a080); 231 (30.1%) did not indicate specialty.

Reducing striatal glutamate release, or antagonising the action of glutamate at its receptors, may therefore represent viable treatment strategies. Several glutamatergic agents with regulatory approval for other indications are available and may be of potential benefit in the treatment of compulsivity/impulsivity in psychiatric disorders in paediatric patients.\nThis review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and evaluates available scientific literature concerning the use of glutamatergic agents in these patients, in order to determine their reported effectiveness/efficacy and tolerability/safety.\nOut of a total of 1,426 publications, 21 trials examining six glutamatergic substances in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder were included.\nTrial designs as well as results were heterogeneous and thus comparability was limited. Available data support the hypothesis that glutamatergic agents are of potential value in the treatment of compulsivity/impulsivity in children and adolescents. Based on the data reviewed, memantine and N-acetylcysteine suggest the best risk-benefit profile for future trials. Riluzole should primarily be further investigated in adults.

Up to 5% of the falls result in severe injuries, but data concerning medical consequences are scare. This brief report presents a retrospective analysis of one year fall protocols from a geriatric psychiatry department focusing on consequences of falls. Fall-induced injuries were rated in four categories: no injuries, mild injuries (contusions, hematomas, abrasions), moderate injuries (lacerations, dislocations), and severe injuries (fractures, cerebral hemorrhages). In total, 510 falls were registered during the study period, indicating a fall rate of 17.7 falls per 1,000 hospital days. Overall, 375 falls (73.5%) resulted in no injuries, 67 (13.1%) resulted in mild injuries, 59 (11.6%) resulted in moderate injuries, and only 9 (1.8%) falls led to severe injuries (fractures and cerebral hemorrhages). These results indicate a quite high fall rate in our sample of hospitalized geriatric psychiatry patients with only a relatively small number of severe injuries resulting from the falls.

Interest in further training and other personal experience were also examined.\nFactor analysis revealed attitudes favoring: (1) social acceptance of people with mental illness, (2) not believing in supernatural causes of mental illness, (3) bio-psycho-social causation, (4) rehabilitation, and (5) social integration. The absence of consistent trends across training levels suggested that education did not increase nonstigmatized attitudes. Areas of most stigmatization were low social acceptance and little favor for social integration. Measures most strongly correlated with nonstigmatized attitudes were as follows: interest in clinical psychiatry, belief that psychiatry should be more valued, and having friends with mental illness.\nAlthough medical school education showed little effect on attitudes, students with more individual experiences such as planning to continue clinical psychiatric training, believing psychiatry should be more valued, and having friends with mental illness had less stigmatized attitudes than others."}, {"Title": "To screen or not to screen?

Historical materials on the Abdication and other respected secondary sources, including biographies of key individuals, were consulted, and the limited sociological and clinical literature on estrangement between elderly parents and adult children was referenced. Although estrangement was perpetuated by the rigid and incompatible positions taken up by both the former king and his widowed mother, the elderly Queen Mary, it was the latter who suffered the greater emotional consequences of the permanent separation that followed the Abdication. Most accounts of the Abdication have put forward views of the conflict of values at its centre that emphasise the vulnerability of the elderly mother. The clinical narrative supports a characterisation of estrangement as a subtype of bereavement with particular relevance to the geriatric population."}, {"Title": "Cooperation between in-hospital psychological support and pastoral care providers: obstacles and opportunities for a modern approach.", "Abstract": "The meaning that patients with cancer attribute to life influences their expectations and their attitudes to the disease and its treatment.

The underlying structure-function relationships are typically derived from functional manipulations or imaging approaches. Although highly informative, these are experimentally costly. The increasing amount of publicly available brain and genetic data offers a rich source that could be mined to address this problem computationally. Here, we developed an algorithm that fuses gene expression and connectivity data with functional genetic meta data and exploits cumulative effects to derive neuroanatomical maps related to multi-genic functions. We validated the approach by using public available mouse and human data. The generated neuroanatomical maps recapture known functional anatomical annotations from literature and functional MRI data. When applied to multi-genic meta data from mouse quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and human neuropsychiatric databases, this method predicted known functional maps underlying behavioral or psychiatric traits. Taken together, genetically weighted connectivity analysis (GWCA) allows for high throughput functional exploration of brain anatomy in silico. It maps functional genetic associations onto brain circuitry for refining functional neuroanatomy, or identifying trait-associated brain circuitry, from genetic data."}, {"Title": "Use of mechanical and pharmacological restraint over an eight-year period and its relation to clinical factors.", "Abstract": "Use of restraint and finding the balance between security and ethics is a continuous dilemma in clinical psychiatry.

It offers several advantages including a more realistic, lifelike environment that may allow subjects to \"forget\" they are being assessed, allow a better participation and an increased generalization of learning. Moreover, the virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, and can also be used to evaluate the patient's multimodal integration and to aid rehabilitation of cognitive abilities. The use of virtual reality to treat various psychiatric disorders in adults (phobic anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addictions\u2026) and its efficacy is supported by numerous studies. Similar research for children and adolescents is lagging behind. This may be particularly beneficial to children who often show great interest and considerable success on computer, console or videogame tasks. This article will expose the main studies that have used virtual reality with children and adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. The use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by various studies. Most of the studies attest to the significant efficacy of the virtual reality exposure therapy (or in virtuo exposure). In children, studies have covered arachnophobia social anxiety and school refusal phobia. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for treatment in anxiety disorders. Several studies have reported the clinical use of virtual reality technology for children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive research has proven the efficiency of technologies as support tools for therapy. Researches are found to be focused on communication and on learning and social imitation skills. Virtual reality is also well accepted by subjects with ASD. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled tasks such as the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like a standard classroom. The virtual reality classroom offers several advantages compared to classical tools such as more realistic and lifelike environment but also records various measures in standardized conditions. Most of the studies using a virtual classroom have found that children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder make significantly fewer correct hits and more commission errors compared with controls. The virtual classroom has proven to be a good clinical tool for evaluation of attention in ADHD. For eating disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program enhanced by a body image specific component using virtual reality techniques was shown to be more efficient than cognitive behavioural therapy alone. The body image-specific component using virtual reality techniques boots efficiency and accelerates the CBT change process for eating disorders. Virtual reality is a relatively new technology and its application in child and adolescent psychiatry is recent. However, this technique is still in its infancy and much work is needed including controlled trials before it can be introduced in routine clinical use. Virtual reality interventions should also investigate how newly acquired skills are transferred to the real world. At present virtual reality can be considered a useful tool in evaluation and treatment for child and adolescent disorders."}, {"Title": "Anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms in palliative care: from neuro-psychobiological response to stress, to symptoms' management with clinical hypnosis and meditative states.", "Abstract": "Psychosomatic disorder is a condition in which psychological stresses adversely affect physiological (somatic) functioning to the point of distress. It is a condition of dysfunction or structural damage in physical organs through inappropriate activation of the involuntary nervous system and the biochemical response. In this framework, this review will consider anxiety disorders, from the perspective of the psychobiological mechanisms of vulnerability to extreme stress in severe chronic illnesses. Psychosomatic medicine is a field of behavioral medicine and a part of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry. Psychosomatic medicine in palliative care, integrates interdisciplinary evaluation and management involving diverse clinical specialties including psychiatry, psychology, neurology, internal medicine, allergy, dermatology, psychoneuroimmunology, psychosocial oncology and spiritual care. Clinical conditions where psychological processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence. Thus, the psychosomatic symptom develops as a physiological connected of an emotional state. In a state of rage or fear, for example, the stressed person's blood pressure is likely to be elevated and his pulse and respiratory rate to be increased. When the fear passes, the heightened physiologic processes usually subside. If the person has a persistent fear (chronic anxiety), however, which he is unable to express overtly, the emotional state remains unchanged, though unexpressed in the overt behavior, and the physiological symptoms associated with the anxiety state persist.

Close social bonds provide an important social support system, at least in part by acting as a buffer against the deleterious effects of chronic exposure to stressors (Young et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 51:18195-18200, 2014; Heinrichs et al., Biol Psychiatry 54:1389-1398, 2003). There is accumulating evidence that individuals that provide predictable affiliation or support to others (bond partners) may moderate the perception of the stressor as well as of the physiological stress response. The neuropeptide, oxytocin, may mediate social buffering by down-regulating HPA activity and thus reducing the stress response. However, much within this process remains unclear, such as whether oxytocin is always released when exposed to a stressor, whether more oxytocin is released if there is social support, what aspect of stress or social support triggers oxytocin release and whether social support in the absence of a stressor also impacts oxytocin release and HPA activity, during everyday life. We review the literature that addresses each of these questions in an attempt to clarify where future research effort will be helpful. A better understanding of these dynamics is likely to have implications for enhancing social and health gains from human social relationships."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of Serious Emotional Disturbance Among U.S. Children: A Meta-Analysis.", "Abstract": "Prevalence estimates of child psychiatric disorders with severe impairment vary widely, and there is a critical need for precise estimates to inform clinical practice and policy in the United States.

In this paper, we focus on the methodology being used to evaluate the impact of capacity-building in these three target groups. We first review the evidence base for approaches to evaluation of capacity-building, highlighting the gaps in this area. We then describe the adaptation of best practice for the Emerald capacity-building evaluation. The resulting mixed method evaluation framework was tailored to each target group and to each country context. We identified a need to expand the evidence base on indicators of successful capacity-building across the different target groups. To address this, we developed an evaluation plan to measure the adequacy and usefulness of quantitative capacity-building indicators when compared with qualitative evaluation. We argue that evaluation needs to be an integral part of capacity-building activities and that expertise needs to be built in methods of evaluation. The Emerald evaluation provides a potential model for capacity-building evaluation across key stakeholder groups and promises to extend understanding of useful indicators of success."}, {"Title": "A systematic evaluation of impulsive-aggressive behavior in psychogeriatric inpatients using the staff observation aggression scale-revision (SOAS-R).", "Abstract": "Impulsive-aggressive behavior is a significant challenge in geriatric psychiatry and requires professional evaluation and management.\nSOAS-R scales (Staff Observation Aggression Scale-Revision) completed by medical staff on three secure psychiatric wards were analyzed during a period of 12 months.

We chose the MAAS-Global as an internationally recognized and validated instrument to calibrate the OSCE station items. The MAAS-Global proportion is the percentage of station checklist items that can be considered as 'true' CS. The reliability of the OSCE was calculated with G-Theory analysis and nested ANOVA was used to compare mean scores of all years.\nMAAS-Global scores in psychiatry stations were significantly higher than those in other disciplines (p<0.03) and above the initial pass mark of 50%. The higher students' scores in psychiatry stations were related to higher MAAS-Global proportions when compared to the general practice stations.\nComparison of outcome measurements, using the MAAS Global as a standardization instrument, between interdisciplinary station checklists was valid and reliable.\nThe MAAS-Global was used as a single validated instrument and is suggested as gold standard."}, {"Title": "Navigating the social synapse: the neurobiology of bedside manner.", "Abstract": "This paper seeks to explore the application of neurobiology to further understanding the importance of developing, refining and modelling good bedside manner in psychiatry. The concept of a social synapse is used as a framework to understand the impact of verbal and non-verbal information that crosses between two attuned individuals. Research shows that widely distributed cortical and subcortical networks are involved in processing of social information and the perception of safety.\nGood bedside manner is proposed as the ability of a clinician to navigate the social synapse and make a patient feel at ease. Findings from neurobiology suggest that good bedside manner needs to be a more considered component of effective psychiatric health care."}, {"Title": "An audit of patient aggression in an adult psychiatric unit: 2013-2014.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the rates of patient aggression in a psychiatric unit over 12 months and to determine underlying causes, notably the role of substances.\nA retrospective file audit was undertaken of all patients admitted to St Vincent's psychiatric unit (Melbourne, Australia) in the first half of 2013 and 2014 involved in an aggressive incident. Patient information included demographics, psychiatric, substance and aggression history. The setting and context of aggression and associated mental state findings were also reviewed.\nThere were 26 aggressive incidents in 2013 and 63 in 2014, perpetrated by 11 and 34 patients respectively. No significant differences were found between the groups' baseline demographics. The 2014 cohort was significantly more likely to have substance use history (odds ratio (OR) 4.83) and have made threats to staff (OR 4.07) but significantly less likely to be distracted by internal stimuli (OR 0.05). There were also (not statistically significant) trends for the 2014 cohort; they were more likely to report a history of alcohol use (OR 3.9); be accompanied to emergency department by police (OR 2.95) and have leave prior to aggression ( \u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 7.37).\nAggressive incidents more than doubled over 12 months. Substance use appeared to be a major factor associated with aggression. These findings have implications for service provision and training. Further research is needed to better understand and manage substances in psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "Primary Care Residents in Teaching Health Centers: Their Intentions to Practice in Underserved Settings After Residency Training.", "Abstract": "To describe the residents who chose to train in teaching health centers (THCs), which are community-based ambulatory patient care sites that sponsor primary care residencies, and their intentions to practice in underserved settings.\nThe authors surveyed all THC residents training in academic years 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016, comparing their demographic characteristics with data for residents nationally, and examined THC residents' intentions to practice in underserved settings using logistic regression analysis.\nThe overall survey response rate was 89% (1,031/1,153). THC resident respondents were similar to residents nationally in family medicine, geriatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry in terms of gender, age, race, and ethnicity. Twenty-nine percent (283) of respondents came from a rural background, and 46% (454) had an educationally and/or economically disadvantaged background. More than half (524; 55%) intended to practice in an underserved setting on completion of their training. Respondents were more likely to intend to practice in an underserved area if they came from a rural background (odds ratio 1.58; 95% confidence interval 1.08, 2.32) or disadvantaged background (odds ratio 2.81; 95% confidence interval 1.91, 4.13).\nTHCs attract residents from rural and/or disadvantaged backgrounds who seem to be more inclined to practice in underserved areas than those from urban and economically advantaged roots. THC residents' intentions to practice in underserved areas indicate that primary care training programs sponsored by community-based ambulatory patient care sites represent a promising strategy to improve the U.S. health care workforce distribution."}, {"Title": "Genetic testing in intellectual disability psychiatry: Opinions and practices of UK child and intellectual disability psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "An increasing number of genetic causes of intellectual disabilities (ID) are identifiable by clinical genetic testing, offering the prospect of bespoke patient management. However, little is known about the practices of psychiatrists and their views on genetic testing.\nWe undertook an online survey of 215 psychiatrists, who were contacted via the Royal College of Psychiatrist's Child and Adolescent and Intellectual Disability Psychiatry mailing lists.\nIn comparison with child and adolescent psychiatrists, intellectual disability psychiatrists ordered more genetic tests, referred more patients to genetic services, and were overall more confident in the genetic testing process. Respondents tended to agree that genetic diagnoses can help patient management; however, management changes were infrequently found in clinical practice.\nDifferences are apparent in the existing views and practices of child and adolescent and intellectual disability psychiatrists. Developing training and collaboration with colleagues working in genetic services could help to reduce discrepancies and improve clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Community mental health teams for older people in England: Variations in ways of working.", "Abstract": "Integrated community mental health teams (CMHTs) are a key component of specialist old age psychiatry services internationally. However, in England, significant shifts in policy, including a focus on dementia and age inclusive services, have influenced provision. This study portrays teams in 2009 against which subsequent service provision may be compared.\nA bespoke national postal survey of CMHT managers collected data on teams' structure, composition, organisation, working practices, case management, and liaison activities.\nA total of 376 CMHTs (88%) responded. Teams comprised a widespread of disciplines. However, just 28% contained the full complement of professionals recommended by government policy. Over 93% of teams had a single point of access, but some GPs bypassed this, and 40% of teams did not accept direct referrals from care homes. Initial assessments were undertaken by multiple disciplines, and 71% of teams used common assessment documentation. Nevertheless, many social workers maintained both NHS and local authority records. In 92% of teams, nominated care coordinators oversaw the support provided by other team members. However, inter-agency care coordination was less prevalent. Few teams offered the range of outreach/liaison activities anticipated in the national dementia strategy.\nCompared with previous studies, teams had grown and changed, with a clear increase in non-medical practitioners, particularly support workers. Measures to facilitate integrated care within CMHTs (eg, common access and documentation) were widespread, but integration across health and social care/primary and secondary services was less developed. Consideration of barriers to further integration, and the impact of current reforms is potentially fruitful."}, {"Title": "An Objective Measure of Splitting in Parental Alienation: The Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire.", "Abstract": "Both clinicians and forensic practitioners should distinguish parental alienation (rejection of a parent without legitimate justification) from other reasons for contact refusal. Alienated children-who were not abused-often engage in splitting and lack ambivalence with respect to the rejected parent; children who were maltreated usually perceive the abusive parent in an ambivalent manner. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (PARQ) in identifying and quantifying the degree of splitting, which may assist in diagnosing parental alienation. Results showed that severely alienated children engaged in a high level of splitting, by perceiving the preferred parent in extremely positive terms and the rejected parent in extremely negative terms. Splitting was not manifested by the children in other family groups. The PARQ may be useful for both clinicians and forensic practitioners in evaluating children of divorced parents when there is a concern about the possible diagnosis of parental alienation."}, {"Title": "A psychotic experience during adolescence: reasoning about differential diagnosis. case report.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present clinical review was to illustrate the diagnostic difficulty associated with psychotic experiences during adolescence, in the light of the multiplicity of circumstances interplaying during this period. It was also intended to illustrate the observation that not all hallucinations occur in the context of a declared psychotic disorder.\nThe patient was a 16-year-old adolescent girl who came to the Emergency Department of Coimbra Pediatric Hospital. On admission, she displayed mood and sensory perception disorders, with a bizarre gait abnormality. A diagnosis of conversion disorder was finally suggested, in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition.\nConversive hallucinations are rare in the psychiatric literature. This diagnostic hypothesis only gained consistency over a long period of follow-up within a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient service, which was fundamental for appropriate diagnostic clarification. The authors discuss psychotic experiences that can arise from a neurotic setting and share the reasoning that was constructed in relation to the differential diagnosis. The psychogenesis and phenomenology of this young patient's conversive hallucinations and the therapeutic strategies adopted over the course of the follow-up are also discussed."}, {"Title": "HIV Prevalence Among Hospitalized Patients at the Main Psychiatric Referral Hospital in Botswana.", "Abstract": "We examined HIV prevalence among patients 18-49\u00a0year olds admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Botswana in 2011 and 2012. The retrospective study analyzed females (F) and males (M) separately, comparing proportions with Chi square test and continuous variables with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, assessing significance at the 5% level. HIV seroprevalence among hospitalized psychiatric patients was much more common among females (53%) compared with males (19%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These women also appeared more vulnerable to infection compared with females in the general population (29%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.017). Among both women and men, HIV-infection appeared most common among patients with organic mental disorders (F:68%, M:41%) and neurotic, stress related and somatoform disorders (F:68%, M:42%). The largest proportion of HIV infections co-occurred among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizotypal and other psychotic disorders (F:48%; M:55%), mood (affective) disorders (F:21%; M:16%) and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (F:16%; M:20%).

Although dopamine function and reward system neural activity are impaired in most psychiatric disorders, it is unknown whether alterations in the dopamine system underlie variations in reward processing across a continuum encompassing health and these disorders. We explored the relationship between dopamine function and neural activity during reward anticipation in 27 participants including healthy volunteers and psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, depression, or cocaine addiction, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) multimodal imaging with a voxel-based statistical approach. Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed with PET and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I as a marker of presynaptic dopamine function, and reward-related neural response was assessed using fMRI with a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task. Across all the participants, DAT availability in the midbrain correlated positively with the neural response to anticipation of reward in the nucleus accumbens. Moreover, this relationship was conserved in each clinical subgroup, despite the heterogeneity of mental illnesses examined. For the first time, a direct link between DAT availability and reward anticipation was detected within the mesolimbic pathway in healthy and psychiatric participants, and suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction is a common mechanism underlying the alterations of reward processing observed in patients across diagnostic categories. The findings support the use of a dimensional approach in psychiatry, as promoted by the Research Domain Criteria project to identify neurobiological signatures of core dysfunctions underling mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Inpatient psychiatric treatment is not always effective in adolescent sample.", "Abstract": "Numerous studies confirm efficacy of psychiatric treatment as well as psychiatric placebo. The aim of the current study was the assessment of improvement rate and factors associated with treatment response in naturalistic group of adolescent inpatients.\nEighty two consecutive adolescent inpatients were recruited. Each patient at the admission and discharge was assessed with brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), eating attitude test (EAT-26), clinical global impression scale (CGI-S) and children global assessment scale (CGAS). Individual and family history was assessed by semi-structured interview. Patients, who improved in at least two interviewer-based scales (IMP, n\u2009=\u200967) were compared to the rest (N-IMP, n\u2009=\u200915). For statistical analysis STATISTICA package was used.\nThe main difference between groups was ICD-10 diagnosis distribution: in the IMP group more anxiety-related disorders (F4), in the N-IMP group more personality disorders (F6). Other differences include history of paediatric hospitalisations and surgery (more in the N-IMP group). Most of the analysed factors did not differ between groups.\nThe inpatient treatment seems to be most effective in severe mental states and in anxiety-related disorders and least effective in personality disorders. Due to limited inpatient treatment efficacy we believe outpatients services are crucial in adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Potential for diagnosis versus therapy monitoring of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a new epigenetic biomarker interacting with both genotype and auto-immunity.", "Abstract": "In view of the need for easily accessible biomarkers, we evaluated in ADHD children the epigenetic status of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) in the SLC6A3 gene, coding for human dopamine transporter (DAT). We analysed buccal swabs and sera from 30 children who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD, assigned to treatment according to severity. Methylation levels at six-selected CpG sites (among which, a CGGCGGCGG and a CGCG motif), alone or in combination with serum titers in auto-antibodies against dopamine transporter (DAT aAbs), were analysed for correlation with CGAS scores (by clinicians) and Conners' scales (by parents), collected at recruitment and after 6\u00a0weeks. In addition, we characterized the DAT genotype, i.e., the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms at the 3'-UTR of the gene. DAT methylation levels were greatly reduced in ADHD patients compared to control, healthy children. Within patients carrying at least one DAT 9 allele (DAT 9/x), methylation at positions CpG2 and/or CpG6 correlated with recovery, as evident from delta-CGAS scores as well as delta Conners' scales ('inattentive' and 'hyperactive' subscales). Moreover, hypermethylation at CpG1 position denoted severity, specifically for those patients carrying a DAT 10/10 genotype. Intriguingly, high serum DAT-aAbs titers appeared to corroborate indications from high CpG1 versus high CpG2/CpG6 levels, likewise denoting severity versus recovery in DAT 10/10 versus 9/x patients, respectively. These profiles suggest that DAT 5'UTR epigenetics plus serum aAbs can serve as suitable biomarkers, to confirm ADHD diagnosis and/or to predict the efficacy of treatment."}, {"Title": "Tracking Brain Development and Dimensional Psychiatric Symptoms in Children: A Longitudinal Population-Based Neuroimaging Study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric symptomatology during childhood predicts persistent mental illness later in life. While neuroimaging methodologies are routinely applied cross-sectionally to the study of child and adolescent psychopathology, the nature of the relationship between childhood symptoms and the underlying neurodevelopmental processes remains unclear. The authors used a prospective population-based cohort to delineate the longitudinal relationship between childhood psychiatric problems and brain development.\nA total of 845 children participated in the study. Psychiatric symptoms were measured with the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist at ages 6 and 10. MRI data were collected at ages 8 and 10. Cross-lagged panel models and linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the associations between psychiatric symptom ratings and quantitative anatomic and white matter microstructural measures over time.\nHigher ratings for externalizing and internalizing symptoms at baseline predicted smaller increases in both subcortical gray matter volume and global fractional anisotropy over time. The reverse relationship did not hold; thus, baseline measures of gray matter and white matter were not significantly related to changes in symptom ratings over time.\nChildren presenting with behavioral problems at an early age show differential subcortical and white matter development. Most neuroimaging models tend to explain brain differences observed in psychopathology as an underlying (causal) neurobiological substrate. However, the present work suggests that future neuroimaging studies showing effects that are pathogenic in nature should additionally explore the possibility of the downstream effects of psychopathology on the brain."}, {"Title": "Serotonin in psychiatry: in vitro disease modeling using patient-derived neurons.", "Abstract": "Several lines of evidence implicate serotonin in the etiology of multiple psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).

LOS was significantly longer in Ireland. Living alone was the only significant predictor for longer LOS in both countries, whereas in addition to living alone, younger age was also a contributor for longer LOS in Turkey.\nGiven that the only factor predicting LOS both in Turkey and Ireland was living alone, helping to identify more acceptable ways of providing social support for living arrangements constitutes an important service to shorten LOS in old age psychiatric population.\nIt is possible to infer that independent from the cultural diversities, living arrangement is a consistent entity to influence length of hospital stay in older adult population."}, {"Title": "Outcomes of a psycho-education and monitoring programme to prevent compulsory admission to psychiatric inpatient care: a randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "There is a need for interventions that effectively reduce compulsory admission to psychiatry. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to investigate whether an innovative intervention programme prevents compulsory re-admission in people with serious mental illness.\nThe programme addresses primarily patients' self-management skills. It consists of individualised psychoeducation focusing on behaviours prior to and during illness-related crises, crisis cards and, after discharge from the psychiatric hospital, a 24-month preventive monitoring. A total of 238 inpatients with compulsory admission(s) in the past were randomised to the intervention group or to treatment as usual (TAU).\nFewer participants who completed the 24-month programme were compulsorily readmitted to psychiatry (28%), compared with those receiving TAU (43%). Likewise, the number of compulsory readmissions per patient was significantly lower (0.6 v. 1.0) and involuntary episodes were shorter (15 v. 31 days), compared with TAU. A negative binomial regression model showed a significant intervention effect (RR 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.9); further factors linked to the risk of compulsory readmission were the number of compulsory admissions in the patient's history (RR 2.8), the diagnosis of a personality disorder (RR 2.8), or a psychotic disorder (RR 1.9). Dropouts (37% intervention group; 22% TAU) were characterised by a high number of compulsory admissions prior to the trial, younger age and foreign nationality.\nThis study suggests that this intervention is a feasible and valuable option to prevent compulsory re-hospitalisation in a high-risk group of people with severe mental health problems, social disabilities, and a history of hospitalisations."}, {"Title": "Latent traits of impulsivity and compulsivity: toward dimensional psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The concepts of impulsivity and compulsivity are commonly used in psychiatry. Little is known about whether different manifest measures of impulsivity and compulsivity (behavior, personality, and cognition) map onto underlying latent traits; and if so, their inter-relationship.\nA total of 576 adults were recruited using media advertisements. Psychopathological, personality, and cognitive measures of impulsivity and compulsivity were completed. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify the optimal model.\nThe data were best explained by a two-factor model, corresponding to latent traits of impulsivity and compulsivity, respectively, which were positively correlated with each other. This model was statistically superior to the alternative models of their being one underlying factor ('disinhibition') or two anticorrelated factors. Higher scores on the impulsive and compulsive latent factors were each significantly associated with worse quality of life (both p < 0.0001).\nThis study supports the existence of latent functionally impairing dimensional forms of impulsivity and compulsivity, which are positively correlated. Future work should examine the neurobiological and neurochemical underpinnings of these latent traits; and explore whether they can be used as candidate treatment targets. The findings have implications for diagnostic classification systems, suggesting that combining categorical and dimensional approaches may be valuable and clinically relevant."}, {"Title": "Psychedelics and connectedness.", "Abstract": "Psychedelic drugs are creating ripples in psychiatry as evidence accumulates of their therapeutic potential.

These processes enable redox sensing and facilitate homeostatic regulation of redox dependent protein signalling, function, stability and trafficking. Increased S-nitrosylation in an environment of increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) is initially a protective mechanism aimed at maintaining protein structure and function. When O&NS becomes severe, mechanisms governing denitrosylation and transnitrosylation break down leading to the pathological state referred to as hypernitrosylation (HN). Such a state has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and we investigate its potential role in the development and maintenance of neuroprogressive disorders. In this paper, we propose a model whereby the hypernitrosylation of a range of functional proteins and enzymes lead to changes in activity which conspire to produce at least some of the core abnormalities contributing to the development and maintenance of pathology in these illnesses."}, {"Title": "The impact of CT head scans on ED management and length of stay in bizarre behavior patients.", "Abstract": "A 5-year retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 EDs.

Adjustment for propensity scores or the use of propensity score matching did not alter the results.\nOur study found that prescription of aspirin offered no significant protection against incident depressive symptoms. Whether aspirin is beneficial in a subgroup of depression with high levels of inflammation remains to be investigated in future studies."}, {"Title": "Personality Traits Are Associated with Academic Achievement in Medical School: A Nationally Representative Study.", "Abstract": "This nationally representative study sought to identify personality traits that are associated with academic achievement in medical school.\nThird-year medical students, who completed an initial questionnaire in January 2011, were mailed a second questionnaire several months later during their fourth year. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and burnout, the authors used multivariate logistic regressions to determine whether Big Five personality traits were associated with receiving honors/highest grade in clinical clerkships, failing a course or rotation, and being selected for the Alpha Omega Alpha or Gold Humanism Honor Society.\nThe adjusted response rates for the two surveys were 61 (n\u00a0=\u00a0564/919) and 84% (n\u00a0=\u00a0474/564). The personality trait conscientiousness predicted obtaining honors/highest grade in all clinical clerkships. In contrast, students high in neuroticism were less likely to do well in most specialties. Students with higher conscientiousness were more likely to be inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society, while students high in openness or agreeableness traits were more likely to be inducted into the Gold Humanism Honor Society. Burnout was not associated with any clinical performance measures.\nThis study suggests the importance of personality traits, particularly conscientiousness, in predicting success during the clinical years of medical school. Medical educators should consider a nuanced examination of personality traits and other non-cognitive factors, particularly for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Vegetarian diets and depressive symptoms among men.", "Abstract": "Vegetarian diets are associate with cardiovascular and other health benefits, but little is known about mental health benefits or risks.\nTo determine whether self-identification of vegetarian dietary habits is associated with significant depressive symptoms in men.\nSelf-report data from 9668 adult male partners of pregnant women in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) included identification as vegetarian or vegan, dietary frequency data and the Edinburgh Post Natal Depression Scale (EPDS).

The authors examined the appeals process from the clerkship directors' perspective.\nA 23-item survey, consisting of multiple choice and narrative questions, was sent to allopathic and osteopathic accredited schools in North America. Questions included information about the medical school, the clerkship director, and the grade appeal processes. StatPlus sorted and analyzed the data, and grade challenge rates were compared between schools. The narrative responses were independently sorted by the authors.\nSixty-one responses were received (35% of programs). A grade challenge rate was calculated for each response, using the number of appeals/students per year, allowing for further comparison of grade challenges. Clerkships with an honors/pass/fail grading schema had a higher grade challenge rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) when compared to all other reported grading schemas. Clerkships where the grade appeal could result in a lower grade had a smaller grade challenge rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) as compared to programs where a grade appeal could not result in a lower grade. The authors observed three common pathways for the processing of grade appeals and four common themes among clerkship directors as contributors to grade appeals.\nA grade appeal is often the final step in the grading process for medical students. By identifying factors that contribute to grade appeals, areas for targeted interventions in the evaluation process are potentially identified.

In this commentary we summarize key findings and recommendations most relevant to clinicians and researchers in geriatric psychiatry and related disciplines. The report notes the growing prevalence of family caregiving in the United States, especially those caring for high-need patients with multiple chronic conditions, disability, and/or cognitive impairment. To support the capacity of family caregivers to perform critical caregiving tasks, the report recommends a major shift in healthcare policy toward collaborative partnerships among patients, their defined family, and providers of care. Optimizing the role of family caregivers will minimally require systematic attention to the identification, assessment, and support of family caregivers throughout the care delivery process. Research is needed to develop the tools and protocols to efficiently assess caregivers, and identify ways in which they can be integrated into existing clinical practices. We also need research to identify how to best implement, maintain, and evaluate caregiver support programs within clinical and community settings. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should be charged with developing, testing, and implementing provider payment reforms that motivate providers to engage and support family caregivers. Payment reforms should include clearly articulated performance standards that hold providers accountable for caregiver engagement, training, and support by explicitly including caregiver outcomes in quality measures."}, {"Title": "The Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and Trauma-Related Disorders.", "Abstract": "Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders, focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade."}, {"Title": "The forsaking of the clinical EEG by psychiatry: how justified?", "Abstract": "Despite decades of publications attesting to the role of the clinical EEG in diagnosing and managing psychiatric disorders, the procedure remains highly underutilized in the practice of psychiatry. The visually inspected EEG (vEEG) can detect various forms of abnormalities, each with its own clinical significance. Abnormalities can be paroxysmal (i.e., suggestive of an epileptic-like process) or stationary. The most important unanswered question remains the value of detecting epileptiform activity in a nonepileptic psychiatric patient in predicting favorable responses to anticonvulsant treatment. Despite the many shortcomings of vEEG, the available evidence suggests that in the presence of paroxysmal activity in a nonepileptic psychiatric patient a trial of a psychotropic anticonvulsant may be warranted if standard treatment has failed. More research on the contribution of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities to the problem of episodic psychiatric symptoms (e.g., panic attacks, dissociative episodes, repeated violence) is sorely needed. It is postulated that at least some of these conditions may represent an epilepsy spectrum disorder. Similarly, the significance of the presence of a slow-wave activity (whether focal or generalized) also deserves further well-designed research to ascertain the exact clinical significance. Nonetheless, the available data suggest that further medical workup is necessary to ascertain the nature and degree of the pathology when present."}, {"Title": "Increasing physical activity for veterans in the Mental Health Intensive Case Management Program: A community-based intervention.", "Abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI), experience increased mortality-20 years greater disparity for men and 15 years greater disparity for women-compared to the general population (Thornicroft G. Physical health disparities and mental illness: The scandal of premature mortality. Br J Psychiatr. 2011;199:441-442). Numerous factors contribute to premature mortality in persons with SMI, including suicide and accidental death (Richardson RC, Faulkner G, McDevitt J, Skrinar GS, Hutchinson D, Piette JD. Integrating physical activity into mental health services for persons with serious mental illness. Psychiatr Serv. 2005;56(3):324-331; Thornicroft G. Physical health disparities and mental illness: The scandal of premature mortality. Br J Psychiatr. 2011;199:441-442), but research has shown that adverse health behaviors-including smoking, low rate of physical activity, poor diet, and high alcohol consumption-also significantly contribute to premature deaths (Jones J. Life expectancy in mental illness. Psychiatry Services. 2010. Retrieved from http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/07/13/life-expectancy-in-mental-illness). This quality improvement (QI) project sought to improve health and wellness for veterans in the Mental Health Intensive Case Management Program (MHICM), which is a community-based intensive program for veterans with SMI at risk for decompensation and frequent hospitalizations. At the time of this QI project, the program had 69 veterans who were assessed and treated weekly in their homes. The project introduced a pedometer steps intervention adapted from the VA MOVE! Program-a physical activity and weight management program-with the addition of personalized assistance from trained mental health professionals in the veteran's home environment. Because a large percentage of the veterans in the MHICM program had high blood pressure and increased weight, these outcomes were the focus of this project. Through mental health case management involvement and the comfort of their familiar living environment, veterans were assisted to meet their physical and mental health goals with a program that could easily be integrated into their daily lives.\nHealthy People 2020 developed goals to improve levels of physical activity and has ranked physical activity as a leading health indicator (US DHHS. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Physical activity topic overview. In Healthy People 2020. 2016. Retrieved from https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/physical-activity). Individuals with SMI are significantly less active than the general population (Shor and Shalev, 2014). It is sometimes difficult for the average individual to obtain the recommended 10,000 steps and even more difficult for those with SMI. Lifestyle modifications, in particular diet and exercise, are recommended for improvement of chronic disease outcomes (US Preventive Services Counseling Task Force, 2016). The health benefits of physical activity for people with SMI are mixed (Pearsall R, Smith D, Pelosi A, Geddes J. Exercise therapy in adults with serious mental illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BMC Psychiatr. 2014;14:117). Some studies found significant physical health benefits, while others did not. However, according to a review by Soundy et\u00a0al., physical exercise is shown to not only have physical benefits but also psychosocial benefits. One of the barriers that hinder participation in physical activities is accessibility (Shor and Shalev, 2014). Integrating a more personalized supported, and in-home pedometer program into mental healthcare should ensure better access to interventions that could possibly reverse the causes of premature death.\nThe program was offered to 69 veterans in the MHICM. Forty-nine agreed to start the program and 20 declined. Twenty-five clients actually started the program with 17 veterans completing it. Preimplementation data included collecting blood pressure and weight measures for all veterans in the MHICM program. Additionally, a focus group was held with case managers to obtain a group perspective on motivating veterans to participate in this program. Further, a teaching session was held to review pedometers use, the client video, the client booklet, methods for getting veterans started, and the progression of the walking intervention. The pedometer physical activity intervention continued for 2 months. At the end of the 2 months, aggregate de-identified data on number of steps, blood pressure, and weight were collected. At the end of the program, the data were reviewed, synthesized, and analyzed, being careful to account for potentially intervening conditions and other chronic illnesses.\nThe postimplementation data revealed that the mean weight decreased by 9 lbs. The percentage of controlled blood pressure increased from 60 to 84, while the percentage of uncontrolled blood pressure decreased from 40 to 16.\nImplementation of a multiple component personalized exercise intervention program for veterans with SMI contributed to reduction in weight and blood pressure."}, {"Title": "Length of Involuntary Hospitalization Related to the Referring Physician's Psychiatric Emergency Experience.", "Abstract": "Although involuntary commitment (IC) is a serious intervention in psychiatry and must always be regarded as an emergency measure, the knowledge about influencing factors is limited.

Duration of involuntary hospitalization and duration until day-passes of 508 patients with IC at the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich were analyzed using a generalized linear model. Durations of involuntary hospitalization and time until day-passes were significantly shorter in patients referred by physicians with less routine experience in psychiatric emergency situations than compared to experienced physicians. Shorter hospitalizations following IC by less-experienced physicians suggest that some IC's might be unnecessary.

In occupational mental health research, there are three widely used theoretical models, namely, job demand and control (JD-C), effort-reward imbalance (ERI) and work-family conflicts (WFC). However, the interaction between these models and their combined effect on the risk of major depression in the workplace is largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the longitudinal combined effects of JD-C, ERI and WFC on the risk of major depression in the working population.\nLongitudinal data (2008-2013) were collected on randomly selected participants (n=4200) from the working population of the province of Alberta, Canada, at baseline and 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year follow-up. Data about JD-C, ERI, WFC and major depression were collected by trained interviewers using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing method. Generalised estimating equations for longitudinal modelling were used.\nThere was an independent association between high ERI and high WFC at t<sub>x</sub> and major depression at t<sub>x+1</sub> (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.96; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.52), respectively. The combined effects of JD-C and ERI, ERI and WFC, and WFC and JD-C on the risk of major depression were as follows: OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.42, OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.49 and OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.48 to 3.30, respectively. The relative excess risks attributable to the interactions were statistically non-significant.\nWork-related psychosocial factors are associated with increased risk of major depression over time, but their combined effect is not synergistic. The effects of the factors depicted in the three occupational health models on the risk of major depression appear to be additive."}, {"Title": "Receptor visualization and the atomic bomb. A historical account of the development of the chemical neuroanatomy of receptors for neurotransmitters and drugs during the Cold War.", "Abstract": "This is a historical account of how receptors for neurotransmitters and drugs got to be seen at the regional, cellular, and subcellular levels in brain, in the years going from the end of the World War II until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cold War (1945-1991). The realization in the US of the problem of mental health care, as a consequence of the results of medical evaluation for military service during the war, let the US Government to act creating among other things the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). Coincident with that, new drug treatments for these disorders were introduced. War science also created an important number of tools and instruments, such as the radioisotopes, that played a significant role in the development of our story. The scientific context was marked by the development of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and the introduction in the early 80's of the DNA recombinant technologies. The concepts of chemical neurotransmission in the brain and of receptors for drugs and transmitters, although proposed before the war, where not generally accepted. Neurotransmitters were identified and the mechanisms of biosynthesis, storage, release and termination of action by mechanisms such as reuptake, elucidated. Furthermore, the synapse was seen with the electron microscope and more important for our account, neurons and their processes visualized in the brain first by fluorescence histochemistry, then using radioisotopes and autoradiography, and later by immunohistochemistry (IHC), originating the Chemical Neuroanatomy. The concept of chemical neurotransmission evolved from the amines, expanded to excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, then to neuropeptides and finally to gases and other \"atypical\" neurotransmitters. In addition, coexpression of more than one transmitter in a neuron, changed the initial ideas of neurotransmission. The concept of receptors for these and other messengers underwent a significant evolution from an abstract chemical concept to their physical reality as gene products. Important steps were the introduction in the 70's of radioligand binding techniques and the cloning of receptor genes in the 80's. Receptors were first visualized using radioligands and autoradiography, and analyzed with the newly developed computer-assisted image analysis systems. Using Positron Emission Tomography transmitters and receptors were visualized in living human brain. The cloning of receptor genes allowed the use of in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry to visualize with the light and electron microscopes the receptor mRNAs and proteins. The results showed the wide heterogeneity of receptors and the diversity of mode of signal transmission, synaptic and extra-synaptic, again radically modifying the early views of neurotransmission. During the entire period the interplay between basic science and Psychopharmacology and Psychiatry generated different transmitter or receptor-based theories of brain drug action. These concepts and technologies also changed the way new drugs were discovered and developed. At the end of the period, a number of declines in these theories, the use of certain tools and the ability to generate new diagnostics and treatments, the end of an era and the beginning of a new one in the research of how the brain functions."}, {"Title": "Catatonia in children and adolescents: New perspectives.", "Abstract": "Catatonia is a rare and severe psychomotor condition in children and adolescents.

Social behavior refers to the behavioral response with regard to socially relevant information, and requires the perception and integration of social cues through a complex cognition process (i.e. social cognition) that involves attention, memory, motivation and emotion. Neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior are highly conserved across species, and inter- and intra-specific variability observed in social behavior can be explained to large extent by differential activity of this conserved neural network. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have greatly informed about the brain structures and their connectivity networks that are important for social cognition. Animal research has been crucial for identifying specific circuits and molecular mechanisms that modulate this structural network. From a molecular neurobiology perspective, activity in these brain structures is coordinated by neuronal circuits modulated by several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Thus, quantitative variation in the levels, release and/or receptor density of these molecules could affect the observed behavioral response. The present review presents an overall framework of the components of the social brain circuitry and its modulation. By integrating multiple research approaches, from human fMRI studies to animal models we can start shedding light into how dysfunction in these circuits could lead to disorders of social-functioning such as Autism."}, {"Title": "Multiple possible inaccuracies cast doubt on a recent report suggesting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to be toxic and ineffective.", "Abstract": "According to a systematic review on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adult depression that was recently published in BMC Psychiatry, the results of which have been widely disseminated in lay media, these drugs increase the risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) while exerting poor antidepressant efficacy. A cursory analysis, however, suggests the analysis of SAEs conducted by the authors to be marred by both methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. After having corrected for these apparent mistakes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we also accounted for a possible moderating effect of age; while this suggests SSRIs to be safe drugs in the non-elderly, they do confirm what is already known, that is, that they may enhance the risk for SAEs in the old. Given the loose definition of SAE, including also innocuous phenomena, the possible clinical significance of the latter observation, however, remains unclear until the nature and actual impact of the SAEs in question have been clarified. Moreover, with respect to efficacy, we find the paper in BMC Psychiatry misleading: first, the authors seem unaware of the well-established shortcomings associated with the conventional efficacy parameter on which their analysis is based, second, they have included suboptimal SSRI doses and third, they have missed some pivotal trials. Unless there are explanations for the many peculiarities in this paper that have escaped us, and which may be satisfactorily clarified by the authors, it seems important that the conclusions presented in this paper be publicly rectified."}, {"Title": "Looking at hospitalized persons throughout the prism of the handicap.", "Abstract": "To describe the disability status of non-selected hospitalized persons.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess activity limitations of every person older than 18 years hospitalized in a regional university hospital covering all medical fields.

While RCTs allow researchers to determine whether a given medication or intervention is effective in a specific patient sample, for practicing clinicians it is more important to know whether it will work for their particular patient in their particular setting. This information cannot be garnered from an RCT. These inherent limitations are exacerbated by biases in design, recruitment, sample populations and data analysis that are inevitable in real-world studies. While trial registration and CONSORT have been implemented to correct and improve these issues, it is worrying that many trials fail to achieve such standards and yet their findings are used to inform clinical decision making. This perspective piece questions the assumptions of RCTs and highlights the widespread distortion of findings that currently undermine the credibility of this powerful design. It is recommended that the clinical guidelines include advice as to what should be considered good and relevant evidence and that external bodies continue to monitor RCTs to ensure that the outcomes published indeed reflect reality."}, {"Title": "Predictors of length of stay in an acute psychiatric inpatient facility in a general hospital: a prospective study.", "Abstract": "There have been significant reductions in numbers of psychiatric beds and length of stay (LOS) worldwide, making LOS in psychiatric beds an interesting outcome. The objective of this study was to find factors measurable on admission that would predict LOS in the acute psychiatric setting.\nThis was a prospective, observational study.\nOverall, 385 subjects were included. The median LOS was 25 days. In the final model, six variables explained 14.6% of the variation in LOS: not having own income, psychiatric admissions in the preceding 2 years, high Clinical Global Impression and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores, diagnosis of schizophrenia, and history of attempted suicide. All variables were associated with longer LOS, apart from history of attempted suicide.\nIdentifying patients who will need to stay longer in psychiatric beds remains a challenge.

However, genetic variants of complex diseases often only confer a marginal increase in disease risk, which is additionally influenced by the environment. Here we show that embryonic deletion of Cacna1c in forebrain glutamatergic neurons promotes the manifestation of endophenotypes related to psychiatric disorders including cognitive decline, impaired synaptic plasticity, reduced sociability, hyperactivity and increased anxiety. Additional analyses revealed that depletion of Cacna1c during embryonic development also increases the susceptibility to chronic stress, which suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 interacts with the environment to shape disease vulnerability. Remarkably, this was not observed when Cacna1c was deleted in glutamatergic neurons during adulthood, where the later deletion even improved cognitive flexibility, strengthened synaptic plasticity and induced stress resilience. In a parallel gene \u00d7 environment design in humans, we additionally demonstrate that SNPs in CACNA1C significantly interact with adverse life events to alter the risk to develop symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Overall, our results further validate Cacna1c as a cross-disorder risk gene in mice and humans, and additionally suggest a differential role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during development and adulthood in shaping cognition, sociability, emotional behavior and stress susceptibility. This may prompt the consideration for pharmacological manipulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental and/or stress-related origins."}, {"Title": "The relationship between the INTERMED patient complexity instrument and Level of Care Utilisation System (LOCUS).", "Abstract": "To investigate the concurrent and criterion validity of two independently developed measurement instruments, INTERMED and LOCUS, designed to improve the treatment and clinical management of patients with complex symptom manifestations.\nParticipants (N\u2009=\u200966) were selected from hospital records based on the complexity of presenting symptoms, with tripartite diagnoses across biological, psychiatric and addiction domains.

The inability of psychiatry to frame psychosis as multidimensional syndromal variation of largely unpredictable course and outcome - within and between individuals - hampers research and recovery-oriented practice. 'Psychosis' remains firmly associated with 'schizophrenia', as evidenced by a vigorous stream of high-impact but non-replicable attempts to 'reverse-engineer' the hypothesized biological disease entity, using case-control paradigms that cannot distinguish between risk for illness onset and risk for poor outcome. In this paper, the main issues surrounding the concept of schizophrenia are described. We tentatively conclude that with the advent of broad spectrum phenotypes covering autism and addiction in DSM5, the prospect for introducing a psychosis spectrum disorder - and modernizing psychiatry - appears to be within reach."}, {"Title": "Love as delusion, delusions of love: erotomania, narcissism and shame.", "Abstract": "Erotomania has a long, colourful history in psychiatry. It is a rare condition in which the patient ('subject') develops the belief that he or she is loved from afar by another person ('object'). The subject is generally female, though men predominate in forensic samples. The object is generally perceived to belong to a higher social class, reflecting a sociopolitical element in the construction of love. Erotomania requires active treatment and risk management as it can be associated with stalking and other offending behaviour. In addition to featuring in the psychiatry literature, erotomania features in the biography of the economist John Maynard Keynes (the apparent 'object' of a woman's erotomanic delusions in the early 1900s) and in fiction (eg, Ian McEwan's <i>Enduring Love</i>); this reflects, in part, the general popularity of romantic themes in broader literature and society. In psychological terms, certain cases of erotomania might be underpinned by combinations of longing, disappointment, shame and narcissism in specific social contexts. Lesser forms of delusional exaggeration of true love might also exist in some stable relationships, and might even be essential for their continued existence. Overall, the division between love and delusions of love is not as distinct as one might imagine. The potential presence of an element of delusional love in many relationships might well serve important social functions, conferring specific advantages on the parties involved and increasing social and community stability. After all, delusions persist; love dies."}, {"Title": "Opinions Regarding Benzodiazepine Teaching and Prescribing Among Trainees in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for a variety of symptoms and illnesses. There has been limited investigation on the training psychiatry residents receive regarding benzodiazepine prescribing. This study surveyed US psychiatric trainees about their didactic and clinical experience with benzodiazepines, investigating how experience with benzodiazepines may shape trainees' opinions and likelihood to prescribe.\nThe 14-question online survey was distributed to residents and fellows at US training programs through an invitation from their training directors.\nOf 466 programs contacted, with an estimated 1345 trainees, a total of 97 programs (20.8%) and 424 trainees (31.5%) responded. The analyses focused only on the 342 general psychiatry trainees who responded. Most trainees reported having formal didactics on benzodiazepines, and earlier training was correlated with higher trainee quality of instruction assessments (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Most trainees rated their instructors as Above or Well Above Average. Trainees cited the observation and opinion of supervisors as the two most important factors affecting likelihood of future benzodiazepine prescribing. Trainees commonly reported pressure from patients to prescribe benzodiazepines but were split on perceived pressure from supervisors about prescribing and whether a bias exists against prescribing at their program or in general.\nThe survey indicated that psychiatry trainees generally feel adequately trained through didactic and clinical experience with benzodiazepines. Trainees perceived pressure by patients to prescribe benzodiazepines, but generally felt comfortable in managing benzodiazepine usage. Psychiatry attendings' opinions on benzodiazepines most impacted trainees. Influences on trainees' prescribing patterns are important variables that can impact future benzodiazepine prescribing."}, {"Title": "Validation of a Teaching Effectiveness Assessment in Psychiatry Continuing Medical Education.", "Abstract": "Little is known about factors associated with effective continuing medical education (CME) in psychiatry.

Presentations were evaluated using an eight-item CME teaching effectiveness instrument, its content based on previously published instruments. Factor analysis, internal consistency and interrater reliabilities, and temporal stability reliability were calculated. Associations were determined between teaching effectiveness scores and characteristics of presentations, presenters, and participants.\nIn total, 364 participants returned 246 completed surveys (response rate, 67.6%). Factor analysis revealed a unidimensional model of psychiatry CME teaching effectiveness. Cronbach \u03b1 for the instrument was excellent at 0.94.

Their pathogenetic mechanisms are still not elucidated.\nHerein, we review the impact of neurotransmitters on metabolic regulation, providing insights into antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects.\nAntipsychotic drugs seem to interfere with feeding behaviors and energy balance, processes that control metabolic regulation. Reward and energy balance centers in central nervous system constitute the central level of metabolic regulation. The peripheral level consists of skeletal muscles, the liver, the pancreas, the adipose tissue and neuroendocrine connections. Neurotransmitter receptors have crucial roles in metabolic regulation and they are also targets of antipsychotic drugs. Interaction of antipsychotics with neurotransmitters could have both protective and harmful effects on metabolism.\nEmerging evidence suggests that antipsychotics have different liabilities to induce obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Around 20% of juvenile catatonia is associated with organic condition (Consoli et al., 2012). Autoimmune conditions represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge since specific antibodies can be missed. To facilitate decision making, we recently formulated a causality assessment score (CAUS) using a stepwise approach and an immunosuppressive therapeutic challenge (Ferrafiat et al., 2016). Our objectives were to validate retrospectively CAUS and to define its threshold for an accurate distinction between organic catatonia and non-organic catatonia, and specifically between autoimmune catatonia and non-organic catatonia.\nTo obtain a sufficient number of cases with organic catatonia, we pooled two samples (N=104) - one from a child psychiatry center, the other from neuro-pediatrics center - expert in catatonia and autoimmune conditions. Organic conditions were diagnosed using a multidisciplinary approach and numerous paraclinical investigations. Given the binary classification needs, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Peacock and Peacock, 2010) to calculate the best classification threshold.\nThe cohort included 67 cases of non-organic catatonia and 37 cases of organic catatonia.

A case for strong aggregate outcomes.", "Abstract": "Clinical trials in psychiatry inherit methods for design and statistical analysis from evidence-based medicine. However, trials in other clinical disciplines benefit from a more specific relationship between instruments that measure disease state (e.g. biomarkers, clinical signs), the underlying pathology and diagnosis such that primary outcomes can be readily defined. Trials in psychiatry use diagnosis (i.e. a categorical label for a syndrome) as a proxy for the underlying disorder, and outcomes are defined, for example, as a percentage change in a univariate total score on some clinical instrument. We label this approach to defining outcomes weak aggregation of disease state. Univariate measures are necessary, because statistical methodology is both tractable and well-developed for scalar outcomes, but we show that weak aggregate approaches do not capture disease state sufficiently, potentially leading to loss of information about response to intervention. We demonstrate how multivariate disease state can be captured using geometric concepts of spaces defined over routine clinical instruments, and show how clinically meaningful disease states (e.g. representing different profiles of symptoms, recovery or remission) can be defined as prototypes (geometric locations) in these spaces. Then, we show how to derive univariate (scalar) measures, which capture patient's relationships to these prototypes and argue these represent strong aggregates of disease state that may be a better basis for outcome measures. We demonstrate our proposal using a large publically available dataset. We conclude by discussing the impact of strong aggregates for analyses in traditional and novel trial designs."}, {"Title": "Findings from the Harvard Medical School Cambridge Integrated Clerkship, a Year-Long Longitudinal Psychiatry Experience.", "Abstract": "The Harvard Medical School Cambridge Integrated Clerkship is a longitudinal integrated clerkship that has provided an alternative clinical model for medical education in psychiatry since its inception in 2004.

Often highly publicized, violent acts raise the question of their detection, prevention, management and treatment. There is no single, direct and exclusive link between aggressiveness and the underlying psychiatric disorder. On the contrary, the processes underlying this violence are multiple and interlinked. In addition to static and dynamic risk factors, cognitive deficits play an important role in the genesis and maintenance of violent and aggressive behavior.\nUsing recent data from the international literature and the main databases, we first clarify the role played by cognitive deficits in the violence of patients with schizophrenia. We then evaluate the place of psychosocial interventions such as cognitive remediation and social cognitive training in managing the violent and aggressive behavior of these patients.\nExecutive functions and working memory are the most studied neurocognitive functions in the field of violence in schizophrenia. Impulsivity, lack of cognitive flexibility, lack of adaptation and inhibition of automatic motor responses, and altered anger regulation may explain this relationship. Three main components of social cognition are associated with violent behaviors in schizophrenia: (1) the recognition of facial emotions through the inoperability of systems of \"emotional monitoring\", violent inhibition and recognition of informative facial zones; (2) the theory of the mind through the erroneous interpretation of the intentions of others; (3) the attributional style through the preferentially aggressive over interpretation of social situations and weak capacities of introspection. Overall, cognitive biases inhibit response in a socially acceptable manner and increase the risk of responding impulsively and aggressively to a stressful or provocative situation. In this context, we studied the place held by psychosocial interventions in the management of the violent and aggressive behaviors of these patients. Various cognitive remediation programs have shown their feasibility in people with schizophrenia and neurocognitive deficits with a history of violence as well as their effectiveness in reducing violence, mainly by reducing impulsivity. Similarly, specific programs dedicated to social cognitive training such as Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT), Reasoning and Rehabilitation Mental Health Program (R&R2 MHP) and Metacognitive Training (MCT) have shown their positive impact on the control and reduction of global aggressive attitudes and on the numbers of physical and verbal aggressive incidents in schizophrenia. The improvement of social cognition would be achieved through the amendment of interpersonal relationships and social functioning. These interventions are effective at different stages of disease progression, in patients with varied profiles, on violent attitudes in general and on the number of verbal and physical attacks, whether for in-patients or out-patients. Beneficial effects can last up to 12months after termination of the study program. The interest of these interventions is preventive if the subject never entered in a violent register or curative in case of a personal history of violence. This type of care can be considered from a symptomatic point of view by limiting downstream the heavy consequences of such acts, but also etiologically by acting on one of the causes of violent behavior. Compliance with the eligibility criteria, carrying out a prior functional analysis and confirmation of the major impulsive part of the patient's violence are prerequisites for the use of these programs. Similarly, the early introduction of such therapies, their repetition over time and the integration of the patient into a comprehensive process of psychosocial rehabilitation will ensure the best chance of success.\nSome cognitive impairments appear to have their place in the genesis, progression and maintenance of violent acts of individuals with schizophrenia. Their management thus opens new therapeutic perspectives such as cognitive remediation, still rarely used in this aim, to complement the action of the traditional care tools. However, further therapeutic trials are needed before considering cognitive remediation and social cognitive training as central care modalities in the therapeutic control of violence in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal changes in global and domain specific cognitive function in the very-old: findings from the Newcastle 85+ Study.", "Abstract": "Ageing is associated with changes in cognition in some, but not all domains.

At baseline, participants were grouped using Mini-Mental State Examination cut-off scores and dementia status into the following: not impaired, mildly impaired or severely impaired/dementia groups.\nOnly a limited number of cognitive measures showed significant decline in performance over time. Where observed, change generally occurred only in the severely impaired group. In the severely impaired group, small differences in baseline age were associated with poorer performance over time on most measures.

Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation.\nFollowing PS stratification, those who received a psychosocial assessment had a lower risk of repeat hospital attendance for self-harm than those who were not assessed [RR 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-0.95]. The risk was reduced most among people less likely to be assessed. Following PS matching, we found no associations between risks of repeat self-harm and admission to a medical bed, referral to outpatient psychiatry or admission to a psychiatric bed. We did not find a relationship between psychosocial assessment and repeat self-harm in the 31 centre cohort.\nThis study shows the potential value of using novel statistical techniques in large mental health datasets to estimate treatment effects. We found that specialist psychosocial assessment may reduce the risk of repeat self-harm. This type of routine care should be provided for all individuals who present to hospital after self-harm, regardless of perceived risk."}, {"Title": "Association between abnormal brain functional connectivity in children and psychopathology: A study based on graph theory and machine learning.", "Abstract": "One of the major challenges facing psychiatry is how to incorporate biological measures in the classification of mental health disorders. Many of these disorders affect brain development and its connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing brain networks based on the combination of a graph theory measure (eigenvector centrality) and a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM).\nWe applied this approach to resting-state fMRI data from 622 children and adolescents. Eigenvector centrality (EVC) of nodes from positive- and negative-task networks were extracted from each subject and used as input to an OC-SVM to label individual brain networks as typical or atypical. We hypothesised that classification of these subjects regarding the pattern of brain connectivity would predict the level of psychopathology.\nSubjects with atypical brain network organisation had higher levels of psychopathology (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was a greater EVC in the typical group at the bilateral posterior cingulate and bilateral posterior temporal cortices; and significant decreases in EVC at left temporal pole.\nThe combination of graph theory methods and an OC-SVM is a promising method to characterise neurodevelopment, and may be useful to understand the deviations leading to mental disorders."}, {"Title": "A pilot study of \"post-seclusion and/or restraint review\" intervention with patients and staff in a mental health setting.", "Abstract": "To develop and evaluate a \"post-seclusion and/or restraint review\" (PSRR) intervention implemented in an acute psychiatric care unit.\nTwelve staff members and three patients were enrolled in a participatory case study. To evaluate PSRR intervention, qualitative analysis was carried out. Seclusion and restraint use 6 months before and after the PSRR implementation was compared.\nNurses reported that they were able to explore the patient's feelings during the PSRR intervention with patients, which led to restoration of the therapeutic relationship. PSRR with the treatment team was perceived as a learning opportunity, which allowed to improve the therapeutic intervention. Both the use of seclusion and the time spent in seclusion were significantly reduced 6 months after the implementation of PSRR intervention.\nOur results suggest the efficacy of PSRR in overcoming the discomfort perceived by both staff and patient and, in the meantime, in reducing the need for coercive procedures. Systematic PSRR could permit to improve the quality of care and the safety of aggressiveness management."}, {"Title": "Patient and provider characteristics related with prescribing of ADHD medication: Nationwide health insurance claims database study in Korea.", "Abstract": "Little is known about the association between prescribing of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication and the patient's age, gender, and type of medical institution in Asia region.\nThis study investigates the prevalence and factors of diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of ADHD in the pediatric population.\nUsing the Korea Health Insurance database, study participants were identified as pediatric patients (\u226417\u00a0years) with at least 1 diagnosis of ADHD (ICD-10, F90) from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. The annual prevalence of ADHD diagnosis and medication was calculated. Annual differences in the prevalence between 2007 and 2011 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We conducted multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% CI to investigate predictors associated with prescribing of ADHD medication.\nThe prevalence of ADHD medication prescribing increased by 26.57% (95% CI, 26.27-26.88) from 0.53% in 2007 to 0.72% in 2011. The prevalence increased by 41.56% (95% CI, 40.51-42.65) in females compared with 34.91% (95% CI, 34.47-35.36) in males.

Despite descriptions of what ownership is, there is little discussion of how to foster ownership during residency. The objective of this study was to solicit psychiatry resident and faculty perspectives on ways to enhance resident ownership in training.\nTwenty-nine of 74 (39.2%) residents and 31 of 68 (45.6%) faculty members surveyed provided narrative responses to a voluntary, anonymous, electronic survey asking two structured, open-ended questions about what factors make it more or less likely that a resident will take \"ownership\" of patient care.\nThe coding process produced four overarching categories of themes (attending, resident, educational program, and environment) that reflect domains for possible interventions to increase ownership, with conceptual guidance from the Theory of Planned Behavior. From these factors, the authors propose a number of practical yet theory-based interventions which include setting expectations, modeling, promoting autonomy, countertransference supervision, changing residency culture, and longer rotations.\nThese interventions address subjective norms, attitudes, perceived ability and control, environment, and actual resident abilities, all of which, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, would be likely to influence patient care ownership.

Multilevel regression analyses revealed a significant inverse relation between the number and severity of aggressive incidents and the amount of support, as well as with the possibilities of growth perceived by the adolescents. No significant associations of aggression and the perception of repression or atmosphere are found.

Amongst treatment completers, statistically and clinically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed at post-treatment, which were generally maintained at the 20-week follow-up. Statistically significant improvements in eating disorder and general psychopathology were observed amongst the total sample.\nThe findings, which were comparable to the previous Australian effectiveness study of CBT-E, indicate that CBT-E is an effective treatment for adults with all eating disorders within out-patient settings. Given the high attrition rate, however, minimizing drop-out appears to be an important consideration when implementing CBT-E within clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Clinical improvement in patients with borderline personality disorder after treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation: preliminary results.", "Abstract": "Current treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD) consists of psychotherapy and pharmacological interventions.

Medical students who were concomitantly in a clinical posting in wards of psychiatry or neurology were invited to participate in the study. The medical student version of the scale Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) was used to measure their attitudes towards psychiatry and persons with psychiatric disorder. This 16-item scale is designed to measure attitudes of health care professionals towards people with mental illness, a higher score indicating more stigmatizing attitudes. Items exploring history of psychiatric disorders in close persons were added at the end of the MICA scale. The questionnaire was completed twice by each student, at the beginning and the end of the 11-week clinical posting. All questionnaires were strictly anonymized. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify the variables independently associated with MICA total score.\nAt the beginning of the education program and clinical posting, 174 students completed the MICA scale: the mean MICA total score was equal to 46.4 (SD 6.9) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=72) and 45.1 (SD 7.01) in those in neurology (n=102). At the end of the academic and clinical training, 138 students again completed the questionnaire, with mean MICA total scores equal to 41.4 (SD 8.1) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=51) and 43.5 (SD 7.3) in those in neurology (n=87). Multivariate analyses showed that lower total MICA scores were independently associated with the time of assessment (lower scores at the end of education program and clinical posting) (b=-2.8; P=0.001), female gender (b=-1.8; P=0.03) and history of a psychiatric disorder in a close person (b=-1.92; P=0.02). Type of clinical posting (psychiatry vs. neurology) was not independently associated with MICA total scores (b=-0.02; P=0.98). A significant interaction was found between the variables \"time of assessment\" and \"type of clinical posting\" (P=0.05): stratified analyses showed that MICA total scores decreased significantly only when the clinical posting was in psychiatry (b=-4.66; P=0.001), with no significant change in medical students in neurology wards (b=-1.45; P=0.16).\nStigmatizing attitudes of medical students towards psychiatry and psychiatric disorders are reduced by an education program in psychiatry, with a positive impact more marked when the education program is concomitant to a clinical posting in psychiatry. As future health professionals in charge of persons with psychiatric disorders, medical students are key targets of actions aimed at reducing stigma towards mental health disorders. It is hence of great importance to promote clinical training in psychiatric wards during medical studies for all future practitioners, irrespective of their future specialty."}, {"Title": "Zika Virus as an Emerging Neuropathogen: Mechanisms of Neurovirulence and Neuro-Immune Interactions.", "Abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the genus Flaviviridae, which causes a febrile illness and has spread from across the Pacific to the Americas in a short timeframe. Convincing evidence has implicated the ZIKV to incident cases of neonatal microcephaly and a set of neurodevelopmental abnormalities referred to as the congenital Zika virus syndrome. In addition, emerging data points to an association with the ZIKV and the development of the so-called Guillain-Barre syndrome, an acute autoimmune polyneuropathy. Accumulating knowledge suggests that neurovirulent strains of the ZIKV have evolved from less pathogenic lineages of the virus. Nevertheless, mechanisms of neurovirulence and host-pathogen neuro-immune interactions remain incompletely elucidated. This review provides a critical discussion of genetic and structural alterations in the ZIKV which could have contributed to the emergence of neurovirulent strains. In addition, a mechanistic framework of neuro-immune mechanisms related to the emergence of neuropathology after ZIKV infection is discussed. Recent advances in knowledge point to avenues for the development of a putative vaccine as well as novel therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, there are unique unmet challenges that need to be addressed in this regard.

The transcribed texts were analyzed by thematic analysis.\nThree main themes were identified: Thinking and doing gender; Understandings of gendering of day center occupations; and Consequences of gendered occupation. The participants were more open-minded in their reasoning than in what they were doing. They understood gendering to be a result of traditions, role models from childhood, ideas about typically male and female innate capacities, lack of knowledge and low self-confidence. Doing seemed to reproduce gender, but being in a group of the same sex could shape unity and a relaxed atmosphere.\nThe findings could be understood as a set of gender frames, which might prevent either of the sexes from developing their full potentials and transgress into e.g. the employment market.

Primary learning-related outcomes included content knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes and behavioral intentions towards evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g., CBT).\nResidents reported significant increases in CBT knowledge, CBT-specific self-efficacy, overall psychotherapy self-efficacy, belief in patient benefit from CBT, and behavioral intention to use CBT. However, there were almost no changes in attitudes towards evidence-based practice more broadly, with one significant finding showing an increase in skepticism towards such practices.\nThis empirically based example of training program development, implementation, and evaluation appears largely successful and represents one approach for addressing the CBT competency goals outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and Milestone Project Guidelines. Despite these initial, positive findings, conclusions should be tempered by limitations of the project design (e.g., the lack of comparison group, absence of objective measures of resident behavioral change, or assessment of the effect of such changes on patient outcomes).

His classification of the different types of epilepsy based on clinical symptoms is still relevant today and made him a precursor of contemporary epileptology. In 1851, Delasiauve clinically and etiologically isolated 'acute mental confusion' (acute confusional state) from all other forms of dementia. Never deviating from his republican and progressive ideals, he devoted himself throughout the 19th century to treating those insane asylum patients who received the poorest care: epileptics and children with intellectual disabilities. Studying functional cognitive disability as well as mental disability secondary to congenital malformations, Delasiauve developed a novel specific form of pedagogy to deal with delays in cognitive development. This made him one of the initiators of institutional pediatric psychiatry. His ideas would be carried forward by his favorite student, D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Magloire Bourneville (1840-1909).

Impairment of the PPI has been reported in several psychiatric disorders, but particularly in schizophrenia, where PPI is considered to be a candidate endophenotype of the disorder. Although the profiles of the ASR differ between races, recent studies of single ethnicity samples in Asia were in accord with a number of studies from Western countries, in reporting that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired PPI. The PPI of the ASR is known to develop before 8years of age, and PPI impairment has only been reported in adults (not children) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involves atypical features that are present from early development. Recent Asian studies of children with ASD suggest that comprehensive investigation of the ASR and its modulation, including the startle response to weak startle stimuli, peak startle latency, and PPI, may contribute to an understanding of the impairment of the neural circuitry in children with ASD and its comorbid behavioral problems. In this review, we review recent findings on the ASR and its modulation from Asian countries, and discuss its potential use for studying sensorimotor gating and its relationship to schizophrenia and ASD. In conclusion, the ASR and its modulation can provide a well-established global neurophysiological index for translational research in psychiatric disorders.

Here, we examined if striatal and prefrontal rCBF differ between patients with CHR, first-episode psychosis (FEP), chronic schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SZ) and controls. Two cohorts with a total of 122 participants were included and analyzed separately: 32 patients with SZ and 31 healthy controls (HC) from the University Hospital of Psychiatry, and 59 patients from the Bern Early Recognition and Intervention Center (29 with CHR, 12 with FEP, and 18 clinical controls [CC]). Ultra-high risk criteria were assessed with the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes, basic symptom criteria with the Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument. rCBF was measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling 3T-Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Striatal rCBF was significantly increased and prefrontal rCBF significantly decreased in the SZ group compared to HC group and in the CHR and FEP groups compared to CC group. Striatal rCBF correlated significantly with positive symptom scores in SZ and CHR. An inverse correlation between striatal and frontal rCBF was found in controls (HC, CC), but not in patient groups (SZ, FEP, CHR). This is the first study to demonstrate increased neuronal activity within the striatum, but reduced prefrontal activity in patients with CHR, FEP, and SZ compared to the respective controls.

In particular, the linking of EHRs to biospecimens and genomic data in biobanks may help address what has become a rate-limiting study for genetic research: the need for large sample sizes. The principal roadblock to capitalizing on these resources is the need to establish the validity of phenotypes extracted from the EHR. For psychiatric genetic research, this represents a particular challenge given that diagnosis is based on patient reports and clinician observations that may not be well-captured in billing codes or narrative records. This review addresses the opportunities and pitfalls in EHR-based phenotyping with a focus on their application to psychiatric genetic research. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive value can be derived from EHRs, especially when structured data are supplemented by text mining approaches. Such algorithms enable semi-automated phenotyping for large-scale case-control studies. In addition, the scale and scope of EHR databases have been used successfully to identify phenotypic subgroups and derive algorithms for longitudinal risk prediction. EHR-based genomics are particularly well-suited to rapid look-up replication of putative risk genes, studies of pleiotropy (phenomewide association studies or PheWAS), investigations of genetic networks and overlap across the phenome, and pharmacogenomic research. EHR phenotyping has been relatively under-utilized in psychiatric genomic research but may become a key component of efforts to advance precision psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A Comparison of the Pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Extended-Release Orally Disintegrating Tablets With a Reference Extended-Release Formulation of Methylphenidate in Healthy Adults.", "Abstract": "Extended-release (ER) methylphenidate (MPH) is a first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ), time to maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub> ), terminal elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub> ), overall systemic exposure (AUC<sub>last</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> ), and partial areas under the concentration curve (AUC<sub>0-3</sub> , AUC<sub>3-7</sub> , and AUC<sub>7-12</sub> ) were calculated. In total, 48 participants completed the study. For total methylphenidate from MPH XR-ODT, the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval (CI) around the geometric mean ratio (GMR, fed/fasted) for C<sub>max</sub> was below 80%, indicating a slightly decreased rate of absorption with food, whereas the 90%CIs around the GMRs of AUC<sub>last</sub> and AUC<sub>inf</sub> were within the 80%-125% limits, suggesting no food effect on exposure. The most common adverse events (AEs) were palpitations and decreased appetite. No serious, unusual, or unexpected AEs were reported. Thus, food had no substantial effect on overall bioavailability of MPH XR-ODT, which may be an important factor for some patients."}, {"Title": "Treatments for people living with schizophrenia in Sub-Saharan Africa: an adapted realist review.", "Abstract": "To identify the treatments and interventions available and their impact on people living with schizophrenia in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nHelp-seeking behaviour and the choice of treatment are largely influenced by socio-cultural factors and beliefs about the causes of mental illness.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on anxiety in a population-based cohort and validated our finding in a clinical cohort as well as a murine model. In the KORA cohort, participants (n=1522, age 32-72 years) were administered the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) instrument, whole blood DNA methylation was measured (Illumina 450K BeadChip), and circulating levels of hs-CRP and IL-18 were assessed in the association between anxiety and methylation. DNA methylation was measured using the same instrument in a study of patients with anxiety disorders recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP, 131 non-medicated cases and 169 controls). To expand our mechanistic understanding, these findings were reverse translated in a mouse model of acute social defeat stress. In the KORA study, participants were classified according to mild, moderate, or severe levels of anxiety (29.4%/6.0%/1.5%, respectively). Severe anxiety was associated with 48.5% increased methylation at a single CpG site (cg12701571) located in the promoter of the gene encoding Asb1 (\u03b2-coefficient=0.56 standard error (SE)=0.10, p (Bonferroni)=0.005), a protein hypothetically involved in regulation of cytokine signaling. An interaction between IL-18 and severe anxiety with methylation of this CpG cite showed a tendency towards significance in the total population (p=0.083) and a significant interaction among women (p=0.014). Methylation of the same CpG was positively associated with Panic and Agoraphobia scale (PAS) scores (\u03b2=0.005, SE=0.002, p=0.021, n=131) among cases in the MPIP study. In a murine model of acute social defeat stress, Asb1 gene expression was significantly upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (p=0.006), which correlated with upregulation of the neuroimmunomodulating cytokine interleukin 1 beta. Our findings suggest epigenetic regulation of the stress-responsive Asb1 gene in anxiety-related phenotypes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the causal direction of this association and the potential role of Asb1-mediated immune dysregulation in anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Development of Collaborative Drug Therapy Management and Clinical Pharmacy Services in an Outpatient Psychiatric Clinic.", "Abstract": "Collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) is a written agreement that allows a pharmacist to initiate, modify, or continue pharmacotherapies under a physician's scope of practice. While available literature pertaining to cardiometabolic and respiratory CDTM services is growing, publications are sparse in psychiatry, particularly outside Veterans Health Administration medical centers. A descriptive study was undertaken to demonstrate how a board-certified psychiatric pharmacist would begin organizing a protocol for clinical pharmacy services at an outpatient, community treatment center for mental health and substance abuse disorders. The primary CDTM service proposed was metabolic monitoring for atypical antipsychotics, though profile reviews for medication reconciliation, drug level monitoring, and insurance coverage were also considered. Potential obstacles identified and worked through during the project included pharmacist-prescriber relationships, federal and state law requirements, pharmacy informatics development, and pharmacy services billing. Discussions with both administrative and medical stakeholders across the health system were essential in helping a pharmacist detail professional qualifications, justify positive impacts on patient outcomes, and navigate these legal and financial issues. The systematic approach arrived at through the study addresses current literature gaps concerning how pharmacists can evolve their practices from ancillary to collaborative design by nature within psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "Broadening the Lens of System-Based Practice: From Micro to Macro and Basic to Complex in Residency Training.", "Abstract": "This paper aimed to develop a model for understanding the various dimensions of system-based practice (SBP) and determine the extent to which psychiatry residents perform behaviors along these dimensions.\nSixty-one supervisors from seven psychiatry programs rated resident performance of SBP behaviors using a 60-item instrument. Multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis were conducted to determine how the instrument items related to one another and the larger concept of SBP. Average supervisor ratings between clusters were compared to determine resident performance along the identified SBP dimensions.\nThe data supports a model of SBP defined along two dimensions: (1) from micro (patient) to macro (population-based) interventions and (2) from low to high system complexity.

Individual sessions were offered in an outpatient setting, while both group and individual sessions occurred in an inpatient unit. This pilot study used a mixed methodology to collect data from young people who attended Bod Squad. A database of exercise physiology records for 47 young people were analysed for attendance and physiological indicators. In addition, 7 semi-structured interviews were conducted with young people to explore their experience of Bod Squad. Young people attended a total of 169 sessions during the programmes tenure, with an overall mean of 3.6 sessions. Pre-post measures for 10 young people (who had attended at least 4 sessions) showed modest average reductions for body mass index, waist circumference, chest circumference and resting heart rate. Five themes emerged from the interviews-(1) My reasons for attending, (2) The social aspect, (3) An individualized approach, (4) Outcomes from Bod Squad and (5) My experience of the service. All of these themes included positive experiences of Bod Squad, which young people perceived as relevant to their needs and helpful to their recovery. These findings are congruent with previous studies that have concluded that exercise physiology may be an effective, acceptable and valued intervention for addressing physical and metabolic health issues for young people."}, {"Title": "The perception of spiritual health differences between citizens and physicians in the Czech Republic.", "Abstract": "This paper focuses on a phenomenon known as spiritual health. Although the scientific literature defines the concept of this health component (in relation to other dimensions, i.e. physical, mental and social health), there is no agreement concerning its relation to religiousness. The aim of this research is to find out the views of citizens (n\u2009=\u20091810) and physicians (n\u2009=\u20091200) in the Czech Republic on the potential dimension of health in its spiritual mode, and on the understanding of its content by those who acknowledge its existence. One of the main research findings is that physicians in the Czech Republic acknowledge the existence of spiritual health (47.0%) to a significantly greater extent than citizens of the country (26.4%). In both groups of respondents, the understanding varies in the discourse of psychology (psychiatry), theology, in the preference for harmony, and in medical care. The acknowledgement of spiritual health depends strongly on gender (women acknowledge the existence of this phenomenon more than men), religious belief (religious physicians, as well as religious citizens and members and non-members of churches and religious societies, acknowledge the existence of spiritual health significantly more compared with atheists) and education (with increasing education the proportion of citizens who acknowledge the existence of spiritual health rises considerably-the highest proportion is found in university graduates). Spiritual health is shown to be an important public health issue, even in a strongly secularized society."}, {"Title": "[Changes in Tasks and Job Characteristics in Psychiatric-Psychotherapeutic Inpatient Treatment in Germany - Description of Relevant Progresses since the Commencement of the German \"Psychiatry Staff Ordinance\" in 1990 - Focusing Psychiatric-Psychotherapeutic Inpatient Intensive Care].", "Abstract": "In Germany, mandatory standards in staff job characteristics concerning inpatient (clinic and day clinic) treatment in psychiatry and psychotherapy were established for the very first time in the year 1990.

The team was attentive to aligning implementation with the needs of each program. To assist in planning, the team included a program champion 1\u00a0year prior to SBIRT implementation to provide the opportunity to develop resources and work with peers. We evaluated this model through an implementation science lens using a case study approach that included interviews and quantitative tabulation of products and resident perceptions.\nWe successfully instituted SBIRT training in all 5 residency programs through the use of a supported local champion model. Teams developed 90 curricular products and had 57 presentations and publications. Residents reported satisfaction with the SBIRT activities. Champions reported that SBIRT was a useful approach and that they gained valuable knowledge and relationships from working with the executive team when designing learning materials appropriate for their residency. Champions successfully incorporated SBIRT into routine clinical practice.\nHaving a strong team to support subsequent SBIRT champions was essential for implementation. The champions needed financial support to have the necessary time to implement training. The strategy of building a peer network across programs was critical for sustaining the implementation.

Weighted multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between ethnic identity, acculturation, and 12-month psychiatric service utilization. Stronger ethnic identity was associated with decreased odds of using psychiatric services among Black (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.956; CI\u00a0=\u00a00.923-0.991) and Hispanic individuals (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.967; CI\u00a0=\u00a00.945-0.990).

MBSR paradigm is based on teaching participants to pay complete attention to the present experience and act nonjudgmentally towards stressful events. During this mental practice the meditator focuses his or her attention on the sensations of the body. While the distractions (mental images, thoughts, emotional or somatic states) arise the participant is taught to acknowledge discursive thoughts and cultivate the state of awareness without immediate reaction. The effectiveness of these programs is well documented in the field of emotional response regulation in depression (relapse prevention), anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder or eating disorders. Furthermore, converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that mindfulness practice improves cognition, especially the ability to sustain attention and think in a more flexible manner. Nevertheless, formal rehabilitation programs targeting cognitive disturbances resulting from psychiatric (depression, disorder bipolar, schizophrenia) or neurologic conditions (brain injury, dementia) seldom rely on MBI principles. This review of literature aims at discussing possible links between MBI and clinical neuropsychology.\nWe conducted a review of literature using electronic databases up to December 2016, screening studies with variants of the keywords (\"Mindfulness\", \"MBI\", \"MBSR\", \"Meditation\") OR/AND (\"Cognition\", \"Attention\", \"Executive function\", \"Memory\", \"Learning\") RESULTS: In the first part, we describe key concepts of the neuropsychology of attention in the light of Posner's model of attention control. We also underline the potential scope of different therapeutic contexts where disturbances of attention may be clinically relevant. Second, we review the efficacy of MBI in the field of cognition (thinking disturbances, attention biases, memory and executive processes impairment or low metacognitive abilities), mood (emotional dysregulation, anxiety, depression, mood shifts) and somatic preoccupations (stress induced immune dysregulation, chronic pain, body representation, eating disorders, sleep quality, fatigue). In psychiatry, these three components closely coexist and interact which explains the complexity of patient assessment and care. Numerous studies show that meditation inspired interventions offer a promising solution in the prevention and rehabilitation of cognitive impairment. In the last part, we discuss the benefits and risks of integrating meditation practice into broader programs of cognitive remediation and therapeutic education in patients suffering from cognitive disorders. We propose a number of possible guidelines for developing mindfulness inspired cognitive remediation tools. Along with Jon Kabatt Zinn (Kabatt-Zinn & Maskens, 2012), we suggest that the construction of neuropsychological tools relies on seven attitudinal foundations of mindfulness practice.\nThis paper highlights the importance of referring to holistic approaches such as MBI when dealing with patients with neuropsychological impairment, especially in the field of psychiatry. We advocate introducing mindfulness principles in order to help patients stabilize their attention and improve cognitive flexibility. We believe this transition in neuropsychological care may offer an interesting paradigm shift promoting a more efficient approach towards cognition and its links to emotion, body, and environment."}, {"Title": "Translation and purification: Ayurvedic psychiatry, allopathic psychiatry, spirits and occult violence in Kerala, South India.", "Abstract": "In this paper, the author traces two parallel movements of institutionalized Ayurvedic psychiatry, an emergent field of specialization in Kerala, India: the 'work of purification' and the 'work of translation' that Latour has described as characteristic of the 'modern constitution.' The author delineates these processes in terms of the relationship of Ayurvedic psychiatry to (1) allopathic psychiatry, (2) bhutavidya, a branch of textual Ayurveda dealing with spirits, and (3) occult violence. The aim is to offer a model of these open and hidden processes and of Ayurvedic psychiatry's positioning within a hierarchical mental health field characterized simultaneously by biopsychiatric hegemony and a persistent vernacular healing tradition. Through these processes, Ayurvedic psychiatry emerges as a relevant actor. It demarcates itself from both allopathic and vernacular epistemologies and ontologies while simultaneously drawing upon aspects of each, and, in this way, shows itself to be both deeply modern and highly pragmatic."}, {"Title": "Investigating the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.", "Abstract": "Characterizing the neurobiology of schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders is one of the main challenges of the current research in psychiatry. The availability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to directly probe virtually any cortical areas, thus providing a unique way to assess the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons. This article presents a review of studies employing TMS in combination with Motor Evoked Potentials (TMS/MEPs) and high density Electroencephalogram (TMS/hd-EEG) in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Studies were identified by conducting a PubMed search using the following search item: \"transcranial magnetic stimulation and (Schizophrenia or OCD or MDD or ADHD)\". Studies that utilized TMS/MEP and/or TMS/hd-EEG measures to characterize cortical excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and/or connectivity in psychiatric patients were selected. Across disorders, patients displayed a pattern of reduced cortical inhibition, and to a lesser extent increased excitability, in the motor cortex, which was most consistently established in Schizophrenia. Furthermore, psychiatric patients showed abnormalities in a number of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations, which was most prominent in the prefrontal cortex of Schizophrenia relative to healthy comparison subjects. Overall, results from this review point to significant impairments in cortical excitability, inhibition, and oscillatory activity, especially in frontal areas, in several major psychiatric disorders. Building on these findings, future studies employing TMS-based experimental paradigms may help elucidating the neurobiology of these psychiatric disorders, and may assess the contribution of TMS-related measures in monitoring and possibly maximizing the effectiveness of treatment interventions in psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Reaching rural Ohio with intellectual disability psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Individuals with intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental illness when compared with the general population, and there is a lack of medical and mental health professionals in rural and under-served areas.

Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice. Ohio's Telepsychiatry Project for Intellectual Disability was initiated in 2012 to serve outlying communities with a lack of infrastructure and resources, to provide specialized mental health services to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and intellectual disability.

Because acetylcholine is important in executive function, these symptoms may be exacerbated by subcortical hyperintensities (SH) located in cholinergic (CH) tracts. This study investigated the effects of SH on cognitive changes in CAD patients undergoing a 48-week cardiac rehabilitation program.\nFifty patients (age 66.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1\u00a0years, 84% male) underwent the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - Canadian Stroke Network neurocognitive battery at baseline and 48\u00a0weeks. Patients underwent a 48-week cardiac program and completed neuroimaging at baseline. Subcortical hyperintensities in CH tracts were measured using Lesion Explorer. Repeated measures general linear models were used to examine interactions between SH and longitudinal cognitive outcomes, controlling for age, education, and max VO<sub>2</sub> change as a measure of fitness.\nIn patients with SH in CH tracts, there was a significant interaction with the Trail Making Test (TMT) part A and part B over time. Patients without SH improved on average 16.6 and 15.0% on the TMT-A and TMT-B, respectively. Patients with SH on average showed no improvements in either TMT-A or TMT-B over time. There were no significant differences in other cognitive measures.\nThese results suggest that CAD patients with SH in CH tracts improve less than those without SH in CH tracts, over 48\u00a0weeks of cardiac rehabilitation. Thus, SH in CH tracts may contribute to longitudinal cognitive decline following a cardiac event and may represent a vascular risk factor of cognitive decline. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Both prevention and therapeutic management can be offered with a better chance of success during these periods. Our specific Consultation Liaison (CL) team PPUMMA was created in order to respond to the need for early detection of psychopathology and rapid implementation of therapeutic management and preventive measure for mother and child. The importance of urgently intervening \"on site\" seemed a necessity since duration of hospitalization in maternity wards is very short. Women might not know or understand their symptoms or be ready to ask for a referral for themselves but could be ready to respond positively to a team approach where the psychiatrist is part of the Ob-Gyn department. Working with an interdisciplinary approach tends to lower stress linked to the psychiatric side of the consultation and stigma related to psychological or psychiatric issues; therefore, PPUMMA intervenes within 48\u00a0to 72hours of birth. It deals with assessment and diagnosis during the peripartum period and orientation and referral for both mother and infant when necessary after birth. The Perinatal Psychiatry emergency mobile unit PPUMMA was created in order to address these issues.\nFrom 2008\u00a0to 2015, 1907\u00a0patients were assessed but data were missing for 90\u00a0patients. We therefore analyzed 1817\u00a0patient files looking at age, diagnosis origin of referral, time of referral (pre or postpartum) and delay from referral to assessment.\nMost patients were between 20\u00a0and 40 (81.5\u00a0%). One hundred and eighteen patients were under 20\u00a0years of age, of whom 64\u00a0were minors (3.5\u00a0%), and 218\u00a0were 40\u00a0or more (12\u00a0%). These two groups were over-represented close to threefold when comparing with national birth data records. A psychologist had first seen three out of four women. Midwives and Ob-Gyn referred 9\u00a0% and 8\u00a0% of patients while Social workers sent in 4\u00a0%. Two thirds of the women were seen during pregnancy, 50\u00a0% were seen the same day and 80\u00a0% received a consultation within 72hours. Three out of five of women had an assessment that concluded in a \"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders\" type code disorder linked to stress and somatoform disorder in ICD 10 (F40-F49). This is due to a high number (47.2\u00a0%) of F43 \"Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders\". Twentynine present of women had a mood disorder (F30-39), and close to one third (31.6\u00a0%) had a personality disorder diagnosis attached. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-F29) represented 4.4\u00a0% of diagnoses. One third of the population had comorbid disorders: meeting either two (28.5\u00a0%) or three (3.7\u00a0%) diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Most co-morbidity is due to personality disorder (82\u00a0% F60-F69).\nThe number of referrals and diagnostic criteria met show how essential a psychiatric CL team assessing and orienting women during pregnancy and immediate postpartum is. Opportunity for adaptation of treatment during the peripartum period and more long-term tailored management of disorders can be organized during this period in a multidisciplinary approach. Knowing how essential maternal mental health is for women, for infant development and for mother-infant interactions, this is a unique window for access to care and intervention. Maternal mental health is a public health issue.

In Brazil, a psychodevelopmental project of teen motherhood has gained traction despite many experts' long-standing commitment to psychodynamic psychiatry and social epidemiology, generating epistemic tension rather than substitution. Drawing on historical ethnography conducted in Southern Brazil, I explore how this project materialized through the co-production of epistemic struggles, remedial interventions, and ontological politics. In showing how this co-production became interwoven with incremental changes in young women's emotions, sexualities, relationships, and bodies, I describe how one particular \"kind\" of teen motherhood emerged and became entangled with both psychiatric knowledge-production and the angst of working-class political agency. In giving women a contested psychiatric language with which to rework their social-moral worlds, I argue that science did more than conceptualize teen childbearing in pathological terms; it contributed to its troubled transformation."}, {"Title": "Outcomes and feasibility of the short transitional intervention in psychiatry in improving the transition from inpatient treatment to the community: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "Discharge from psychiatric inpatient care is frequently described as chaotic, stressful, and emotionally charged. Following discharge, service users are vulnerable to becoming overwhelmed by the challenges involved in readapting to their home environments, which could result in serious problems and lead to readmission. The short transitional intervention in psychiatry (STeP) is a bridging intervention that includes pre- and post-discharge sections. It aims to prepare patients for specific situations in the period immediately following discharge from a psychiatric hospital. We conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study to determine the feasibility of the intervention, and gain insight into the effects of the STeP. Two inpatient wards at a Swiss psychiatric hospital participated in the study, and represented the intervention and control arms. Patient recruitment and baseline assessment were performed 2\u00a0weeks prior to discharge. Follow-up data were collected 1\u00a0week subsequent to discharge. Questionnaires measured coping, admission and health-care usage, self-efficacy, working alliance, experience of transition, and the number of difficulties experienced following discharge. Fourteen and 15 patients completed the follow-up assessment in the control and intervention groups, respectively. The STeP did not affect primary or secondary outcomes; however, it was shown to be feasible, and patients' feedback highlighted the importance of post-discharge contact sessions.

Specifically, faculty members rated themselves as having increased their own understanding and confidence regarding the use of the assessment forms after the intervention. With regard to actual ratings of clerkship students, faculty members were less likely to use the 'Not observed' option after the intervention.

A wide array of biochemical processes underlie MDD presentations and their shift to a recurrent, neuroprogressive course, including: increased immune-inflammation, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), mitochondrial dysfunction, aryl hydrocarbonn receptor activation, and oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), as well as decreased sirtuins and melatonergic pathway activity. These biochemical changes may have their roots in central, systemic and/or peripheral sites, including in the gut, as well as in developmental processes, such as prenatal stressors and breastfeeding consequences. Consequently, conceptualizations of MDD have dramatically moved from simple psychological and central biochemical models, such as lowered brain serotonin, to a conceptualization that incorporates whole body processes over a lifespan developmental timescale. However, important hubs are proposed, including the gut-brain axis, and mitochondrial functioning, which may provide achievable common treatment targets despite considerable inter-individual variability in biochemical changes. This provides a more realistic model of the complexity of MDD and the pathophysiological processes that underpin the shift to rMDD and consequent cognitive deficits. Such accumulating data on the pathophysiological processes underpinning MDD highlights the need in psychiatry to shift to a classification system that is based on biochemical processes, rather than subjective phenomenology."}, {"Title": "Treatment of Depression in Adults with Fabry Disease.", "Abstract": "Fabry disease (FD) is a genetic X-linked, multisystemic, progressive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). Depression has emerged as a disease complication, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 62%. This is a pilot study examining the effects of psychological counseling for depression in FD on depression, adaptive functioning (AF), quality of life (QOL), and subjective pain experience. Telecounseling was also piloted, as it has beneficial effects in other chronic diseases which make in-person counseling problematic. Subjects completed 6\u00a0months of in-person or telecounseling with the same health psychologist, followed by 6\u00a0months without counseling. Self-report measures of depression, AF, QOL, and subjective pain were completed every 3\u00a0months. All subjects experienced improvements in depression, which were sustained during the follow-up period. Improvements in depression were correlated with improvements in mental health QOL and subjective pain severity, while improvements in mental health QOL were correlated with improvements in AF. While statistical comparison between counseling modes was not possible with the given sample size, relevant observations were noted. Recommendations for future research include replication of results with a larger sample size and a longer counseling period. The use of video counseling may be beneficial. In conclusion, the present pilot study supports the efficacy of psychological treatment for depression in people with FD, highlighting the importance of having health psychologists housed in LSD treatment centers, rather than specialty psychology/psychiatry settings, to increase participation and decrease potential obstacles to access due to perceived stigma."}, {"Title": "Public discourse on mental health and psychiatry: Representations in Swedish newspapers.", "Abstract": "Mass media plays a central role in shaping public discourse on health and illness. In order to examine media representations of mental health and expert knowledge in this field, two major Swedish daily newspapers from the year 2009 were qualitatively analysed. Drawing on the theory of social representations, the analysis focused on how issues concerning mental health and different perspectives are represented. The results show how the concept of mental illness is used in different and often taken-for-granted ways and how the distinction between normal and pathological is a central underlying question. Laypersons' perspectives are supplemented by views of professionals in the newspapers, where signs of confidence and dependence on expert knowledge are juxtaposed with critique and expressions of distrust. The newspaper discourse thus has salient argumentative features and the way that conflicts are made explicit and issues concerning authoritative knowledge are addressed indicates ambivalence towards the authoritative role of expert knowledge concerning mental health. In this way, the newspapers provide a complex epistemic context for everyday sense-making that can be assumed to have implications for relations between laypersons and professionals in the field of mental health."}, {"Title": "Supporting Shared Decision-making for Children's Complex Behavioral Problems: Development and User Testing of an Option Grid\u2122 Decision Aid.", "Abstract": "There is a lack of research to guide collaborative treatment decision-making for children who have complex behavioral problems, despite the extensive use of mental health services in this population.

Caregivers did not have a clinical depression or anxiety disorder at baseline. Suicide-related thoughts were measured with an item from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, a diagnostic instrument for DSM-IV mental disorders. Fisher exact, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests compared the characteristics of caregivers who had contemplated suicide with two comparison groups.\nWithin 24\u00a0months, 76 caregivers reported symptoms of a potential depression and were further assessed for suicidal thoughts. Nine carers (11.8%, 4.7% of the total sample) reported suicidal thoughts with three of those at multiple points. Caregivers with suicidal thoughts had more severe depressive and anxious symptoms, had a lower sense of competence and mastery, felt less happy and experienced more health problems, less family support and more feelings of loneliness than caregivers who had not.\nSuicidal thoughts are present in dementia caregivers and can persist across the care trajectory. Various psychological and social characteristics significantly distinguish caregivers with suicidal thoughts from those without.

It aims to increase people's ability to manage a life with a long-term illness. For people with bipolar disorder, psychoeducation is one of a range of psychosocial interventions now considered part of contemporary mental health practice. It has taken on a 'common sense' status that results in little critique of psychoeducation practices. Using a published manual on psychoeducation and bipolar disorder as its data, Foucauldian discourse analysis was used in the present study for a critical perspective on psychoeducation in order to explore the taken-for-granted assumptions on which it is based. It identifies that the text produces three key subject positions for people with bipolar disorder. To practice self-management, a person must: (i) accept and recognize the authority of psychiatry to know them; (ii) come to see that they can moderate themselves; and (iii)\u00a0see themselves as able to undertake a reflexive process of self-examination and change. These findings highlight the circular and discursive quality to the construct of insight that is central to how psychoeducation is practiced. Using Foucault's construct of pastoral power, it also draws attention to the asymmetrical nature of power relations between the clinician and the person with bipolar disorder. An effect of the use of medical discourse in psychoeducation is to limit its ability to work with ambivalence and contradiction. A critical approach to psychotherapy and education offers an alternate paradigm on which to basis psychoeducation practices."}, {"Title": "The Negative Impact of an Uncertain Residence Status: Analysis of Migration-Related Stressors in Outpatients with Turkish Migration Background and Psychiatric Disorders in Germany Over a 10-Year Period (2005-2014).", "Abstract": "Several studies indicate that immigration is associated with a higher risk for mental disorders, particularly in refugees and asylum seekers.

Diagnoses of juvenile bipolar disorders (BD) are rare and controversial and standardized assessment is helpful for a reliable diagnosis. The main objective of this study was to identify the number of juvenile bipolar disorder diagnoses according to DSM-5\u00a0criteria in a population of children and adolescents hospitalized for suicide attempts. Secondary objectives were the assessment of a patient's characteristics and the comparison of suicide attempt recurrence during 12\u00a0months of follow-up.\nThis current practice study consecutively included children and adolescents aged 6\u00a0to 18\u00a0years and hospitalized for a suicide attempt in a French University Pediatric Hospital over a 4-month period. Patients were assessed at baseline, at 3\u00a0months and at 12\u00a0months. The standardized assessment was realized by the investigator using semi-structured interview K-SADS-PL (2013) to diagnose juvenile bipolar disorders based on DSM-5\u00a0criteria. Clinical diagnoses based on medical charts and according to ICD-10\u00a0criteria were also collected at 12-month follow-up. Standardized assessment was completed by the French validated K-SADS-PL (2004) for comorbidities (DSM-IV), dimensional assessment by MADRS-YMRS-ARI-C-SSR, and C-GAS at inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) those presenting juvenile bipolar disorder according to DSM 5 (BD+) and (2) those without criteria for bipolar disorder (BD-). Suicide risk factors and suicide attempt relapse were assessed at 3\u00a0and 12\u00a0months of follow-up.\nTwenty-six inpatients (22\u00a0female and 4\u00a0male) aged 14.5\u00a0years (SD 1,5) were consecutively included. Twenty patients were followed up during the 12-month period. At baseline, 5\u00a0patients (19.2\u00a0%) presented a diagnosis of BD (DSM-5): 1\u00a0BD type 2, 2\u00a0non specified BD, 2\u00a0cyclothymic disorders. According to the medical charts (ICD-10), none of the patients had been diagnosed with BD but had diagnoses of dysthymia, of borderline personality disorder and of conduct disorder corresponding to DMDD in 3, 2\u00a0and 1\u00a0patient respectively. During the 12-month follow-up, 9\u00a0patients of the BD- group and none of the BD+ presented recurrence of suicide attempt with 67\u00a0% during the first 3\u00a0months and 3\u00a0patients with multi-relapses. These 3\u00a0patients were female adolescents out of care and carrying at least three suicide risk factors. Six patients have been lost to follow-up (1\u00a0BD+, 5\u00a0BD-).

This study analyzed DSM-IV-referenced ASD symptom statements from parent and teacher versions of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R. A series of exploratory structural equation\u00a0models was conducted in order to produce interpretable latent factors that account for multivariate covariance.\nResults indicated that ASD symptoms were structured into an interpretable hierarchy across multiple informants. This hierarchy includes five levels; key features of ASD bifurcate into different constructs with increasing specificity.\nThis is the first study to examine an underlying structural hierarchy of ASD symptomatology using the bass-ackwards method. This hierarchy demonstrates how core features of ASD relate at differing levels of resolution, providing a model for conceptualizing ASD heterogeneity and a structure for integrating divergent theories of cognitive processes and behavioral features that define the disorder. These findings suggest that a more coherent and complete understanding of the structure of ASD symptoms may be reflected in a metastructure rather than at one level of resolution."}, {"Title": "Reproductive Psychiatry Residency Training: A Survey of Psychiatric Residency Program Directors.", "Abstract": "The reproductive life cycle has unique influences on the phenotypic expression of mental illness in women.

They assessed the availability of both mandated and optional didactic and clinical training experiences in reproductive psychiatry.\nFifty residency program directors answered the survey, for a response rate of 28%. More than half of residency program directors (59%) reported requiring some training in reproductive psychiatry. Both the breadth and depth of topics covered varied greatly among programs. Lack of time (48%) and lack of qualified faculty (26%) were the most frequently cited barriers to more training. Only 40% of residency directors surveyed agreed that all residents should be competent in reproductive psychiatry.\nThese findings suggest that specific training in reproductive psychiatry is inconsistent in US residency programs, and that training that does exist varies considerably in clinical time and content. Given that women comprise more than 50% of all psychiatric patients and most women will menstruate, give birth, and undergo menopause, future psychiatrists would benefit from more systematic instruction in this area.

Hornstein offers a resignified vision of mad identity that embroiders the central trope of an \"anti-colonial\" struggle to reclaim the experiential world \"colonized\" by psychiatry. A series of literal and figurative appeals makes recourse to the inner world and (corresponding) cultural world of the mad as well as to the ethno-symbolic cultural materials of dormant nationhood. This rhetoric is augmented by a model in which the mad comprise a diaspora without an origin, coalescing into a single transnational community. The mad are also depicted as persons displaced from their metaphorical homeland, the \"inner\" world \"colonized\" by the psychiatric regime. There are a number of difficulties with Hornstein's rhetoric, however. Her \"ethnicity-and-rights\" response to the oppression of the mad is symptomatic of Western parochialism, while her proposed transmutation of putative psychopathology from limit upon identity to parameter of successful identity is open to contestation. Moreover, unless one accepts Hornstein's porous vision of mad identity, her self-ascribed insider status in relation to the mad community may present a problematic \"re-colonization\" of mad experience."}, {"Title": "Prioritising patient care: The different views of clinicians and managers.", "Abstract": "There is little research comparing clinicians' and managers' views on priority settings in the healthcare services.

Research design and participants: We conducted qualitative observations, interviews and focus groups with medical doctors, nurses and other clinical members of the interdisciplinary team in both somatic medical and mental health wards in hospitals in Norway. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Ethical considerations: Basic ethical principles for research ethics were followed. The respondents signed an informed consent for participation. They were assured anonymity and confidentiality.

Clinicians experienced a threat to their autonomy, to their professional ideals and to their desire to perform their job in a professional way. Prioritisations were a cause of constant concern and problematic decisions. Even though several managers understood and empathised with the clinicians, the ideals of patient flow and keeping budgets balanced were perceived as more important.\nWe discuss our findings in light of the moral challenges of patient-centred individual healthcare versus demands of distributive justice from healthcare management.\nThe clinicians' ideals of autonomy and good medical and nursing care for the individual patients were perceived as endangered."}, {"Title": "The effect of mindfulness meditation training on biological acute stress responses in generalized anxiety disorder.", "Abstract": "Mindfulness-Based interventions have increased in popularity in psychiatry, but the impact of these treatments on disorder-relevant biomarkers would greatly enhance efficacy and mechanistic evidence.

Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) concentrations were calculated for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MBSR participants had a significantly greater reduction in ACTH AUC compared to control participants. Similarly, the MBSR group had a greater reduction in inflammatory cytokines' AUC concentrations.

In forensic psychiatry, it is important to use designs which are potentially robust against susceptibility to manipulation or deception. We tested a new design to measure neurofunctional correlates of sexual preference. Twenty-two healthy heterosexual men had to solve a mental rotation task while sexually preferred or non-preferred distractors were presented simultaneously. With this challenging active task, subjects' possibility to manipulate their response to the sexual stimuli should be lower than in easier tasks and in passive designs. Participants needed more time to solve the mental rotation task when distractors of women and girls were presented compared to distractors of men and boys. FMRI-results showed a network of three brain regions which specifically responded to sexually preferred distractors. Female and adult distractors evoked stronger responses than male and child distractors in regions comprising parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus and amygdala/basal ganglia/thalamus, respectively. Women distractors elicited stronger responses in the inferior parietal lobe compared to all other distractors. Specifically, sexually preferred distractors elicited a weaker downregulation than other distractors. We suppose a different emotion regulation with respect to the sexual relevance of the distractors. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show neurofunctional correlates of sexual preference under cognitive demand.

The present cross-sectional study examined suicidal thoughts, treatment modalities (outpatient crisis intervention, inpatient care), and their determinants in asylum seekers (n = 119) and permanent residents (n = 120) attending the same outpatient clinic in Geneva, Switzerland. The most frequent diagnoses were depressive disorders (64.7%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (34.5%) in asylum seekers and psychotic (55.0%) and depressive disorders (33.3%) in permanent residents. The frequency of suicidal thoughts was similar in both groups (>30%). Asylum seekers benefited from outpatient crisis intervention more frequently than residents did (26.9% vs. 5.8%), whereas inpatient care was less frequent (25.2% vs. 44.2%). In asylum seekers, acute suicidal thoughts were associated with increased frequency of outpatient crisis interventions, and, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or personality disorders were associated with higher rates of hospitalization. Documenting clinical characteristics and service utilization of asylum seekers is a prerequisite to organizing targeted interventions."}, {"Title": "Cultural Identity Among Afghan and Iraqi Traumatized Refugees: Towards a Conceptual Framework for Mental Health Care Professionals.", "Abstract": "Cultural identity in relation with mental health is of growing interest in the field of transcultural psychiatry. However, there is a need to clarify the concept of cultural identity in order to make it useful in clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to unravel the complexity and many layers of cultural identity, and to assess how stress and acculturation relate to (changes in) cultural identity. As part of a larger study about cultural identity, trauma, and mental health, 85 patients from Afghanistan and Iraq in treatment for trauma-related disorders were interviewed with a Brief Cultural Interview. The interviews were analysed through qualitative data analysis using the procedures of grounded theory. The analysis resulted in three domains of cultural identity: personal identity, ethnic identity and social identity. Within each domain relationships with stress and acculturation were identified. The results offer insight into the intensity of changes in cultural identity, caused by pre-and post-migration stressors and the process of acculturation. Based on the research findings recommendations are formulated to enhance the cultural competency of mental health workers."}, {"Title": "[The career of the psychiatrist Dietfried M\u00fcller-Hegemann (1910-1989) : Example of a politically motivated rise and fall in the German Democratic Republic].", "Abstract": "Dietfried M\u00fcller-Hegemann was one of the prominent figures in East German psychiatry and psychotherapy of the 1950s and 1960s. Having been a\u00a0communist prior to 1933, a\u00a0resistance fighter during the National Socialist regime and having gone through political training during his exile in Soviet Russia, he proved to be a\u00a0committed member of the new ruling SED socialist party in Eastern Germany. As such both governmental and party organs regarded him as a\u00a0promising and reliable party member to be supported and implemented as executive staff within the new, socialist scientific system. Also, due to the fact that he supported the Pavlovian school of thought for modern psychiatry, M\u00fcller-Hegemann was installed as the new head of the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry at Leipzig University by the state secretary for higher education, notably against the clear opposition of the university medical faculty. Soon thereafter however M\u00fcller-Hegemann fell from favor due to the fact that he supported views that did not follow the strict ideological guidelines, e.\u2009g. with regard to the emergence of fascism. Moreover, he strongly opposed the separation of neurology from psychiatry as ruled by the ministry. An attempt in 1963 by junior party members and ministerial staff to remove him from office failed, but still managed to make M\u00fcller-Hegemann resign from his Leipzig post and take over that of director of the Griesinger hospital for the mentally ill in East Berlin. In May 1971, after new conflicts with party officials, he did not return from a\u00a0business trip to Essen in West Germany. This study does not review the scientific and medical merits of M\u00fcller-Hegemann, but concentrates on how his career as a\u00a0leading psychiatrist was manipulated, both supported and sabotaged, and ideologically controlled by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) system. His development is documented proof that party officials did not tolerate opposition, neither in ideological nor in professional questions, even if the opponent was a\u00a0committed Marxist. The example of his career shows that political and ideological dissent soon melted into personal animosity and drives, as a\u00a0result of which M\u00fcller-Hegemann's promising career as professor in Leipzig was terminated."}, {"Title": "DNA methylation and clinical response to antidepressant medication in major depressive disorder: A review and recommendations.", "Abstract": "Antidepressant medications are the most common treatment for major depression and related disorders. Pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that response to these medications is associated with genetic variation. While these studies have been invaluable they have yet to explain why a significant number of patients do not respond to their initial medication. The epigenetic modification known as DNA methylation has recently been studied in the context of antidepressant treatment response. As such, the purpose of this article is to review the advances made in the relatively new field of pharmaco-epigenetics of antidepressant response. We included all published articles examining DNA methylation in association with antidepressant treatment response in Major Depressive Disorder from April 2006 to June 2016 using the PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. At the present time, although original articles are limited, epigenetic modifications of SLC6A4, BDNF, and IL11 genes are showing promising results as biomarkers for prediction of antidepressant response. However, research methods and results are heterogeneous and additional studies are required before results are generalizable. At the end of this review we provide recommendations for study design and analytic approaches."}, {"Title": "Beneficial Coercion in Psychiatric Care: Insights from African Ethico-Cultural System.", "Abstract": "There is a 'catch 22' situation about applying coercion in psychiatric care. Autonomous choices undeniably are rights of patients. However, emphasizing rights for a mentally-ill patient could jeopardize the chances of the patient receiving care or endanger the public. Conversely, the beneficial effects of coercion are difficult to predict. Thus, applying coercion in psychiatric care requires delicate balancing of individual-rights, individual well-being and public safety, which has not been achieved by current frameworks. Two current frameworks may be distinguished: the civil liberty approach and the Stone model. Both frameworks are restrictive, and not respectful of human dignity. In a civil liberty approach, individuals who are severely mentally-ill but not dangerous would be denied care because they do not meet the dangerousness threshold or because the use of coercion will not lead to rebirthing of autonomy. This is unsatisfactory. Albeit involuntary interventions such as talk therapies, peer-support etc., may not always lead to rebirthing of autonomy or free patients from mental illness; they can however help to maintain the dignity of each mentally ill patient. In place of these frameworks, this study proposes a new ethical framework for applying coercion in psychiatric care that is respectful of human dignity. Specifically, it draws on insights from the African ethico-cultural system by using the Yoruba concept Omo-olu-iwabi to develop this new framework. This way, the study shows that only a more respectful approach for applying coercion in psychiatric care can lead to the careful balancing of the competing interests of individual's rights, individual's well-being and public safety."}, {"Title": "Suicidal ideation and subsequent completed suicide in both psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations: a meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Several authors claimed that expression of suicidal ideation is one of the most important predictors of completed suicide. However, the strength of the association between suicidal ideation and subsequent completed suicide has not been firmly established in different populations. Furthermore, the absolute suicide risk after expression of suicidal ideation is unknown. In this meta-analysis, we examined whether the expression of suicidal ideation predicted subsequent completed suicide in various populations, including both psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations.\nA meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies that assessed suicidal ideation as determinant for completed suicide in adults. Two independent reviewers screened 5726 articles for eligibility and extracted data of the 81 included studies. Pooled risk ratios were estimated in a random effects model stratified for different populations. Meta-regression analysis was used to determine suicide risk during the first year of follow-up.\nThe risk for completed suicide was clearly higher in people who had expressed suicidal ideation compared with people who had not, with substantial variation between the different populations: risk ratio ranging from 2.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.87) in affective disorder populations to 8.00 (95% CI 5.46-11.7) in non-psychiatric populations. In contrast, the suicide risk after expression of suicidal ideation in the first year of follow-up was higher in psychiatric patients (risk 1.40%, 95% CI 0.74-2.64) than in non-psychiatric participants (risk 0.23%, 95% CI 0.10-0.54). Past suicide attempt-adjusted risk ratios were not pooled due to large underreporting.\nAssessment of suicidal ideation is of priority in psychiatric patients. Expression of suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients should prompt secondary prevention strategies to reduce their substantial increased risk of suicide."}, {"Title": "[Non-pharmacological treatment of dementia in geriatric psychiatry care units : Scoping review].", "Abstract": "The number of persons suffering from dementia will continuously increase in the coming years; therefore, evidence-based interventions are needed in geriatric psychiatric care.

This article reports on the forensic mental health clinicians experiences of the clinician-patient alliance during mechanical restraint, and their assessment of parameters of alliance regarding the patient's readiness to be released from restraint. We used a qualitative, descriptive approach and conducted focus group interviews with nurses, nurse assistants and social and healthcare assistants. The results show that a pre-established personal clinician-patient alliance formed the basis for entering into, and weighing the quality of, the alliance during mechanical restraint. In consideration of the patient's psychiatric condition, the clinicians observed and assessed two quality parameters for the alliance: 'the patient's insight into or understanding of present situation' (e.g. the reasons for mechanical restraint and the behaviour required of the patient to discontinue restraint) and 'the patient's ability to have good and stable contact and cooperation with and across clinicians. These assessments were included, as a total picture of the quality of the alliance with the patient', in the overall team assessment of the patient's readiness to be released from mechanical restraint. The results contribute to inform the development of a short-term risk assessment instrument, with the aim of reducing the duration of mechanical restraint."}, {"Title": "Non-adherence to Psychotropic Medication Among Adolescents - A Systematic Review of the Literature.", "Abstract": "Whether patients take their medication as prescribed is of increasing importance in adolescent psychiatry since both the number of efficacious pharmaceutical treatments and the rate of prescriptions of psychotropic compounds are on the rise. Previous research showed high rates of medication nonadherence among both adolescents with medical disorders and adult patients with psychiatric disorders.\nThe present review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and evaluates existing scientific literature concerning adherence to psychotropic medication among adolescents. The goal was to determine rates of nonadherence in this age group as well as the factors associated with it. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed from its inception until 15 September 2015 using the keywords \"adherence,\" \"compliance,\" \"adolescent,\" and \"psychotropic medication.\"\nA total of 607 pertinent articles were collected and screened; 15 publications were selected for detailed review. The studies differed, among other things, regarding sample characteristics, medication type, and indications. Furthermore, the definitions of what constitutes nonadherence and the methods used to assess it varied widely. Nonadherence rates ranged from 6 % to 62 % (median 33 %).\nNonadherence to psychotropic medication is a clinically relevant problem among adolescents. Because of the methodological heterogeneity across studies and partially contradictory results, no conclusions could be drawn concerning the influence of factors such as psychopathology, medication type, side effects, the effectiveness of treatment, or family-related factors. Well-designed long-term studies of large patient samples and a consensus regarding definitions are therefore warranted. Such research would facilitate the design of tailored strategies to improve adherence in these patients."}, {"Title": "A Qualitative Study of Clinicians Experience with Rating of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale.", "Abstract": "The severity of illness in psychiatry is rated using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. The GAF scale is often used in both research settings and in the clinic. The scale ranges from 1 to 100 and is subdivided into ten 10-point intervals, each with verbal rating instructions called anchor points and examples. GAF is an instrument that needs improvement. Studying clinicians' experiences with this rating system may be important for developing improvements. The aim of this study was to collect information from clinicians about their experiences with the GAF instrument, and to collect their ideas on how the GAF scale can be improved, particularly in the area of verbal instructions (i.e., anchor points and examples). Qualitative interviews were performed with 25 clinicians. Through this interview process, several weaknesses of the GAF scale were revealed.

However, few data are available on the way psychiatrists practice in the PES. Our aim was to survey psychiatrists working in PES, focusing on their job satisfaction and the theoretical models they use in their everyday practice.\nWe sent a survey to a sample of 508 psychiatrists working in PES in France.\nTwo hundred and thirty-seven psychiatrists returned the survey, yielding a response rate of 47%. On a 0 to 10 scale, the mean level of job satisfaction was 6.7 (SD: 1.92). Participants reported that facing a variety of clinical situations and playing a key-coordinating role in the mental health system were the two most specific features of emergency psychiatry. The main sources of dissatisfaction were organizational issues and stressful clinical experiences, including violence or hostility. Sixty-three percent (n=150) of participants reported using more than two theoretical models in their practice, while the use of crisis models was reported by almost 40% of them. When assessed for suggestions to improve the PES, the majority of participants indicated that efforts should be focused on organizational factors.\nWhile emergency psychiatry could appear as an ungrateful practice, the majority of psychiatrists who responded to our survey reported satisfaction with their work and highlighted its unique particularities. Future research and collaborations are needed to identify organizational models of PES and their better integration in mental health networks."}, {"Title": "Repatriation is associated with isthmus cingulate cortex reduction in community-dwelling elderly.", "Abstract": "The impact of stressful life events (SLEs) on brain anatomy is poorly understood, particularly its long-term neural consequences.

Research has suggested that initiation of substances is both genetically and environmentally driven (Rhee et al., Archives of general psychiatry 60:1256-1264, 2003; Verweij et al., Addiction 105:417-430, 2010). A previous work has found a significant interaction between the polygenic score and the same elementary school-based intervention with tobacco smoking (Musci et al., in press). The polygenic score reflects the contribution of multiple genes and has been shown in prior research to be predictive of smoking cessation, tobacco use, and marijuana use (Uhl et al., Molecular Psychiatry 19:50-54, 2014). Using data from a longitudinal preventive intervention study (N\u2009=\u2009678), we examined age of first marijuana use from sixth grade to age 18. Genetic data were collected during emerging adulthood and were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray (N\u2009=\u2009545). The polygenic score was computed using these data. Discrete-time survival analysis was employed to test for intervention main and interaction effects with the polygenic score. We found main effect of the polygenic score approaching significance, with the participants with higher polygenic scores reporting their first smoking marijuana at an age significantly later than controls (p\u2009=\u2009.050). We also found a significant intervention \u00d7 polygenic score interaction effect at p\u2009=\u2009.003, with participants at the higher end of the polygenic score benefiting the most from the intervention in terms of delayed age of first use. These results suggest that genetics may play an important role in the age of first use of marijuana and that differences in genetics may account for the differential effectiveness of classroom-based interventions in delaying substance use experimentation."}, {"Title": "Clinical and biological predictors of response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a review.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), developed in the 30's by Bini and Cerletti, remains a key element of the therapeutic armamentarium in psychiatry, particularly for severe and life-threatening psychiatric symptoms. However, despite its well-established clinical efficacy, the prescription of ECT has declined constantly over the years due to concerns over its safety (cognitive side effects) and an increasingly negative public perception. As for other treatments in the field of psychiatry, ECT is well suited to a personalized approach that would increment its efficacy, as well as reducing the impact of side effects. This should be based on the priori identification of sub-populations of patients sharing common clinical and biological features that predict a good response to ECT. In this review we have selectively reviewed the evidence on clinical and biological predictors of ECT response. Clinical features such as an older age, presence of psychotic and melancholic depression, a high severity of suicide behavior, and speed of response, appear to be shared by ECT good responders with depressive symptoms. In mania, a greater severity of the index episode, and a reduction of whole brain cortical blood flow are associated with ECT good response. Biological determinants of ECT response in depressive patients are the presence of pre-treatment hyperconnectivity between key areas of brain circuitry of depression, as well as of reduced glutamine/glutamate levels, particularly in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). Furthermore, pre ECT high plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, as well as of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and low pre-ECT levels of S-100B protein, appear to predict ECT response. Finally, polymorphisms within the genes encoding for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the dopamine 2 receptor gene (DRD2), the dopamine receptor 3 gene (DRD3), the cathechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), the serotonin-transporter (5-HTT), the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), appear to predict a good response to ECT.

However, whether specific patient groups are more likely to be subjected to these coercive measures is unclear. Using robust methodological and statistical techniques, we aimed to determine the demographic, clinical and behavioural predictors of both PICU and seclusion.\nData were extracted from an anonymised database comprising the electronic medical records of patients within a large South London mental health trust. Two cohorts were derived, (1) a PICU cohort comprising all patients transferred from general adult acute wards to a non-forensic PICU ward between April 2008 and April 2013 (N = 986) and a randomly selected group of patients admitted to general adult wards within this period who were not transferred to PICU (N = 994), and (2) a seclusion cohort comprising all seclusion episodes occurring in non-forensic PICU wards within the study period (N = 990) and a randomly selected group of patients treated in these wards who were not secluded (N = 1032). Demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, admission status and time since admission) and behavioural precursors (potentially relevant behaviours occurring in the 3 days preceding PICU transfer/seclusion or random sample date) were extracted from electronic medical records. Mixed effects, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed with all variables included as predictors.\nPICU cases were significantly more likely to be younger in age, have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and to be held on a formal section compared with patients who were not transferred to PICU; female sex and longer time since admission were associated with lower odds of transfer. With regard to behavioural precursors, the strongest predictors of PICU transfer were incidents of physical aggression towards others or objects and absconding or attempts to abscond. Secluded patients were also more likely to be younger and legally detained relative to non-secluded patients; however, female sex increased the odds of seclusion. Likelihood of seclusion also decreased with time since admission. Seclusion was significantly associated with a range of behavioural precursors with the strongest associations observed for incidents involving restraint or shouting.\nWhilst recent behaviour is an important determinant, patient age, sex, admission status and time since admission also contribute to risk of PICU transfer and seclusion. Alternative, less coercive strategies must meet the needs of patients with these characteristics."}, {"Title": "[Ambulatory care of patients with somatically unexplained complaints : A\u00a0comparative qualitative study].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the approach of general practitioners (GP) and outpatient specialists for psychiatry, neurology or psychosomatic medicine to patients with somatically unexplained complaints.\nQualitative interviews were conducted with general practitioners in Berlin and with outpatient specialists.

Available research has primarily been conducted on community populations, and even clinical samples mostly used self-reported questionnaires. These studies also recruited participants 12 years old and older, with a consequent lack of information on children from 8 to 11 years old. We examined the prevalence of PLEs and their relationship with psychiatric diagnosis, functioning, intelligence quotient (IQ), anxiety and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample aged 8-17 years old.\nThe study was conducted on a clinical sample of 46 CAD with PLEs compared to a clinical sample of 60 CAD without PLEs.

These significant differences were maintained when the covariate IQ, number of psychiatric diagnoses or level of anxiety or depression was added. No significant age-related differences in the presence of PLEs were found.\nThe findings of this study show that PLEs are common in a clinical sample of CAD, even those under 12 years old.

The reasons for hospitalization, the psychiatric and somatic comorbidities of the patients over 65\u00a0years old with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder were examined to identify patterns and risk profiles.\nA retrospective analysis was carried out using paper and electronic patient records of a department of acute care for geriatric psychiatry and psychotherapy. During the assessment period 206 successive patients over 65\u00a0years old were included in the study. The patient cohort included 64 patients with schizophrenia according to the international classification of diseases 10 (ICD-10, category F20), 78 patients with persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10, F22) and 64 patients with schizoaffective disorder (ICD-10, F25).\nThe reason for admission for one third of the patients in all three groups was aggressive behavior, whereas delusions and hallucinations were more frequent in the groups of F20 and F22 patients than in patients with schizoaffective disorders (F25). Somatic comorbidities were seen significantly more often in the group of F22 patients than in the other two groups.\nAcute admission was essentially due to acute psychiatric symptoms. Additional somatic comorbidities and psychosocial influencing factors played only a minor role in this study. The patients examined in this study constituted a special group within the acute treatment of inpatient psychiatry because they showed distinctive psychopathological productive symptoms but were relatively healthy from a somatic point of view. Patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (F20) or schizoaffective disorder (F25) were significantly different from patients classified into the group of delusional disorders (F22)."}, {"Title": "Preventing work-related stress among staff working in children's cancer Principal Treatment Centres in the UK: a brief survey of staff support systems and practices.", "Abstract": "Growing evidence of the association between health professionals' well-being and patient and organisational outcomes points to the need for effective staff support. This paper reports a brief survey of the UK's children's cancer Principal Treatment Centres (PTCs) regarding staff support systems and practices. A short on-line questionnaire, administered in 2012-2013, collected information about the availability of staff support interventions which seek to prevent work-related stress among different members of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). It was completed by a member of staff with, where required, assistance from colleagues. All PTCs (n\u00a0=\u00a019) participated. Debriefs following a patient death was the most frequently reported staff support practice. Support groups were infrequently mentioned. There was wide variability between PTCs, and between professional groups, regarding the number and type of interventions available. Doctors appear to be least likely to have access to support. A few Centres routinely addressed work-related stress in wider staff management strategies. Two Centres had developed a bespoke intervention. Very few Centres were reported to actively raise awareness of support available from their hospital's Occupational Health department. A minority of PTCs had expert input regarding staff support from clinical psychology/liaison psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of double care demanding patients in a mental health care setting and a nursing home setting: results from the SpeCIMeN study.", "Abstract": "Older patients suffering from a combination of psychiatric disorders and physical illnesses and/or dementia are called Double Care Demanding patients (DCDs). Special wards for DCDs within Dutch nursing homes (NHs) and mental health care institutions (MHCIs) offer a unique opportunity to obtain insight into the characteristics and needs of this challenging population.\nThis observational cross-sectional study collected data from 163 DCDs admitted to either a NH or a MHCI providing specialized care for DCDs. Similarities and differences between both DCD groups are described.\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms were highly prevalent in all DCDs but significantly more in MHCI-DCDs. Cognitive disorders were far more present in NH-DCDs, while MHCI-DCDs often suffered from multiple psychiatric disorders. The severity of comorbidities and care dependency were equally high among all DCDs. NH-DCDs expressed more satisfaction in overall quality of life.\nThe institutionalized elderly DCD population is very heterogeneous. Specific care arrangements are necessary because the severity of a patient's physical illness and the level of functional impairment seem to be equally important as the patient's behavioural, psychiatric and social problems. Further research should assess the adequacy of the setting assignment and the professional skills needed to provide adequate care for elderly DCDs."}, {"Title": "[Recovery and Inclusion: A Field Report on 5 Years of Peer Support in Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "We report on 5 years of hands-on experience with the inclusion of peers as recovery companions in the psychiatric teams at Klinikum Bremerhaven-Reinkenheide. It was our aim to offer those affected the possibility of professional inclusion into peer support and organize our department more strongly in line with recovery principles as result of their work. Currently, seven peer support people are permanent employees at our department. Their salaries are covered by the nursing budget. We discuss the preconditions of our model, implementation of the program, changes that occurred, but also problems that arose."}, {"Title": "Effects of Violence Prevention Behavior on Exposure to Workplace Violence and Threats: A Follow-Up Study.", "Abstract": "This longitudinal study investigates the relationship between prevention behaviors, that is, enacted violence prevention policies, and exposure to workplace violence and threats across four different high risk work sectors: psychiatry, special schools, eldercare, and the prison and probation services. Logistic regression analysis of a 1-year follow-up sample of 3.016 employees from these four sectors shows that prevention behaviors are significantly and negatively associated with self-reported exposure to workplace violence and threats-in the prison and probation services, eldercare, and in psychiatry, while no significant associations are found for special schools. The results therefore show clear sector differences with regard to the preventive effect of violence prevention behaviors. Furthermore, this multisector comparison suggests that prevention behaviors are more effective in relation to a moderate frequency of violence and threats, and that only top management prevention behavior can prevent very frequent incidents (odds ratio [ OR] = 0.58). This study contributes to the literature by use of a longitudinal design and acceptable response rates, while also simultaneously investigating several high risk sectors. The results imply that when managing workplace violence in high risk areas of human service work, there should be emphasis on the use of violence prevention behaviors from top management, supervisor, and among coworkers. However, type of sector and the frequency of workplace violence should be analyzed to evaluate the potential impact of prevention behaviors."}, {"Title": "Making defensible decisions in the era of recovery and rights.", "Abstract": "Our aim was to develop a framework for clinical decision-making that can be used to take into account risk in an era of recovery and rights.\nWe developed a framework influenced by civil liability law to develop a guide for clinical decision-making which emphasises collaboration, clarification of the available information and communication of decisions as essential components of recovery-oriented risk management."}]
