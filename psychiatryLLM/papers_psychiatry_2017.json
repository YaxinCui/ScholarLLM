[{"Title": "What influences postgraduate psychiatric trainees' attitudes to clinical audit?", "Abstract": "Clinical audit is an important component of safe and ethical practice but many clinicians cite barriers to engagement in audit.\nA total of 81 basic specialist trainees in psychiatry were surveyed in terms of their basic demographic details and their knowledge, direct experience and attitudes in relation to clinical audit.\nAmong the 49 (60.5%) who responded, 57.1% had received formal training in audit, but only 20.4% had received more than four hours of training in their whole career. The median positivity score was 30 out of a possible 54 (range 12-40), suggesting that participating trainees were barely more than 'undecided' overall when it comes to positive attitudes to clinical audit. Age, nationality and specific training did not predict attitudes to clinical audit. Gender, years of clinical experience and direct experience of clinical audit did not significantly predict attitudes to clinical audit, but these findings are at odds with some previous research.\nMuch work is needed in improving postgraduate trainees' attitudes to clinical audit, given that clinical audit is essential for good medical practice. Ours is an initial study of this area of training limited by sample size and the narrowness of the group tested. Further study of other specialities, higher trainees and consultant trainers would further enhance our understanding."}, {"Title": "Foreign accent syndrome and psychosis: a case report.", "Abstract": "This is a case report on a 57-year-old lady who presented to the Psychiatry Department of Tallaght Hospital after being referred by Neurology Department. She was initially attending Neurology Department for idiopathic Parkinson's disease which was later refuted as there was no objective evidence of response to treatment. She attended the A&E department with altered consciousness and headache, but her computed tomography of the brain was normal, and was diagnosed with migraine. But it was noted that she was reporting paranoia and auditory hallucinations, and her family had noticed marked change in her accent. On assessment in psychiatric outpatient she was noted to have psychotic symptoms. She reported these symptoms to be ongoing for the last 4 years, but have worsened to an extent that she was extremely distressed by them. She had acquired a Scottish accent. The change in accent coincided with worsening of her psychotic symptoms. Based on her assessment she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was commenced on olanzapine. Not only her psychotic symptoms resolved but also her accent reverted to native form."}, {"Title": "Changing prescribing patterns in an Irish community mental health service.", "Abstract": "Medication is an important component of the treatment of many mental illnesses.

We set out to obtain details of psychiatric medications being prescribed by one Irish community mental health service.\nAll prescribing by the Cluain Mhuire Community Mental Health Service became electronic during 2004. Using Business Intelligence software, we obtained details of all psychiatric medications prescribed from 2005 to 2016. We compared numbers of prescriptions written in the first 6 years (2005-2010) with the following 6 (2011-2016).\nOlanzapine was the most commonly prescribed medication throughout but its use declined by one-quarter over the study period. Clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol prescribing increased. Prescriptions for mood stabilisers and antidepressants fell by 25%. Sedative prescriptions declined by almost 50%. Absolute numbers of prescriptions written for methylphenidate and pregabalin were small but increased dramatically over the time period.\nThis community mental health service prescribed less of most psychiatric medications in 2016, than had been the case in 2005. This is despite an increase in the numbers of patients seen over the same period.

Overcoming the Rule-out Diagnosis?", "Abstract": "Functional neurological disorders, formerly referred to as conversion disorders, are a frequent clinical problem in neurology, psychiatry and primary care departments. In the new diagnostic categories, emphasis is placed on the positive characteristics necessary to diagnose this disorder. A narrative review of the scientific medical literature related to the subject was performed in order to determine the differences and advantages that the new classification of functional neurological disorders gives to doctors and patients. Historical, diagnostic, clinical and treatment concepts related to functional neurological disorders are reviewed. The conceptual differences between conversion disorders and functional neurological disorders and the implications of these changes in the clinical approach are identified. The new proposed diagnosis for functional neurological disorders provides the opportunity to transform a diagnosis made by ruling out other pathologies to a diagnosis where the presence of neurological signs suggestive of the disorder are verified and can be taught to the patient, and based on them, treatment strategies posed."}, {"Title": "Competence in performing emergency skills: How good do doctors really think they are?", "Abstract": "Despite the differences in exposure and experience in dealing with medical emergencies, all doctors should nevertheless be competent to assist a patient in need of resuscitation. The objective of this study was to describe the level of self-assessed emergency skill competence that specialist trainees in various disciplines possessed as well as to identify factors that may have contributed to their level of self-perceived competence.\nA prospective, cross-sectional, questionnaire study of various specialist trainees' self-perceived levels of competence in emergency skills was conducted across three academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa. Trainees from General Surgery and Internal Medicine (Clinical) and Psychiatry and Radiology (Non-Clinical) rated their self-perceived level of competence in a list of basic, intermediate and advanced emergency skills according to a five-point Likert ranking scale.\nNinety-four specialist trainees participated in the study - a response rate of 36%. The overall median competence rating for cardiac arrest resuscitation was 3.0 [IQR 3.0, 4.0] (i.e. intermediate). The median competence rating for cardiac arrest resuscitation in the clinical group (4.0) [IQR 3.0, 4.0] was higher than in the non-clinical group (3.0) [IQR 2.0, 3.0] (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Current or expired certification in Paediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) or Advanced Paediatric Life Support (APLS) courses increased perceived competence and delays in starting specialisation resulted in a decrease in overall competence composite scores for each year of delay after internship.\nGeneral Surgery and Internal Medicine trainees had a higher level of self-perceived competence in various emergency skills than their non- clinical counterparts.

The existence of some cases with exclusively psychiatric symptoms represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this article is to describe seven treatable neurometabolic disorders that should be taken into account in the psychiatric consultation as they manifest with psychiatric symptoms that mask the organic origin of the disorder. Homocysteine metabolism and urea cycle disorders, Wilson's disease, Niemann-Pick disease Type C, acute porphyria and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis are described. Following an analysis of the literature, a list of psychiatric symptoms associated with these disorders are proposed, ranging from insidious changes in affective state and thought to atypical symptoms such as visual hallucinations, as well as paradoxical effects of antipsychotics or behavioural disorders in children and adolescents associated with loss of autonomy. The most frequently associated neurological signs, such as alterations in the state of consciousness, motor behaviour and balance disorders, catatonia or progressive cognitive deficit are also listed.

A standard research strategy to pursue this goal is to compare observations of potential factors from patients with those from healthy controls. Classifications of individuals into patient and control groups are generally based on a diagnostic system, such as the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)</i> or the <i>International Classification of Diseases</i> (<i>ICD</i>). Several flaws in these conventional diagnostic-based approaches have been recognized. The flaws are primarily due to the complexity in the relation between the pathogenetic factors (causes) and disorders: The current diagnostic categories may not reflect the underlying etiological mechanisms. To overcome this difficulty, the National Institute of Mental Health initiated a novel research strategy called Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), which encourages studies to focus on the neurobiological mechanisms and core aspects of behavior rather than to rely on traditional diagnostic categories. However, how RDoC can improve research in psychiatry remains a matter of debate. In this article, we propose a theoretical framework for evaluating psychiatric research strategies, including the conventional diagnostic category-based approaches and the RDoC approach. The proposed framework is based on the statistical modeling of the processes of how the disorder arises from pathogenetic factors. This framework provides the statistical power to quantify how likely relevant pathogenetic factors are to be detected under various research strategies. On the basis of the proposed framework, we can discuss which approach performs better in different types of situations. We present several theoretical and numerical results that highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the strategies. We also demonstrate how a computational model is incorporated into the proposed framework as a generative model of behavioral observations. This demonstration highlights how the computational models contribute to designing psychiatric studies."}, {"Title": "Atypical waveform morphology in schizophrenia-visual evoked potential as a promising endophenotype.", "Abstract": "Electrophysiological research has provided measures of dysfunction of visual pathway in schizophrenia through the use of visual evoked potential (VEP) as the neurophysiologic tool.\nThe main objective of this study is to examine the morphology and topography of VEP responses in schizophrenic patients and to explore the potentiality of VEP as an endophenotype.\nThe study included 20 patients of schizophrenia who were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient department of psychiatry of a tertiary care rural hospital.

Interoceptive signaling has been considered a component process of reflexes, urges, feelings, drives, adaptive responses, and cognitive and emotional experiences, highlighting its contributions to the maintenance of homeostatic functioning, body regulation, and survival. Dysfunction of interoception is increasingly recognized as an important component of different mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, eating disorders, addictive disorders, and somatic symptom disorders. However, a number of conceptual and methodological challenges have made it difficult for interoceptive constructs to be broadly applied in mental health research and treatment settings. In November 2016, the Laureate Institute for Brain Research organized the first Interoception Summit, a gathering of interoception experts from around the world, with the goal of accelerating progress in understanding the role of interoception in mental health.

To overcome this challenge, the University Hospital of North Norway implemented an on-call system in psychiatric emergencies, by which psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 for telephone and videoconferencing consultations with patients and nurses at three regional psychiatric centers. The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of videoconferencing consultations in psychiatric emergencies. The on-call psychiatrists and nurses at the regional psychiatric centers who participated in at least one videoconferencing consultation were recruited for semi-structured interviews: 5 psychiatrists and 19 nurses for a total of 24 participants. The interviews were performed from July of 2012 to June of 2013. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a stepwise-deductive-inductive approach supported by the HyperRESEARCH analysis software. After the introduction of the videoconferencing system, telephone consultations were still used for straightforward situations when further treatment or admission decisions were obvious. Videoconferencing consultations, during which patients were present, were useful for challenging situations when there was 1) uncertainty regarding the degree of illness or the level of treatment, 2) a need to clarify the severity of the patient condition, 3) a need to build an alliance with the patient, and 4) disagreement either between health personnel or between the patient and health personnel.

Qualitative data was also gathered with a staff questionnaire. We hypothesised that compared to the use of white lights, red lights would be associated with a greater amount of recorded sleep, lesser use of 'as required' medication and no increase in the number of falls (reflecting comparable safety).\nWhilst there were no significant differences in quantitative measures recorded, there were more observations of sleep during the red light period than the white light period (14.1 versus 13.9 times per night) (U=627.5, z=-0.69, p=0.49) and fewer 'as required' medication administrations during the red light period compared to the white light period (3.3 versus 4.8 times per night) (U=640.0, z=0.56, p=0.57).

This paper attempts to provide some observations to take into account when discussing the link between ethics and mental health. In this work, the authors approach the question of ethics committees and the importance that psychiatrist performance has within them. This is done through a review of relevant papers on the subject. A detailed description on research ethics is provided in terms of justification, purpose and duties. Likewise, emphasis is placed on each of the areas in which psychiatrists are involved and bear great responsibilities in the medical decision-making process.

In individuals with healthy defense and coping systems, stress results in the formation of negatively valenced memories whose ability to induce emotional and somatic distress subsides with time. Vulnerable individuals, however, go on to develop stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suffer from significant memory abnormalities. Whether expressed as intrusive trauma memories, partial amnesia, or dissociative amnesia, such abnormalities are thought to be the core source of patients' symptoms, which are often debilitating and implicate an entire socio-cognitive-affective spectrum.\nWith this in mind, and focusing on stress-responsive hippocampal microcircuits, this article highlights recent advances in the neurobiology of memory that allow us to (1) isolate and visualize memory circuits, (2) change their activity using genetic tools and state-dependent manipulations, and (3) directly examine their impact on socio-affective circuits and global network connectivity. By integrating these approaches, we are now in a position to address important questions that have troubled psychiatry for a long time-questions such as are traumatic memories special, and why are stress effects on memory diverse.\nFurthering our fundamental understanding of memory in the framework of adaptive and maladaptive stress responses has the potential to boost the development of new treatments that can benefit patients suffering from psychological trauma."}, {"Title": "Epidemiological survey of mental health in adolescent school children of Gujarat, India.", "Abstract": "Mental health problems in adolescents are inadequately researched in low-resource settings.

RLDM offer a novel approach to assessing and potentially diagnosing psychiatric patients, and there is growing enthusiasm for both RLDM and computational psychiatry among clinical researchers. Such a framework can also provide insights into the brain substrates of particular RLDM processes, as exemplified by model-based analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). However, researchers often find the approach too technical and have difficulty adopting it for their research. Thus, a critical need remains to develop a user-friendly tool for the wide dissemination of computational psychiatric methods. We introduce an R package called hBayesDM (hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Decision-Making tasks), which offers computational modeling of an array of RLDM tasks and social exchange games. The hBayesDM package offers state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian modeling, in which both individual and group parameters (i.e., posterior distributions) are estimated simultaneously in a mutually constraining fashion. At the same time, the package is extremely user-friendly: users can perform computational modeling, output visualization, and Bayesian model comparisons, each with a single line of coding. Users can also extract the trial-by-trial latent variables (e.g., prediction errors) required for model-based fMRI/EEG. With the hBayesDM package, we anticipate that anyone with minimal knowledge of programming can take advantage of cutting-edge computational-modeling approaches to investigate the underlying processes of and interactions between multiple decision-making (e.g., goal-directed, habitual, and Pavlovian) systems. In this way, we expect that the hBayesDM package will contribute to the dissemination of advanced modeling approaches and enable a wide range of researchers to easily perform computational psychiatric research within different populations."}, {"Title": "Validation of the French Version of Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised, Short Version (CPRS-R:S): Scale Measurement Invariance by Sex and Age.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> ADHD is one of the most frequent neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition to clinical assessment, its diagnosis requires the use of validated and reliable behavior questionnaires such as the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R:S). Though various French versions of the CPRS-R:S have been already put to use in clinical practice and research, only a few have undergone a stringent validation process. After a previous validation of the factorial structure of Lausanne French version, we sought here for the analysis of its invariance across sex and age. <b>Method:</b> This validation step was carried out in a rather homogeneous French population of 365 boys and 374 girls from a single school. Two-age classes were considered: children (boys and girls) aged 9 to 11 years (<i>n</i> = 258) and adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (<i>n</i> = 481). <b>Results:</b> Regarding age, dimension Oppositional showed a strong invariance whereas dimensions Hyperactivity and Cognitive problems/Inattention showed a partially strong invariance. Regarding sex, dimensions Oppositional and Hyperactivity showed a partially strong invariance whereas dimension Cognitive problems/Inattention showed a partially weak invariance. The distribution of the CPRS-R:S scores is given by sex and age class. <b>Conclusion:</b> The Lausanne French version of the CPRS-R:S, already validated regarding its factorial structure, internal consistency, and reliability, is here validated regarding its invariance across sex and age.

The aim of this study was to investigate the patient's perspective on psychiatric visits: patient's attitudes towards the psychiatrist, patient's view of the patient-psychiatrist relationship, and the patient's needs and expectations from this relationship.\n615 psychiatric outpatients responded to the anonymous questionnaires connected with their attitudes towards the psychiatrist, evaluation of the doctor, and expectations from psychiatric care. The study was conducted in 10 out of 30 public centres for psychiatric care in north-eastern Poland.\nGenerally, the patients liked and positively evaluated their psychiatrists. Patient's liking for the doctor was connected with the feeling that the doctor also liked the patient, as well as with perceiving the doctor as competent and willing to meet the patient. The longer the treatment with a particular psychiatrist and the rarer need to consult the doctor, the more positive attitude and evaluation of the doctor patients had. According to the patients, the most significant expectations were associated with both conversation with the doctor and receiving emotional support.\nThe key phase for forming the patient-psychiatrist relationship was the first stage of cooperation in which patients created their attitudes towards the doctor without modifying them at further stages. Thus, further studies on learning and developing the ability to establish the relationship with the patient, inspiring the patient's trust and making psychiatric appointments comfortable from the first meeting, will be highly valuable."}, {"Title": "[Brain X-radiation for Childhood Epilepsy, Hydrocephalus or Mental Retardation?

Following his death in 1941, his student Hans Heinze (Brandenburg/H.) succeeded him, prevailing over Werner Villinger (Breslau). The principal task of the DGKH was considered to be the exploration of the genetic origins of intellectual disabilities and behavioural disorders among children and adolescents. Based on their research since the 1920s, Schr\u00f6der and Heinze believed that genetically predisposed, i. e. hereditary, character structures were aetiological for behavioural deviations among minors. It was their opinion that, based on the characterology they had established, development capabilities of children, as well as their \"value\" for the community, could be reliably predicted. In order to spare the community fruitless expenditures, they suggested that pedagogical stimulation was to be diminished in cases that reached the \"hereditary boundaries of education\". This assessment of a hereditary and hence unswayable inferiority was contested by the \"Berlin School\", represented by psychiatrist Franz Kramer and social pedagogue Ruth von der Leyen. They argued that while the possibility of \"brutal-egoistical behaviour\" existed, given the hereditary predisposition, it could however be successfully counteracted by pedagogic-therapeutic measures. After 1933, this faction controversy within the institutionally emerging child and adolescent psychiatry was decided in favour of the \"Leipzig School\", which was conform to the system and ideology of the time."}, {"Title": "[Coercive Measures in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Post-war Germany, Using the Example of the \"Pflege- und Beobachtungsstation\" in the State Psychiatric Hospital Weissenau (1951-1966)].", "Abstract": "Coercive Measures in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Post-war Germany, Using the Example of the \"Pflege- und Beobachtungsstation\" in the State Psychiatric Hospital Weissenau (1951-1966) The patient admissions at the children's ward of the State Psychiatric Hospital Weissenau in the years 1951, 1956, 1961 and 1966 were analyzed regarding documented coercive measures. Shortage of staff, mainly inadequately skilled personnel, a mixing of age groups in the patient cohort, neurological and psychiatric disorders and of patients who were in need of nursing and of those who needed treatment constituted the general work environment. Coercive measures against patients, mostly disproportionate isolations, were a constant part of daily life on the ward. This affected in particular patients who had to stay longer at the hospital and whose stay was financed by public authority. The uselessness of such measures was known, which can be seen e. g. in the Caretaker's Handbook of that time and the comments in the patient files.

First, the historical starting point of diagnosing distress was neurasthenia during the last two decades of the 19th century. Second, the diagnosis of neurasthenia that initially contained more somatic than mental symptoms was gradually replaced by the more psychologically conceptualized neuroses. Such a psychiatrization of neurosis gradually separated mental and somatic syndromes into two distinct diagnostic categories, those of mental and somatic. Third, when modern \"neuroses\" are seen in the framework of distress rather than disease, it provides tools for new kinds of interventions, in which the principal aim is to alleviate the subjective distress with all possible and reasonable means and methods. As the social context constitutes a crucial \"etiology\" to medicalized forms of distress, we need new, context-based approaches to both analyze and alleviate such distress. In our historical and medical approach to these \"diagnoses of distress\", we are guided by the belief that analyzing diagnostic categories can provide important insight into the mechanisms behind our changing conceptions of health and wellbeing."}, {"Title": "Clinical Applications of Stochastic Dynamic Models of the Brain, Part II: A Review.", "Abstract": "Brain activity derives from intrinsic dynamics (due to neurophysiology and anatomical connectivity) in concert with stochastic effects that arise from sensory fluctuations, brainstem discharges, and random microscopic states such as thermal noise.

Consequently, widespread alterations in neural structure and developmental and maturational trajectory would be expected. To date, there have been few quantitative and systematic studies of brain morphology in PWS, although alterations of volume and of cortical organisation have been reported. This study aimed to investigate, in detail, the structure of grey matter and cortex in the brain in a sample of young adults with PWS in a well-matched case-controlled analysis. 20 young adults with PWS, aged 19-27\u00a0years, underwent multiparameter mapping magnetic resonance imaging sequences, from which measures of grey matter volume, cortical thickness and magnetisation transfer saturation, as a proxy measure of myelination, were examined. These variables were investigated in comparison to a control group of 40 typically developing young adults, matched for age and sex. A voxel-based morphometry analysis identified large and widespread bilateral clusters of both increased and decreased grey matter volume in the brain in PWS. In particular, widespread areas of increased volume encompassed parts of the prefrontal cortex, especially medially, the majority of the cingulate cortices, from anterior to posterior aspects, insula cortices, and areas of the parietal and temporal cortices. Increased volume was also reported in the caudate, putamen and thalamus. The most ventromedial prefrontal areas, in contrast, showed reduced volume, as did the parts of the medial temporal lobe, bilateral temporal poles, and a small cluster in the right lateral prefrontal cortex. Analysis of cortical structure revealed that areas of increased volume in the PWS group were largely driven by greater cortical thickness. Conversely, analysis of myelin content using magnetisation transfer saturation indicated that myelination of the cortex was broadly similar in the PWS and control groups, with the exception of highly localised areas, including the insula. The bilateral nature of these abnormalities suggests a systemic biological cause, with possible developmental and maturational mechanisms discussed, and may offer insight into the contribution of imprinted genes to neural development."}, {"Title": "[Narrative and psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The aim of this work is to analyze the application of the concepts that originate in the narrative, to the learning and teaching of psychiatry.

The aim of this work has been to describe the development of the neuropsychology in Argentina and its relation with the psychology, neurology and psychiatry. The first period was into the neurology with its French school in?uence. In 1907, Jose Ingeniero published in French his book about \"amusia\", Cristofredo Jakob the \"folia neurobiologica\" where he described the organization of the human brain, Vicente Dimitri in 1933 his book \"aphasia\" and Bernardo de Quiros in 1959 his works about dyslexia.

The argentine school of psychology by the holism and the psychoanalysis influence do not accept the neuropsychology until 1960 where was included at the school of psychology from the university of Buenos Aires (UBA) with the first linguistics works of Juan Azcoaga. At the 80, began the North American influence of the neurology with authors like Carlos Mangone (dementia), Ramon Leiguarda (apraxia), Sergio Starkstein (depression and apathy) and Ricardo Allegri (memory and Alzheimer). In 1982 the Argentine Neuropsychological Society was founded and in 1987 was the working group of dementia from the Argentine Neurological Society.

Comparative studies between Open Dialogue (OD) and current treatments of schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses point to an important difference in short and long-term results in favor of this approach developed in Western Lapland. This suggests that OD treatment enhances durable recovery. The prognosis of recovery would depend mainly on the treatment received, and would not be necessarily partial or dependent on a mysterious personal quality. We emphasize the consequent epistemological change regarding the recovery and the offcial view of the problems in mental health. To do this, we briefly recount the concept of recovery, originating in North America in the 1970s, also based on its influence in the countries of Europe, particularly Switzerland, based on the work of a group of user associations and former users of psychiatry, families and social and mental health professionals (Le GREPSY). Traditionally recovery is a controversial issue, which has generated tension and conflict between patients and psychiatry.

This paper focuses on primary prevention activities, which can be undertaken in a general hospital in South Asia with abysmally low-mental health resources. For implementing primary prevention in psychiatry, a general hospital may be conceptualized as a population unit, located in a well-populated area with easy accessibility where different kinds of communities, for example, students and resident doctors, consultants, patients and their caregivers, and paramedical, nursing, administrative and other supportive staff, coexist and have varied functions. All the functional components of the general hospital psychiatric units (GHPUs) offer scope for introducing primary preventive psychiatry services. Psychiatrists in GHPUs can lead efforts for primary prevention in mental health in the hospital by employing strategies in the framework of universal, selective, and indicated prevention.

In the light of enlargement of the concept of mental illness and the experience of madness, an approach is being attempted regarding the early surrealist views as they precursory appear e.g. from the case of Hieronymus Bosch to the meeting of the dominant psychiatry and the surrealist movement in the 19th and 20th century. Then, the paper attempts to present the main positions of representatives of the movement, such as Breton, Dali and Kalas. These three surrealists were chosen among others, for this brief report, as the representatives of three remarkable moments in the surrealistic route. Breton introduces the element of fiction and hyper-reality while he questions the distinction between normal and abnormal element. Dali with his paranoid critical method reconciles actual representations with mythical and symbolic elements, breaking through the limits between objectivity and subjectivity. Kalas puts forward the social origin of insanity along with the fundamental surrealist notions of individual freedom and will. For a more complete understanding of this attempt, it was considered useful to include elements of the main views on madness from the standpoint of a critical approach in psychiatry and psychology. The surrealistic view seems to be close to this critical approach which is likely to have been affected by it on the level in which the movements and scientific fields meet and interact. The relationship between surrealism, the notion and expression of madness and the absurd seems to be inherent to the very development of the movement through its core and individual pursuits. In conclusion, the relationship between surrealism and the notion and expression of the madness and the absurd seems to be inherent to the very birth of the movement through its main positions and pursuits. The question of so-called reality, its overshoot and the vision of a hyperreality that will incorporates the challenges and contradictions of this reality, are points loudly expressed through artistic activities and scientific researches and practices. A common ground to all these aspects is the liberation of desire, the questioning of rationality, the integration and acceptance of the absurd, as well as, the dispute of it as such, and finally the social change-driven by the individual psychological development."}, {"Title": "[The concept of urban resilience and its relation to resilience in mental health: Prospects for research in schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "The relationship between schizophrenia and the city is well known and widely documented in the literature, albeit with many questions still unanswered. While it is clear that there is a higher incidence of schizophrenia in cities, there is little known on causality - or its direction - in that relationship. Also, despite the fact that several clinical and epidemiological parameters play a role in the relationship between schizophrenia and the city, this relationship has not been investigated or interpreted holistically. In particular, biological, psychological and social parameters have been extensively explored, usually in isolation, but not as a part of the wider urban environment. A concept that could potentially offer such integration between the urban environment and the biopsycho- social approach may be the concept of psychological resilience. Psychological resilience is a central notion of Preventive Psychiatry, both in theory and in practice. It refers to a person's ability to cope with adversity and to recover. It describes, in holistic terms, the psychological potential that each person has, taking together all positive psychological factors but also their functioning and reactions in their own environment. It is intriguing that the same concept, (even by the same name - urban resilience), exists in relation to urban planning and architecture, referring to a city's ability to help its inhabitants and systems to withstand and recover from adversity. As with people, the factors that make a city resilient are many and complex. Surprisingly, however, the factors that define psychological and urban resilience are conceptually related, as ultimately both serve the person/citizen. Thus, the factors that make up urban resilience may be complementary to the factors that make up mental resilience and vice versa. Consequently, not only is the conceptual affinity of urban resilience and psychological resilience logical, but also the individual factors that define the two are also related. It would be interesting to study these factors and to examine the role of resilience (or lack thereof) in the occurrence of mental illness - in particular schizophrenia - in cities. In this paper we present the concepts of psychological and urban resilience, we identify the factors that characterize urban resilience, and define its practical relationship with psychological resilience in the case of schizophrenia. Finally, we explore the potential and prospects of this novel multidisciplinary approach for tackling schizophrenia, for use in public health, and for further research."}, {"Title": "RETRACTED: Mnemonic Discrimination Deficits in First-Episode Psychosis and a Ketamine Model Suggests Dentate Gyrus Pathology Linked to N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Hypofunction.", "Abstract": "This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/article-withdrawal).

After re-running statistical analyses with the correct values, the authors found a significant difference in the response bias\u2013corrected pattern recognition score in healthy volunteers (HV) compared with first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (HV: 84.13 \u00b1 10.96; FEP: 63.70 \u00b1 21.83; t = 4.01; p < .01) in experiment 1. This finding is not consistent with the original report, where the authors reported no group differences in bias-corrected pattern recognition scores (originally reported values: t = 0.93, p = .36). The authors again found no significant correlations between pattern completion scores and BPRS total, positive, or negative symptom scores or RBANS scores, consistent with the original report. In experiment 2, bias-corrected pattern recognition scores did not differ between the saline and ketamine conditions (saline: 78.29 \u00b1 28.04; ketamine: 73.59 \u00b1 18.94; t = 0.81; p = 0.43), which is consistent with the original report (originally reported values: t = \u22120.69, p = .50). Contrary to the original report, task performance during the saline and ketamine infusions was no longer correlated at trend level for pattern recognition. Repeat analyses showed no correlations between pattern recognition scores during the ketamine challenge and BPRS total, positive, and negative symptom scores, or ketamine plasma levels at either time point, consistent with the original report. The authors have verified that bias-corrected pattern separation scores were calculated correctly for both experiments in the initial report. This error affects the abstract, the results, Figure 1, and discussion of the manuscript. The authors voluntarily informed the Journal of this honest error upon its discovery. Because of the extent and nature of the changes to the paper, the editors and authors concluded that, to ensure maximum clarity and transparency, the only course of action was to retract this version of the paper. The authors are revising the paper, which the Journal will re-review and consider further for publication."}, {"Title": "Machine Learning for Precision Psychiatry: Opportunities and Challenges.", "Abstract": "The nature of mental illness remains a conundrum. Traditional disease categories are increasingly suspected to misrepresent the causes underlying mental disturbance. Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "A shift to placing parents in charge: Does it improve weight gain in youth with anorexia?", "Abstract": "Family-based treatment (FBT) has emerged as a promising approach for medically stable youth with anorexia nervosa (AN). While there is evidence that therapists embrace the core principles of FBT, most face barriers in implementing the model with fidelity. Little research has been conducted to determine whether adhering to the core methods of placing parents in charge are sufficient in restoring weight in youth with AN. This study involved a chart review of youth under 16 years of age, treated by a Canadian tertiary care health centre-based eating disorders team (EDT). The purpose was to compare the weight gain of youth treated before and after the team was trained in FBT and shifted to empowering parents to be in charge of weight gain. As predicted, youth who participated in family sessions adhering to the 'parents in charge' approach (PIC, N=32) made greater gains in percentage of ideal body weight (%IBW) and were more likely to reach body weights within a healthy range as compared with youth (N=14) who participated in a 'non-specific therapy' (NST) involving expert driven psycho-educational family sessions. Youth whose parents were placed in charge of weight gain were also significantly less likely to be hospitalized on the psychiatry unit for weight restoration, had significantly shorter mean duration of stays on this unit, and required tube-feeding less frequently than youth who participated in NST. Collectively, the results suggest that placing parents in charge of refeeding promotes efficient weight gain, while decreasing the need for more intensive intervention."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale among Korean Adolescents.", "Abstract": "The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is designed to measure the current level of depressive symptomatology in the general population. However, no review has examined whether the scale is reliable and valid among children and adolescents in Korea. The purpose of this study was to test whether the Korean form of the CES-D is valid in adolescents.\nData were obtained from 1,884 adolescents attending grades 1-3 in Korean middle schools. Reliability was evaluated by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). Concurrent validity was evaluated by a correlation analysis between the CES-D and other scales. Construct validity was evaluated by exploratory factor and confirmatory factor analyses.\nThe internal consistency coefficient for the entire group was 0.88. The CES-D was positively correlated with scales that measure negative psychological constructs, such as the State Anxiety Inventory for Children, the Korean Social Anxiety Scale for Children and Adolescents, and the Reynold Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, but it was negatively correlated with scales that measure positive psychological constructs, such as the Korean version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. The CES-D was examined by three-dimensional exploratory factor analysis, and the three-factor structure of the scale explained 53.165% of the total variance. The variance explained by factor I was 24.836%, that explained by factor II was 15.988%, and that explained by factor III was 12.341%. The construct validity of the CES-D was tested by confirmatory factor analysis, and we applied the entire group's data using a three-factor hierarchical model. The fit index showed a level similar to those of other countries' adolescent samples.\nThe CES-D has high internal consistency and addresses psychological constructs similar to those addressed by other scales. The CES-D showed a three-factor structure in an exploratory factor analysis. The present findings suggest that the CES-D is a useful and reliable tool for measuring depression in Korean adolescents."}, {"Title": "Comparative Analysis of the WISC between Two ADHD Subgroups.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school-age children is 7.2%, and ADHD is divided into clinical subtypes.\nThe current study explored whether specific cognitive profiles as assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-IV could be obtained for each clinical ADHD subtype (ADHD-Inattentive type and ADHD-Combined type) and investigated the correlation between WISC scores and parental age at their children's birth or birthweight. The enrolled sample comprised 12 ADHD-I and 15 ADHD-C subjects.\nAn impaired Processing Speed Index was found in ADHD-I. The age of the father at the child's birth and birthweight positively correlated with the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) score in the WISC assessment.\nInattentiveness within the behaviors of the children with ADHD-I is partly due to the impaired processing speed, therefore effective support for ADHD will be conducted if educator decreases their speaking speed. Since biological basis of ADHD is still largely unknown, future studies using both psychological and biological methods will reveal the etiology of ADHD.

Flexible laryngoscopy demonstrated fullness of the right posterior pharyngeal wall and computed tomography (CT) showed a linear opaque foreign body extending from the level of the oropharynx to the thyroid ala. Further history elicited that he stabbed himself in the pharynx two years prior with a toothbrush following a command hallucination. The toothbrush was removed uneventfully via an external approach. The patient was discharged with psychiatry follow-up. This case is unusual due to the submucosal location of the foreign body and the length of retention.

Although it is not supported by psychiatric associations, few medical associations have actually condemned it as unethical. In this article, I argue that past life regression therapy is unethical for two basic reasons. First, it is not evidence-based. Past life regression is based on the reincarnation hypothesis, but this hypothesis is not supported by evidence, and in fact, it faces some insurmountable conceptual problems. If patients are not fully informed about these problems, they cannot provide an informed consent, and hence, the principle of autonomy is violated. Second, past life regression therapy has the great risk of implanting false memories in patients, and thus, causing significant harm.

There were two concepts that stood out in these transnationally held discussions; namely moral insanity and later on, psychopathy. Following recent approaches in the cultural and social history of psychiatry, we understand moral insanity and psychopathy as social constructs, which are determined by the evolution in psychiatric knowledge, and also by laws, codes and social norms of particular historical timeframes. Our task is to discuss the evolution and adoption of these concepts in two linguistically different, but still historically profoundly entangled regions, namely in Italian and Croatian psychiatric discourses at the turn from the 19th to the 20th century.

It considers what would happen if we treated diagnostic categories not as <i>causes</i> of signs and symptoms, but as diagnostic <i>consequences</i> of psychopathology and pathophysiology. This reformulation (of the standard nosological model) opens the door to a more natural description of how patients present-and of their likely responses to therapeutic interventions. In brief, we describe a model that generates symptoms, signs, and diagnostic outcomes from latent psychopathological states. In turn, psychopathology is caused by pathophysiological processes that are perturbed by (etiological) causes such as predisposing factors, life events, and therapeutic interventions. The key advantages of this nosological formulation include (i) the formal integration of diagnostic (e.g., DSM) categories and latent psychopathological constructs (e.g., the dimensions of the Research Domain Criteria); (ii) the provision of a hypothesis or model space that accommodates formal, evidence-based hypothesis testing (using Bayesian model comparison); and (iii) the ability to predict therapeutic responses (using a posterior predictive density), as in precision medicine.

Four 50-minute interactive didactic lectures were integrated into the required didactic curriculum (one lecture per postgraduate training class) during the 2015-2016 academic year.\nOf residents who attended lectures and provided anonymous feedback, 97% agreed that discussing racism in formal didactics was at least \"somewhat\" positive, and 92% agreed that it should \"probably\" or \"definitely\" remain in the curriculum. Qualitative feedback centered on a need for more time to discuss racism as well as a desire to learn more about minority mental health advocacy in general.\nTeaching about racism as part of required training conveys the explicit message that this is core curricular material and critical knowledge for all physicians. These lectures can serve as a springboard for dissemination and provide scaffolding for similar curriculum development in medical residency programs."}, {"Title": "Efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Mobile Application: a Randomized Waiting-List Controlled Trial.", "Abstract": "Although several hundreds of apps are available that (cl)aim to promote mindfulness, only a few methodologically sound studies have evaluated the efficacy of these apps. This randomized waiting-list controlled trial therefore tested the hypothesis that one such app (the <i>VGZ Mindfulness Coach</i>) can achieve immediate and long-term improvements of mindfulness, quality of life, general psychiatric symptoms, and self-actualization. One hundred ninety-one experimental participants received the VGZ Mindfulness Coach, which offers 40 mindfulness exercises and background information about mindfulness without any form of therapeutic guidance. Compared to 186 control participants, they reported large (Cohen's <i>d</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.77) and statistically significant increases of mindfulness after 8\u00a0weeks and small-to-medium increases of the Observing, Describing, Acting with awareness, Nonjudging, and Nonreactivity mindfulness facets as measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Cohen's <i>d</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.66, 0.26, 0.49, 0.34, and 0.43, respectively). Also, there were large decreases of general psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12; Cohen's <i>d</i>\u00a0=\u00a0-0.68) and moderate increases of psychological, social, and environmental quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF; Cohen's <i>d</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.38, 0.38, and 0.36, respectively). Except for social quality of life, these gains were maintained for at least 3\u00a0months. We conclude that it is possible to achieve durable positive effects on mindfulness, general psychiatric symptoms, and several aspects of quality of life at low costs with smartphone apps for mindfulness such as the VGZ Mindfulness Coach."}, {"Title": "Study of the effect of Memantine therapy on the treatment of dyslexia in children.", "Abstract": "Reading disorder (RD) is one of the important complaints in children with learning disorders (LD) that is prevalent in 4% of children in the United States. Treating this disorder includes education of reading practices and treating psychological disorders, and there are no exact medications prescribed in these children. Memantine has been effective in treating memory problems in Alzheimer Dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism disorder, and other psychological diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of memantine in improving RD in children.\nIn this randomized clinical trial, 62 children, with RD in Pediatric Psychiatry Clinics of Noor and Ali-Asghar Hospital in Isfahan from 2015 to 2016, were participated. They were randomly assigned to two groups of equal number, one receiving education plus memantine and the other education plus placebo. RD was evaluated at the beginning, 1 and 3 months after intervention by Iranian standard reading and dyslexia test (Nama).\nMean (standard deviation) age of participants was 7.55 (0.60) years.

So far, many attempts have been made to treat this disease, but few effective treatments have been discovered. In this work, we reviewed the related articles in the limited period of time, 2000-2016, through search in PubMed, Scopus database, Google Scholar, and psychology and psychiatry literature (PsycINFO). We selected the articles about the correlation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and breast cancer in the insight into therapeutic applicability from mentioned genetics research databases. The miRNAs as an effective therapy for breast cancer was at the center of our attention. Hormone therapy and chemotherapy are two major methods that are being used frequently in breast cancer treatment. In the search for an effective therapy for breast cancer, miRNAs suggest a promising method of treatment. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that can turn genes on or off and can have critical roles in cancer treatment; therefore, in the near future, usage of these biological molecules in breast cancer treatment can be considered a weapon against most common cancer-related concerns in women. Here, we discuss miRNAs and their roles in various aspects of breast cancer treatment to help find an alternative and effective way to treat or even cure this preventable disease."}, {"Title": "Combat psychiatry: Indian perspective.", "Abstract": "Indian Armed Forces have been engaged in various combat duties for long.

Clinically, it has often been applied in the United States but rarely in most other countries. A meta-analysis (Van Meter et al., Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, , 72, 1250) claimed that the prevalence of PBD was similar to adults at 1.8% with no difference between the United States and other countries. This conclusion has been highly cited.\nThe heterogeneous nature of the original 12 epidemiological surveys warrants a qualitative analysis, rather than statistical meta-analysis as performed by Van Meter et\u00a0al. (Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 2011, 72, 1250). Thus, the meta-analysis and each of the 12 studies (six from the United States; six from other countries) were reexamined.\nMost of the 12 surveys predated the emergence of the PBD hypothesis. The 12 surveys were mainly of adolescents and at times young adults with few prepubertal children. Prevalence rates in the 12 studies suggest a lower rate of bipolar disorder, especially in non-US samples. For example, the Van Meter et\u00a0al. (Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 2011, 72, 1250) meta-analysis chose a rate of 2.8% by summation of adolescent and parent responses in a Dutch survey, however the rate fell to 0% if requiring concordance of adolescent and parent responses. Indeed, it could be argued that four of the non-US studies show 0% rates of PBD.\nRates of PBD were generally substantially lower than 1.8%, particularly in non-US surveys, and if both parent and adolescent reports were required to meet the diagnostic threshold they fell to close to zero. The reanalysis suggests that bipolar disorder is rare before the expected age of onset in later adolescence."}, {"Title": "[Latent and simple forms of schizophrenia in the concept of E.

However, the subcellular distribution of TAAR1 is still unclear, since TAAR1 signal is largely intracellular. <i>In vitro</i>, TAAR1 is activated with nanomolar to micromolar affinity by some endogenous amines, particularly <i>p</i>-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), the latter representing a novel branch of thyroid hormone signaling. In addition, TAAR1 responds to a number of psychoactive drugs, i.e., amphetamines, ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and lisuride. Trace amines have been identified as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, and they are considered as potential neuromodulators. In particular, beta-phenylethylamine and <i>p</i>-tyramine have been reported to modify the release and/or the response to dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA, while evidence of cross-talk between TAAR1 and other aminergic receptors has been provided. Systemic or intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous T1AM produced prolearning and antiamnestic effects, reduced pain threshold, decreased non-REM sleep, and modulated the firing rate of adrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus. However each of these substances may have additional molecular targets, and it is unclear whether their endogenous levels are sufficient to produce significant TAAR1 activation <i>in vivo</i>. TAAR1 knock out mice show a worse performance in anxiety and working memory tests, and they are more prone to develop ethanol addiction. They also show increased locomotor response to amphetamine, and decreased stereotypical responses induced by apomorphine. Notably, human genes for TAARs cluster on chromosome 6 at q23, within a region whose mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For human TAAR1, around 200 non-synonymous and 400 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, but their functional consequences have not been extensively investigated yet. In conclusion, the bulk of evidence points to a significant physiological role of TAAR1 in the modulation of central nervous system function and a potential pharmacological role of TAAR1 agonists in neurology and/or psychiatry. However, the specific effects of TAAR1 stimulation are still controversial, and many crucial issues require further investigation."}, {"Title": "[Data analysis: challenges and specifics in neuroscience and psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The amount of available data relevant for clinical decision support is rising not only rapidly but at the same time much faster than our ability to analyze and interpret them. Thus, the potential of the data to contribute to determining the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of an individual patient is not appropriately exploited. The hopes to obtain benefit from the data for an individual patient must be accompanied by a reliable and diligent biostatistical analysis which faces serious challenges not always clear to non-statisticians. The aim of this paper is to discuss principles of statistical analysis of big data in research and routine applications in clinical medicine, focusing on particular aspects of psychiatry. The paper brings arguments in favor of the idea that the biostatistical analysis of data in a specialty field requires different approaches and different experience compared to other clinical fields. This is illustrated by a description of common complications of the analysis of psychiatric data. Challenges of the analysis of big data in both psychiatric research and routine practice are explained, which are far from a routine service activity exploiting standard methods of multivariate statistics and/or machine learning.

People with this syndrome pretend that they are sick and tend to seek treatment, without secondary gains, at different care facilities. Both syndromes are well-recognized conditions described in the literature since 1951. They are frequently observed by health teams in clinics, hospital wards and emergency rooms. We performed a narrative, nonsystematic review of the literature, including case reports, case series, and review articles indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed from 1951 to 2015. Each study was reviewed by two psychiatry specialists, who selected, by consensus, the studies to be included in the review. Although Munchausen syndrome was first described more than 60 years ago, most of studies in the literature about it are case reports and literature reviews. Literature lacks more consistent studies about this syndrome epidemiology, therapeutic management and prognosis. Undoubtedly, these conditions generate high costs and unnecessary procedures in health care facilities, and their underdiagnose might be for lack of health professional's knowledge about them, and to the high incidence of countertransference to these patients and to others, who are exposed to high morbidity and mortality, is due to symptoms imposed on self or on others."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric morbidity after surgery for inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "To examine the evidence about psychiatric morbidity after inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related surgery.\nPRISMA guidelines were followed and a protocol was published at PROSPERO (CRD42016037600).

The survey contained 18 statements which were rated twice based on truthfulness in terms of a participant's formal education and conception, respectively. Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon signed rank test determined differences between education and conception.\nResults showed that students were less likely to perceive a neurotransmitter imbalance to cause mental illness, as opposed to what was emphasized during a formal medical education. Students and residents also understood the importance of factors such as systemic racism and socioeconomic status in the development of mental illness, which were factors that did not receive heavy emphasis during medical education. Furthermore, students and residents believed that not only did mental illnesses have nonuniform pathologies, but that the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> also had the propensity to sometimes arbitrarily categorize individuals with potentially negative consequences.\nIf these notions are therefore part of students' and residents' conceptions, as well as documented in the literature, then it seems appropriate for medical education to be further developed to emphasize these ideas."}, {"Title": "Self-Reported Adverse Drug Reactions, Medication Adherence, and Clinical Outcomes among Major Depressive Disorder Patients in Ethiopia: A Prospective Hospital Based Study.", "Abstract": "There is paucity of data on prevalence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and adherence and clinical outcomes of antidepressants.

One of the reasons for this situation depends on the fact that professionals cannot rely on clear rules of conduct. Indeed, in psychiatry, it may happen that a judge considers negligent a conduct not punishable by another court, as in cases of hospital discharges. In order to solve this situation, on March 8, 2017 Italian legislators issued the law no. 24. First of all, it establishes that health care providers must follow the guidelines that will be published on the website of the High Institute of Health, with the exception of specific situations on a given case. In the absence of such guidelines, the good clinical-care practice should be applied (Art. 5). In addition, if health care providers have met the guidelines as appropriate to the specific case or, in their absence, to the good clinical-care practice, they cannot be sentenced for homicide or accidental injury due to incapacity (Art. 6). The authors analyze these provisions with the aim of verifying if they are adequate to achieve the purposes that the legislator had set: 1) protecting patients\u2019 health; 2) offering psychiatrists clear rules of conduct in order to reduce the risk of being subjected to criminal proceedings. The first objective is endangered by the fact that the law does not indicate the level of the evidences trustworthiness necessary to make them be considered as binding guidelines. The second objective appears unreachable. In fact, the law under consideration states that only incapacity is not punishable, whereas homicide and lesions caused by negligence or imprudence, even if slight, are considered a crime. In the psychiatric field, more than in other branches of medicine, charges normally concern negligence or imprudence. Therefore, this reform does not limit at all psychiatrists\u2019 criminal liability."}, {"Title": "Perinatal Care for Women with Spinal Cord Injuries: A Collaborative Workshop for Consensus on Care in Canada.", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> In North America, there are currently no clearly defined standards of care for women with spinal cord injury (SCI) during the perinatal periods of preconception, pregnancy, labour/delivery, and postpartum.

Item-total score correlation coefficients were high and very high, respectively, for child and parent forms indicating a statistical significance. As for construct validity, one factor was maintained for each form and was found to be consistent with the original form of the scale. As for concurrent validity, the child form of the scale showed significant correlation with Children's Depression Inventory, while the parent form showed significant correlation with Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Parent Form.\nIt was found that the Turkish version of DSM-5 Level 2 Anger Scale could be utilized as a valid and reliable tool both in clinical practice and for research purposes."}, {"Title": "Confidence in Procedural Skills before and after a Two-Year Master's Programme in Family Medicine in Gezira State, Sudan.", "Abstract": "Many postgraduate family medicine training programmes have been developed to meet the worldwide dire need for practicing family physicians. This study was conducted in Gezira state of Sudan in a \"before-and-after\" design in the period of 2010-2012 with the aim to assess improvements in candidates' confidence in performing certain clinical skills. A self-evaluation questionnaire was used with a five-grade scale (1-5) to assess candidates' confidence in performing 46 clinical skills. A group of 108 participants responded for both the \"before\" and the \"after\" questionnaire: the response rate was 91% (before) and 90% (after). In general, a positive progress trend was detected. The mean skill value for all skills was 3.23 (before) and 3.93 (after) with a mean increase of 21.7% (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Male students scored constantly higher than females both before and after completing the master's programme, while females showed a higher percentage in progress. Scores in certain medical disciplines were higher than others. However, disciplines with low scores in the beginning, such as psychiatry and ophthalmology, showed the highest progress percentage. The results show a significant increase in confidence in performing procedural skills designed in the curriculum of the GFMP master's programme."}, {"Title": "Lithium, Stress, and Resilience in Bipolar Disorder: Deciphering this key homeostatic synaptic plasticity regulator.", "Abstract": "Lithium is the lightest metal and the only mood stabilizer that has been used for over half a century for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD). As a small ion, lithium is omnipresent, and consequently, its molecular mechanisms and targets are widespread. Currently, lithium is a crucial pharmacotherapy for the treatment of acute mood episodes, prophylactic therapy, and suicide prevention in BD. Besides, lithium blood level is the most widely used biomarker in clinical psychiatry. The concept of stress in BD characterizes short- and long-term deleterious effects at multiple levels (from genes to behaviors) and the ability to establish homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to either prevent or reverse these effects. Within this concept, lithium has consistently shown anti-stress effects, by normalizing components across several levels associated with BD-induced impairments in cellular resilience and plasticity.\nA literature search for biomarkers associated with lithium effects at multiple targets, with a particular focus on those related to clinical outcomes was performed. An extensive search of the published literature using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar was performed. Example search terms included lithium, plasticity, stress, efficacy, and neuroimaging. Articles determined by the author to focus on lithium's impact on neural plasticity markers (central and periphery) and clinical outcomes were examined in greater depth. Relevant papers were evaluated, selected and included in this review.\nLithium induces neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in a wide range of preclinical and translational models. Lithium's neurotrophic effects are related to the enhancement of cellular proliferation, differentiation, growth, and regeneration, whereas its neuroprotective effects limit the progression of neuronal atrophy or cell death following the onset of BD. Lithium's neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects seem most pronounced in the presence of pathology, which again supports its pivotal role as an active homeostatic regulator.\nFew studies associated with clinical outcomes. Due to space limitations, the author was unable to detail all findings, in special those originated from preclinical studies.\nThese results support a potential role for biomarkers involved in neuroprotection and activation of plasticity pathways in lithium's clinical response. Evidence supporting this model comes from results evaluating macroscopic and microscopic brain structure as well neurochemical findings in vivo from cellular to sub-synaptic (molecules and intracellular signaling) compartments using central and peripheral biomarkers. Challenges to precisely decipher lithium's biological mechanisms involved in its therapeutic profile include the complex nature of the illness and clinical subtypes, family history and comorbid conditions. In the context of personalized medicine, it is necessary to validate predictive biomarkers of response to lithium by designing longitudinal clinical studies during mood episodes and associated clinical dimensions in BD."}, {"Title": "The therapeutic discharge II: An approach to documentation in the setting of feigned suicidal ideation.", "Abstract": "The therapeutic discharge of patients assessed as misrepresenting suicidal ideation, though in the best interests of the patient, physician, and health care system, is an inherently risk-assuming action. The rationale and conduct of the therapeutic discharge has been written on previously. Here, we propose a method of documenting the therapeutic discharge in a way that is useful and teachable.\nAfter describing some other types of note-writing that can be needed in the care of deceptive patients, we describe an approach to each of the major sections of an initial consultation/encounter note as it applies to the therapeutic discharge.\nEach note section is handled slightly differently than ordinarily. The history of present illness follows the sequence, rather than the re-organization of the information obtained. The past medical history requires and reflects a more granular chart review than is usually warranted. The mental status exam is less cross-sectional than usual. The assessment and plan incorporates several components that reflect a reasoning process specific to the therapeutic discharge.\nWhile labor-intensive, the documentation approach advocated for and exemplified here reaffirms aspects of one's identity as a physician, ensures responsible execution of a risk-involving decision, and potentially simplifies subsequent patient encounters."}, {"Title": "Neuropsychiatry in Demyelination Disease: Using Depression as a Prodrome for Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.", "Abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks its own insulating myelin sheaths covering the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. MS patients show signs of mental illness via emotional blunting, liability, apathy, depression, irritability, and psychosis. Many psychiatrists have noted that the symptomatology of mood disorder is very similar to early signs of MS. The mechanism behind the relationship of depression with MS is not entirely understood at this point. However, through advancements in medical imaging techniques, there are now some leading explanations. One main explanation suggests that depression and memory disturbance are correlated to the demyelination within the limbic system caused by MS. Studies showed that following a diagnosis of MS, the rates of depression are significantly elevated in patients. Several studies noted a lifetime prevalence of major depression in >50% of MS patients. These studies foreshadow that depression is a very important clinical harbinger of active demyelination in MS patients. Depression may hint at which subgroup or stage the MS patient is in, without needing to wait for dramatic physical signs or symptoms to commence. Future physicians may be able to use depression as a prodrome for multiple sclerosis and narrow down the prognosis of their patients, treating them earlier."}, {"Title": "[\"FESZEK\": A program based on cognitive behavioral therapy in Vadaskert Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hospital and Outpatient Clinic].", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common child psychiatric disorder, which occurs in approximately 4-6% of school-aged children.

The newest version of DSM, the 5th, - even though it is based on extensive professional consensus - is criticized numerously, as it could not exceed the cathegorical and simplistic syndromathologic approach. For this reason it seems to be indispensable to implement a new diagnostic system, which includes the modern neurosience researches and the clinical observations together. The main goal in the creation of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) model was to implement a new research criteria system which facilitates to understand the biologic and psychosocial background of mental illnesses. In our article we present the most important characteristics of RDoC system, in particular its dimensionality, its behaviour- based and neuro-bio-social approach, futhermore its developmental perspective.

Cognitive performance was assessed through the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP). Psychosocial functioning was evaluated using the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and the General Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Homocysteine and CRP levels were determined. Separate analyses were performed by gender. Partial correlations were calculated to test for associations between biomarkers and cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess factors predicting cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Covariates were: age, education, duration of illness, hospital admissions, depressive symptoms, tobacco consumption, and BMI.\nA better performance was noted in women in delayed verbal learning (p = 0.010), along with better occupational functioning (p = 0.027) and greater leisure time impairment (p = 0.034). In men, CRP and homocysteine levels were associated with psychosocial dysfunction (interpersonal relationships and financial functioning, respectively). In women, CRP levels correlated with cognitive performance (SCIP total raw score, immediate and delayed verbal learning, and verbal fluency). CRP was a predictor of cognitive performance in women only.\nThe choice of the cognitive scale and covariates and the lack of a control group may be the main limitations.\nA gender difference was found in biomarker modulation of cognition and psychosocial functioning.

Another worrying trend from India is that the average age of initiation of alcohol use has reduced from 28 years during the 1980s to 17 years in 2007. In India, alcohol abuse also amounts to huge annual losses due to alcohol-related problems in workplaces.

Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations.

Despite an increasing scientific effort to find the pathophysiological explanations for the disease, the neurobiological links remain unclear. A large amount of evidence suggests that pathological processes taking place in early embryonic neurodevelopment might be responsible for later manifestation of autistic symptoms. This dysfunctional development includes altered maturation/differentiation processes, disturbances in cell-cell communication, and an unbalanced ratio between certain neuronal populations. All those processes are highly dependent on the interconnectivity and three-dimensional organizations of the brain. Moreover, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the complex neurobiology of autism spectrum disorders, valid disease models are pivotal. Induced pluripotent stem cells could potentially help to elucidate the complex mechanisms of the disease and lead to the development of more effective individualized treatment. The induced pluripotent stem cells approach allows comparison between the development of various cellular phenotypes generated from cell lines of patients and healthy individuals. A newly advanced organoid technology makes it possible to create three-dimensional in\u00a0vitro models of brain development and structural interconnectivity, based on induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the respective individuals.

In psychiatry, reproducibility issues are compounded because the complex behavioral syndromes make many disorders challenging to model. We develop translatable tasks that quantitatively measure psychiatry-relevant behaviors across species. The behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) was designed to analyze exploratory behaviors, which are altered in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), especially during mania episodes. We have repeatedly assessed the behavioral effects of reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the BPM using a DAT knockdown (KD) mouse line (~10% normal expression). DAT KD mice exhibit a profile in the BPM consistent with acutely manic BD patients in the human version of the task-hyperactivity, increased exploratory behavior, and reduced spatial d (Perry et al., 2009). We collected data from multiple DAT KD BPM experiments in our laboratory to assess the reproducibility of behavioral outcomes across experiments. The four outcomes analyzed were: 1) transitions (amount of locomotor activity); 2) rearings (exploratory activity); 3) holepokes (exploratory activity); and 4) spatial d (geometrical pattern of locomotor activity). By comparing DAT KD mice to wildtype (WT) littermates in every experiment, we calculated effect sizes for each of the four outcomes and then calculated a mean effect size using a random effects model. DAT KD mice exhibited robust, reproducible changes in each of the four outcomes, including increased transitions, rearings, and holepokes, and reduced spatial d, vs. WT littermates. Our results demonstrate that the DAT KD mouse line in the BPM is a consistent, reproducible model of mania-relevant behaviors.

As expected, \"noninvasive measures\" (e.g., the use of a \"soft room,\" observation in seclusion) were better accepted by patients than \"invasive measures\" (e.g., mechanical restraint, forced medication). Forced medication and mechanical restraint were less well accepted than involuntary hospitalization, seclusion, or video surveillance. The retrospective understanding of coercive measures increased over the course of treatment. In addition, patients rated a number of options for reducing coercion on the wards, particularly music or exercises. A large subgroup indicated they would like to discuss future admissions with the staff."}, {"Title": "Association of serum brain derived neurotropic factor with duration of drug-naive period and positive-negative symptom scores in drug naive schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the serum brain derived neurotropic factor (BNDF) levels of patients with schizophrenia who had never received an antipsychotic treatment with those of a control group. Also, to analyze the relationship between the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) scores and BDNF levels of the patients during the period they were drug-naive.\nThe sample of the study comprised patients who presentedto the Psychiatry Clinic and were admitted after a distinctive schizophrenia diagnosis was made in accordance with the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis classification and who were not using and never had any antipsychotic medicine. A total of 160 participants were included in the study, 80 of whom had schizophrenia patients and 80 constituted the age- and sex-matched healthy control group. Before the start of the treatment, the serum samples to be checked for the BDNF levels were collected from the patients.\nThe difference between the average BDNF levels of the groups were statistically significant (t = -5.25; p\u02c2.001). An analysis as to whether there was a relation between the BDNF levels and the drug-na\u00efve duration indicated no correlations. An examination of the relationship between PANSS scores and BDNF levels of the patients yielded no correlations.\nSerum BDNF levels seem to be one of the indicators of schizophrenia and its progress; nevertheless, we still do not have sufficient information about this neurotropic factor.

This study aimed to evaluate multiple intelligences profiles of children with ADHD in comparison with non-ADHD.\nThis cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was done on 50 children of 6-13 years old in two groups of with and without ADHD. Children with ADHD were referred to Clinics of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, in 2014. Samples were selected based on clinical interview (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV and parent-teacher strengths and difficulties questionnaire), which was done by psychiatrist and psychologist. Raven intelligence quotient (IQ) test was used, and the findings were compared to the results of multiple intelligences test. Data analysis was done using a multivariate analysis of covariance using SPSS20 software.\nComparing the profiles of multiple intelligence among two groups, there are more kinds of multiple intelligences in control group than ADHD group, a difference which has been more significant in logical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligence (<i>P</i> < 0.05). There was no significant difference with the other kinds of multiple intelligences in two groups (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The IQ average score in the control group and ADHD group was 102.42 \u00b1 16.26 and 96.72 \u00b1 16.06, respectively, that reveals the negative effect of ADHD on IQ average value. There was an insignificance relationship between linguistic and naturalist intelligence (<i>P</i> > 0.05). However, in other kinds of multiple intelligences, direct and significant relationships were observed (<i>P</i> < 0.05).\nSince the levels of IQ (Raven test) and MI in control group were more significant than ADHD group, ADHD is likely to be associated with logical-mathematical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal profiles."}, {"Title": "Telemental Health Care, an Effective Alternative to Conventional Mental Care: a Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Due to the high costs of conventional mental health care, there has been a rise in the application of web-based technologies in recent years, i.e., telemental health care.

Past, present & future.", "Abstract": "The classical psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide and mescaline, were used extensively in psychiatry before they were placed in Schedule I of the UN Convention on Drugs in 1967. Experimentation and clinical trials undertaken prior to legal sanction suggest that they are not helpful for those with established psychotic disorders and should be avoided in those liable to develop them. However, those with so-called 'psychoneurotic' disorders sometimes benefited considerably from their tendency to 'loosen' otherwise fixed, maladaptive patterns of cognition and behaviour, particularly when given in a supportive, therapeutic setting. Pre-prohibition studies in this area were sub-optimal, although a recent systematic review in unipolar mood disorder and a meta-analysis in alcoholism have both suggested efficacy. The incidence of serious adverse events appears to be low. Since 2006, there have been several pilot trials and randomised controlled trials using psychedelics (mostly psilocybin) in various non-psychotic psychiatric disorders. These have provided encouraging results that provide initial evidence of safety and efficacy, however the regulatory and legal hurdles to licensing psychedelics as medicines are formidable. This paper summarises clinical trials using psychedelics pre and post prohibition, discusses the methodological challenges of performing good quality trials in this area and considers a strategic approach to the legal and regulatory barriers to licensing psychedelics as a treatment in mainstream psychiatry.

The present paper aims to provide a short review of the basic principles of the antipsychiatric movement, and to discuss the atitudes of its most important theorists. The authors searched recent literature, as well as drawing upon some of the basic antipsychiatric texts. Antipsychiatry dates from 18<sup>th</sup> century, and as an international movement it emerged during the 1960s as part of the historic tumult of the period rather than as a result of the evolution of scientific ideas. During that period psychiatrists began to see heredity as the cause of mental illness, became pessimistic about restoring patients to sanity, and adopted essentially a custodial approach to care that included use of physical restraints. Radical attitudes of antipsychiatry gave a significant incentive to review psychiatric theory and practice, especially with protecting the rights of mental patients and giving importance not only to somatic, but mental, social and spiritual sides of human existence. But, at the same time, they led to unwarranted attacks on psychiatry as a medical discipline, encouraged different views of its stigmatization and in a certain measure affected the weakening of social awareness about the importance of medical and institutional care for the mentally ill persons. After the 1970s, the antipsychiatry movement became increasingly less influential, due in particular to the rejection of its politicized and reductionistic understanding of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Stigmatization of Mentally Ill Patients through Media.", "Abstract": "The stigmatization of mentally ill patients has negative labelling, marginalization and exclusion of people simply because they have a mental illness. Stigma has negative consequences for the individual and his family, as well as for psychiatry as a profession and the entire community. Stigma weakens the mentally ill, reinforcing a sense of alienation, which has negative consequences on the course of the illness. The media can inform the public about the treatment of mentally ill patients by conveying correct information, who can then act positively towards improving the quality of treatment. Stigma and self-stigma create a feeling of low self-esteem and fear of rejection, due to which mentally ill people avoid the media and very rarely speak publicly about their illness. The realization of information rights is very delicate and it is reflected through two opposing but substantially equivalent human rights: 1. Right to information, 2. Right to privacy. Which of the two rights will get advantage depends on the circumstances of each case and journalism ethics. The relationship of psychiatry with the media and especially the media with psychiatry must be extremely correct and professional, based on facts, and not on the pursuit of media sensationalism. The media can significantly reduce the current level of stigmatization of the mentally ill by adequate and correct reports, and thereby facilitate their role in family and society. Lack of knowledge and understanding of mental illness contributes to stigmatization. Education of patients, their families and journalists is crucial if we want to better understand people with mental illness and reduce stigma."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry between Glorification and Stigmatization.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, stigma means negative marking of the person only because s(he) has a diagnosis of mental disease, and usually this refers to schizophrenia. Stigmatization is related to prejudice, i.e. negative attitudes that are deeply rooted on false beliefs that schizophrenia cannot be treated. In principle, stigma is caused by combination of ignorance and fear which represents the basis of the creation of entrenched myths and prejudice. From a historical point of view, schizophrenia as a disease remains for public, one of the medical areas that are related to fear, a sense of discomfort, prejudice and avoidance. A combination of difficult mental disease, discrimination and stigmatization can be devastating for mentally disabled patients. Throughout history, stigma played significant role in patient's emotional and social isolation from other people deepening their suffering. A common consequence of stigma is discrimination which represents violation of basic human rights. Mentally disabled patients are often unjustifiably seen as dangerous, incapable, irresponsible which causes their isolation, homelessness and economic collapse. Thereby, possibilities for normal life, work, treatment, rehabilitation and social integration are decreased."}, {"Title": "Stigma of psychiatric diseases and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The aim of this review is evaluate stigma seen among people suffering from psychiatric disorders.

The first example concerns the direct marketing of pharmaceutical products to consumers in the US, the second the use of psychology in semi-post-Cold War Korea, and the third the persisting authority of psychology in the treatment of the developmentally delayed. While these instances are not innately connected, looking at these as part of the process by which the authoritative knowledge is established will help us understand, albeit partially, the mechanism by which mental illness penetrates our lives as truth, and how this regime of truth is supported by the authority of psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, what Foucault calls the 'psy-function,' reinforcing the medicalisation of our lives."}, {"Title": "From distress to disease: a critique of the medicalisation of possession in DSM-5.", "Abstract": "This paper critiques the category of possession-form dissociative identity disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) published in 2013 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM as an index of psychiatry pathologises possession by categorising it as a form of dissociative identity disorder. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork, this paper argues that such a pathologisation medicalises possession, which is understood as a non-pathological condition in other contexts such as by those individuals who manifest possession at a temple in Kerala, South India. Through medicalising and further by creating distinctions between acceptable and pathological possession, the DSM converts a form of distress into a disease. This has both conceptual and pragmatic implications. The temple therefore becomes reduced to a culturally acceptable site for the manifestation of a mental illness in a form that is culturally available and possession is explained solely through a biomedical framework, denying alternative conceptualisations and theories which inform possession. By focussing on the DSM-5 classification of possession and the limitations of such a classification, this paper seeks to posit an alternative conceptualisation of possession by engaging with three primary areas which are significant in the DSM categorisation of possession: the DSM's conceptualisation of self in the singular, the distinction between pathological and non-pathological forms of possession, and the limitations of the DSM's equation of the condition of possession with the manifestation of possession. Finally, the paper briefly highlights alternative conceptualisations of possession, which emerged from the perspective of those seeking to heal possession at the Chottanikkara temple."}, {"Title": "Of sacraments, sacramentals and anthropology: is anthropological explanation sacramental?", "Abstract": "This paper suggests that what is usually called a cultural misunderstanding of biomedical disease categories may be construed as a biomedical and anthropological misunderstanding of cultural categories. This is premised on the fact that anthropology often functions as an intimate double and handmaiden of biomedicine, in so far as it refuses to countenance the possibility of theurgic aetiologies in the realm of what is called 'mental illness'. Such a refusal displaces native explanations of divine or demonic agency to human agency. This is best elucidated by examining the unexamined religious beliefs of Anglo-European anthropology, which appears to be the terra firma of its emic explanatory categories. The paper attempts to demonstrate this by proposing that while native explanations are akin to the sacraments, anthropological explanations are akin to sacramentals (holy water, the cross, the scapular, verbal blessings). While the sacraments, like divine agency, operate ex opere operato, the sacramentals are dependent on the disposition of the recipient and on the good offices of the church, as they operate ex opere operantis ecclesiae (from the work of the working church), as well as ex opere operantis (from the work of the working one). If the sacraments are efficacious as it is work done by Christ alone, and akin to work done by the possessing agent, sacramentals are efficacious as they are also dependent on human agency. In other words, anthropological explanations are, at best, 'sacramental' as they replace emic theurgic explanations by etic ones, where human agency in the form of the priest, the institution of the church, and the lay person who is the recipient of divine dispensation, also have a role to play; or, as is often the case, the only role to play."}, {"Title": "The concept of chronotypes and its clinical importance for depressive disorders.", "Abstract": "Chronobiology and chronobiological research deal with time-dependent physiological processes and behavioral correlates as well as their adaptation to environmental conditions.

The managers amongst us want to regulate and institutionalize all aspects of practice. In opposition, many clinicians resist the relentless march toward the safety of uniformity travel alongside managerial imposition of regulations. Psychotherapy supervision's method of a close apprenticeship relationship between supervisor and trainee and its focus on the process and ethics of professional interaction stand at the humanistic core of what is otherwise becoming an increasingly mechanistic model of providing care to persons with mental illness. Our commentary picks up on these themes as it reviews the work by Mehrtens <i>et al</i> about strengthening awareness of liability in psychiatry residency training programs. We argue that the practice of psychiatry is overburdened by documentation requirements. In imposing further record-keeping on psychotherapy supervision, we lose much more than we gain. We recommend that the supervisory process focus on the characterological virtues essential to functioning as an ethical therapist. We also argue that self-protective rules place restraints on possibilities for imaginative insights and innovations in psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "Current Risk Management Practices in Psychotherapy Supervision.", "Abstract": "Psychotherapy competence is a core skill for psychiatry residents, and psychotherapy supervision is a time-honored approach to teaching this skill.

We report the psychometric validation of a novel, multi-dimensional instrument based on Amartya Sen's capability approach intended for use as an outcome measure in mental health research.\nThe Oxford Capabilities Questionnaire for Mental Health (OxCAP-MH) is a 16-item self-complete capability measure that covers multiple domains of functioning and welfare. Data for validation of the instrument were collected through a national randomised controlled trial of community treatment orders for patients with psychosis. Complete OxCAP-MH data were available for 172 participants. Internal consistency was established with Cronbach's alpha; an interclass correlation coefficient was used to assess test-retest reliability in a\u00a0sub-sample (N\u2009=\u200950) tested one week apart. Construct validity was established by comparing OxCAP-MH total scores with established instruments of illness severity and functioning: EuroQol (EQ-5D), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Objective Social Outcomes Index (SIX). Sensitivity was established by calculating standard error of measurement using distributional methods.\nThe OxCAP-MH showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.79) and test-retest reliability (ICC\u2009=\u20090.86).

Objective A team-based psychiatric consultation approach was tested in an inpatient hospital setting. This is the first study that examines 30-day readmission rate with this approach. Methods In this quality improvement study, 164 patients received a team-based psychiatric consultation that included daily meetings during the weekdays between psychiatrists and hospitalists and 436 received care of treatment-as-usual or traditional consultation-liaison services. Results Overall 30-day readmission rate was not significantly different between intervention and nonintervention groups. However, in subgroups with high risk of mortality or severe illness, the intervention group had a 0% 30-day readmission rate for both high risk of mortality and severe illness subgroups, while the nonintervention group's readmission rate was 5% for high risk of mortality group and 3% for severely ill patients. Annual hospital cost saving is estimated between a quarter million and 1.5 million dollars for these subgroups.

Targeted Training in Illness Management is a group-based self-management training approach which targets serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus concurrently. This analysis examines data from a randomized controlled trial of Targeted Training in Illness Management intervention to examine the impact of comorbid anxiety on baseline psychiatric symptomatology and diabetic control, and on longitudinal treatment outcomes. Methods We conducted secondary analyses on data from a prospective, 60-week, randomized controlled trial testing Targeted Training in Illness Management versus treatment as usual in 200 individuals with serious mental illness and diabetes. Primary outcomes included measures related to serious mental illness symptoms, functional status, general health status, and diabetes control. Measures were compared between those participants with anxiety disorders versus those without anxiety at baseline as well as over time using linear mixed effects analyses. Results Forty seven percent of the participants had one or more anxiety disorders. At baseline, those with an anxiety diagnosis had higher illness severity, depressive, and other psychiatric symptomatology and disability. Diabetic control (HbA1c) was not significantly different at baseline. In the longitudinal analyses, no significant mean slope differences over time (group-by-time interaction effect) between those with anxiety diagnoses and those without in treatment as usual group were found for primary outcomes. Within the Targeted Training in Illness Management arm, those with anxiety disorders had significantly greater improvement in mental health functioning. Those with anxiety comorbidity in the Targeted Training in Illness Management group demonstrated significantly lower HbA1c levels compared to no anxiety comorbidity and also demonstrated a greater improvement in HbA1c over the first 30 weeks compared to those without anxiety comorbidity. Conclusion Comorbid anxiety in serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus population is associated with increased psychiatric symptomatology and greater disability. Individuals from this population appear to experience greater improvement in functioning from baseline with the Targeted Training in Illness Management intervention. Anxiety comorbidity in the serious mental illness and type II diabetes mellitus population does not appear to have a negative impact on diabetic control.

The post-session questionnaire investigated among the students if: they thought having been able to appropriately manage the simulated ASA; they found the SBME medium more fitted for training than real situations; they found that the SBME session faithfully reproduced a real ASA; and the session was found useful for transmitting the skills on correct management of ASA. The average level of stress induced by the training was assessed using a numerical rating scale (0-10).\nTwo hundred and six of the 219 students completed the pre-session questionnaire (63% females; response rate 96.7%). A hundred and thirty four students played the scenario and completed the post-session questionnaire (65.7% females; response rate 100%). 38.3% of the responders reported having previously experienced a situation of ASA in their practice, and 31.1% deemed to know the good practices rules for managing an ASA. In post-session, 29.9% of the participants considered that they appropriately managed the ASA, 79.9% deemed that the role-playing session faithfully reproduced a real ASA, and 97% deemed that this SBME was more fitted and useful than a real clinical situation to improve their medical skills. Bivariate analyses revealed that the post-session responses and level of stress were not influenced by previous experience on ASA, previous participation in a SBME role-playing session, or thinking to know the rules for managing ASAs.\nSBME role-playing training appears a promising, realistic, and well-accepted method for teaching the management of ASA."}, {"Title": "QT Prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, and Psychotropic Medications: A 5-Year Update.", "Abstract": "Some psychotropic medications have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and QT prolongation, especially in those with medical illness, and are linked to lethal ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). In 2013, we published a review of QT prolongation, TdP, and psychotropic medications.\nWe provide an update over the past 5 years on the specific concerns most relevant to clinicians who see medically ill patients.\nIn this nonsystematic review, we aimed to carefully and intensively identify new articles by utilizing a structured PubMed search from 2012-present.\nQT prolongation remains an imperfect, though well-established marker of risk for TdP. Among antidepressant medications, citalopram does appear to prolong the QT interval more than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, though the clinical significance of this prolongation remains unclear. Escitalopram appears to prolong the QT interval to a lesser extent. Haloperidol carries a risk for QT prolongation, but the assertion that intravenous haloperidol is inherently riskier may be confounded by its primary use in medically ill populations. Among atypical antipsychotic agents, ziprasidone-and possibly iloperidone-is associated with the greatest QT prolongation, whereas aripiprazole appears safest from this standpoint.\nThe evidence for clinically meaningful QT prolongation with most classes of psychiatric agents remains minimal. The most important risk-reducing intervention clinicians can make is undertaking a careful analysis of other QT risk factors when prescribing psychiatric medications."}, {"Title": "[Applied Value of Electroencephalogram in Assessment of Mild Psychiatry Impairment].", "Abstract": "To explore the applied value of electroencephalogram \uff08EEG\uff09 in assessment of psychiatric impairment among patients with mental disorders due to traumatic brain injury.\nAccording to the ICD-10, a total of 271 subjects were enrolled and assessed with the criterion of mental disorders due to traumatic brain injury.

Based on Danish national registers, we linked information on paternal use of SSRIs, ASD diagnosed in children and a range of potential confounders. The children whose fathers used SSRIs during the last 3 months prior to conception were identified as the exposed. Cox regression model was used to estimate the HR for ASD in children.\nCompared with unexposed children, the exposed had a 1.62-fold higher risk of ASD (95% CI 1.33 to 1.96) and the risk attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, especially fathers' psychiatric conditions (HR=1.43, 95%\u2009CI 1.18 to 1.74).

Results A current psychiatric comorbidity has been found in 75% (less in cancer patients), mainly adjustment and anxiety (45%), mood (22%), and organic mental disorders (12%). The functioning score (Global Assessment of Functioning) was 59.4 and was especially low in patients suffering from unclear medical conditions. The performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) amounted to 1.63 and was especially high in patients suffering from orthopedic conditions, infections, and cancer. Each patient received on average of 2.26 (SD\u2009=\u20092.81) contacts and 111 minutes (SD\u2009=\u2009160) of total treatment time.

Diagnoses are still based on observation, the clinical history, and an outmoded diagnostic system that stresses the historic goal of disease specificity. Psychotropic drugs are still based on molecular targets developed decades ago, with no increase in efficacy. Numerous biomarkers have been proposed, but none have the requisite degree of sensitivity and specificity, and therefore have no usefulness in the clinic. The obvious lack of progress in psychiatry needs exploration.\nThe historical goals of psychiatry are reviewed, including parity with medicine, a focus on diagnostic reliability rather than validity, and an emphasis on reductionism at the expense of socioeconomic issues. Data are used from Thomas Picketty and others to argue that our failure to advance clinical care may rest in part on the rise in social and economic inequality that began in the 1970s, and in part on our inability to move beyond the medical model of specificity of disease and treatment.\nIt is demonstrated herein that the historical goal of specificity of disease and treatment has not only impeded the advance of diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, but, in combination with a rapid increase in socioeconomic inequality, has led to poorer outcomes and rising mortality rates in a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression.\nIt is proposed that Psychiatry should recognize the fact of socioeconomic inequality and its effects on mental disorders.

Psychiatry residents (n = 35) completed surveys to ascertain their baseline experience, knowledge, and proficiency with the ECT procedure. They were then block-randomized to receive either a didactic ECT curriculum (non-SIM) or one augmented by simulation training (SIM). Three months post-completion of the two types of instruction, all residents were re-administered the surveys and a procedural post-assessment.\nThe median number of ECTs performed prior to the study was similar between the two groups (SIM group = 3, non-SIM group = 4.) The SIM group showed significant improvement on pre- and post- survey theoretical knowledge scores: 51% (95% CI = 41 to 61%) and 69% (95% CI = 64 to 74%), respectively, p = .02; this difference was not significant in the non-SIM group, p = .2. Improvement between pre- and post- proficiency scores were seen in the SIM group: 22% (95% CI = 13 to 32%) and 51% (95% CI = 53 to 59%), p < .001 while the effect was less pronounced in the non-SIM group. Inter-rater agreement for the proficiency assessment was excellent: k, = .9.\nResidents showed significant improvement in knowledge, comfort, and skills following ECT simulation training. With the proposed curriculum, residents would receive comprehensive education not only in the theory behind ECT but also in procedural skills.

The national shortage of psychiatrists coupled with an increasing mental illness burden necessitates development of creative interdisciplinary collaboration. The authors report on an interdisciplinary, resident-to-resident didactic series assessing whether such a model could improve internal medicine resident comfort with managing psychiatric illness on inpatient medical wards.\nInternal medicine residents were assessed regarding their comfort level with managing certain common inpatient psychiatric presentations before and after the delivery of a teaching curriculum designed and delivered by psychiatry residents.\nInternal medicine residents' overall confidence with identifying and managing common psychiatric problems on inpatient medical wards improved. Comfort level with managing depression and demoralization and determining decisional capacity both improved to a statistically significant degree.\nCollaborative, interdisciplinary care is complex and its benefits can be difficult to assess. Data from this study showed that interdisciplinary teaching at the resident level has the potential to be an effective means for building collaboration and can lead to a subjective improvement in comfort managing common inpatient psychiatric presentations on medical wards.

The authors note they were able to replicate identification rates in a larger version of the original Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. However, they also report lower identification accuracies when using historical neuroimaging acquisitions with low spatial and temporal resolution. The authors suggest that their results indicate connectomes derived from historical imaging data may be similar across individuals, to the extent that this connectome-based approach may be inappropriate for precision psychiatry and the goal of drawing inferences based on subject-level data. Here we note that the authors did not take into account factors affecting data quality and hence identification rates, independent of whether a low spatiotemporal resolution acquisition or a high spatiotemporal resolution acquisition is used. Specifically, we show here that the amount of data collected per subject and in-scanner motion are the predominant factors influencing identification rates, not the spatiotemporal resolution of the acquisition. To do this, we investigated identification rates in the HCP dataset as a function of the amount of data and motion. Using a dataset from the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), we investigated the impact of multiband versus non-multiband imaging parameters; that is, high spatiotemporal resolution versus low spatiotemporal resolution acquisitions. We show scan length and motion affect identification, whereas the imaging protocol does not affect these rates. Our results suggest that motion and amount of data per subject are the primary factors impacting individual connectivity profiles, but that within these constraints, individual differences in the connectome are readily observable."}, {"Title": "Metasynthesis: An Original Method to Synthesize Qualitative Literature in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Metasynthesis-the systematic review and integration of findings from qualitative studies-is an emerging technique in medical research that can use many different methods.

Only in recent years have controlled and peer-reviewed preclinical and clinical studies lent support to (\u00b1)-MDMA's hypothesized clinical utility. However, the clinical utility of (\u00b1)-MDMA is potentially mitigated by a range of demonstrated adverse effects. One potential solution could lie in the individual S(+) and R(-) enantiomers that comprise (\u00b1)-MDMA. Individual enantiomers of racemic compounds have been employed in psychiatry to improve a drug's therapeutic index. Although no research has explored the individual effects of either S(+)-MDMA or R(-)-MDMA in humans in a controlled manner, preclinical research has examined similarities and differences between the two molecules and the racemic compound. This review addresses information related to the pharmacodynamics, neurotoxicity, physiological effects, and behavioral effects of S(+)-MDMA and R(-)-MDMA that might guide preclinical and clinical research. The current preclinical evidence suggests that R(-)-MDMA may provide an improved therapeutic index, maintaining the therapeutic effects of (\u00b1)-MDMA with a reduced side effect profile, and that future investigations should investigate the therapeutic potential of R(-)-MDMA."}, {"Title": "The Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ-2) - Translation and Reliability of a Hebrew Version.", "Abstract": "The Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire 2 (VMIQ-2) assesses individuals' ability to imagine themselves performing 12 simple motor tasks, from three perspectives: internal visual imagery, external visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery.

The authors, Eric J. Engstrom and Kenneth S. Kendler, challenge the so-called neo-Kraepelinian view of Kraepelin and argue that the true, historical Kraepelin was far more inclined towards scientific psychology, less reductionist and brain-centric, and more skeptical nosologically than his later followers apparently believe. Commenting upon this paper, Rael D. Strous, Annette A. Opler, and Lewis A. Opler do not question these claims per se, but rather recall and emphasize historical facts that the paper regrettably omitted: Kraepelin's avid promotion of degeneration theory, eugenics, racism, and anti-Semitism as well as his mentoring of several of the most prominent Nazi-collaborating psychiatrists. Strous, Opler and Opler go on to suggest that it is now time for psychiatry to unburden itself of any iconic indebtedness to Kraepelin. The authors of the current paper agree, and propose to replace Kraepelin with the psychiatrist Karl Jaspers, MD (1883-1969) as the proper iconic founder of present-day and future psychiatry. Acknowledging our debt to Jaspers can usher in a fully humanistic and scientific psychiatric practice that can flourish as a medical discipline that is respectful of and of service to patients, beneficial for research, multiperspectival and methodologically pluralistic."}, {"Title": "A quantitative approach to neuropsychiatry: The why and the how.", "Abstract": "The current nosology of neuropsychiatric disorders allows for a pragmatic approach to treatment choice, regulation and clinical research.

We review the unmet needs of patients with SZ and the scientific rationale behind the DBS targets proposed in the literature in order to guide future development of DBS to treat this vulnerable patient population. SZ remains a devastating disorder despite treatment. Relapse, untreated psychosis, intolerable side effects and the lack of effective treatment for negative and cognitive symptoms contribute to poor outcome. Novel therapeutic interventions are needed to treat SZ and DBS is emerging as a potential intervention. Convergent genetic, pharmacological and neuroimaging evidence implicating neuropathology associated with psychosis is consistent with SZ being a circuit disorder amenable to striatal modulation with DBS. Many of the DBS targets proposed in the literature may modulate striatal dysregulation. Additional targets are considered for treating tardive dyskinesia and negative and cognitive symptoms. A need is identified for the concurrent development of neurophysiological biomarkers relevant to SZ pathology in order to inform DBS targeting. Finally, we discuss the current clinical trials of DBS for SZ, and their ethical considerations. We conclude that patients with severe symptoms despite treatment must have the capacity to consent for a DBS clinical trial in which risks can be estimated, but benefit is not known.

The authors review critiques of Kraepelin's work published in his lifetime by Adolf Meyer, Friedrich Jolly, Eugenio Tanzi, Alfred Hoche, Karl Jaspers, and Willy Hellpach. These critics made six major points. First, Kraepelin's new categories of dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity were too broad and too heterogeneous. Second, his emphasis on course of illness was misconceived, as the same disease can result in brief episodes or a chronic course. Third, the success of his system was based on the quality of his textbooks and his academic esteem, rather than on empirical findings. Fourth, his focus on symptoms and signs led to neglect of the whole patient and his or her life story. Fifth, Kraepelin's early emphasis on experimental psychology did not bear the expected fruit. Sixth, Kraepelin was committed to the application of the medical disease model. However, because of the many-to-many relationship between brain pathology and psychiatric symptoms, true natural disease entities may not exist in psychiatry. Most of the ongoing debates about Kraepelin's nosology have roots in these earlier discussions and would be enriched by a deeper appreciation of their historical contexts. As authoritative as Kraepelin was, and remains today, his was only one among many voices, and attention to them would be well repaid by a deeper understanding of the fundamental conceptual challenges in our field.

If the mini-CEX is to be used in multidisciplinary contexts, then validity evidence should be gathered in similar settings. The purpose of this study was to gather further validity evidence for the mini-CEX but in a broader context. Specifically we sought to explore the effects of discipline and rater type on mini-CEX scores, internal structure, and the relationship between mini-CEXs and OSCEs in a multidisciplinary context.\nDuring clerkship, medical students completed eight different rotations (family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency, anesthesiology and obstetrics and gynecology). During each rotation, mini-CEX forms and a written examination were completed. Two multidisciplinary OSCEs (in Clerkship Year 3 and start of Year 4) assessed clinical skills. The reliability of the mini-CEX was assessed using Generalizability analyses. To assess the influence of discipline and rater type, mean scores were analyzed using a factorial analysis of variance. The total mini-CEX score was correlated to scores from the students' respective OSCEs and corresponding written exams.\nEighty-two students met inclusion criteria for a total of 781 ratings (average of 9.82 mini-CEX forms per student).

The mini-CEX was not correlated with the written examination scores for any of the disciplines.\nOur results provide conflicting findings for validity evidence for the mini-CEX. Mini-CEX ratings were correlated to multidisciplinary OSCEs but not written examinations, supporting the validity argument. However, reliability of the mini-CEX was low to moderate, and error accounted for the greatest amount of variability in scores. There was variation in scores due to discipline and resident raters gave higher scores than faculty.

Notes on the notion of cerebral plasticity.", "Abstract": "\"Psychoanalysis versus psychiatry\" and \"unconscious versus brain\" are classic oppositions between different perspectives on the human being and mental suffering. This article draws on certain elements of this discussion and reflects on how new ideas about the brain and biology favor closer interaction between psychoanalysis and the neurosciences. These questions are redefined through the notion of cerebral plasticity, by which the brain is open to interaction with the social environment and the influence of psychoanalytical therapy. Conceiving of the brain as a plastic organ allows for the possibility of interchange between psychoanalysis and the neurosciences."}, {"Title": "The ritualization of life and the expansion of psy cultures in Colombia: the local and the barely transnational.", "Abstract": "This paper exposes the status of psy cultures in Colombia. It is shown how the country's official health system has transformed biomedical psychiatry and cognitive behavioral psychology into the dominant and hegemonic psy culture. However, far from being hegemonic, as presented, both serve to foster and sustain the existence of different \"religious\" or \"sacred\" therapeutic systems and practices that denaturalize human existential and psychological suffering. In general, the latter are ritual practices with a strong spiritualist, anti-materialist and antimonist content, that deal freely with a wide range of cosmologies, beliefs and symbols, even including the same concepts and practices of a biomedical origin. The result is a hyper-ritualization of daily life in the country."}, {"Title": "Effects of cross-rearing with social peers on myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex of a mouse model with autism spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, poor communication skills, and repetitive/restrictive behaviors. Recent studies have indicated that early rehabilitative intervention can alleviate the symptoms of individuals with ASD. However, it remains unknown whether rehabilitative intervention can restore brain structures such as myelin, which generally shows abnormalities in individuals with ASD. Therefore, in the present study, we used a mouse model of ASD (BTBR mice) that demonstrated asocial behaviors and hypomyelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to investigate whether interaction with social peers (C57BL/6J mice) has an effect on myelination. We found that housing with C57BL/6J mice after weaning through adulthood increased the myelin thickness in mPFC, but not in the motor cortex, of BTBR mice. There was no effect of cross-rearing with C57BL/6J mice on axon diameter in mPFC of BTBR mice. This finding suggests that early rehabilitative intervention may alleviate myelin abnormalities in mPFC as well as clinical symptoms in individuals with ASD."}, {"Title": "Systematic review into factors associated with the recruitment crisis in psychiatry in the UK: students', trainees' and consultants' views.", "Abstract": "<b>Aims and method</b> To review the literature to examine the factors that may be affecting recruitment into psychiatry in the UK.

The population in all studies comprised of 1879 psychiatrists, 6733 students and 220 746 trainees. About 4-7% of students opt for a career in psychiatry. Enrichment activities helped to attract students more towards psychiatry than just total time spent in the specialty. Job content in terms of the lack of scientific basis, poor prognosis and stigma towards psychiatry, work-related stress and problems with training jobs were common barriers highlighted among students and trainees, affecting recruitment. Job satisfaction and family-friendly status of psychiatry was rated highly by students, with lifestyle factors appearing to be important for trainees who tend to choose psychiatry. <b>Clinical implications</b> Negative attitudes and stigma towards psychiatry continue to persist.

Because the onset of most psychiatric diseases is in late adolescence or early adulthood, testing minors could lead to early identification that may prevent or delay the development of these disorders. However, due to their complex aetiology, psychiatric genetic testing does not provide the immediate medical benefits that current guidelines require for testing minors. While several authors have argued non-medical benefits may play a crucial role in favour of predictive testing for other conditions, little research has explored such a role in psychiatric disorders. This paper outlines the potential non-medical benefits and harms of psychiatric genetic testing in minors in order to consider whether the non-medical benefits could ever make such testing appropriate. Five non-medical themes arise in the literature: psychological impacts, autonomy/self-determination, implications of the biomedical approach, use of financial and intellectual resources, and discrimination. Non-medical benefits were prominent in all of them, suggesting that psychiatric genetic testing in minors may be appropriate in some circumstances. Further research needs to empirically assess these potential non-medical benefits, incorporate minors in the debate, and include normative reflection to evaluate the very purposes and motivations of psychiatric genetic testing in minors."}, {"Title": "Insulin Signaling Deficiency Produces Immobility in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> That Models Diminished Motivation States in Man and Responds to Antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Defects in insulin signaling have been reported in schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, which also share certain negative symptoms such as avolition, anhedonia, and apathy. These symptoms reflect diminished motivational states, which have been modeled in rodents as increased immobility in the forced swimming test. We have discovered that loss-of-function mutations in the insulin receptor (<i>daf-2</i>) and syntaxin (<i>unc-64</i>) genes in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, brief food deprivation, and exposure to DMSO produce immobility and avolition in non-dauer adults. The animals remain responsive to external stimuli; however, they fail to forage and will remain in place for >12 days or until they die. Their immobility can be prevented with drugs used to treat depression and schizophrenia and that reduce immobility in the forced swimming test. This includes amitriptyline, amoxapine, clozapine, and olanzapine, but not benzodiazepines and haloperidol. Recovery experiments confirm that immobility is induced and maintained by excessive signaling via serotonergic and muscarinic cholinergic pathways. The immobility response described here represents a potential protophenotype for avolition/anhedonia in man.

Centers for partnering are selected on the basis of need, receptivity to change, and participants' fluency in English. Ukrainian physicians attend month-long observerships in Toronto, and biannual teaching visits are conducted by Canadian clinicians.\nOver 5 years, 7 teaching visits have taken place, and 20 physicians have trained at SickKids Hospital in Toronto. Six Ukrainian children's hospitals are now collaborating with UPFP. New surgical procedures have been introduced, such as endoscopic ventriculostomy and corpus callosotomy.

This article presents the results of two studies: a systematic review of the literature on treatment of sleep disturbances in adult trauma-affected refugees and a study of the role of sleep disturbances in the PTSD symptom structure. Study 1, the literature review, identified five studies on treatment of sleep disturbances: four studies were on pharmacological treatment and one study on music therapy. The identified studies had small sample sizes and few carried out statistical analysis. It was not possible from the available literature to recommend any specific treatment of sleep disturbances. In Study 2, a clinical sample of 752 refugees, fulfilling criteria for PTSD and enrolled in treatment at the Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry, Denmark, completed the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) before and after treatment. To determine item discrimination, the data was tested with a Rasch model. 99.1% reported trouble sleeping and 98.7% reported recurrent nightmares. The Rasch analysis displayed fit residuals of 0.05 for trouble sleeping and -1.16 for nightmares, indicating sufficient discrimination. Trouble sleeping and nightmares proved important parts of the HTQ response structure.

Occasionally, this violence involves acts of aggression between patients in emergency psychiatric units or hospital wards. Such events can lead to the development or worsening of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nTo establish the context, we first examined the epidemiology data concerning posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric patients who were frequently exposed to assaults. Secondly, we examined the issue of sexual and physical assaults between patients receiving treatment in a psychiatric ward. In this context, we studied possible occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder associated with exposure to assaults of this kind.\nIn certain cases, potentially traumatic exposure to violence was unknown to the medical staff or not taken into consideration. This would induce a risk of later development of posttraumatic stress disorder that would not be treated during the stay in psychiatry.\nTo date, few scientific studies have focused on the proportion of patients assaulted by other patients during treatment in a psychiatric ward and the subsequent development of peritraumatic reactions and/or posttraumatic stress disorder associated with these assaults.

Although tele-psychiatry, via real-time videoconferencing (VC), is used to provide consultative services in areas that lack psychiatrists, there are a paucity of studies on the use of VC for psychiatric emergencies. We examine how VC matters for patient involvement and professional practice in the first Norwegian emergency tele-psychiatric service. Through a decentralised on-call system, psychiatrists are accessible 24/7 by telephone and VC for patients and nurses in regional psychiatry centres. Based on 29 interviews with patients, psychiatrists and nurses, this article addresses how participation is fostered by VC, and how it may change the social dynamics of therapeutic emergency encounters. We identified four contributions of the 'video-mediated gaze' in the therapeutic encounter including those of the: (1) immediacy of assessment, (2) increased transparency, (3) sense of access to the 'real' expert, and (4) fostering of the patient's 'voice' in therapeutic decisions. These VC inflections of the therapeutic encounter are a mix of the pragmatic (1 and 2) and the symbolic (3 and 4), assembling in these contexts to foster patient-centeredness.

We also expected the WHODAS 2.0 to show high 2-week test-retest reliability, convergent validity (correlations approximately .50 to .90 with other self-report measures of functional impairment), that it would differentiate between patients with and without exhaustion disorder, and that it would respond to change in primary symptom domain.\nWe administered the 12-item self-report WHODAS 2.0 online to patients with anxiety and stress disorders (N=160) enrolled in clinical trials of cognitive behavior therapy, and analyzed psychometric properties within a classical test theory framework. Scores were compared with well-established symptom and disability measures, and sensitivity to change was studied from pretreatment to posttreatment assessment.\nThe 12-item self-report WHODAS 2.0 showed high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=.83-.92), high 2-week test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=.83), adequate construct validity, and was sensitive to change. We found preliminary evidence for a three-factorial structure, but one strong factor accounted for a clear majority of the variance.\nWe conclude that the 12-item self-report WHODAS 2.0 is a psychometrically sound instrument when administered online to individuals with anxiety and stress disorders, but that it is probably fruitful to also report the three subfactors to facilitate comparisons between studies.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT02540317; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02540317 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6vQEdYAem); Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02314065; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02314065 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6vQEjlUU8)."}, {"Title": "High-Stakes Collaborative Testing: Why Not?", "Abstract": "Phenomenon: Studies of high-stakes collaborative testing remain sparse, especially in medical education. We explored high-stakes collaborative testing in medical education, looking specifically at the experiences of students in established and newly formed teams.\nThird-year psychiatry students at 5 medical schools across 6 sites participated, with 4 participating as established team sites and 2 as comparison team sites. For the collaborative test, we used the National Board of Medical Examiners Psychiatry subject test, administering it via a 2-stage process. Students at all sites were randomly selected to participate in a focus group, with 8-10 students per site (N = 49). We also examined quantitative data for additional triangulation.\nStudents described a range of heightened emotions around the collaborative test yet perceived it as valuable regardless if they were in established or newly formed teams. Students described learning about the subject matter, themselves, others, and interpersonal dynamics during collaborative testing. Triangulation of these results via quantitative data supported these themes. Insights: Despite student concerns, high-stakes collaborative tests may be both valuable and feasible. The data suggest that high-stakes tests (tests of learning or summative evaluation) could also become tests for learning or formative evaluation.

According to national survey data, depressive disorders affect about 9% of the North American population (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005). A review of psychological distress and depression across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease indicates that the prevalence of depression in ESKD is reported to be about four times that of the general population and it is associated with adverse outcomes including low quality-of-life ratings, graft failure, and death after renal transplantation (Zalai, Szeifert, & Novak, 2012). At St. Michael\u2019s Hospital (SMH), patients on hemodialysis (HD) requiring psychiatry consultation had traditionally been referred to a dedicated outpatient psychiatrist. This presented challenges around access to psychiatry assessment and follow-up, as patients were reluctant to attend appointments outside of HD visits. The team recognized these challenges and addressed them through the introduction of the Medical Psychiatry NP (MP NP) role, as the point-of-care consultant in HD."}, {"Title": "40\u00a0Hz Auditory Steady-State Response: The Impact of Handedness and Gender.", "Abstract": "The 40\u00a0Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is a periodic response to a periodic stimulation. Its sources are located in the primary auditory cortex and the asymmetry of the planum temporale has previously been associated with hand preference and gender-related differences; thus subject's handedness and gender could potentially influence ASSRs. Nevertheless, electrophysiological studies of ASSRs are mainly dominated by right-handed participants and the observed findings can only be generalized to the right-handed populations. However, for a potential use of 40\u00a0Hz ASSR as a translational biomarker of neuropsychiatric disorders, it is important to investigate the response in association to handedness and gender. We included an equal number of left-handed and right-handed males and females and recorded EEG responses during left-ear, right-ear and both ears stimulation. The results of the study suggest that the processing of 40\u00a0Hz auditory stimulation depends on the subjects' gender and handedness: significantly lower phase-locking and strength of 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs were observed in left-handed females as compared to left-handed males, but right-handers did not differ in 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs. Our observation of the opposite impact of gender in the examined handedness groups stresses the importance of careful consideration of handedness and gender factors when evaluating the determinants of inter individual variability of 40\u00a0Hz ASSRs. This finding is of particular importance for clinical studies in psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Response to letter to the editor from Dr Rahman Shiri: The challenging topic of suicide across occupational groups.", "Abstract": "We thank Dr Rahman Shiri (1) for his careful reading of our systematic review and meta-analysis on suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (2). Our paper had the objective of providing a pooled effect size of suicide for this occupational group. Suicide is a crucial issue in public and occupational health. Suicide has a multifactorial etiology and recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have pointed out the role of occupational exposures, mainly psychosocial work stressors, as risk factors for suicide (3, 4). Suicide is a very rare event in the general population and still more seldom in the working population. Indeed, unemployed and economically inactive people have a higher risk of suicide compared to employed people (5, 6). However, the total number of suicides is greater in the employed population than among the economically inactive or unemployed (6). Shiri's letter (1) questioned several aspects of our review and meta-analysis. One comment related to the single reference database used in our review and a suggestion that our review could not be considered to be systematic. The review was based on Medline because our main interest was in quantitative epidemiologic studies. This is the largest database for biomedical literature and we would argue the most pertinent. Furthermore, we checked the reference lists of the most recent papers and literature reviews, and Shiri did not report any paper that was missing. No review, whether searching one or more databases, can expect to be totally exhaustive. There may always be missing studies, especially if we consider grey literature. Thus we assert that our review was systematic, while acknowledging that it may not be perfectly comprehensive. Shiri suggested an absence of quality assessment of the studies included in our meta-analysis. First, quality was considered in the context of our comments in the discussion section. Second, as suggested by Rothman et al (7), quality assessment was replaced by regression analyses of the effect of each quality item (study characteristics, ie, study design, effect measure, reference group, and adjustment). Third, because most studies included in this review were based on objective data (census, administrative, or register data), they were free of many of the sources of bias that exist in studies where information on exposure and outcome must be collected from participants. Consequently, many of the items related to quality were not pertinent, such as response and follow-up rates, coverage and representativeness of the sample, selection, etc. Contrary to what Shiri suggested, all study designs can be informative in this topic because all of them are able to provide an unbiased estimate of the effect size. In addition, the prospective and case-control studies may have shortcomings. For example, we excluded five studies including three prospective and case-control studies in the sensibility analysis because the group of interest was defined on the basis of the exposure to chemicals (pesticides) rather than job title. Our choice to retain the least adjusted models was justified because aggregated data were used for the meta-analysis. Therefore, unless all included studies adjusted for the same covariates measured in the same way, adjusted estimates cannot be meaningfully provided in an aggregate data meta-analysis. In addition, as the objective was above all descriptive and not etiological or explanatory, and as it is the norm in the exploration of social inequalities in health (8), the results from the least (gender- and age-) adjusted models were in line with the objective. Indeed, including more adjustment variables could lead to overadjustment as they may be intermediate variables on the causal pathways between occupation and suicide. Our strategy was in line with previous meta-analyses on similar topics (9-11). Consequently, we would argue that our results are not likely to be largely due to confounding, contrary to the comment by Shiri. Indeed, the study of the contribution of underlying factors in explaining social inequalities in health outcomes is a fully-fledged topic of research (12-15), but this is relevant research to conduct after demonstrating that inequalities exist between social or occupational groups. Several of Shiri's comments were about statistical aspects of our analyses. First, it was suggested that we did not correctly extract the confidence intervals for the estimates of several studies. We disagree. We used the STATA metan suite of commands using log-transformed effect sizes and standard errors. Our figure 1 and the values of effect sizes and confidence intervals were provided by STATA, this explains why there may be small differences in these values compared with the results published in some studies. Using log-transformed effect sizes and confidence intervals, the analysis provided the same results. Second, our subgroup comparison was based on subsamples that were independent. As not all studies provided information for these subgroups, each subgroup was treated as a unit of analysis. This strategy allows the use of all relevant subgroups and comparisons between them (16). Third, we were also criticized for the use of random-effects models. Random-effects models are generally more plausible for meta-analysis based on studies from the published literature, because the fixed-effect model assumed that the entire corpus of literature has been obtained, ie, that every study has been or ever will be written on the topic has been included, which is an implausible assumption. We also assumed differences in effect size between studies and between subgroups, and the use of random-effects models was consistent with such an assumption. However, random-effects models produce wider confidence intervals compared to fixed-effect models (16). These models are thus more conservative, making our results all the more robust. One of Shiri's comments related to the reference group used in the studies for the comparison of agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. Although we reported that the studies using a specific occupational group as reference group provided a higher effect size than the studies using other reference groups, we did not explicitly recognize and state in the paper that the results for Japan were based on two studies using a specific occupational group as reference; we concede that this may explain why we found a much more elevated effect size for Japan. Shiri's results (1) allow to conclude that the difference between Japan and the other geographic areas could be explained by the choice of reference group-we are grateful to him for raising this point. However, we would note that the effect size of suicide was still elevated and significant for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers even after this change in the reference group for these two studies. Nevertheless, the choice of the optimal reference group is not obvious. If we consider the general population as the reference group, as unemployed people and economically inactive people (including people who may not be working due to illness or disability) are part of it and have a higher risk of suicide than employed people, the effect size provided by the nine studies using the general population as the reference is likely to be underestimated, which may contribute to an underestimation of the observed effect size of suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers in our study. The comparison was made in our paper with the other occupational groups (ie, the working population except the group of interest) as the reference, which was used by nine other studies, but this did not allow to determine the exact rank of the group of interest in the occupational hierarchy. Another relevant choice would have been to retain the group with the lowest suicide risk (for example, the high-skilled occupational group) as the reference, which would have led to a much higher effect size of suicide for agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers. To conclude, as statistical power in detecting differences between subgroups may be low in subgroup analyses and meta-regression, the absence of significant results according to subgroups found in our results cannot be interpreted as evidence that the effect size is the same across subgroups. Consequently, our meta-analysis reporting a significant excess of risk of suicide among agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers may also be a good incentive for more research among this group of workers to (i) confirm this observed excess of risk using differing methodological approaches to meta-analysis and (ii) explore the potential differences within this group and the underlying factors that may explain this excess of risk.

The attitude of medical students towards psychiatry was measured by Attitude toward Psychiatry - 30 (ATP-30). The collected Data were analyzed by SPSS version-20 using independent samples t-test plus bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. The level of significance was determined at 95% confidence interval.\nMedical students who did not take psychiatry clinical rotation had a higher ATP-30 mean score 55.52(\u00b115.2) indicating positive attitude towards psychiatry than those who completed psychiatry clinical rotation (mean= 49.75 \u00b110.67). Female medical students had significantly more positive attitude towards psychiatry than males (OR=9.23, 95% CI: 2.32; 36.76). Medical students who did not take psychiatry clinical rotation had more positive attitude towards psychiatry than students who completed the psychiatry clinical rotation (OR=7.58, 95% CI: 2.02; 28.37). Subjective experience of mental illness and reported family history of mental illness significantly predicted positive attitude toward psychiatry.\nThe findings suggest that doing psychiatry rotation might have affected the attitude of medical students towards psychiatry.

Residents and faculty had differing perspectives on 'shift work' and transitions of care and on resident decision-making as elements of ownership.\nThis study expanded and enriched the definition of patient care ownership. There were more similarities than differences across groups, a\u00a0reassuring finding for those concerned about a\u00a0decreasing understanding of ownership in trainees.

All participants completed the Hwa-byung Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), Reaction Inventory (RI), and Aggression Questionnaire (AQ). Chi-square tests and a one-way analysis of variance with Games-Howell post-hoc tests were used to compare demographic variables and scores.\nA binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine risk factors for hwa-byung. Scores in the hwa-byung group were higher than those in the depression group for the HDRS; BDI; GDS; trait anger STAXI subscale (trait anger temperament and trait anger reaction); state anger and anger expression STAXI subscales (anger-in, anger-out, and anger control); physical and verbal aggression as well as anger and hostility AQ subscales; and disturbance, embarrassing circumstances, personal disrespect, and unpleasant encounters RI subscales. A binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the state anger STAXI subscale, verbal aggression and anger AQ subscales, and unpleasant encounters RI subscale were significantly associated with hwa-byung.\nElderly patients with hwa-byung had more severe anger traits and states as well as higher depression severity compared to those diagnosed with clinical depression. Excessive anger and anger reactivity to unpleasant factors may be risk factors for hwa-byung, whereas the appropriate expression (rather than suppression) of anger may decrease the risk of hwa-byung."}, {"Title": "Do Patients Want to Listen to a Diagnosis of Dementia in Korea? Preferences on Disclosing a Diagnosis of Dementia and Discussing Advance Care Planning in Elderly Patients with Memory Concerns and Their Families.", "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to investigate preferences regarding the disclosure of a dementia diagnosis and advance care planning (ACP) in patients with memory complaints and their families.\nA total of 98 patients who visited the department of psychiatry at a tertiary hospital with memory complaints and 62 family members completed a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included preferences on disclosure of dementia and cancer diagnosis, awareness and preferences on ACP.\nIn total, 96.9% of patients were willing to know their dementia diagnosis. There were no significant differences in preferences between the diagnosis of cancer and dementia. Only 24.7% of patients and 45.8% of family members have heard of ACP. However, 82.8% of patients agreed on the necessity of ACP under the current condition. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger patients were more likely to agree with necessity for ACP under the current condition.\nIn Korea, patients with memory complaints and their family members strongly favored a disclosure of dementia diagnosis. The majority of participants also agreed on the necessity of ACP. More active involvement of patients is needed in treatment decisions and care planning in cases of dementia as well as other life-threatening illnesses."}, {"Title": "Understanding forensic psychiatry in healthcare practices and collaboration between legal nurse consultants and physicians.", "Abstract": "In 2000, the Institute of Medicine stunned many professionals with their published report that noted the vast number of deaths that occur each year in hospitals across the United States which reach as many as 98,000. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the healthcare arena faces litigious issues regularly, with some specialties budgets being significantly impacted by the cost of maintaining liability insurance. Legal Nurse Consultants and forensic physicians working in tandem but who work independently from treating clinicians can carry out forensic independent medical examinations (IME). This can help to assess the validity of malpractice claims, including issues of causation and degree of injuries claimed due to the incident(s) and recommend treatment strategies where appropriate. Reviews can cover a wide range of issues such as a person's past or current testamentary capacity, a prisoner or an accused person's mental health and/or mental impairment where necessary sending them for more assessment or treatment outside prison.

First, we discuss the conceptualization of mental hygiene in the 1940s and its role as a tool for the legitimization of dictatorship, revealing the involvement of orthodox Catholicism and its links with moral and racial hygiene. Second, we assess the transformation of mental hygiene during the 1950s towards modernization and a stronger linkage with the dominant trends of contemporary psychiatry without ever leaving the ideological background of Catholicism. For this purpose, we will focus on analysis of the activities of the Mental Hygiene Week held in Barcelona in 1954 and on the creation in 1955 of the National Board of Psychiatric Care, which took on mental hygiene as one of its functions. This paper shows the close relationship of mental hygiene during the early years of Francoism with the political principles of the Dictatorship. The 1940s witnessed the deployment of a harsh discourse in which mental hygiene was a tool for the (moral and spiritual) education of the Spanish people in the political principles of the \"New State\", pathologizing political dissent and ideologically purifying the country. In the 1950s, Francoist mental hygiene underwent a process of aggiornamento marked by international political events following the defeat of fascism in World War II, advancing a project for (authoritarian) modernization in an international context already directed towards mental health."}, {"Title": "Christian psychopathology: psychiatry and knowledge for the sake of salvation in the early years of Francoism.", "Abstract": "After World War II came to an end, General Franco's regime attempted to step aside from the defeated fascist states by emphasizing its Catholic character. The change of image culminated in 1947 with the establishment of Spain as a Catholic State by means of the Law of Succession. This process generated the national catholic ideology, which became, during the first decades of the dictatorship, the hegemonic instrument for the transformation of Spanish society in an anti-modernizing way. Scientific activity was not excluded from these changes, and a Catholic science conveying universal values and in harmony with the faith was strongly encouraged. One example of this Catholic science was the psychiatric approach developed by Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Ibor during the first Francoist period, including the concepts of anagogy, the perfection instinct, psychagogy and, above all, anxious thymopathy and life anguish. This paper analyses the Christian background of these notions, their scientific repercussions and their social utility for the dictatorship. This paper emphasizes the consideration of these key notions of Spanish psychiatry during the First Francoism as knowledge of salvation, i.e., as conveyors of assumed eternal values in accordance with the prevailing view of Catholicism. On the other hand, it points to the functioning of these concepts as a part of the regulatory network designed and deployed by Francoism to promote submission and resignation in the Spanish population."}, {"Title": "The beginning of Francoist psychiatry: the National Neurology and Psychiatry Conference (Barcelona, 1942).", "Abstract": "While there has been some research into Francoist psychiatry, much work still needs to be done on the reorganization of the mental health profession within the new state. Held in Barcelona on 12, 13 and 14th January 1942, the National Neurology and Psychiatry Conference undoubtedly played a major role in the attempt to overthrow the dominant ideas in the field of Spanish psychiatry and displace its most influential figures. This article seeks to analyse the Conference's main organizational features and examine its most significant content, with the aim of evaluating its strategic importance in the context of both the psychiatrists' professional and scientific interests and their ideological and political concerns. Conference papers tackled issues such as neurology and psychiatry in wartime, vitamin deficiency and the nervous system, and new psychiatric treatments, including shock therapy. The Conference's marked ideological nature represented the beginning of a new professional dynamic, featuring the emergence or establishment of new leaders intent on laying the foundations of psychiatry during the early years of the Franco regime."}, {"Title": "Enhancing metabolic monitoring for children and adolescents using second-generation antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of children and adolescents using second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) has increased significantly in recent years. In this population, SGAs are used to treat mood and behavioural disorders although considered 'off-label' or not approved for these indications. Metabolic monitoring is the systematic physical health assessment of antipsychotic users utilized to detect cardiovascular and endocrine side effects and prevent adverse events such as weight gain, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia, and arrhythmias. This practice ensures safe and efficacious SGA use among children and adolescents. Despite widely available, evidence-based metabolic monitoring guidelines, rates of monitoring continue to be suboptimal; this exposes children to the unnecessary risk of developing poor cardiovascular health and long-term disease. In this discursive paper, existing approaches to metabolic monitoring as well as challenges to implementing monitoring guidelines in practice are explored. The strengths and weaknesses of providing metabolic monitoring across outpatient psychiatry, primary care, and collaborative community settings are discussed. We suggest that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to improving metabolic monitoring care for children and adolescents using SGA in all settings. However, we advocate for a pragmatic global approach to enhance safety of children and adolescents taking SGAs through collaboration among healthcare disciplines with a focus on integrating nurses as champions of metabolic monitoring."}, {"Title": "The use of psychiatry-focused simulation in undergraduate nursing education: A systematic search and review.", "Abstract": "Evidence on the use of simulation to teach psychiatry and mental health (including addiction) content is emerging, yet no summary of the implementation processes or associated outcomes exists.

Objectives were to (i)\u00a0assess the methodological quality of existing evidence on the use of simulation to teach mental health content to undergraduate nursing students, (ii) describe the operationalization of the simulations, and (iii) summarize the associated quantitative and qualitative outcomes. We conducted online database (MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, CINAHL, PsycINFO from January 2004 to October 2015) and grey literature searches. Thirty-two simulation studies were identified describing and evaluating six types of simulations (standardized patients, audio simulations, high-fidelity simulators, virtual world, multimodal, and tabletop). Overall, 2724 participants were included in the studies. Studies reflected a limited number of intervention designs, and outcomes were evaluated with qualitative and quantitative methods incorporating a variety of tools. Results indicated that simulation was effective in reducing student anxiety and improving their knowledge, empathy, communication, and confidence. The summarized qualitative findings all supported the benefit of simulation; however, more research is needed to assess the comparative effectiveness of the types of simulations. Recommendations from the findings include the development of guidelines for educators to deliver each simulation component (briefing, active simulation, debriefing).

Positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabeled ligands selective for the 18\u2009kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become the most widely used technique to assess putative neuroimmune abnormalities in vivo. Originally used to detect discrete neurotoxic damages, TSPO has generally turned into a biomarker of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation'. Psychiatric research has mostly accepted these denotations of TSPO, even if they may be inadequate and misleading under many pathological conditions. A reliable and neurobiologically meaningful diagnosis of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation' is unlikely to be achieved by the sole use of TSPO PET imaging. It is also very likely that the pathological meanings of altered TSPO binding or expression are disease-specific, and therefore, not easily generalizable across different neuropathologies or inflammatory conditions. This difficulty is intricately linked to the varying (and still ill-defined) physiological functions and cellular expression patterns of TSPO in health and disease. While altered TSPO binding or expression may indeed mirror ongoing neuroinflammatory processes in some cases, it may reflect other pathophysiological processes such as abnormalities in cell metabolism, energy production and oxidative stress in others. Hence, the increasing popularity of TSPO PET imaging has paradoxically introduced substantial uncertainty regarding the nature and meaning of neuroinflammatory processes and microglial activation in psychiatry, and likely in other neuropathological conditions as well. The ambiguity of conceiving TSPO simply as a biomarker of 'neuroinflammation' or 'microglial activation' calls for alternative interpretations and complimentary approaches. Without the latter, the ongoing scientific efforts and excitement surrounding the role of the neuroimmune system in psychiatry may not turn into therapeutic hope for affected individuals."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of NPS use in patients admitted to acute psychiatric services in Southeast Scotland: a retrospective cross-sectional analysis following public health interventions.", "Abstract": "Assess the impact of selective prohibition and seizure of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) supply on NPS use prevalence within psychiatric admissions and evaluate demographic characteristics of current NPS users.\nA 6-month retrospective cross-sectional analysis of discharge letters between 1 October 2015 and 31 March 2016.\nGeneral psychiatry inpatients and intensive home treatment team (IHTT) community patients at a psychiatric hospital in a Scottish city.\nAll participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

However, it is unclear to what extent this compulsive behavior in gambling disorder is associated with abnormal compulsivity-related neurocognitive functioning. Here, we summarize and synthesize the evidence for compulsive behavior, as assessed by compulsivity-related neurocognitive tasks, in individuals with gambling disorder compared to healthy controls (HCs). A total of 29 studies, comprising 41 task-results, were included in the systematic review; 32 datasets (n=1072 individuals with gambling disorder; n=1312 HCs) were also included in the meta-analyses, conducted for each cognitive task separately. Our meta-analyses indicate significant deficits in individuals with gambling disorder in cognitive flexibility, attentional set-shifting, and attentional bias. Overall, these findings support the idea that compulsivity-related performance deficits characterize gambling disorder. This association may provide a possible link between impairments in executive functions related to compulsive action. We discuss the practical relevance of these results, their implications for our understanding of gambling disorder and how they relate to neurobiological factors and other 'disorders of compulsivity'."}, {"Title": "Addressing Mental Health Needs of Refugees.", "Abstract": "Throughout history, refugees have alternatively been seen as entitled victims of adversity or as threats or abusers of host countries scarce resources. Within the present globalized context, ambivalent public perceptions of refugees are shattering the protective nature of the post migratory environment in refugee receiving countries. This raises new challenges for refugees' mental health and calls for systemic responses to address both pre-migratory trauma and losses and post migratory adversities. Recent evidence on the effectiveness of mental health treatment for refugees confirms the utility of trauma-focused psychotherapy and the limits of psychopharmacology for stress related disorders in this group.

The data linking hearing impairment to incident late-life depression are more mixed but suggest that diminished hearing does increase risk for depression. Behavioral mechanisms may explain these associations, such as the withdrawal of older adults from situations in which they may have difficulty hearing and communicating, which may contribute to the development of social isolation, loneliness, and consequent cognitive decline and depression. At a neural level, chronic hearing loss leads to reduced activation in central auditory pathways, resulting in compensatory increased activation in the cognitive control network, dysfunctional auditory-limbic connectivity, and deafferentation-induced atrophy in frontal brain regions. These pathologic changes decrease cognitive performance and increase depression risk by reducing cognitive reserve, increasing executive dysfunction, and disrupting normative emotion reactivity and regulation. Based on the available data and informed by this model, evidence-based suggestions are proposed for clinicians treating older adults, and a research agenda is advanced to facilitate the development of rationally designed and age-appropriate psychiatric treatments for older adults with age-related hearing loss. First and foremost, treating hearing loss should be investigated as a means of improving cognitive and depressive outcomes in well-designed studies incorporating comprehensive psychiatric assessments, randomization, objective documentation of compliance, and analyses of treatment mediators that will facilitate further therapeutic development. Multimodal neuroimaging studies integrating audiometric, neuropsychological, and clinical assessments also are needed to further evaluate the model proposed.

This study was planned to explore the factors determining patient participation in clinical trials. A random sample of 123 consenting psychiatry inpatients were provided the information and consent-form of a hypothetical clinical drug trial. They were interviewed regarding their decision, the decision maker and factors that led to the decision. Family members tended to be the decision makers when patients were females, had low-income, were from rural background or had severe illnesses. Anticipated side effects and not wanting to interfere with existing treatment were the common reasons for refusal to participate while hope of betterment of the patient and benefit to humanity were cited for consent. The educated, urban, affluent class had more awareness regarding unethical trials and tended to be mistrustful of the medical community leading to higher rates of non-participation. Those who were adherent with ongoing treatment were also unwilling to participate. The lesser educated, low-income patients and rural domicile patients on the other hand had lesser awareness regarding clinical trials, trusted doctors and were more likely to participate.

Based on available evidence, the Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (AZCERT) classification defines the risk of QT prolongation for exposure to single drugs. We aimed to investigate how combining AZCERT drug categories impacts QT duration and how relative drug exposure affects the extent of pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions.\nIn a cohort of 2558 psychiatric inpatients and outpatients, we modeled whether AZCERT class and number of coprescribed QT-prolonging drugs correlates with observed rate-corrected QT duration (QTc) while also considering age, sex, inpatient status, and other QTc-prolonging risk factors. We concurrently considered administered drug doses and pharmacokinetic interactions modulating drug clearance to calculate individual weights of relative exposure with AZCERT drugs. Because QTc duration is concentration-dependent, we estimated individual drug exposure with these drugs and included this information as weights in weighted regression analyses.\nDrugs attributing a 'known' risk for clinical consequences were associated with the largest QTc prolongations. However, the presence of at least two <i>versus</i> one QTc-prolonging drug yielded nonsignificant prolongations [exposure-weighted parameter estimates with 95% confidence intervals for 'known' risk drugs + 0.93 ms (-8.88;10.75)]. Estimates for the 'conditional' risk class increased upon refinement with relative drug exposure and co-administration of a 'known' risk drug as a further risk factor.\nThese observations indicate that indiscriminate combinations of QTc-prolonging drugs do not necessarily result in additive QTc prolongation and suggest that QT prolongation caused by drug combinations strongly depends on the nature of the combination partners and individual drug exposure. Concurrently, it stresses the value of the AZCERT classification also for the risk prediction of combination therapies with QT-prolonging drugs."}, {"Title": "The relationship of SSRI and SNRI usage with interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis in an elderly population: a case-control study.", "Abstract": "The association between interstitial lung disease (ILD) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/SNRI) has been previously described in published case reports.

Although such applications have been slow to arrive, we observe a steady evolution of the idea and anticipate emerging technologies with some optimism. To highlight critical themes and innovations in depression biomarker research, we take as our point of reference a specific research narrative. We begin with an early model of frontal-limbic dysfunction, which represents a conceptual shift from localized pathology to understanding symptoms as an emergent property of distributed networks. Over the decades, this model accommodates perspectives from neurology, psychiatry, clinical, and cognitive neuroscience, and preserves past insight as more complex methods become available. We also track the expanding mission of brain biomarker research: from the development of diagnostic tools to treatment selection algorithms, measures of neurocognitive functioning and novel targets for neuromodulation. To conclude, we draw from this particular research narrative future directions for biomarker research. We emphasize integration of measurement modalities to describe dynamic change in domain-general networks, and we speculate that a brain-based framework for psychiatric problems may dissolve classical diagnostic and disciplinary boundaries.

We present a 76-year-old woman with refractory mania who developed multiple episodes of severe hypothermia associated with several psychiatric medications including olanzapine, quetiapine, valproic acid and oxcarbazepine. These episodes resolved following discontinuation of the agents. The patient had never experienced hypothermia before, despite having been on these or similar agents for many years. With traditional treatments for mania not feasible, other medications were used to treat her including lithium, clonazepam, gabapentin and the novel protein kinase c inhibitor tamoxifen. The regimen resulted in some success and importantly, without triggering hypothermia. This case alerts clinicians to the rare side effect of hypothermia in response to various psychiatric medications, the fact that patients can suddenly develop this intolerance and suggests possible medications that may be used safely without triggering hypothermia."}, {"Title": "Primary Care Providers' Use of a Child Psychiatry Telephone Support Program.", "Abstract": "The Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) provides telephone support from mental health specialists to primary care providers (PCPs).

PCPs were asked about recent patients with mental health problems, and they were asked to describe reasons for calling or not calling MCPAP. Frequent callers were asked what sustained use; infrequent callers were asked about alternative management strategies. Comparisons were made between these groups in qualitative analysis.\nPCPs (n\u2009=\u2009993) made 6526 calls (mean\u2009=\u20096.6; median\u2009=\u20093). Factors influencing calling included: MCPAP's guidance is timely and tailored to individual scope of practice; MCPAP's ability to arrange therapy referrals exceeds PCPs' ability; providing a plan at point of care relieves anxious families; and MCPAP's assistance helps accommodate families' preference to keep mental health in primary care. Some infrequent callers had gained skills through MCPAP before 2010 and now called only for complex cases. Other reasons for infrequent calling: PCPs have other consultation sources, have fear of being asked to manage more than they are comfortable, or have misperceptions of MCPAP's offerings.\nMCPAP enhanced PCPs' ability to deliver mental health care consistent with families' preferences. PCPs applied knowledge gained from calls to subsequent patients. Promoting MCPAP components through outreach and tailoring guidance to PCPs' scope of practice may entice greater use."}, {"Title": "Analysis of the Prevalence of Mental Disorders in Psoriasis: The Relevance of Psychiatric Assessment in Dermatology.", "Abstract": "The boundary between Dermatology and Psychiatry has increasing recognition. Psoriasis is a common psychophysiological skin disease with a major impact on patient's quality of life and a paradigmatic example of a pathology in that boundary. Studies are needed to exactly point out the prevalence of specific psychopathology and mental disorders associated with psoriasis. This work intends to analyse the prevalence of psychopathology and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with psoriasis.\nA systematic review of the literature was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the \"5S\" model proposed by Haynes. From all the papers retrieved by this search, a total of 34 papers met the inclusion criteria and were then deeply analysed.\nThe most prevalent mental disorders in these patients are sleep disorders (average prevalence: 62.0%), sexual dysfunction (45.6%), personality (35.0%), anxiety (30.4%), adjustment (29.0%), depressive (27.6%) and substance-related and addictive disorders (24.8%). Other mental disorders have been less described, namely somatic symptoms and related disorders, schizophrenia and other psychoses, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.\nThis updated research shows that the prevalence of psychiatric conditions in psoriasis may range from 24% to 90%. The study of the mind-skin connection in psoriasis may improve the knowledge about psoriasis and its psychiatric comorbidities. The link between psoriasis and associated mental disorders is frequently forgotten or not considered in the clinical practice. Psychiatric disorders in patients with psoriasis may be underdiagnosed.

Operational criteria for symptomatic remission in schizophrenia have been proposed by Andreasen et al. (2005). Over the last decade, these criteria have been widely validated; however few studies have been conducted outside developed countries. Moreover, the association of symptomatic remission with functional outcome has not yet been established in developing countries including Tunisia, as there may be variability in the social and familial environment.\nTo determine the frequency and associated factors of symptomatic remission in a sample of Tunisian out-patients with schizophrenia and to explore the relationship between symptomatic remission and some indicators of social functioning.\nA cross-sectional study was carried-out on 115 out-patients with schizophrenia (87 males, 28 females, mean age=37.56\u00b110.2\u00a0years) in the psychiatry department of the university hospital in Monastir (Tunisia). Nearly all of the patients (98.26%) had been hospitalized at least once in a psychiatric unit. The last hospitalization dated back to 39 months on average (range=6\u00a0months to 16\u00a0years). Symptomatic remission was assessed by the eight core items of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). These are the items P1 \"Delusions\"; P3 \"Hallucinatory behavior\" and G9 \"Unusual thought content\" for the positive dimension, the items P2 \"Conceptual disorganization\" and G5 \"Mannerism and disorders of posture\" for the disorganization dimension and the items N1 \"Blunted affect\", N4 \"Social withdrawal\" and N6 \"Lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation\" for the negative dimension. A score of mild or less on all eight-core symptoms constitutes symptomatic remission. This symptom level should have been maintained for six months. The social functioning was assessed by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and the Social Autonomy Scale (SAS) exploring personal care, management of daily life, resource management, the relationship with the outside and the emotional life and relationships social. A multivariate analysis using a binary logistic regression was conducted with as a dependent variable \"symptomatic remission\" and as explanatory variables the associated variables with symptomatic remission in bivariate analysis with age and gender.\nThe symptomatic remission was observed in 50.4% of patients. The items corresponding to positive dimension (P1, P3 and G9) and the item P2 \"conceptual disorganization\" had a better predictive value of symptomatic remission. After multivariate analysis, the associated factors of symptomatic remission were the acute of onset (P=0.026), the low score of negative symptoms during the last hospitalization (P=0.017) and the episodic course (P<0.0001). However, age or gender of the patients, educational or socioeconomic level, psychiatric family history, age of onset, duration of untreated psychosis, number and duration of previous hospitalizations, antipsychotic treatment dosage were not associated with symptomatic remission in our sample. The mean score of the SOFAS was 48.47\u00b114.44, and the mean score of the SAS was 56.6\u00b116.84. A significant association was shown between the SOFAS score and the symptomatic remission (P<0.0001) and between the SAS score and the symptomatic remission (P<0.0001). Moreover, a significant association was found between symptomatic remission and occupational activity (P=0.03).\nThe frequency of symptomatic remission according the PANSS criteria in our sample is above the average of the reported rates in literature (30 to 60%). This can be explained by the frequency of symptomatic remission in outpatient versus inpatients, or in relation to the notion of a more favorable course of schizophrenia in developing countries, although this notion is controversial. Remitter patients had significantly an acute onset of disorders, a low score of negative symptoms during the last hospitalization and an episodic course. They also showed a significant trend for better social functioning. In fact, a significant association was shown in our sample between symptomatic remission and social functioning.

From a clinical, legal and ethical perspective, CCC continues to be a controversial practice in psychiatry, and perhaps even more so when applied to patients with severe substance use disorder (SUD). Several reasons make it controversial. The lack of consensus about the benefits of CCC and professional disagreement about what mental illness and autonomy mean in the case of SUD make it difficult to apply ethically sound clinical decision-making in CCC. Also, the medico-legal framework underlying CCC use sometimes appears to foster the use of reductionist clinical evaluation. Layered on top of these issues is how stakeholders view coercion. There is a discrepancy between clinicians' and patients' perception of coercion, which leads to clinician-patient differences on whether CCC is necessary. Moreover, the way in which the evaluation is typically carried out influences patients' perception of coercion and subsequently their motivation for participating fully in treatment. In this article, we explore the value of care ethics, often applied to care practices such as nursing, when applied to more procedural medical practices, such as decision-making regarding CCC. The care-ethical approach views decision-making as part of a dynamic care process, within which the lived experience, interpretative dialogue and promotion of dignity are core features. Embracing this new framework means a paradigm shift in when the therapeutic relationship begins, namely, investing in it occurs while conducting an evaluation for a possible CCC procedure. Unlike in current typical evaluations, early cultivation of the therapeutic relationship enables the patient to participate in the definition of his needs, reduces perceived coercion and negative emotions and enhances treatment motivation. Finally, implications of this novel approach for clinical practice are formulated and discussed."}, {"Title": "[Reliability and Validity Study of the Turkish Version of Hypomania Checklist-32-Revised].", "Abstract": "In this study, it is aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of Hypomania Checklist-32-Revised.\nThe study was carried out with 80 patients diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, 26 patients diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and 42 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder attending the out- and in-patient psychiatry departments of three university hospitals and one training hospital, and 116 healthy volunteers consisting of university students. Mean duration of illness was 15,1 years for the bipolar disorder group, and 9,3 years for the major depressive disorder group. For concurrent validity, Mood Disorder Questionnaire was used. In the statistical analysis, internal consistency coefficient, item-total score correlation coefficients, exploratory factor analysis, correlation with concurrent scale and ROC curve were calculated.\nTranslation into Turkish and back-translation into English of Hypomania Checklist-32-Revised were performed and thus the semantic harmony of the scale was obtained. In the internal consistency, Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0,914 and item-total score correlations were between 0,235-0.743. Solely the coefficient of item #23 was found as 0,110. In factor analysis, six factors were obtained but a two-factor solution representing 44,5% of the total variance was accepted and first factor represents overactivity and being expansive, second factor represents impulsivity and risky behaviors. Correlation of Hypomania Checklist-32-R with Mood Disorder Questionnaire was r=0,379.

PTSD occurs frequently after a physical trauma such as a severe hand injury. It is often not recognized and consequently untreated. Previous research has shown that 10%-40% of civilian trauma survivors experience PTSD in the first 12 months after injury. There is great urgency to identify patients in the early stage of recovery from trauma, as PTSD becomes more difficult to treat in its chronic form. Mangling hand injuries are particularly disabling because they are an integral part of our social body image. We wanted to investigate the degree of PTSD screening and the follow-up-referral procedures in all mangled hand cases at the hand clinic of a large Northwestern Trauma Center. A retrospective medical record review was conducted from January to December 2012 using an existing PTSD screen with data from the electronic medical records. We found that 40% of the patients with mangled hand injury were classified as \"at risk\" according to our PTSD screening but only 22% of those cases were referred to rehabilitation psychiatry for further evaluation and treatment. The low rate of referral for PTSD after mangled hand injury was alarming. On the basis of this, we instituted a new screening protocol for all patients with mangled hand injury using the 4-item Primary Care-PTSD screening tool and provided an informational brochure on PTSD. The investigation led to a positive change in the practice environment and workflow of the clinic.

The internal clock model complemented with the attentional gate model allows a more in-depth understanding of the perception of time. The motor representation of duration is ensured by the basal ganglia, while the cerebellum synchronizes short duration for the movement. The right prefrontal cortex seemingly intervenes in the handling of temporal information in working memory. The temporal lobe ensures the comparison of durations, especially the right lobe for the reference durations and the medial lobe for the reproduction of durations in episodic memory. During normal aging, the hypothesis of slowing of the temporal processor is evoked when noting the perception of the acceleration of the passage of time that seemingly occurs with advancing age. The various studies pertaining specifically to time cognition, albeit heterogeneous in terms of methodology, attest to the wide-ranging disturbances of this cognitive field during the course of numerous disorders, whether psychiatric - depression and schizophrenia notably - or neurological. Hence, perturbations in temporality are observed in focal brain lesions and in subcortical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or Huntington's chorea. Alzheimer's disease represents a particularly fertile field of exploration with regard to time cognition and temporality. The objectified deconstruction of temporal experience provides insights into the very processes of temporality and their nature: episodic, semantic and procedural. In addition to exploration based on elementary stimuli, one should also consider the time lived, i.e. that of the subject, to better understand cognition as it relates to time. While the temporal dimension permeates the whole cognitive field, it remains largely neglected: integration of a genuine time cognition and temporality clinic in daily practice remains to be implemented."}, {"Title": "[Death anxiety and its importance for psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Inner dealing with the question of death as well as death anxiety accompany human beings from the beginning, which is reflected by the different philosophical and religious positions.

The Access Group model provides rapid, flexible, high-volume intake for up to 20 patient referrals per day. Patients are scheduled for intake by referring hospital clinicians using an online scheduling software and can be seen within 1-3 days of hospital discharge. Access allows flexibility, easy rescheduling, and limited wait time. At intake, patients and family members participate in a structured group intake procedure from which they are scheduled for follow-up psychiatry, therapy, and social work appointments. Same-day appointments are available for urgent needs. Initial evidence suggests that the Access Group model is effective at providing rapid access to and engagement in care, and is acceptable to patients. Generalizability and funding approaches for the model are discussed."}, {"Title": "Out-of-pocket health expenditures in patients with bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: findings from a study in a psychiatry outpatient clinic in Turkey.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the amount of OOP health expenditures and their determinants in patients with bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in a psychiatry outpatient clinic of Turkey.\nThe study group was 191 patients who attended to the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic in June 2014. All patients were previously diagnosed with either 'bipolar disorder', 'anxiety disorder' or 'schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders'. The dependent variable was OOP expenditures for prescription, medical tests and examinations. Independent variables were age, gender, education, occupation, existence of social and/or private health insurance, equivalent household income and the financial resources. Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA and logistic regression methods were applied with SPSS 15.0 for analysis.\nOOP expenditures per admission were higher in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders ($8.4) than those with anxiety disorders ($4.8) (p\u2009=\u20090.02). OOP expenditures were higher in patients paying with debit ($9.8) than paying with monthly income ($6.2) (p\u2009=\u20090.04). OOP expenditures were higher in patients without social health insurance ($45.8) than others ($4.8) (p\u2009=\u20090.003). There was not a difference in OOP expenditures with respect to equivalent household income level, occupational class or education level of the patients (respectively p: 0.90, p: 0.09, p: 0.52).\nPatients who were diagnosed with 'schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders' were disadvantaged in paying significantly higher amounts for their treatment.

A citation content analysis of an influential paper.", "Abstract": "Leucht et al. in 2012 described an overview of meta-analyses of the efficacy of medication in psychiatry and general medicine, concluding that psychiatric drugs were not less efficacious than other drugs. Our goal was to explore the dissemination of this highly cited paper, which combined a thought provoking message with a series of caveats.\nWe conducted a prospectively registered citation content analysis. All papers published before June 1st citing the target paper were independently rated by two investigators. The primary outcome coded dichotomously was whether the citation was used to justify a small or modest effect observed for a given treatment. Secondary outcomes regarded mentioning any caveats when citing the target paper, the point the citation was making (treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine, others), the type of condition (psychiatric, medical or both), specific disease, treatment category and specific type. We also extracted information about the type of citing paper, financial conflict of interest (COI) declared and any industry support. The primary analysis was descriptive by tabulating the extracted variables, with numbers and percentages where appropriate. Co-authorship networks were constructed to identify possible clusters of citing authors. An exploratory univariate logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between each of a subset of pre-specified secondary outcomes and the primary outcome.\nWe identified 135 records and retrieved and analysed 120. Sixty-three (53%) quoted Leucht et al.'s paper to justify a small or modest effect observed for a given therapy, and 113 (94%) did not mention any caveats. Seventy-two (60%) used the citation to claim that treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine; 110 (91%) paper were about psychiatric conditions. Forty-one (34%) papers quoted it without pointing towards any specific treatment category, 28 (23%) were about antidepressants, 18 (15%) about antipsychotics. Forty (33%) of the citing papers included data. COIs were reported in 55 papers (46%). Univariate and multivariate regressions showed an association between a quote justifying small or modest effects and the point that treatment effectiveness in psychiatry closely resembles that in general medicine.\nOur evaluation revealed an overwhelmingly uncritical reception and seemed to indicate that beyond defending psychiatry as a discipline, the paper by Leucht et al. served to lend support and credibility to a therapeutic myth: trivial effects of mental health interventions, most often drugs, are to be expected and therefore accepted.Protocol registration: https://osf.io/9dqat/."}, {"Title": "Automated telephone interventions for problematic alcohol use in clinical and population samples: a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "The primary objective was to evaluate 6-month outcomes for brief and extensive automated telephony interventions targeting problematic alcohol use, in comparison to an assessment-only control group.

During this time, youth also transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) to Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS). This transition puts many youth at risk of disengagement from service use; however, our understanding of this transition from the perspective of youth is limited. This systematic review aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of youth experiences of transition from CAMHS to AMHS, through a qualitative thematic synthesis of the extant literature in this area.\nPublished and unpublished literature was searched using keywords targeting three subject areas: Transition, Age and Mental Health. Studies were included if they qualitatively explored the perceptions and experiences of youth who received mental health services in both CAMHS and AMHS. There were no limitations on diagnosis or age of youth. Studies examining youth with chronic physical health conditions were excluded.\nEighteen studies, representing 14 datasets and the experiences of 253 unique service-users were included. Youth experiences of moving from CAMHS and AMHS are influenced by concurrent life transitions and their individual preferences regarding autonomy and independence. Youth identified preparation, flexible transition timing, individualized transition plans, and informational continuity as positive factors during transition. Youth also valued joint working and relational continuity between CAMHS and AMHS.\nYouth experience a dramatic culture shift between CAMHS and AMHS, which can be mitigated by individualized and flexible approaches to transition. Youth have valuable perspectives to guide the intelligent design of mental health services and their perspectives should be used to inform tools to evaluate and incorporate youth perspectives into transitional service improvement.\nClinical Trial or Systematic Review Registry: PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42014013799 ."}, {"Title": "[Transitional and Adolescent Psychiatry in Austria: A Pilot Study on the Attitudes of Experts].", "Abstract": "Transitional and Adolescent Psychiatry in Austria: A Pilot Study on the Attitudes of Experts Abstract.\nThis pilot study establishes baseline data on the current situation of transitional processes in Austrian psychiatry.

Notably, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain imaging in thousands of individuals around the world have led to a range of promising findings. Extensions of such approaches are now addressing epigenetics, gene-gene epistasis, and gene-environment interactions, not only in brain structure, but also in brain function. Complementary developments in systems biology might facilitate the translation of findings from basic neuroscience and neuroimaging genomics to clinical practice.

Antecedent concepts (such as risk, factor, predisposition) have ancient roots. \"Risk factor\" began to appear in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in many industries, not just in insurance but also in finance, agriculture, and manufacturing. The term appeared in the occupational health literature in 1922. It reappeared in the 1950s in many different areas of medicine including psychiatry, surgery, cardiology, epidemiology, and aerospace medicine. Furthermore, despite the influential appearance of \"risk factor\" in a 1961 Framingham Heart Study publication, the term did not gain momentum in medicine and public health until the mid-1970s.

Each participant received a single 15-mL dose of AMP XR-OS (equivalent to 30 mg of the reference drug) under fasted conditions, a single 15-mL dose of AMP XR-OS under fed conditions, and a single dose of the reference drug under fed conditions.

The threshold requirement for establishing the defence of pathological criminal incapacity entails that the accused at the time of the commission of the offence should have suffered from a 'mental illness' or 'mental defect'. Once it is established that the accused suffered from a mental illness or mental defect at the time of the commission of the offence, an assessment is conducted to determine whether the illness or defect rendered the accused either incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of the act or of acting in accordance with such appreciation. The problem that inevitably arises during the assessment of the defence relates to the fact that the terms 'mental illness' and 'mental defect' are not defined. Mental health practitioners mainly rely on the DSM for answers, yet the DSM cautions that the disorders contained may not be wholly relevant for legal purposes. Postpartum disorders are generally classified as postpartum depression and the more serious manifestation, postpartum psychosis. Postpartum disorders were not provided for in the DSM-IV (1994) or the DSM-IV-TR (2000) as distinct mental disorders. The DSM-5 came into operation in 2013, and yet again these disorders fall outside the scope of the DSM-5. Research indicates that the mental health professional plays a vital and pivotal role in explaining these disorders and the various complexities associated with them.

The level of scientific evidence is particularly low and weak in the field of child and adolescent Psychiatry. The purpose of this article is to give an updated overview of dietary treatments in this area. We make a brief introduction about general questions, including legal aspects, and propose general practical recommendations for a proper management by the families that choose these treatments. We focus on reviewing the current state of research into dietary treatments in some childhood and juvenile psychiatric disorders, highlighting current evidence of specific treatments. The final purpose of this article is to describe the level of current evidence on dietary treatments and to provide professionals involved in the care of children and adolescents with a useful tool to help, guide and educate families about their use in order to achieve the greatest benefit to patients."}, {"Title": "[Zero citation of Russian institute publications on the psychiatry and addiction].", "Abstract": "To evaluate the zero-citation sizes.\nBased on the data of the Russian Science Citation Index the publication activity of four leading institutes in the field of Psychiatry and Addiction is analyzed.

In this study, it was aimed to investigate changing cortisol and DHEA-S levels post-eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and the relationship between treatment response and basal cortisol, and DHEA-S levels before treatment.\nThe study group comprised 40 adolescents (age, 12-18 years) with PTSD. The PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPSRI) and the blood cortisol and DHEA-S were measured with the chemiluminescence method before and after treatment. A maximum of six sessions of EMDR therapy were conducted by an EMDR level-1 trained child psychiatry resident. Treatment response was measured by the pre- to post-treatment decrease in self-reported and clinical PTSD severity.\nPre- and post-treatment DHEA-S and cortisol levels did not show any statistically significant difference. Pre-treatment CDI scores were negatively correlated with pre-treatment DHEA-S levels (r: -0.39). ROC analysis demonstrated that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio predicts treatment response at a medium level (AUC: 0.703, p: .030, sensitivity: 0.65, specificity: 0.86).\nThe results of this study suggested that the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio may predict treatment response in adolescents with PTSD receiving EMDR therapy. The biochemical parameter of HPA-axis activity appears to be an important predictor of positive clinical response in adolescent PTSD patients, and could be used in clinical practice to predict PTSD treatment in the future."}, {"Title": "Corrigendum.", "Abstract": "Corrigendum to: Carter G, Page A, Large M, et al.

Its biological basis is unknown, and its treatment unsatisfactory. Here, we review two recent areas of progress. First, the discovery of risk genes and their implications, with a focus on voltage-gated calcium channels as part of the disease process and as a drug target. Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes. One such feature is persistent mood instability, and efforts are underway to understand its mechanisms and its therapeutic potential.

Thus, we investigated this association among adults aged \u226550 years across six LMICs.\nA cross-sectional analysis using data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa) was conducted. A perceived stress score [range 0 (lowest stress) -100 (highest stress)] was computed based on two questions from the Perceived Stress Scale. Thirteen chronic conditions were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted.\n34,129 adults with a mean age of 62.4 (SD=16.0)years (52.1% females) were included. Overall, 56.6% (95% CI=55.0%-58.2%) had multimorbidity. In the adjusted model including all countries, compared with those with no chronic conditions, higher numbers of chronic conditions were significantly associated with higher stress levels, dose dependently. In a countrywide meta-analysis, multimorbidity was associated with significantly higher stress levels in all countries (especially India and Ghana) although characterized by moderate heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=54.6%). For single chronic conditions, notably high stress scores were observed for depression, stroke, and hearing problems.\nChronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with higher levels of stress in older adults in LMICs. Given that perceived stress and chronic conditions are collectively associated with worse health outcomes, low-cost, population-level integrated interventions to address stress among those with chronic conditions are urgently needed."}, {"Title": "Historical reflections on neurosyphilis based on the 1826 treatise on general paralysis in demented patients by Louis Florentin Calmeil (1798-1895).", "Abstract": "General paralysis is a neurological symptom of tertiary syphilis that was first identified in asylums as paralytic madness. The enlightened discussion of 60 clinicopathological cases provided by Louis Florentin Calmeil in his 1826 treatise greatly improved our knowledge of general paralysis. However, Calmeil was unable to relate this symptom to syphilis, although the latter was quite widespread at that time. Following a detailed reanalysis of Calmeil's observations with special attention to his clinical and demographic data, we conclude that this eminent clinician was unable to define the cause of general paralysis because his early 19th century mind was still under the influence of traditional knowledge and moral prejudices. For Calmeil, general paralysis belonged entirely to the realm of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A Deep-Dream Virtual Reality Platform for Studying Altered Perceptual Phenomenology.", "Abstract": "Altered states of consciousness, such as psychotic or pharmacologically-induced hallucinations, provide a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms underlying conscious perception. However, the phenomenological properties of these states are difficult to isolate experimentally from other, more general physiological and cognitive effects of psychoactive substances or psychopathological conditions. Thus, simulating phenomenological aspects of altered states in the absence of these other more general effects provides an important experimental tool for consciousness science and psychiatry. Here we describe such a tool, which we call the Hallucination Machine. It comprises a novel combination of two powerful technologies: deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and panoramic videos of natural scenes, viewed immersively through a head-mounted display (panoramic VR). By doing this, we are able to simulate visual hallucinatory experiences in a biologically plausible and ecologically valid way. Two experiments illustrate potential applications of the Hallucination Machine. First, we show that the system induces visual phenomenology qualitatively similar to classical psychedelics. In a second experiment, we find that simulated hallucinations do not evoke the temporal distortion commonly associated with altered states. Overall, the Hallucination Machine offers a valuable new technique for simulating altered phenomenology without directly altering the underlying neurophysiology."}, {"Title": "Impact of pharmacist intervention on influenza vaccine assessment and documentation in hospitalized psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "Results of an initiative to improve assessment and documentation of the influenza vaccination status of adult psychiatric inpatients are reported.\nA prospective quality-improvement study was conducted at a large, tertiary care academic medical center with the aim of improving compliance with the Influenza Immunization (IMM-2) quality measure, which was added to the Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting (IPFQR) program in 2015 and requires assessment and documentation of influenza vaccination status in specified groups of psychiatric inpatients. The primary objective was to improve the IMM-2 IPFQR compliance rate to 100% during the 2015-16 influenza season from a rate of 55% during the 2014-15 influenza season through pharmacist interventions; secondary objectives included analysis of types of pharmacist interventions, rates of influenza vaccination status assessment and ordering, and rates of vaccine refusal by psychiatric disease state.\nWith pharmacist interventions, the IMM-2 IPFQR compliance rate was increased to 99% during the 2015-16 influenza season. Of the 1,413 patients included in the study population, 45% (<i>n</i> = 646) were targeted for pharmacist intervention. Influenza vaccine was ordered for 61% of the study population (<i>n</i> = 867 patients), with an overall refusal rate of 74% (<i>n</i> = 642).

This study discusses whether it was his period in the Russian Empire in the years 1886 to 1891 when he worked at Dorpat University (today Tartu, Estonia) that raised his popularity in Russia. Our research shows that all of his writings which had been translated into Russian language derive from a period much later than Dorpat. Moreover, none of his students has ever reached a scientific position which would have enabled him to become a proponent of Kraepelin's ideas in Russia. Despite his stay at Dorpat was important for Kraepelin's scientific development, it had no major impact on Russian psychiatry.The later perception of Kraepelin in Russia and in the Soviet Union is quite inconsistent. At some point of time, his works on experimental psychology were appreciated, which was probably connected with the rise of reflexology in Russian and, especially, Soviet psychiatry. On the other hand, it was Kraepelin's merits in the classification of psychiatric diseases that have mainly been acknowledged."}, {"Title": "Risk of unintentional injuries in children and adolescents with ADHD and the impact of ADHD medications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "A systematic review with meta-analyses was performed to: 1) quantify the association between ADHD and risk of unintentional physical injuries in children/adolescents (\"risk analysis\"); 2) assess the effect of ADHD medications on this risk (\"medication analysis\").

For the risk analysis, studies reporting sex-controlled odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) estimating the association between ADHD and injuries were combined. Pooled ORs (28 studies, 4,055,620 individuals without and 350,938 with ADHD) and HRs (4 studies, 901,891 individuals without and 20,363 with ADHD) were 1.53 (95% CI=1.40,1.67) and 1.39 (95% CI=1.06,1.83), respectively.

This is also the case with compulsory outpatient mental health care, Community Treatment Orders (CTOs) that were introduced in England in 2008. No study has systematically investigated family involvement through the CTO process.\nWe conducted qualitative interviews with 24 family carers to ascertain their views and experiences of involvement in CTOs. The transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis that incorporated both deductive and inductive elements.\nWe found significant variation in both the type and extent of family carer involvement throughout the CTO process (initiation, recall to hospital, renewal, tribunal hearings, discharge). Some were satisfied with their level of involvement while others felt (at least partly) excluded or that they wanted to be more involved. Some wanted less involvement than what they had. From the interviews we identified key factors shaping carers' involvement. These included: perceptions of patient preference; concern over the relationship to the patient; carers' knowledge of the CTO and of the potential for carer involvement; access to and relationships with health professionals; issues of patient confidentiality; opportunities for private discussions, and; health professionals limiting involvement. These factors show that health professionals have many opportunities to facilitate, or hinder, carer involvement. The various roles attributed to carers, such 'proxy' for patient decision, 'gatekeeper' to services, 'mother' or 'expert carer', however, conflict with one another and make the overall role unclear.\nThere is a need for clarification of the expectations of carers in individual care situations, for carers to be equipped with the information they need to in order to be involved, and for services to find flexible and innovative ways of ensuring continuous, open communication. The introduction of CTOs in England has not been successful in its ambition for carer involvement."}, {"Title": "The effects of ADHD on cognitive performance.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing neurodevelopmental disorder.

The majority of measures showed a non-linear effect of age. SWM strategy and SST direction errors showed a linear effect of age. ADHD diagnosis had a statistically significant effect on performance. For all tests except SOC, ADHD produced the main effect without interaction with age.\nFor all CANTAB measures, ADHD diagnosis had a significant effect on performance and produced this effect without interaction with age in all tests except SOC, indicating that the developmental trajectories were parallel in both groups. The results indicate that cognitive performance is impaired in youth with ADHD and that CANTAB can be a valuable tool in the diagnostic assessment of ADHD."}, {"Title": "Prediction of violent crime on discharge from secure psychiatric hospitals: A clinical prediction rule (FoVOx).", "Abstract": "Current approaches to assess violence risk in secure hospitals are resource intensive, limited by accuracy and authorship bias and may have reached a performance ceiling.

Most clients are insured by Medicaid, and about 40% are adolescent mothers (pregnant and post-delivery) (The mother and infant home visiting program evaluation: early findings on the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 2015). Over a third of home-visited clients report peripartum depressive symptoms (The mother and infant home visiting program evaluation: early findings on the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 2015).

However, this is not a common practice in psychiatric genetics research. Furthermore, psychiatry researchers often generate findings that do not meet all of these criteria, yet there may be ethically compelling arguments to offer selected results. Here, we review the return of results debate in genomics research and propose that, as for genomic studies of other medical conditions, psychiatric genomics researchers should offer findings that meet the minimum criteria stated above. Additionally, if resources allow, psychiatry researchers could consider offering to return pre-specified 'clinically valuable' findings even if not medically actionable-for instance, findings that help corroborate a psychiatric diagnosis, and findings that indicate important health risks. Similarly, we propose offering 'likely clinically valuable' findings, specifically, variants of uncertain significance potentially related to a participant's symptoms. The goal of this Perspective is to initiate a discussion that can help identify optimal ways of managing the return of results from psychiatric genomics research."}, {"Title": "Effects of two different psychiatric nursing courses on nursing students' attitudes towards mental illness, perceptions of psychiatric nursing, and career choices.", "Abstract": "This quasi-experimental study was carried out to compare the attitudes towards psychiatry patients of students educated with problem-based learning and students educated with a traditional method in western Turkey. The students' perceptions of psychiatric nursing and their career choices were also evaluated. The sample consisted of 202 students; 130 were educated with a problem-based learning model and 72 were educated with a traditional method. Students educated with the problem-based learning method developed more positive attitudes towards mental illness after the psychiatric nursing course in comparison with students educated with the traditional method. Students educated with the traditional method preferred psychiatric nursing in comparison with nursing students educated with problem-based learning. It is important that the psychiatric nursing curriculum includes topics and programs that will create awareness in students regarding stigmatization of mental illness and its effects. In addition, we suggest that studies are performed to determine the perceptions of students towards psychiatric nursing and the factors that affect their career choices."}, {"Title": "The closing of forensic psychiatric hospitals in Italy: Determinants, current status and future perspectives.

Both the Provincial and Federal legislation have limited the right to medical assistance in dying (MAID) to end-of-life cases; which makes MAID inaccessible to most patients solely suffering from psychiatric illness. While some end-stage anorexia nervosa or elderly patients may meet the end-of-life criterion because of their medical comorbidities or their age (Kelly et al., 2003), repeated suicide attempts or psychotic disorganization would not qualify since they would not be seen as elements of an illness leading to a foreseeable \"natural death\" (Canada, 2016). This is in contradiction to other jurisdictions, such as Belgium and the Netherlands as well as the eligibility criteria stated in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Carter v. Canada (Supreme Court of Canada, 2015). Here we analyze three cases of patients who presented to a psychiatric emergency department and requested MAID for psychiatric reasons. While none of the patients were eligible for MAID under Canadian law, we find that their demographics match closely that of patients granted MAID for psychiatric reasons in jurisdictions where that practice is allowed. Based on these cases, we comment on potentially negative consequences that may come from decriminalizing MAID for psychiatric reasons (such as an increased assessment burden on ED staff) and potentially positive consequences (such as encouraging suffering patients who had not consulted to seek care). While it is by no means our intention to take a political or moral stand on this important issue, or to conclusively weigh the negatives and positives of allowing MAID for psychiatric reasons, we do stress the importance of an active voice for psychiatry in this ongoing public debate."}, {"Title": "Public attitudes towards involuntary admission and treatment by mental health services in Norway.", "Abstract": "The role of compulsory treatment of serious mental disorders has been the topic of ongoing public debate involving among others mental health professionals, service providers, service user advocates, relatives of service users, media commentators and politicians. However, relatively little is known about general public attitudes towards involuntary admission and compulsory treatment of people with various mental disorders. This article examines the attitudes in a representative sample of Norway's population towards the use of involuntary admission and treatment, and under which circumstances does the general public consider compulsory treatment to be justified in the Norwegian mental health care services.\nData were collected from a representative sample of the population in Norway aged 18 and older. The sample was stratified for gender, geographical region and age distribution (n=2001). The survey was performed in the months of May 2009 (n=1000) and May 2011 (n=1001), using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) by an independent polling company. All respondents were provided a general definition of coercive intervention before the interview was conducted.\nUnivariate descriptions and bivariate analyses were performed by means of cross-tabulation, analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) and comparing of group of means. Cohen's d was used as the measure for effect size.\nBetween 87% and 97% of those surveyed expressed strong or partial agreement with the use of involuntary admissions or compulsory treatment related to specified cases and situations. The majority of interviewees (56%) expressed the opinion that overall, current levels are acceptable. A further, 34% were of the opinion that current levels are too low, while only 9.9% of respondents supported a reduction in the level of involuntary treatment. Lower levels of education were associated with a more positive attitude towards involuntary admission and treatment. There was stronger support for admission to prevent suicide than the possibility of violence by the mentally ill.\nThe Norwegian adult population largely supports current legislation and practices regarding involuntary admission and compulsory treatment in the mental health services."}, {"Title": "History of lobotomy in Poland.", "Abstract": "In Poland, there were 176 cases of prefrontal leucotomy performed by Moniz's method between 1947 and 1951. There were also several cases in which alternative psychosurgical techniques were used: prefrontal topectomy by Bilikiewicz and colleagues, and prefrontal topischemia by Ziemnowicz. This article analyses the following: publications by Chor\u00f3bski, who performed lobotomy in Poland, and by Korzeniowski, who assessed its short-term results; a report by Bornsztajn, who reviewed general results of the method; and clinical research by Broszkiewicz and by Konieczy\u0144ska, who assessed Polish patients in terms of long-term results of lobotomy. Negative clinical evaluation of lobotomy led to its abandonment in Poland, a decision strengthened by a regulation that forbade lobotomy in the USSR and impacted Polish psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Medication Exposure in Highly Adherent Psychiatry Patients.", "Abstract": "Medication exposure is dependent upon many factors, the single most important being if the patient took the prescribed medication as indicated. To assess medication exposure for psychotropic and other medication classes, we enrolled 115 highly adherent psychiatry patients prescribed five or more medications. In these patients, we measured 21 psychotropic and 38 nonpsychotropic medications comprising a 59 medication multiplex assay panel. Strict enrollment criteria and reconciliation of the electronic health record medication list prior to study initiation produced a patient cohort that was adherent with 91% of their prescribed medications as determined by comparing medications detected empirically in blood to the electronic health record medication list. In addition, 13% of detected medications were not in the electronic health record medication list. We found that only 53% of detected medications were within the literature-derived reference range with 41% below and 6% above the reference range specific to each medication. When psychotropic medications were analyzed near trough-level, only sertraline was found to be within the literature-derived reference range for all patients tested. Concentrations of the remaining medications indicated extensive exposure below the reference range. This is the first study to empirically and comprehensively assess medication exposure obtained in comorbid polypharmacy patients, minimizing the important behavioral factor of adherence in the study of medication exposure. These data indicate that low medication exposure is extensive and must be considered when therapeutic issues arise, including the lack of response to medication therapy."}, {"Title": "Validity of routine clinical diagnoses in acute psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "To examine the validity of diagnoses obtained by clinicians during routine clinical examination on acute psychiatric inpatient wards.\nN=100 inpatients with a broad spectrum of major mental disorders were randomly selected in a mental hospital's department of general psychiatry. Patients were diagnosed by independent assessors within\u00a0Md = 5 (Range: 1-18) days of admission using the SCID I in order to examine the validity of the diagnoses given by the clinical staff based on routine assessments.\nThe commonly used clinical examination technique had good overall agreement with the SCID I assessments regarding primary diagnoses at the level of ICD-10 main categories (F2, F30-31, F32-F33, F4; \u03ba = 0.65). However, agreement between routine clinical diagnoses and the SCID I diagnoses tended to be low for some specific mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders) and for secondary diagnoses.\nThe validity of routine clinical diagnoses established in acute inpatient settings is limited and should be improved."}, {"Title": "Enhancing excitability of dopamine neurons promotes motivational behaviour through increased action initiation.", "Abstract": "Motivational deficits are a key symptom in multiple psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and addiction. A likely neural substrate for these motivational deficits is the brain dopamine (DA) system. In particular, DA signalling in the nucleus accumbens, which originates from DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), has been identified as a crucial substrate for effort-related and activational aspects of motivation. Unravelling how VTA DA neuronal activity relates to motivational behaviours is required to understand how motivational deficits in psychiatry can be specifically targeted. In this study, we therefore used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) in TH:Cre rats, in order to determine the effects of chemogenetic DA neuron activation on different aspects of motivational behaviour. We found that chemogenetic activation of DA neurons in the VTA, but not substantia nigra, significantly increased responding for sucrose under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. More specifically, high effort exertion was characterized by increased initiations of reward-seeking actions. This effect was dependent on effort requirements and instrumental contingencies, but was not affected by sucrose pre-feeding. Together, these findings indicate that VTA DA neuronal activation drives motivational behaviour by facilitating action initiation. With this study, we show that enhancing excitability of VTA DA neurons is a viable strategy to improve motivational behaviour."}, {"Title": "[Violent outburst from teenagers in the pediatric emergency room: Complex cases].", "Abstract": "Teenagers admitted to the emergency room for a violent attacks episode are increasingly numerous. The source of agitation is multifactorial for these teenagers, often with a complex course. They jeopardize hospital wards, which are often ill-suited for and overwhelmed during these outbursts. This study aims to identify and describe all the teenagers admitted to the hospital over 1 year for a violent outburst and discuss their management.\nRetrospective and descriptive study of teenagers admitted to the pediatric emergency department of the Nantes University Hospital for a violent outburst in 2015.\nDuring this 1-year study, 99 teenagers out of a total of 182 consultations were admitted for a violent outburst. We noted that 85% of them had a previous history of a violent outburst, 70% of them were seeing a psychologist, and 56% were followed by the child welfare services. Most of the outbursts took place at home and were hetero-aggressive. Upon arrival at the pediatric emergency ward, 90% of the teenagers had calmed down. The mean time spent in the emergency ward was 3h42min. Finally, 31% of the teenagers were hospitalized in the general pediatric unit, 14% in the children's psychiatric department, and 8% in the adult psychiatry ward.\nWe observed a high proportion of complex cases in the teenagers admitted to our emergency department for a violent outburst. These teenagers in distress, with a complex previous history, illustrated the relation between violence against themselves and their own violent behavior toward others. Developing short-stay units for a temporary isolation could be an advantageous multidisciplinary approach to allow somatic, psychological, and social evaluation of these vulnerable patients."}, {"Title": "Increasing HIV Testing in Inpatient Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "People with serious mental illness (SMI) are at elevated risk of HIV infection, but do not receive HIV tests regularly. Inpatient psychiatric admissions provide opportunities for HIV testing.\nThis study retrospectively examined the impact of three sequential interventions designed to increase HIV testing on an acute inpatient psychiatry service: (1) advocacy by an administrative champion, (2) an on-site HIV counselor, and (3) a clinician championing HIV testing.\nDemographic and HIV testing data were extracted from hospital data systems for 11,360 admissions of HIV-negative patients to an inpatient psychiatry service between 2006 and 2012. Relationships among interventions, length of stay, patient demographics, and receipt of an HIV test were examined using general estimating equation methods.\nIn the year prior to the intervention, 7.2% of psychiatric inpatients received HIV tests. After 1 year of administrative advocacy, 11.2% received tests. Following the HIV counseling intervention, 25.1% of patients were tested. After the counseling intervention ended, continued administrative and clinical advocacy was associated with further increases in testing. In the final year studied, 30.3% of patients received HIV tests. Patients with shorter inpatient stays and those of Black or Asian race/ethnicity were less likely to be tested. Further, 1.6% of HIV tests were positive.\nThree interventions of varying intensity were associated with a 5-fold increase in HIV testing on an acute inpatient psychiatry service. Nonetheless, 70% of inpatients were not tested. Continued efforts are needed to increase HIV testing in inpatient psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "[Williams-Beuren syndrome (Williams syndrome).

However, establishing the diagnosis is important, not only to find the cause of intellectual disability but to look for cardiovascular, endocrine, psychiatry, urology and other conditions, which can occur at any age in the patients' lifetime. This case report presents the story of 47-year-old woman, who was admitted with haematemesis. During her stay on the ward, in the light of the distinctive facial features, mental retardation, and social behaviour patterns, the possibility of Williams syndrome emerged. Later, the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis. This female is the oldest living patient with Williams syndrome in Hungary.

Health professionals are in a position to model health related attitudes both in the general public and patients. Medical students are an interesting group to focus upon, since they are future health professionals and correcting stigmatizing attitudes is still possible during their educational curriculum.\nThis study investigated the attitude toward mental illness in medical students at the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy. We surveyed first year students, since they have not yet received specific classes or internships in psychiatry; 322 students from the Romanian and English sections participated, representing a response rate of 94.7%. The questionnaire consisted of the Romanian and English versions of Link's Social Distance Scale towards people with mental illness scale.\nOverall, medical students had a relatively negative attitude towards people with mental illness, with moderate social distance and stereotypical attitudes. The level of personal contact with people with mental illness was correlated with positive attitudes. International students had scored lower then Romanian students on social distance toward mentally ill patients.\nMedical education can play an important role in the attitudes of students toward mental illness. Medical students have stigmatizing attitudes about mentally ill patients. Personal contact with people suffering from mental illness might contribute to a positive attitude from the medical students toward mentally ill patients."}, {"Title": "Impact of oral ketamine augmentation on hospital admissions in treatment-resistant depression and PTSD: a retrospective study.", "Abstract": "Depressive episodes are the leading cause of mental health-related hospital admissions in Australia, and 44% of those admitted have a previous history of hospitalisations for depression (Admitted patient mental health-related care: (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Aust Hospital Stat 2011-12, 2013). Despite numerous available antidepressant treatments, many patients do not respond to conventional therapy, having what is called 'treatment resistance' (Fava Biol Psychiatry 53:649-659, 2003). In recent years, ketamine has risen to prominence as an effective, rapidly acting antidepressant (Ketamine: a light in the darkness: Paleos and Ross 28-33, 2013). However, customary intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes of administration and relapse rates after cessation remain barriers to more widely adopted usage.\nThis study represents the largest retrospective review of patients receiving long-term oral ketamine for treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our purpose was to examine the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine therapy in an outpatient setting as measured by changes in hospitalisation for psychiatric episodes.\nHospital records of 37 patients who received oral ketamine treatment were reviewed to compare the number and duration of psychiatric hospital admissions before and after treatment. Records were also screened for adverse medical events and changes in ketamine dosage over time.\nFollowing treatment, inpatient hospital days were reduced by 70%, and hospital admissions were reduced by 65%. The dose of ketamine patients required was stable over time with no evidence of tolerance building. There were no serious adverse events and no long-term negative effects associated with ketamine.\nOral ketamine offers a promising pharmacologic adjunct to depression treatment. It may offer a more approachable alternative to IV or IM ketamine. The results warrant further investigation into the safety and efficacy of oral ketamine for psychiatric treatment."}, {"Title": "Atypical depression and non-atypical depression: Is HPA axis function a biomarker? A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The link between the abnormalities of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and depression has been one of the most consistently reported findings in psychiatry. At the same time, multiple studies have demonstrated a stronger association between the increased activation of HPA-axis and melancholic, or endogenous depression subtype. This association has not been confirmed for the atypical subtype, and some researchers have suggested that as an antinomic depressive subtype, it may be associated with the opposite type, i.e. hypo-function, of the HPA-axis, similarly to PTSD. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarise existing studies addressing the abnormalities of the HPA-axis in melancholic and/or atypical depression.\nWe conducted a systematic review in the literature by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OvidSP and Embase databases until June 2017. The following search items were used: \"hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\" OR \"HPA\" OR \"cortisol\" OR \"corticotropin releasing hormone\" OR \"corticotropin releasing factor\" OR \"glucocorticoid*\" OR \"adrenocorticotropic hormone\" OR \"ACTH\" AND \"atypical depression\" OR \"non-atypical depression\" OR \"melancholic depression\" OR \"non-melancholic depression\" OR \"endogenous depression\" OR \"endogenomorphic depression\" OR \"non-endogenous depression\". Search limits were set to include papers in English or German language published in peer-reviewed journals at any period. All studies were scrutinized to determine the main methodological characteristics, and particularly possible sources of bias influencing the results reported.\nWe selected 48 relevant studies. Detailed analysis of the methodologies used in the studies revealed significant variability especially regarding the samples' definition comparing the HPA axis activity of melancholic patients to atypical depression, including healthy controls. The results were subdivided into 4 sections: (1) 27 studies which compared melancholic OR endogenous depression vs. non-melancholic or non-endogenous depression or controls; (2) 9 studies which compared atypical depression or atypical traits vs. non-atypical depression or controls; (3) 7 studies which compared melancholic or endogenous and atypical depression subtypes and (4) 5 studies which used a longitudinal design, comparing the measures of HPA-axis across two or more time points. While the majority of studies did confirm the association between melancholic depression and increased post-challenge cortisol levels, the association with increases in basal cortisol and basal ACTH were less consistent. Some studies, particularly those focusing on reversed vegetative symptoms, demonstrated a decrease in the activity of the HPA axis in atypical depression compared to controls, but the majority did not distinguish it from healthy controls.\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that there is a difference in the activity of the HPA-axis between melancholic and atypical depressive subtypes. However, these are more likely explained by hypercortisolism in melancholia; and most often normal than decreased function in atypical depression. Further research should seek to distinguish a particular subtype of depression linked to HPA-axis abnormalities, based on symptom profile, with a focus on vegetative symptoms, neuroendocrine probes, and the history of adverse childhood events. New insights into the dichotomy addressed in this review might be obtained from genetic and epigenetic studies of HPA-axis related genes in both subtypes, with an emphasis on the presence of vegetative symptoms."}, {"Title": "Indicators of Complex Care During the Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry Activity at the Transplant Center of the Policlinico Hospital, Modena.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify possible biopsychosocial predictors of organizational complexity in patients referred to the consultant psychiatrist for assessment before liver transplantation.\nThis was a case-control study.

RLS patients were divided into subgroups as mild-moderate, severe, and very severe according to the severity of symptoms. Sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness were determined according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale, respectively, and sleep quality scores were analyzed statistically among the groups divided according to disease severity. Copeptin levels in all the patients were compared to the controls. RLS subgroups were compared with each other to evaluate association between copeptin levels and disease severity.\nPlasma copeptin levels in RLS patients were significantly higher than controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). However, there was no association between copeptin levels and disease severity. Excessive daytime sleepiness was found as 14.63% and low sleep quality as 68.29% in patients.\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation and sympathetic hyperactivity in RLS might be responsible for increased Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and copeptin release. We think that copeptin might have a potential role in the pathogenesis of RLS and be a biomarker for this disease."}, {"Title": "Source estimation of epileptic activity using eLORETA kurtosis analysis.", "Abstract": "Exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) is a technique for three-dimensional representation of the distribution of sources of electrical activity in the brain.

To evaluate the reliability of eLORETA kurtosis analysis, the results of the analysis were compared with those of equivalent current dipole (ECD) and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) kurtosis analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a patient with epilepsy with elementary visual seizures in a 6-year follow-up.The results of electroencephalography (EEG) eLORETA kurtosis analysis indicative of a right superior temporal spike source partially overlapped with MEG ECD/SAM kurtosis results in all recordings, with a total overlapping at the end of the follow-up period. Overall findings suggest that eLORETA kurtosis analysis of EEG data may aid in the localisation of spike activity sources in patients with epilepsy."}, {"Title": "The Neurodevelopmental Basis of Early Childhood Disruptive Behavior: Irritable and Callous Phenotypes as Exemplars.", "Abstract": "The arrival of the Journal's 175th anniversary occurs at a time of recent advances in research, providing an ideal opportunity to present a neurodevelopmental roadmap for understanding, preventing, and treating psychiatric disorders. Such a roadmap is particularly relevant for early-childhood-onset neurodevelopmental conditions, which emerge when experience-dependent neuroplasticity is at its peak. Employing a novel developmental specification approach, this review places recent neurodevelopmental research on early childhood disruptive behavior within the historical context of the Journal. The authors highlight irritability and callous behavior as two core exemplars of early disruptive behavior. Both phenotypes can be reliably differentiated from normative variation as early as the first years of life. Both link to discrete pathophysiology: irritability with disruptions in prefrontal regulation of emotion, and callous behavior with abnormal fear processing. Each phenotype also possesses clinical and predictive utility. Based on a nomologic net of evidence, the authors conclude that early disruptive behavior is neurodevelopmental in nature and should be reclassified as an early-childhood-onset neurodevelopmental condition in DSM-5. Rapid translation from neurodevelopmental discovery to clinical application has transformative potential for psychiatric approaches of the millennium.

Among all factors, sunlight exposure intensity has a crucial effect on affecting circadian functions high-risk individuals. A potential explanation of this relation is that excessive sunlight exposure is able to impair biological mechanisms, possibly through the dysregulation of serotonin and/or melatonin production/metabolism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of excessive sunlight exposure in a sample of emergency psychiatry inpatients.\nAll subjects were consecutively recruited from the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano (University of Turin, Italy) from September 2013 to August 2015. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were carefully collected.\nWe initially screened a sample of 900 patients; however, only 730 subjects voluntary accepted to participate in the study. Patients with admissions in spring/summer (a period in which daylight/darkness ratio is longer) showed a higher prevalence of involuntary admission, an earlier age at illness onset, a longer duration of hospitalization and admission for (hypo)manic episode.\nExcessive sunlight exposure may exert a fundamental role on psychopathological conditions presumably affecting biological vulnerability.

Several caveats were however identified suggesting that the prevalence of the disease is actually higher.\nWe have now updated main genotype/phenotype data, as well as potential associations within/between them, of all Spanish individuals currently diagnosed with McArdle disease (December 2016).\nNinety-four new patients (all Caucasian) have been diagnosed, yielding a prevalence of ~1/139,543 individuals. Around 55% of the mutated alleles have the commonest PYGM pathogenic mutation p.R50X, whereas p.W798R and p.G205S account for 10 and 9% of the allelic variants, respectively. Seven new mutations were identified: p.H35R, p.R70C, p.R94Q, p.L132WfsX163, p.Q176P, p.R576Q, and c.244-3_244-2CA. Almost all patients show exercise intolerance, the second wind phenomenon and high serum creatine kinase activity. There is, however, heterogeneity in clinical severity, with 8% of patients being asymptomatic during normal daily life, and 21% showing limitations during daily activities and fixed muscle weakness. A major remaining challenge is one of diagnosis, which is often delayed until the third decade of life in 72% of new patients despite the vast majority (86%) reporting symptoms before 20\u00a0years. An important development is the growing proportion of those reporting a 4-year improvement in disease severity (now 34%) and following an active lifestyle (50%). Physically active patients are more likely to report an improvement after a 4-year period in the clinical course of the disease than their inactive peers (odds ratio: 13.98; 95% confidence interval: 5.6, 34.9; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

He had been hospitalized our hospital's Department of Psychiatry and had been diagnosed with pneumonia. On the following day, electrocardiography showed coved-type ST elevation in the right precordial leads and a blood examination revealed that the patient's carbamazepine concentration was at the upper limit of the standard range, as well as hypothyroidism.

A brief educational intervention was designed to help improve family medicine residents' knowledge, comfort, and attitudes in delivering mental health care.\nA 6-hour didactic curriculum was taught by 2 psychiatry residents to family medicine residents between February and April 2015. Preintervention and postintervention surveys assessed participant demographics, knowledge, comfort levels, and attitudes regarding treating patients with psychiatric illness. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize results. Relationships between the sessions attended and preintervention and postintervention knowledge, comfort, and attitudes were investigated.\nOf 24 eligible residents, 15 completed each of the surveys preintervention and postintervention. Psychiatric knowledge scores were similar in the preintervention (mean score = 70%, SD = 15%) and postintervention (mean score = 69%, SD = 16%) groups. A significant positive correlation emerged between the number of didactic sessions attended and postintervention comfort levels (Spearman rank correlation coefficient: \u03c1 = 0.61, P = .02). The number of sessions attended was also positively associated with postintervention knowledge scores, although this did not reach statistical significance (\u03c1 = 0.40, P = .16). No relationship emerged between the number of sessions attended and participant attitudes (F\u2082,\u2081\u2082 = 1.88, P = .19).\nA brief, resident-led educational intervention positively impacted family medicine residents' comfort in managing patients with psychiatric comorbidities.

How Internet-based interventions will influence these relationships for persons with long-term care needs, and the measures that can be taken to maintain and enhance working relationships through Internet, is still not well understood.\nThe aim of this study was to gain insights into how service users and health providers experience their working relationships when they are offered the option of supplementing ongoing collaboration with an e-recovery portal.\nIn this exploratory and descriptive study, an e-recovery portal was used by service users and their health providers in 2 mental health communities in Norway for at least 6 months and at most 12 months (2015-2016). The portal consists of secure messaging, a peer support forum, and a toolbox of resources for working with life domains including status, goals and activities, network map, crisis plan, and exercises. The portal was owned and managed by the service user while health providers could remotely access parts of the service user-generated content. The participants could use the portal in whatever way they wished, to suit their collaboration. Data from 6 focus groups, 17 individual interviews, and an interview with 1 dyad about their experiences of use of the portal over the study period were inductively coded and thematically analyzed.\nThe thematic analysis resulted in 2 main themes: (1) new relational avenues and (2) out of alignment, illustrated by 8 subthemes. The first main theme is about dyads who reported new and enriching ways of working together through the portal, particularly related to written communication and use of the goal module. Illustrative subthemes are ownership, common ground, goals and direction, and sense of presence and availability. The second main theme illuminates the difficulties that arose when service users' and health providers' expectations for portal use were not aligned, and the consequences of not addressing these difficulties. Illustrative subthemes are initiative and responsibility, waiting for the other, feeling overwhelmed, and clarifications and agreements.\nThe degree to which dyads benefited from using the e-recovery portal appeared to be mainly associated with the degree to which the dyads' relations were open and flexible before the portal was introduced. For those who experienced frustrations, the portal may have both exposed and added to suboptimal working relationships. Use of the goal module appeared to strengthen the person-centered nature of collaboration. A key question is how health providers balance between enabling service users' greater control over their care, without relinquishing responsibility for the quality of the working relationship, also when using an e-recovery portal. Implications for implementation are discussed."}, {"Title": "Digital Platforms in the Assessment and Monitoring of Patients with Bipolar Disorder.", "Abstract": "This paper aims to review the application of digital platforms in the assessment and monitoring of patients with Bipolar Disorder (BPD).

We also compared mothers', fathers' and other caregivers' reports of children's QoL.\nPatients with externalizing symptoms in their history, aged 13-18 years were selected from the Vadaskert Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hospital and Outpatient Clinic. We used the Inventory of Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (QL), parent and children version to measure the children's QoL. We used F-factor analysis (Principal Component Analysis and direct oblimin rotation) and t-tests for data analysis.\nAltogether 138 caregiver-child dyads filled the QL.

The hypothesis of our present study was that SCAN is able to assess the social cognitive ability of patients with schizophrenia in a rapid, complex and objective way.\n86 schizophrenia patients and 101 healthy controls were examined. SCAN was used to present verbal and nonverbal tasks to measure four different domains of social cognition. SCAN registered the responses and the reaction times as well. Furthermore, an additional application was developed (called Scanalizer) to evaluate the results of a person being tested.\nThe results were evaluated by a two-dimensional analysis. This means that both task performance and the reaction time were taken into consideration while evaluating the results. As for the results, we found that the patients showed significantly worse functioning than the healthy subjects in the four domains of social cognition.\nBased on our results, SCAN is effective enough to detect the atypical social processing of schizophrenia patients. Moreover, Scanalizer is capable of evaluating the social cognitive abilities of schizophrenia patients in a complex, relatively fast and objective way."}, {"Title": "Use of ketamine for acute suicidal ideation in a patient with chronic pain on prescribed cannabinoids.", "Abstract": "Ketamine is a standard anaesthetic drug that has been studied as a possible treatment for acute suicidal ideation. Aside to the potential psychotropic effects of ketamine, a Cochrane review reported that available studies suggest a modest effect of ketamine for chronic pain months to years after surgical intervention. We present a patient with acute suicidal ideation who required immediate inpatient psychiatric admission in the setting of concurrent chronic pain on cannabinoids which could not be prescribed within our inpatient hospital setting. This presented a clinical dilemma to rapidly reverse the patient's suicidality while substituting the patient's prescribed cannabinoid products with an alternative pain regimen. Since there is emerging support in the use of ketamine in suicidality and chronic pain, we administered ketamine while withholding cannabinoid products and found evidence to support its use in rapid reversal of suicidal ideation and temporary chronic pain relief."}, {"Title": "Incidence of child and adolescent mental disorders in children aged 0-17 with familial high risk for severe mental illness - A Danish register study.", "Abstract": "Offspring of parents with severe mental illness (SMI: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) have an increased risk of developing mental disorder themselves. In childhood they may have neurodevelopmental delays, cognitive deficits and social adversities. We aimed to investigate if these individuals are more at risk of being diagnosed with a mental disorder during childhood/adolescence in a national sample.\nBy linking Danish registers we established a cohort consisting of all persons born to parents with SMI with those born to parents without SMI serving as a reference group. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for offspring diagnosed with a mental disorder by parental mental disorder were calculated.\nOffspring of parents with SMI showed increased IRR for all diagnoses of child and adolescent mental disorders compared to the reference group. Offspring of mothers with schizophrenia had IRR of 2.60 (CI: 2.50-2.70, N=2550) of having any diagnoses, for children of fathers with schizophrenia IRR was 2.06 (CI: 1.97-2.16, N=1901) and for offspring of two parents with schizophrenia IRR was 4.57 (CI: 3.94-5.31, N=175).

Previous studies on hospital choice mainly have focused on patients undergoing elective surgery. This study examined a representative sample of hospital inpatients across disciplines and treatment interventions in Germany. Its research questions were: How many patients decide where to go for hospital treatment? How much time do patients have before admission? Which sources of information do they use, and which criteria are relevant to their decision?\nCross-sectional observational study covering 1925 inpatients of 46 departments at 17 hospitals in 2012. The stratified survey comprised 11 medical disciplines (internal medicine, gynaecology, obstetrics, paediatrics, psychiatry, orthopaedics, neurology, urology, ENT and geriatrics) on 3 hospital care levels representing 91.9% of all hospital admissions to inpatient care in Germany in 2012. The statistical analysis calculated the frequency distributions and 95% confidence intervals of characteristics related to the hospital choice.\n63.0% [60.9-65.2] of patients in Germany chose the hospital themselves, but only 21.1% [19.3-22.9] had more than one week to decide prior to admission. Major sources of information were personal knowledge of hospitals, relatives, outpatient health professionals and the Internet. Main criteria for the decision were personal experience with a hospital, recommendations from relatives and providers of outpatient services, a hospital's reputation and distance from home. Specific quality information as provided by performance reports were of secondary importance.\nA majority of patients in the German health system choose their hospital freely. Providers of outpatient health care can have an important \"agent\" function in the quality-oriented hospital choice especially for patients with little time prior to admission and those who do not decide themselves.

This study evaluated the attitudes of primary care nurses towards people with mental illness and its associated factors; and the effectiveness of a short video-based contact intervention (VBCI) in improving these attitudes using a Malay version of the 15-item Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC-15-M).\nA 5-minute VBCI was developed comprising elements of psychoeducation and interviews of people with mental illness and the people they interact with, relating to experience of mental illness and recovery. A pre-post cross-sectional study was conducted on 206 randomly selected primary care nurses in Penang, Malaysia. The OMS-HC-15-M questionnaire was administered before and immediately after participants viewed the VBCI. The difference in mean pre-post VBCI scores using paired t-tests, effect size and standardised response mean (SRM) were obtained. Factors correlating to attitudes were obtained using univariate and multivariate regression analyses.\nDifferences in pre-post VBCI score were statistically significant (p<0.001) with a 14% score reduction, a moderate effect size and SRM at 0.97 (0.85-0.11) and 1.1 (0.97-1.2) respectively. By factoring in the Minimal Detectable Change statistic of 7.76, the VBCI produced a significant improvement of attitudes in 30% of the participants. Factors associated with less stigmatising attitudes at baseline were previous psychiatry-related training, desiring psychiatric training, and positive contact with people with mental illness.\nThis is the first study in Malaysia to show that a brief VBCI is effective in improving attitudes of primary care nurses towards people with mental illness in the immediate term. Further studies are needed to determine if these results can be sustained in the longer term and generalizable to other health care professionals. Qualitative studies are warranted to provide insight to the factors correlating to these attitudes.

For each vignette, participants were asked to give a quantitative estimate of the proportion of young people with similar mental health problems they thought would clinically benefit from each of twelve attributes of mental health care (other than pharmacological or individual psychological therapies). Survey results were analysed as independent, disorder-based samples, using standard statistical tests of significance, and as a stratified sample using mixed-effects models.\nA total of 412 clinicians working in 32 countries participated in both parts of the survey. Respondents represented a broad range of clinical disciplines, settings and areas of expertise. Their estimated proportions of young people who would benefit from the mental health care attributes varied by clinical stage and disorder (eg, a mean of 93% [interquartile range (IQR), 90%-100%] of young people with Stage 2 psychosis were estimated to benefit from case management with a multidisciplinary team; while only 15% [IQR, 1%-25%] of young people with Stage 1b generalised anxiety disorder were estimated to benefit from collection and processing of biological samples).

It can be implemented in a range of ways. A review of the available literature identified a range of studies reporting the results of evaluation research into integrated care services. The best available data indicate that many young people who may not otherwise have sought help are accessing these mental health services, and there are promising outcomes for most in terms of symptomatic and functional recovery. Where evaluated, young people report having benefited from and being highly satisfied with these services. Some young people, such as those with more severe presenting symptoms and those who received fewer treatment sessions, have failed to benefit, indicating a need for further integration with more specialist care.

It is one of the most common paroxysmal disorders in children and adolescents. The three major causes of syncope in children are neural, cardiovascular and other non-cardiovascular causes. The common unifying mechanism is transient global hypoperfusion of the brain. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and objective laboratory investigations add little to the diagnosis in children especially in neurocardiogenic subtype. Specific management depends on the underlying cause of syncope in children. For cardiac causes, management includes early referral to the pediatric cardiology specialist. When paroxysmal non-epileptic events are suspected, child psychology or psychiatry consultation should be sought to identify the stressors and counseling. For neurocardiogenic syncope, the main objective of treatment is to prevent recurrent events to improve the quality of life, psychological stress and school absenteeism by behavior and lifestyle modifications followed by drugs in refractory cases. The prognosis is excellent for neurocardiogenic syncope and is variable based on the underlying pathology in cardiogenic cases. As syncope is not a disease in itself but a symptom of an underlying disorder; hence, all children with syncope require assessment to exclude an underlying life-threatening cardiac or non-cardiac disorder."}, {"Title": "Utilization of Mental Health Resources and Complementary and Alternative Therapies for Alopecia Areata: A U.S. Survey.", "Abstract": "The efficacy of traditional medical treatments for alopecia areata (AA) is limited, leading some to pursue alternative treatments.

He was a practitioner of moral therapy and non-restraint. He added his own religious aspects to his treatment based on his personal experiences. These interventions were novel and benefitted his patients. However, he is less well known in the present day than his contemporaries who also championed non-restraint. In 1838, he left Hanwell Asylum, as he disagreed with plans to expand patient capacity. The resurgence of Whig politics at the time also played its part in his resignation.

Because attitudes are formed early in life, the current study aimed to investigate if teaching psychiatry in secondary school nursing students (i.e., adolescents) changes attitudes toward three prevalent psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. A pilot quasi-experimental study was conducted with 51 fourth-year students in secondary nursing school who completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes toward these disorders on the first and last day of their Nursing in Psychiatry course. Results show that the stigma attached to all three disorders was significantly reduced after students completed the course. Students attached greater stigma to schizophrenia than PTSD, and to PTSD than depression, before and after the course. The study indicates that education in psychiatry helps reduce negative attitudes toward PTSD, schizophrenia, and depression.

To date, the management of depression remains mainly empirical and often poorly evaluated. The development of a personalized medicine in psychiatry may reduce treatment failure, intolerance or resistance, and hence the burden and costs of mood depressive disorders. The Geneva Cocktail Phenotypic approach presents several advantages including the \"in vivo\" measure of different cytochromes and transporter P-gp activities, their simultaneous determination in a single test, avoiding the influence of variability over time on phenotyping results, the administration of low dose substrates, a limited sampling strategy with an analytical method developed on DBS analysis. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME), assessed by a phenotypic approach, and the concentrations of Venlafaxine (VLX)\u00a0+\u00a0O-demethyl-venlafaxine (ODV), the efficacy and tolerance of VLX.\nThis study is a multicentre prospective non-randomized open trial. Eligible patients present a major depressive episode, MADRS over or equal to 20, treatment with VLX regardless of the dose during at least 4\u00a0weeks. The Phenotype Visit includes VLX and ODV concentration measurement. Following the oral absorption of low doses of omeprazole, midazolam, dextromethorphan, and fexofenadine, drug metabolizing enzymes activity is assessed by specific metabolite/probe concentration ratios from a sample taken 2\u00a0h after cocktail administration for CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP2D6; and by the determination of the limited area under the curve from the capillary blood samples taken 2-3 and 6\u00a0h after cocktail administration for CYP2C19 and P-gp. Two follow-up visits will take place between 25 and 40\u00a0days and 50-70\u00a0days after inclusion. They include assessment of efficacy, tolerance and observance. Eleven french centres are involved in recruitment, expected to be completed within approximately 2\u00a0years with 205 patients. Metabolic ratios are determined in Geneva, Switzerland.\nBy showing an association between drug metabolism and VLX concentrations, efficacy and tolerance, there is a hope that testing drug metabolism pathways with a phenotypical approach would help physicians in selecting and dosing antidepressants.

Recent epidemiological studies in European community samples are scarce. In Portugal, community prevalence data is very limited. The 10/66 Dementia Research Group (DRG) population-based research programmes are focused in low and middle income countries, where the assessments proved to be culture and education fair. We applied the 10/66 DRG prevalence survey methodology in Portugal, where levels of illiteracy in older populations are still high.\nA cross-sectional comprehensive one-phase survey was conducted of all residents aged 65 and over of two geographically defined catchment areas in Southern Portugal (one urban and one rural site). Nursing home residents were not included in the present study. Standardized 10/66 DRG assessments include a cognitive module, an informant interview and the Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT, providing data on dementia diagnosis and subtypes, mental disorders including depression, physical health, anthropometry, demographics, disability/functioning, health service utilization, care arrangements and caregiver strain.\nWe interviewed 1405 old age participants (mean age 74.9, SD\u00a0=\u00a06.7\u00a0years; 55.5% women) after 313 (18.2%) refusals to participate. The prevalence rate for dementia in community-dwellers was 9.23% (95% CI 7.80-10.90) using the 10/66 DRG algorithm and 3.65% (95% CI 2.97-4.97) using DSM-IV criteria. Pure Alzheimer's disease was the most prevalent dementia subtype (41.9%). The prevalence of dementia was strongly age-dependent for both criteria, but there was no association with sex.\nDementia prevalence was higher than previously reported in Portugal. The discrepancy between prevalence according to the 10/66 DRG algorithm and the DSM-IV criteria is consistent with that observed in less developed countries; this suggests potential underestimation using the latter approach, although relative validity of these two approaches remains to be confirmed in the European context.

A United States-based textbook confirms that there is no consensus about which laboratory investigation should be routinely performed in psychiatric patients, but with respect to CSF diagnostics, the differences are even more striking. A survey among European experts showed a wide variety of opinions regarding clinical use and criteria in various countries of Europe and worldwide: some psychiatrists, mostly university hospital-based, recommended performing CSF diagnostics in every patient first experiencing severe mental illness (SMI), but especially in patients from the schizophrenia spectrum, whereas others almost never perform CSF examinations themselves and usually refer patients to neurology departments if necessary. Minor neurologic signs are generally frequent in SMI, mainly in affective and schizophrenic disorders. Even with neurologic signs present, there are no clear guidelines regarding CSF evaluation, leaving doctors with experience-based decision making. However, the field is evolving. A recent review provides helpful yellow and red flags for differential diagnosis of SMI from autoimmune encephalitis; interestingly, minor CSF abnormalities are considered a red flag, suggesting that CSF should be routinely performed in acute psychiatric patients. There are reports of single cases identified as an established neurologic disorder: patients within affective and schizophrenic spectrum disorders systematically underwent CSF examination, and were rediagnosed based on CSF results. This was often to the surprise of the psychiatric doctors. Overall, an increasing number of psychiatrists believe that CSF is too rarely examined in psychiatric patients. This chapter provides an overview of differential diagnostic issues in SMI, particularly for new-onset cases. The general recommendations regarding CSF examination procedures can be found in other chapters of this book. Here we focus on specific aspects of differential diagnosis in SMI. Also, there will be an overview of admittedly limited CSF research efforts in psychiatric disorders, focusing on more recent CSF studies.

Conversely, administration of anti-inflammatory agents has been shown to ameliorate depressive symptoms, demonstrating the importance of inflammation as a mediator of depression. Although it is clear that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, the mechanism by which inflammation is activated in mood disorders remains unclear. To address this issue, studies have investigated the role of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) activation in stress-induced inflammation and mood disorders. However, the identification of the endogenous factors, referred to as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) that activate these receptors remains understudied.

We studied the antidepressant-like and pro-cognitive effects of raw GM rind in Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a genetic model of depression, following acute and chronic treatment compared to a reference antidepressant, imipramine (IMI). The chemical composition of the GM extract was analysed for levels of \u03b1- and \u03b3-mangostin. The acute dose-dependent effects of GM (50, 150 and 200\u00a0mg/kg po), IMI (20\u00a0mg/kg po) and vehicle were determined in the forced swim test (FST) in FSL rats, versus Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) control rats.

Chronic treated animals were also assessed with respect to frontal cortex and hippocampal monoamine levels and accumulation of malondialdehyde. FSL rats showed significant cognitive deficits and depressive-like behavior, with disordered cortico-hippocampal 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and noradrenaline (NA), as well as elevated hippocampal lipid peroxidation.

Chronic GM (50\u00a0mg/kg/d) displayed significant antidepressant- and pro-cognitive effects, while demonstrating parity with IMI. Both behavioral and monoamine assessments suggest a more prominent serotonergic action for GM as opposed to a noradrenergic action for IMI, while both IMI and GM reversed hippocampal lipid peroxidation in FSL animals.

There is an urgent need for further research to understand possible mechanisms accounting for this finding."}, {"Title": "Heritable Variation, With Little or No Maternal Effect, Accounts for Recurrence Risk to Autism Spectrum Disorder in Sweden.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has both genetic and environmental origins, including potentially maternal effects. Maternal effects describe the association of one or more maternal phenotypes with liability to ASD in progeny that are independent of maternally transmitted risk alleles. While maternal effects could play an important role, consistent with association to maternal traits such as immune status, no study has estimated maternal, additive genetic, and environmental effects in ASD.\nUsing a population-based sample consisting of all children born in Sweden from 1998 to 2007 and their relatives, we fitted statistical models to family data to estimate the variance in ASD liability originating from maternal, additive genetic, and shared environmental effects. We calculated sibling and cousin family recurrence risk ratio as a direct measure of familial, genetic, and environmental risk factors and repeated the calculations on diagnostic subgroups, specifically autistic disorder (AD) and spectrum disorder (SD), which included Asperger's syndrome and/or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\nThe sample consisted of 776,212 children of whom 11,231 had a diagnosis of ASD: 4554 with AD, 6677 with SD. We found support for large additive genetic contribution to liability; heritability (95% confidence interval [CI]) was estimated to 84.8% (95% CI: 73.1-87.3) for ASD, 79.6% (95% CI: 61.2-85.1) for AD, and 76.4% (95% CI: 63.0-82.5) for SD.\nThere was modest, if any, contribution of maternal effects to liability for ASD, including subtypes AD and SD, and there was no support for shared environmental effects. These results show liability to ASD arises largely from additive genetic variation."}, {"Title": "Adverse impact of marijuana use on clinical outcomes among psychiatry patients with depression and alcohol use disorder.", "Abstract": "This study examined whether marijuana use was associated with clinically problematic outcomes for patients with depression and alcohol use disorder (AUD). The sample consisted of 307 psychiatry outpatients with mild to severe depression and past 30-day hazardous drinking/drug use, who participated in a trial of substance use treatment. Participants were assessed for AUD based on DSM-IV criteria. Measures of marijuana use, depression symptoms, and functional status related to mental health were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Differences in these outcomes were analyzed among patients with and without AUD using growth models, adjusting for treatment effects. Marijuana was examined as both an outcome (patterns of use) and a predictor (impact on depression and functioning). Forty percent used marijuana and about half the sample met AUD criteria. Fewer patients with AUD used marijuana than those without AUD at baseline. Over 6 months, the proportion of patients with AUD using marijuana increased compared to those without AUD. Patients with AUD using marijuana had greater depressive symptoms and worse functioning than those without AUD. These findings indicate that marijuana use is clinically problematic for psychiatry outpatients with depression and AUD. Addressing marijuana in the context of psychiatry treatment may help improve outcomes."}, {"Title": "Rising incidence of psychiatric disorders before diagnosis of immune-mediated inflammatory disease.", "Abstract": "After the diagnosis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the incidence of psychiatric comorbidity is increased relative to the general population. We aimed to determine whether the incidence of psychiatric disorders is increased in the 5 years before the diagnosis of IMID as compared with the general population.\nUsing population-based administrative health data from the Canadian province of Manitoba, we identified all persons with incident IBD, MS and RA between 1989 and 2012, and cohorts from the general population matched 5 : 1 on year of birth, sex and region to each disease cohort. We identified members of these groups with at least 5 years of residency before and after the IMID diagnosis date. We applied validated algorithms for depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and any psychiatric disorder to determine the annual incidence of these conditions in the 5-year periods before and after the diagnosis year.\nWe identified 12 141 incident cases of IMID (3766 IBD, 2190 MS, 6350 RA) and 65 424 matched individuals. As early as 5 years before diagnosis, the incidence of depression [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.54; 95% CI 1.30-1.84) and anxiety disorders (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.12-1.51) were elevated in the IMID cohort as compared with the matched cohort. Similar results were obtained for each of the IBD, MS and RA cohorts. The incidence of bipolar disorder was elevated beginning 3 years before IMID diagnosis (IRR 1.63; 95% CI 1.10-2.40).\nThe incidence of psychiatric comorbidity is elevated in the IMID population as compared with a matched population as early as 5 years before diagnosis. Future studies should elucidate whether this reflects shared risk factors for psychiatric disorders and IMID, a shared final common inflammatory pathway or other aetiology."}, {"Title": "[The impasse known as ADHD].", "Abstract": "There are two extreme views within psychiatry when it comes to etiopathogenesis. At one extreme is the naturalistic vision; at the other extreme is a perception of psychiatric diagnoses as social constructions. There are also different perspectives on ADHD: historical, social, psychological and neurobiological. In this article, I will try to find a position between the two extremes to sketch the context of the current ADHD debate from the different perspectives. I conclude that a one-sided neurobiological view of ADHD lacks adequate foundation; it does not support the psychiatrist who is struggling with complicated ADHD issues in daily practice, and does not respond adequately to the very real problems of the people concerned and their families. We do not know exactly how to address the issue of ADHD in children and adults.

This WFSBP guideline has been developed to supply a systematic overview of all scientific evidence pertaining to the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar mixed states in adults.\nMaterial used for these guidelines is based on a systematic literature search using various data bases. Their scientific rigour was categorised into six levels of evidence (A-F), and different grades of recommendation to ensure practicability were assigned. We examined data pertaining to the acute treatment of manic and depressive symptoms in bipolar mixed patients, as well as data pertaining to the prevention of mixed recurrences after an index episode of any type, or recurrence of any type after a mixed index episode.\nManic symptoms in bipolar mixed states appeared responsive to treatment with several atypical antipsychotics, the best evidence resting with olanzapine. For depressive symptoms, addition of ziprasidone to treatment as usual may be beneficial; however, the evidence base is much more limited than for the treatment of manic symptoms. Besides olanzapine and quetiapine, valproate and lithium should also be considered for recurrence prevention.\nThe concept of mixed states changed over time, and recently became much more comprehensive with the release of DSM-5. As a consequence, studies in bipolar mixed patients targeted slightly different bipolar subpopulations. In addition, trial designs in acute and maintenance treatment also advanced in recent years in response to regulatory demands.\nCurrent treatment recommendations are still based on limited evidence, and there is a clear demand for confirmative studies adopting the DSM-5 specifier with mixed features concept."}, {"Title": "SMART-R: A Prospective Cohort Study of a Resilience Curriculum for Residents by Residents.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a resident-led resiliency curriculum developed by residents, for residents.\nThe Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program for Residents (SMART-R) is a 6-h group-based curriculum that teaches meditation, behavioral skills, and positive perspective-taking strategies.

We sought to understand how faculty and residents' describe their experiences of AC and ambulatory care education (ACEduc) within, between, and across disciplinary contexts.\nWe designed a Stakian collective case study, applying constructivist grounded theory analytic methods. Using purposive and snowball sampling, we interviewed 17 faculty and residents across three instrumental cases: family medicine, psychiatry, surgery. Through constant comparative analysis, we identified patterns within, between, and across cases.\nFamily medicine and psychiatry saw AC as an inherent part of continuous, longitudinal care; surgery equated AC with episodic experiences in clinic, differentiating it from operating. Across cases, faculty and residents cautiously valued ACEduc, and in particular, considered it important to develop non-medical expert competencies (e.g., communication). However, surgery residents described AC and ACEduc as less interesting and a lower priority than operating. Educational structures mediated these views.\nDifferences between cases highlight a need for further study, as universal assumptions about ACEduc's purposes and approaches may need to be tempered by situated, contextually-rich perspectives. How disciplinary culture, program structure, and systemic structure influence ACEduc warrant further consideration as does the educational potential for explicitly framing learners' perspectives."}, {"Title": "[Assessment of mood disorders by passive data gathering: The concept of digital phenotype versus psychiatrist's professional culture].", "Abstract": "The search for objective clinical signs is a constant practitioners' and researchers' concern in psychiatry. New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of \"digital phenotype\" is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood disorders by means of a selective review of the literature.\nWe conducted a selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included.\nFor unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve.\nAll these systems can be used to computerize the clinical characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data."}, {"Title": "Machine-based classification of ADHD and nonADHD participants using time/frequency features of event-related neuroelectric activity.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent diagnosis among children who are referred to psychiatry departments.

Time-Frequency Hermite-Atomizer (TFHA) technique is used for the extraction of high resolution time-frequency domain features that are highly localized in time-frequency domain. Based on an extensive investigation, Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to obtain the best discriminating features.\nWhen the best three features were used, the classification accuracy for the training dataset reached 98%, and the use of five features further improved the accuracy to 99.5%. The accuracy was 100% for the testing dataset. Based on extensive experiments, the delta band emerged as the most contributing frequency band and statistical parameters emerged as the most contributing feature group.\nThe classification performance of this study suggests that TFHA can be employed as an auxiliary component of the diagnostic and prognostic procedures for ADHD.\nThe features obtained in this study can potentially contribute to the neuroelectrical understanding and clinical diagnosis of ADHD."}, {"Title": "Forensic psychiatric service provision in Pakistan and its challenges.", "Abstract": "In the Islamic Republic of Pakistan the law relating to people who are mentally ill, until 2001, was set out by the Lunacy Act of 1912, which was inherited from the British colonial occupiers.

However, more recently, community mental health services, which have been shown to improve access to care and clinical outcomes are beginning to develop in some locations. Despite efforts to promote more accessible services, low levels of knowledge about effective treatment of mental disorders means that even where these services are available, a very small proportion of people utilise these services. Therefore interventions to increase service use are an essential component of health system.\nThis intervention was designed to increase use of a mental health services through the work of community-based Village Health Workers. Fifteen Village Health Workers in each Local Government Area (district) were selected and trained to create mental health awareness in communities. Their function also include identification and referral of persons with mental illness to trained mental health nurses in the clinics.

By implementing this approach we explored whether individual feedback on symptom dynamics complements current categorical classification and treatment. The aim of this proof-of-principle case-study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability and usability of this transdiagnostic approach.\nA female patient, aged 67, suffering from treatment resistant anxious and depressive symptoms was treated in our tertiary outpatient clinic for old age psychiatry. She participated in ecological momentary assessments (EMA), which involved intensive repeated measurements of mood and context-related items during two weeks. Visualizations of the interplay between the items were provided by network graphs and were discussed with the patient.\nNetwork graphs were discussed with the patient. For example, it was hypothesized and discussed with the patient that feeling relaxed increased physical activity, causing physical discomfort in the following hours. Physical discomfort caused stress as its symptoms resembled her feared somatic anxiety symptoms. This increased the patient's insight that stress, expressed as somatic symptoms, played a central role in her panic disorder. This started a dialogue on how to cope with stress caused by somatic (anxiety) symptoms and provided a rationale for the patient to start an interoceptive exposure intervention she had repeatedly refused before.\nThe observed symptom dynamics may not be generalizable to any other random two weeks.\nPersonalized diagnosis of psychopathology incorporating complex symptom dynamics is feasible and a promising addition to current categorical diagnostic systems and could guide intervention selection.

The country now has seven EM residency programs: three in the capital city of Bogot\u00e1, two in Medellin, one in Manizales, and one in Cali. The seven residency programs are in different stages of maturity, with the oldest founded 20 years ago and two founded in the last two years. The objective of this study was to characterize these seven residency programs.\nWe conducted semi-structured interviews with faculty and residents from all the existing programs in 2013-2016. Topics included program characteristics and curricula.\nColombian EM residencies are three-year programs, with the exception of one four-year program. Programs accept 3-10 applicants yearly. Only one program has free tuition and the rest charge tuition. The number of EM faculty ranges from 2-15. EM rotation requirements range from 11-33% of total clinical time. One program does not have a pediatric rotation. The other programs require 1-2 months of pediatrics or pediatric EM. Critical care requirements range from 4-7 months. Other common rotations include anesthesia, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, orthopedics, ophthalmology, radiology, toxicology, psychiatry, neurology, cardiology, pulmonology, and trauma. All programs offer 4-6 hours of protected didactic time each week. Some programs require Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Advanced Trauma Life Support, with some programs providing these trainings in-house or subsidizing the cost. Most programs require one research project for graduation. Resident evaluations consist of written tests and oral exams several times per year. Point-of-care ultrasound training is provided in four of the seven programs.\nAs emergency medicine continues to develop in Colombia, more residency programs are expected to emerge. Faculty development and sustainability of academic pursuits will be critically important. In the long term, the specialty will need to move toward certifying board exams and professional development through a national EM organization to promote standardization across programs."}, {"Title": "Characterizing New England Emergency Departments by Telemedicine Use.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine connects emergency departments (ED) with resources necessary for patient care; its use has not been characterized nationally, or even regionally.

The survey queried directors of every ED (n=195) in the six New England states (excluding federal hospitals and college infirmaries). Descriptive statistics characterized ED telemedicine use; multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of use.\nOf the 169 responding EDs (87% response rate), 82 (49%) reported using telemedicine. Telemedicine EDs were more likely to be rural (18% of users vs. 7% of non-users, p=0.03); less likely to be academic (1% of users vs. 11% of non-users, p=0.01); and less likely to have 24/7 access to neurology (p<0.001), neurosurgery (p<0.001), orthopedics (p=0.01), plastic surgery (p=0.01), psychiatry (p<0.001), and hand surgery (p<0.001) consultants.

This rise increases the occurrence of, risks of, and costs of treating obesity-related medical conditions. Diet and activity programs are largely inadequate for the long-term treatment of medically-complicated obesity. Physicians who deliver gastrointestinal care after completing traditional training programs, including gastroenterologists and general surgeons, are not uniformly trained in or familiar with available bariatric care. It is certain that gastrointestinal physicians will incorporate new endoscopic methods into their practice for the treatment of individuals with medically-complicated obesity, although the long-term impact of these endoscopic techniques remains under investigation. It is presently unclear whether gastrointestinal physicians will be able to provide or coordinate important allied services in bariatric surgery, endocrinology, nutrition, psychological evaluation and support, and social work. Obtaining longitudinal results examining the effectiveness of this ad hoc approach will likely be difficult, based on prior experience with other endoscopic measures, such as the adenoma detection rates from screening colonoscopy. As a long-term approach, development of a specific curriculum incorporating one year of subspecialty training in bariatrics to the present training of gastrointestinal fellows needs to be reconsidered. This approach should be facilitated by gastrointestinal trainees' prior residency training in subspecialties that provide care for individuals with medical complications of obesity, including endocrinology, cardiology, nephrology, and neurology. Such training could incorporate additional rotations with collaborating providers in bariatric surgery, nutrition, and psychiatry.

It is natural that once patient achieves remission, QoL would improve, but very few studies are conducted under this phase. This study compares the differences in QoL in remitted patients with monotherapy and polypharmacy.\nThe aim of this study is to compare the QoL between psychiatric patients in remission treated with monotherapy and polypharmacy.\nIt is a questionnaire based cross-sectional comparative study.\nThis study included outpatients under remission who come for follow-up in psychiatric department. Semi-structured data collection form was used. Remission was confirmed using suitable scales, and QoL was assessed using the World Health Organization quality of life-Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) scale. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were applied to understand the overall improvement and functioning levels.\nOut of the total 100 patients enrolled in the study, fifty patients were on monotherapy and fifty patients on polypharmacy. The cost of medication was comparatively high for polypharmacy (Rs. 3568.92 [\u00b1348.54]) than monotherapy (Rs. 1936.56 [\u00b1252.07]). The QoL in physical, psychological, and social domains was significantly high in patients on polypharmacy rather than monotherapy when assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Ninety-six percent of monotherapy patients had CGI scores between 1.5 and 2.4 while 74% of polypharmacy patients had scores between 1.0 and 1.5.

The number of trainees 'highly likely' to choose psychiatry increased over the four-month period, from 4.5% to 19%. The number of trainees 'highly unlikely' to choose psychiatry decreased, from 27.3% to 9.5%. An increasingly positive intention towards a psychiatry career appeared to relate to enjoyment of the placement and the quality of supervision.

Treatment responders are assessed for treatment response. This tautology in the logic of RDTs renders them invalid, since the predictor and the outcome are the same variable. Although RDTs can be designed to avoid this tautologous state of affairs, like using independent predictors of outcomes, such is not the case with psychiatric maintenance studies Further, purported benefits of RDTs regarding feasibility were found to be questionable. Specifically, RDTs do not enhance statistical power in many settings, and, because of high dropout rates, produce results of questionable validity. Any claimed benefits come with notably reduced generalizability.\nRDTs appear to be scientifically invalid as used in psychiatric maintenance designs. Their purported feasibility benefits are not seen in actual trials for psychotropic drugs.

In this review, we examine the clinical evidence of marijuana use in transplant patients to enable psychiatric providers to meaningfully contribute to the relevant medical and psychiatric aspects of this issue in a unique patient population.\nThere is no consensus among experts regarding marijuana use in transplantation patients. There are extant case reports of post-transplant complications attributed to marijuana use including membranous glomerulonephritis, ventricular tachycardia, and tacrolimus toxicity. However, recent studies suggest that the overall survival rates in kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplant patients using marijuana are equivalent to non-users. Transplant teams should not de facto exclude marijuana users from transplant listing but instead holistically evaluate a patient's candidacy, integrating meaningful medical, psychiatric, and social variables into the complex decision-making process. Psychiatric providers can play a key role in this process.

The letters she wrote to her father, often on a daily basis, provide a unique insight to the earliest years of the hospital that was to have such an influence on British psychiatry. It is the only insider record we have of this crucial time. Barkas demonstrated her versatility in psychiatry and child psychiatry. She used psychoanalysis to treat her patients, receiving recognition from her colleagues. Her work in this field proved to be an exception as analysis was not practiced after she left the Maudsley. Her problem was the institutionalised prejudice against women in psychiatry, which caused her to leave. Her career was terminated at an early stage and her life took a puzzling turn after she returned to New Zealand in 1933.

A wide variation seems to exist internationally regarding legal frameworks, administrative procedures, detention rates and clinical practice. The aim of the present study is to describe qualitative and quantitative features of compulsory admissions in a large administrative area in southwest Greece, in order to identify targets for future research and possible remediation. Involuntary assessments and admissions in the Department of Psychiatry of the University Hospital of Patras were retrospectively assessed, during a 12-month period, for demographic features and data regarding legal procedures. Diagnoses following compulsory first assessment and at discharge were recorded for the patients who were admitted in our department. During the period of observation, 218 compulsory assessments were made, corresponding to 190 patients and resulting in 183 compulsory admissions. Thirty five cases (16.1%) were assessed as not justifying hospitalization and corresponded mainly to the diagnoses of alcohol and/or substance abuse or dependence. Involuntary hospitalizations represented 44.9% of all psychiatric admissions in our department. Diagnosis at first assessment was most frequently psychosis (68.4%). Diagnoses at discharge were most often schizophrenia (52.8%) and bipolar disorder (21.3%). A history of multiple hospitalizations (>5) was observed in 17 (15.8%) patients, whereas 46 patients (42.6%) were hospitalized for the first time, and 13 (11.7%) exhibited their first psychotic episode.

Some doubts have been expressed in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation (network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range of Sustainable Development Goals."}, {"Title": "Role of Chronobiology as a Transdisciplinary Field of Research: Its Applications in Treating Mood Disorders.", "Abstract": "Chronobiology is a field that studies the effects of time on biological systems. Periodicity is of particular interest. The master biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus controls daily rhythms of core body temperature, rest-activity cycle, physiological and behavioral functions, psychomotor functions and mood in humans. The clock genes are involved in the generation of the circadian rhythms and the biological clock is synchronized to solar day by direct photic inputs. Various circadian rhythm abnormalities have been demonstrated in mood disorders such as unipolar depression, bipolar depression and seasonal affective disorder. Hypotheses involving circadian rhythm abnormalities related to the etiology of mood disorders have been raised. The resulting circadian rhythm changes can be measured and evaluated that these techniques can be used to identify subtypes of mood disorders associated with circadian rhythm changes. The data obtained from chronobiological studies reveal methods that manipulate circadian rhythms. The effects of light and melatonin on circadian rhythms are determined by these studies. Chronobiological research has been applied to the psychiatric clinic and light therapy has been used as a chronotherapeutic in the treatment of mood disorders. On the other hand, chronotherapeutic approaches with effects on circadian rhythms such as sleep deprivation therapy have been used in the treatment of mood disorders too. As a good example of translational psychiatry, chronobiological studies have been projected in the psychiatry clinic. It may be possible, the data obtained from the basic sciences are used in the diagnosis of mood disorders and in the treatment of psychiatric disorders as chronotherapeutic techniques.

Earlier studies report conflicting results with regard to the nature and severity of NMS. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, sleep problems, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in a Dutch DRD cohort.\nClinical characteristics, motor symptoms, type and severity of psychiatric co-morbidity, sleep problems, fatigue and HR-QoL were assessed in DRD patients with a confirmed GCH1 mutation and matched controls.\nTwenty-eight patients were included (18 adults and 10 children), from 10 families. Dystonia symptoms were well-controlled in all patients. According to the DSM IV patients significantly more often met the criteria for a lifetime psychiatric disorder than controls (61% vs. 29%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In particular the frequencies of generalized anxiety and agoraphobia were higher in patients (both 29% vs. 4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients scored significantly higher on daytime sleepiness than controls (ESS, 11.2 vs 5.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Adult patients had significantly lower scores on the mental component of the HR-QoL (47 vs. 54, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than controls mainly associated with (worse) quality of sleep.\nNMS were highly prevalent in our cohort of DRD patients, despite adequate treatment of motor symptoms. Our findings support the accumulating evidence of an important non-motor phenotype in DRD, with possible involvement of serotonergic mechanisms.

The curriculum is intended for healthcare trainees coming from undergraduate pre-medical programs, nursing, pharmacy, social work, clinical psychology, medical school and post-graduate medical training in family medicine, medicine-pediatrics, and psychiatry. The clinical component is specifically designed to reach destitute patients and the curriculum is structured to reverse commonly held myths about homelessness among the trainees, thereby improving their Homelessness Information Quotient, the ability to more fully understand homelessness. Participants across all disciplines and specialties have shown greater empathy and helper behavior as determined by qualitative measures. Learners have also developed a greater understanding of health-care systems allowing them to more consistently address social determinants of health identified by the authors as their Disparity Information Quotient. This article outlines the process of initiating a homeless service program, a curriculum for addressing common myths about homelessness and the effective use of narrative methods, relational connections, and reflective practice to enable trainees to process their experience and decrease burnout by focusing on the value of altruism and finding meaning in their work."}, {"Title": "Clinical characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder: older vs. young adults.", "Abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older people.

It is often assumed to be rare. Observations suggest that rather than overestimating its frequency, we are more likely to underestimate it (Pope et al., 1986). It is a rare but potentially fatal disorder characterized by four principal symptoms. These are mental status changes, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis of NMS often presents a challenge because several medical conditions generate similar symptoms. Although less common now than in the past, thanks to greater awareness, it remains a risk in susceptible patients receiving conventional or atypical neuroleptics.

Here, we characterize neural and computational mechanisms underlying this form of social influence. We introduce a computational model that captures fluctuations in self-esteem engendered by prediction errors that quantify the difference between expected and received social feedback. Using functional MRI, we show these social prediction errors correlate with activity in ventral striatum/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, while updates in self-esteem resulting from these errors co-varied with activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We linked computational parameters to psychiatric symptoms using canonical correlation analysis to identify an 'interpersonal vulnerability' dimension. Vulnerability modulated the expression of prediction error responses in anterior insula and insula-vmPFC connectivity during self-esteem updates. Our findings indicate that updating of self-evaluative beliefs relies on learning mechanisms akin to those used in learning about others. Enhanced insula-vmPFC connectivity during updating of those beliefs may represent a marker for psychiatric vulnerability."}, {"Title": "Suicide by Medication Overdose in Prison: A Study of Three Cases.", "Abstract": "Suicide is one of the principal causes of mortality in a prison environment.

As the number of diversion programs, including mental health courts, continues to rapidly grow, so does the need for \"diversion evaluations\". Diversion evaluations are a type of forensic mental health assessment (FMHA) conducted to assist the courts in making decisions regarding diversion eligibility. As a result, they should follow the general principles of FMHA and the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law Practice Guideline for Forensic Assessment. Diversion evaluations also require application of specific areas of knowledge and experience, as court-based diversion is a unique, therapeutically focused context that is purposefully non-adversarial. The diversion evaluator is a role that combines objective decision-making with clinical consultation.

However, it is not a unitary disease-it is a heterogeneous syndrome, with patients differing remarkably in symptom profile, pathophysiology and treatment responsiveness. Previous attempts to subtype major depressive disorder have showed limited clinical applicability. We present a classification of major depressive disorder episodes based on the proximate mechanisms that led to the original mood change that caused the depressive episode. We identify discrete depression subtypes that are induced by: 1) infection, 2) long-term stress, 3) loneliness, 4) traumatic experience, 5) hierarchy conflict, 6) grief, 7) romantic rejection, 8) postpartum events, 9) the season, 10) chemicals, 11) somatic diseases and 12) starvation. We further examine the ultimate functions of these subtypes and show that not all types of mood changes that trigger depression are adaptive. Instead, some are clearly maladaptive and some are byproducts of other adaptations. In modern societies, low mood after adverse life events may turn into a pathological depressive state. Modern lifestyle increases susceptibility to inflammatory dysregulation and chronic stress, both of which increase the amount of proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood, leading to low mood and sickness behaviour. Proinflammatory cytokines may aggravate the previously adaptive short-term mood changes to a chronic maladaptive depressive state by preventing the normalization of mood after adverse life events. Subtyping depression enables an effective and intelligent long-term treatment of patients in each subtype by treating the underlying causes of depression."}, {"Title": "Gene-environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions.", "Abstract": "Empirical studies suggest that psychiatric disorders result from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.

One possible approach to avert it is the preventive treatment of individuals with a sexual interest in children. The aim of the current eye tracking study was to compare people with a self-reported sexual interest in children who participate in the outpatient preventive treatment project \"PsM\", pedophilic forensic inpatients, and a non-pedophilic control group. Groups were compared with respect to sexual interest and attentional control in the presence of sexual stimuli, both assessed independently of self-report. Two approaches were applied, namely the initial orientation approach for measuring sexual interest, and a sexual distractor task for measuring attentional control. Our data showed for the first time that outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children differed from pedophilic forensic inpatients with respect to attentional control but not with regard to sexual interest. Outpatients showed similar sexual interest in children as pedophilic forensic inpatients. They demonstrated significantly better attentional control than pedophilic forensic inpatients in the face of adult sexual stimuli, but the difference regarding child sexual stimuli did not reach significance. This might reflect a higher capacity for self-control and self-regulation in these patients. Nevertheless, child stimuli remain to be important distractors for them. Our results provide valuable additional information for the diagnosis and therapy of outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children.

This review focuses on prospective longitudinal studies in 22q11DS, which capture fluctuations in psychosis symptoms over time and may provide insights into potential demographic, clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging predictors of psychosis-spectrum outcomes in the general population. Findings are compared and contrasted with those from idiopathic psychosis-spectrum populations. Onset of psychotic disorders in 22q11DS can occur over a wide range of ages, peaking in late adolescence. Symptoms may be gradually progressive or episodic in nature, highlighting the importance and challenge of risk and resilience prediction models. Converging results suggest that psychosis-spectrum outcomes in 22q11DS are predicted by lower baseline functioning, higher baseline psychosis-spectrum symptoms, presence of mood disturbance or anxiety, and lower baseline and subsequent decline in global measures of cognition. Predictors of transition to threshold psychotic disorders and ages of onset are similar in idiopathic clinical risk. They also share similarly global cognitive deficits, but not to the same extent as in 22q11DS. While neuroimaging studies in idiopathic clinical risk suggest loss of prefrontal gray matter, there is no consistent evidence yet emerging in the limited literature in 22q11DS. Interventional efforts in 22q11DS aimed at halting progression to psychosis or mitigating outcomes in early psychosis may be best implemented during the adolescent age range.

K\u00fcchenhoff, Augustin, and Kunz (2012) provided a statistical method for estimating confidence intervals of the prevalence based on the well-known kappa coefficient of interrater agreement. We expand this method and derive confidence intervals for the probability of a diagnosis being true (i.e., the positive predictive value). We illustrate the method and its results with empirical data for a particular type of paraphilia (pedophilia) in sexual offenders. The findings indicate that up to 1 in 3 diagnoses of pedophilia may be wrong. Given the similar rates of prevalence and interrater agreement reported for diagnoses in general psychiatry (such as schizophrenia or affective disorders), the results likely apply to other diagnostic domains as well.

In order to solve the problem integration of mental health into primary health care is recommended and in Ethiopia implementation of the scale of mental health services at primary health care level was started in 2014. For the success of the integration of mental health into primary health care, primary care health professionals are the key personnel who are responsible for the management of mental, neurologic and substance use disorders. However, proper training and education of primary care health professionals is mandatory for an optimal performance and success of integration. This interventional study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of mental health training course for scale up of mental health services at primary health care level in Ethiopia.\nThis quasi-experimental pre- and post-study design was conducted in Ethiopia from October to December 2016 using quantitative data collection methods. A total of 94 primary health care professionals were included in the study. The intervention was conducted by psychiatry professionals using standardized World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guide prepared for scaling up of mental health care through integration into primary health care (PHC) and general medical services. Pre- and post intervention assessment was done for knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP); and statistically analyzed. A paired sample <i>t</i> test with p values was performed to test the differences between the pre- and post-test. In additions mean and standard deviation of the responses were calculated. Overall the response rate was 100% at the end of the intervention.\nThe study resulted in a significant improvement in knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of PHC workers about all the four mental, neurologic and substance use disorders during the post intervention survey (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Post intervention the knowledge of health professionals increased by 53.19% for psychosis, 42.56% for depression, 19.25% for epilepsy and 54.22% for alcohol use disorders. Similarly, post intervention attitude increased by 55.32% for psychosis, 40.42% for depression, 36.17% for epilepsy and 43.6% for alcohol use disorders.

Results revealed a robust three-component structure underlying mentalized affectivity, which we labeled: Identifying emotions (the ability to identify emotions and to reflect on the factors that influence them); Processing emotions (the ability to modulate and distinguish complex emotions); and Expressing emotions (the tendency to express emotions outwardly or inwardly). Hierarchical modeling suggested that Processing emotions delineates from Identifying them, and Expressing emotions delineates from Processing them. We then showed how these components are associated with personality traits, well-being, trauma, and 18 different psychological disorders (including mood, neurological, and personality disorders). Notably, those with anxiety, mood, and personality disorders showed a profile of high Identifying and low Processing compared to controls. Further, results showed how mentalized affectivity scores varied across psychological treatment modalities and years spent in therapy.

Accordingly, the symbolic meaning of tattoos has evolved over time and is highly individualized, from both the internal perspective of the wearer and the external perspective of an observer. Within modern Western societies through the 1970s, tattoos represented a cultural taboo, typically associated with those outside of the mainstream such as soldiers, incarcerated criminals, gang members, and others belonging to marginalized and counter-cultural groups. This paper aims to review the more recent epidemiology of tattoos in Western culture in order to establish that tattooing has become a mainstream phenomenon. We then review psychological and psychiatric aspects of tattoos, with a goal of revising outmoded stigmas about tattooing and helping clinicians working with tattooed patients to facilitate an exploration of the personal meaning of skin art and self-identity. We suggest that as a kind of augmentation of the physical exam, looking at and talking to patients about their tattoos can provide a valuable window into the psyche, informing clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Photo-elicitation with adolescents in qualitative research: an example of its use in exploring family interactions in adolescent psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Photo-elicitation is a method used increasingly often in qualitative health research, and its positive effect on the research process is well established today.

Nonetheless, it is barely used at all in the field of adolescent psychiatry. With the aim of exploring the potential of these methods for research with adolescents receiving psychiatric care, we conducted a qualitative photo-elicitation data collection study with this population, asking them about family interactions around food.\nThe data were collected from 15 adolescents and 17 parents during semi-structured interviews in which a photo taken by the adolescent served as the focus of discussion. Data were explored through inductive thematic analysis.\nPhoto-elicitation played a threefold role in this study: (1) it induced the teens' interest, thought, and pleasure, (2) it played a mediating function during the interviews, and (3) it enabled family interactions to be viewed from the adolescent's perspective. Three themes concerning family interactions were found: (1) parent-child relationship patterns, (2) the functioning of the family group, and (3) the adolescent's individual relation with food, that is, the issue of the adolescent's autonomy.\nPhoto-elicitation proved to be an innovative technique in qualitative research in the area of adolescent psychiatry, one that enriched the data and enabled the emergence of new themes in this field, related in particular to the process by which adolescents develop autonomy."}, {"Title": "Current Challenges and Future Opportunities for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Japan.", "Abstract": "Japan has been facing a serious shortfall of child and adolescent psychiatric workforce relative to increasing service needs. Likely because of a combination of limited workforce supply and limited trust or perception of effectiveness, mental health services are under-utilized by the educational and child welfare systems. Child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) has not been a formally established specialty in Japan. The lack of basic structure in the specialty most likely contributes to a lack of training facilities, limited exposure to and interest in the specialty, and hence an inadequate workforce. To date, there exists no standardized training program for CAP in Japan and each training hospital determines its own teaching curriculum and training content. Clinical experience in CAP varies greatly among hospitals. To solve current problems in child and adolescent psychiatry in Japan, we advocate for the development and establishment of a more standardized child and adolescent psychiatry training system that is akin to what exists in the US and that teaches and evaluates according to specific competencies. Through standardizing care and education and ultimately improving workforce, the quality of mental health services can be raised.

Dual diagnosis is associated with difficulties in the stratification and treatment of patients. One of the major challenges in clinical practice of addiction psychiatry is the lack of objective biological markers that indicate the degree of consumption, severity of addiction, level of toxicity and response to treatment in patients with CUD. These potential biomarkers would be fundamental players in the diagnosis, stratification, prognosis and therapeutic orientation in addiction. Due to growing evidence of the involvement of the immune system in addiction and psychiatric disorders, we tested the hypothesis that patients with CUD in abstinence might have altered circulating levels of signaling proteins related to systemic inflammation.\nThe study was designed as a cross-sectional study of CUD treatment-seeking patients. These patients were recruited from outpatient programs in the province of Malaga (Spain). The study was performed with a total of 160 white Caucasian subjects, who were divided into the following groups: patients diagnosed with CUD in abstinence (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a079, cocaine group) and matched control subjects (<i>N</i>\u00a0=\u00a081, control group). Participants were clinically evaluated with the diagnostic interview PRISM according to the DSM-IV-TR, and blood samples were collected for the determination of chemokine C-C motif ligand 11 (CCL11, eotaxin-1), interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-17\u03b1 (IL-17\u03b1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) and transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1) levels in the plasma. Clinical and biochemical data were analyzed in order to find relationships between variables.\nWhile 57% of patients with CUD were diagnosed with dual diagnosis, approximately 73% of patients had other substance use disorders. Cocaine patients displayed greater cocaine symptom severity when they were diagnosed with psychiatric comorbidity. Regarding inflammatory factors, we observed significantly lower plasma levels of IL-17\u03b1 (<i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.001), MIP-1\u03b1 (<i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and TGF\u03b1 (<i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the cocaine group compared with the levels in the control group. Finally, there was a significant primary effect of dual diagnosis on the plasma concentrations of TGF\u03b1 (<i>p</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the cocaine group, and these levels were lower in patients with dual diagnoses.\nIL-17\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1 and TGF\u03b1 levels are different between the cocaine and control groups, and TGF\u03b1 levels facilitate the identification of patients with dual diagnosis. Because TGF\u03b1 reduction is associated with enhanced responses to cocaine in preclinical models, we propose TGF\u03b1 as a potential biomarker of complex CUD in humans."}, {"Title": "Suicide in Castellon, 2009-2015: Do sociodemographic and psychiatric factors help understand urban-rural differences?", "Abstract": "Studies have pointed to rurality as an important factor influencing suicide.

While psychiatry and neurology, both of which deal with brain diseases, have a historical standing as distinct disciplines, there has been an increasing need to have a combined neuropsychiatric approach to deal with many conditions and disorders. Additionally, there is a body of disorders and conditions that warrants the skills sets and knowledge bases of both disciplines. This is the territory covered by the subspecialty of Neuropsychiatry from a 'mental' health perspective and Behavioural Neurology from a 'brain' health perspective. This paper elaborates the neuropsychiatric approach to dealing with brain diseases, but also argues for the delineation of a neuropsychiatric territory. In the process, it describes a curriculum for the training of a neuropsychiatrist or a behavioural neurologist who is competent in providing a unified approach to the diagnosis and management of this set of conditions and disorders. The paper describes in some detail the objectives of training in neuropsychiatry and the key competencies that should be achieved in such higher training after a foundational training in psychiatry and neurology. While aiming for an internationally relevant training program, the paper acknowledges the local and regional differences in training expertise and requirements. It provides a common framework of training for both Neuropsychiatry and Behavioural Neurology, while accepting the differences in skills and emphasis that basic training in psychiatry or neurology will bring to the subspecialty training. The future of Neuropsychiatry (or Behavioural Neurology) as a discipline will be influenced by the successful adoption of such a unified training curriculum."}, {"Title": "Mental illness stigma among medical students and teachers.", "Abstract": "Medical school curriculum contributes to future doctors' attitude formation towards people with mental illness.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare stigmatizing attitudes between medical students and faculty, analyse stigmatizing attitudes among students from different years of study and identify factors predicting stigma.\nA cross-sectional study with the use of scales measuring attitudes and social distance was designed. Online questionnaires were distributed to all students and teachers at a medical faculty in the Czech Republic.\nThe response rate was 32.1% ( n\u2009=\u2009308) among students and 26.7% ( n\u2009=\u2009149) among teachers. Teachers had a greater prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes than students. Increased tolerant attitudes in students were detected after the fourth year, that is, following introduction to psychiatry. Preferred specialization in psychiatry and attending two psychiatry courses predicted more tolerant attitudes. Among both students and teachers, men possessed more stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness. Age was an important predictor of stigmatizing attitudes among teachers.\nEducators should pay closer attention to the role of medical psychology and communication training implementation, which may be beneficial to improving skills and increasing medical students' self-esteem and feeling of competence throughout their psychiatry rotation."}, {"Title": "Exploring the East-West Divide in Prevalence of Affective Disorder: A Case for Cultural Differences in Coping With Negative Emotion.", "Abstract": "Lifetime rates of clinical depression and anxiety in the West tend to be approximately 4 to 10 times greater than rates in Asia. In this review, we explore one possible reason for this cross-cultural difference, that Asian cultures think differently about emotion than do Western cultures and that these different systems of thought help explain why negative affect does not escalate into clinical disorder at the same rate. We review research from multiple disciplines-including cross-cultural psychology, social cognition, clinical psychology, and psychiatry-to make the case that the Eastern holistic principles of contradiction (each experience is associated with its opposite), change (the world exists in a state of constant flux), and context (the interconnectedness of all things) fundamentally shape people's experience of emotions in different cultures. We then review evidence for how these cultural differences influence how successfully people use common emotion regulation strategies such as rumination and suppression."}, {"Title": "On being supervised: getting value from a clinical supervisor and making the relationship work when it is not.", "Abstract": "The importance of clinical supervision is emphasised in psychiatric training programs. Despite this, the purpose and processes of supervision are often poorly defined. There is limited guidance available for trainees about their role in making supervision work. This paper considers the nature of supervision in psychiatric training and provides practical advice to help supervisees take active steps to make supervision work.\nIn obtaining value from supervision, the active role of the supervisee in seeking feedback, finding value in criticism and building autonomy is emphasised. Additionally, the importance of exploring what value a supervisor can offer and maintaining realistic expectations is considered. Trainees can benefit from taking an active role in planning and managing their supervision to maximise their learning."}, {"Title": "Psychostimulants As Cognitive Enhancers in Adolescents: More Risk than Reward?", "Abstract": "Methylphenidate and other psychostimulants, originally developed to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, are increasingly abused by healthy adolescents and adults seeking an advantage in scholastic performance and work productivity. However, how these drugs may affect cognitive performance, especially in the young brain, remains unclear. Here, we review recent literature and emphasize the risks of abuse of psychostimulants in healthy adolescents and young adults. We conclude that while the desire for cognitive enhancement, particularly with rising costs of education and increasingly competitive nature of scholarship programs, is unlikely to diminish in the near future, it is crucial for the scientific community to thoroughly examine the efficacy and safety of these stimulants in healthy populations across development. The current dearth of knowledge on the dose-response curve, metabolism, and cognitive outcomes in adolescents following methylphenidate or other psychostimulant exposure may be perpetuating a perception of these drugs as \"safe\" when that might not be true for developing brains."}, {"Title": "Is Schizophrenia a Disorder of Consciousness? Experimental and Phenomenological Support for Anomalous Unconscious Processing.", "Abstract": "Decades ago, several authors have proposed that disorders in automatic processing lead to intrusive symptoms or abnormal contents in the consciousness of people with schizophrenia. However, since then, studies have mainly highlighted difficulties in patients' conscious experiencing and processing but rarely explored how unconscious and conscious mechanisms may interact in producing this experience. We report three lines of research, focusing on the processing of spatial frequencies, unpleasant information, and time-event structure that suggest that impairments occur at both the unconscious and conscious level. We argue that focusing on unconscious, physiological and automatic processing of information in patients, while contrasting that processing with conscious processing, is a first required step before understanding how distortions or other impairments emerge at the conscious level. We then indicate that the phenomenological tradition of psychiatry supports a similar claim and provides a theoretical framework helping to understand the relationship between the impairments and clinical symptoms. We base our argument on the presence of disorders in the minimal self in patients with schizophrenia. The minimal self is tacit and non-verbal and refers to the sense of bodily presence. We argue this sense is shaped by unconscious processes, whose alteration may thus affect the feeling of being a unique individual. This justifies a focus on unconscious mechanisms and a distinction from those associated with consciousness."}, {"Title": "From Serotonin to Neuroplasticity: Evolvement of Theories for Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "The serotonin (5-HT) hypothesis of depression has played an important role in the history of psychiatry, yet it has also been criticized for the delayed onset and inadequate efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). With evolvement of neuroscience, the neuroplasticity hypothesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been proposed and may provide a better framework for clarification the pathogenesis of MDD and antidepressant efficacy. In this article, we first summarized the evidence challenging the monoamine hypothesis and proposed that the antidepressant efficacy of SSRIs is not derived from elevated monoamine (5-HT, noradrenaline (NE), or dopamine (DA)) concentration or monoamine neurotransmission. Second, we reviewed the role of stress in the pathogenesis of MDD and gave a brief introduction to the neuroplasticity hypothesis of MDD. Third, we explored the possible mechanisms underlying the antidepressant efficacy of typical antidepressants in the context of neuroplasticity theory. Fourth, we tried to provide an explanatory framework for the significant difference in onset of efficacy between typical antidepressants and ketamine. Finally, we provided a brief summarization about this review article and some perspectives for future studies."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of 5-HTTLPR Gene Polymorphism and Resilience Components on the Development of Psychopathology in Adolescent Sexual Abuse Cases.", "Abstract": "More than one-fourth adolescents are exposed to unexpected frightening experiences and traumas until adulthood. In this study, we aimed to determine the potential role of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphism regarding resilience factors in the symptom variability of individuals exposed to sexual abuse.\nAdolescents aged 11-17 years, who were admitted to the Marmara University Child Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic Forensic division with sexual abuse experience history, were informed about the research, and volunteers were included in the study. Turkish versions of \"Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL)\" was used to assess the psychopathology and functionality. The evaluation of participants also included self-reports based on \"Eysenck Personality Inventory\" and \"Ways of Coping Inventory\" for reflecting the resilience domain.\nThe sample included 16 girls (88.9%) and 2 boys (11.1%), and the mean (\u00b1standard deviation) age was 14.58\u00b11.97 years. Genotyping of the insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the 5-HTT gene's transcriptional control zone was established, and 8 participants (44.4%) were determined to be of the LL genotype, while 7 (38.8%) were LS and 3 (16.6%) were SS carriers. Considering the relationship between coping styles regarding resilience and genetic variants, 87.5% of participants (n=7) exhibiting problem-focused coping style were determined found to carry the LL allele, while 90% (n=9) who exhibited emotion-focused coping styles were the SS-LS allele carriers (p=0.003).\nOur findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism has a significant impact on the formation of coping styles.

For reliability analyses, the internal consistency coefficient and the test-retest correlation coefficient were measured. For validity analyses, the exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis with the Child Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index for concurrent validity were measured.\nThe Cronbach's alpha (the internal consistency coefficient) of the scale was 0.909, and the test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.663. One factor that could explain 58.5% of the variance was obtained and was congruent with the original construct of the scale.

Standardized abstraction tools were used to assess the electronic health records from 8,005 hospitalizations. Medical record administrators screened the records for the presence of ten specific types of patient safety events, which, when present, were evaluated by physician reviewers to assess whether the event was the result of an error, whether it caused harm, and whether it was preventable.\nApproximately one in five patients experienced a patient safety event. The most frequently occurring events were medication errors (which include delayed and missed doses) (17.2%), followed by adverse drug events (4.1%), falls (2.8%), and assault (1.0%). Most patient safety events (94.9%) resulted in little harm or no harm, and more than half (56.6%) of the events were deemed preventable.\nAlthough patient safety events in VHA psychiatric inpatient units were relatively common, a great majority of these events resulted in little or no patient harm.

Clinical records on 494 pediatric psychiatric emergencies included ED length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. Satisfaction surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians.\nCompared with children who received usual care, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ED lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p<.001) and lower total patient charges ($3,493 and $8,611, p<.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported high satisfaction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition.\nMeasured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediatric psychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consultation at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs."}, {"Title": "A Change in Perspective: From Dual Diagnosis to Multimorbidity.", "Abstract": "There has been increasing interest within psychiatry in the concept of multimorbidity because psychiatric patients typically present with multiple concurrent disorders, these disorders mutually exacerbate one another, and their interaction shapes treatment options.

Collaborative care networks in both arms involved health care and other agencies in five service sectors. This study examined six- and 12-month outcomes for CPIC participants with serious mental illness.\nThis secondary analysis focused on low-income CPIC participants from racial-ethnic minority groups with serious mental illness in underresourced Los Angeles communities (N=504). Serious mental illness was defined as self-reported severe depression (\u226520 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at baseline or a lifetime history of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Logistic and Poisson regression with multiple imputation and response weights, controlling for covariates, was used to model intervention effects.\nAmong CPIC participants, 50% had serious mental illness. Among those with serious mental illness, CEP relative to RS reduced the likelihood of poor mental health-related quality of life (OR=.62, 95% CI=.41-.95) but not depression (primary outcomes); reduced the likelihood of having homelessness risk factors and behavioral health hospitalizations; increased the likelihood of mental wellness; reduced specialty mental health medication and counseling visits; and increased faith-based depression visits (each p<.05) at six months. There were no statistically significant 12-month effects.\nFindings suggest that a coalition approach to implementing expanded collaborative depression care, compared with technical assistance to individual programs, may reduce short-term behavioral health hospitalizations and improve mental health-related quality of life and some social outcomes for adults with serious mental illness, although no evidence was found for long-term effects in this subsample."}, {"Title": "Moving concussion care to the next level: The emergence and role of concussion clinics in the UK.", "Abstract": "Concussion is a worldwide issue in sports medicine at present, and in recent years has evolved into a major consideration for sports in the United Kingdom (UK).

Here, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment with psilocybin (serotonin agonist) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Quality pre and post treatment fMRI data were collected from 16 of 19 patients. Decreased depressive symptoms were observed in all 19 patients at 1-week post-treatment and 47% met criteria for response at 5 weeks. Whole-brain analyses revealed post-treatment decreases in CBF in the temporal cortex, including the amygdala. Decreased amygdala CBF correlated with reduced depressive symptoms. Focusing on a priori selected circuitry for RSFC analyses, increased RSFC was observed within the default-mode network (DMN) post-treatment. Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-bilateral inferior lateral parietal cortex RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5-weeks, as was decreased parahippocampal-prefrontal cortex RSFC. These data fill an important knowledge gap regarding the post-treatment brain effects of psilocybin, and are the first in depressed patients. The post-treatment brain changes are different to previously observed acute effects of psilocybin and other 'psychedelics' yet were related to clinical outcomes.

Although the Goldwater Rule prohibits psychiatrists from offering diagnostic opinions on individuals they have never examined, no comparable rule exists for psychologists. We contend that, owing largely to the Goldwater Rule's origins in psychiatry, a substantial body of psychological research on assessment and clinical judgment, including work on the questionable validity of unstructured interviews, the psychology of cognitive biases, and the validity of informant reports and of L (lifetime) data, has been overlooked in discussions of its merits. We conclude that although the Goldwater Rule may have been defensible several decades ago, it is outdated and premised on dubious scientific assumptions.

Data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling.\nOur model showed that: (1) sexual and emotional abuse impact on AH both through the effect of maladaptive schemas and dissociation; (2) physical abuse impact on AH only through the effect of dissociation. More specifically, we found that four maladaptive schemas impact on AH: Abandonment, Vulnerability, Self-sacrifice and Subjugation.\nOverall, our findings indicate that specific early maladaptive schemas may play a fundamental role in the association between exposure to trauma and auditory hallucination together with dissociation symptoms in the general population.

Compared to UC, those in the pediatrician-only arm had lower odds of treatment initiation (OR=0.53, 95% CI=[0.28-0.99]), while patients in the embedded-BHC arm had marginally higher odds (OR=1.83, 95% CI=[0.99-3.38]). Black patients and those with other/unknown race/ethnicity had lower odds of treatment initiation compared with white adolescents; there were no gender or age differences. We found no differences in treatment engagement across the three arms.\nEmbedded BHCs can have a significant positive impact on facilitating treatment initiation for pediatric primary care adolescents referred to addiction and/or psychiatry services.\nClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02408952."}, {"Title": "Auditory Hallucinations as Translational Psychiatry: Evidence from Magnetic Resonance Imaging.", "Abstract": "In this invited review article, I present a translational perspective and overview of our research on auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia at the University of Bergen, Norway, with a focus on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the phenomenology of experiencing \"hearing voices\". An auditory verbal hallucination (i.e. hearing a voice) is defined as a sensory experience in the absence of a corresponding external sensory source that could explain the phenomenological experience. I suggest a general frame or scheme for the study of auditory verbal hallucinations, called Levels of Explanation. Using a Levels of Explanation approach, mental phenomena can be described and explained at different levels (cultural, clinical, cognitive, brain-imaging, cellular and molecular). Another way of saying this is that, to advance knowledge in a research field, it is not only necessary to replicate findings, but also to show how evidence obtained with one method, and at one level of explanation, converges with evidence obtained with another method at another level. To achieve breakthroughs in our understanding of auditory verbal hallucinations, we have to advance vertically through the various levels, rather than the more common approach of staying at our favourite level and advancing horizontally (e.g., more advanced techniques and data acquisition analyses). The horizontal expansion will, however, not advance a deeper understanding of how an auditory verbal hallucination spontaneously starts and stops. Finally, I present data from the clinical, cognitive, brain-imaging, and cellular levels, where data from one level validate and support data at another level, called converging of evidence. Using a translational approach, the current status of auditory verbal hallucinations is that they implicate speech perception areas in the left temporal lobe, impairing perception of and attention to external sounds. Preliminary results also show that amygdala is implicated in the emotional \u00abcolouring\u00bb of the voices and that excitatory neurotransmitters might be involved. What we do not know is why hallucinatory episodes occur spontaneously, why they fluctuate over time, and what makes them spontaneously stop. Moreover, is voice hearing a category or dimension in its own right, independent of diagnosis, and why is the auditory modality predominantly implicated in psychotic disorders, while the visual modality dominates in, for example, neurological diseases?"}, {"Title": "What Do Final Year Medical Students Understand by the Concept of Recovery? A Descriptive Qualitative Study.", "Abstract": "Traditional teaching in psychiatry does little to address recovery concepts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incorporation of a recovery-focused teaching program for medical students in psychiatry.\nRecovery, as understood by medical students who had participated in a recovery-focused teaching program, was assessed by thematic analysis of recovery-focused assessment reflections.\nSix major themes emerged from the recovery reflections from final year medical students are as follows: (1) recovery as a person-centered approach, (2) the need for social integration, (3) non-diagnostic framing of mental illness, (4) tensions between the medical model and personal recovery, (5) a patient's willingness to engage with mental health services, and (6) the development of a positive sense of self.\nA recovery teaching program was associated with students expressing knowledge of recovery principles and positive attitudes towards people with experience of mental illness.

We invited deans of 31 medical schools in the UK and Ireland in 2015 to complete an online survey to reassess the situation 16 years later. <b>Results</b> Response rate was 74%. As found in the original survey, there was variation across medical schools in how old age psychiatry is taught. Half of schools stated there was not enough space in the curriculum dedicated to old age psychiatry, and not all medical school curricula offered a clinical attachment. Medical schools that involved academic old age psychiatrists in teaching (59%) showed a greater diversity of teaching methods. <b>Clinical implications</b> There is a need to recognise the importance of old age psychiatry teaching, with the consensus of opinion continuing to be that more curriculum space needs to be given to old age psychiatry. To achieve this we advocate increasing the number of old age psychiatrists with teaching roles, as relying on academics to teach and lead on curriculum development is challenging given their greater research pressures."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric neurosurgery in the 21st century: overview and the growth of deep brain stimulation.", "Abstract": "Ambulatory deep brain stimulation (DBS) became possible in the late 1980s and was initially used to treat people with movement disorders.

By 1900, it closely resembled its modern form. This paper reviews the descriptions of mania in Western psychiatry from 1880 to 1900, when Kraepelin was training and developing his concept of manic-depressive illness. Psychiatric textbooks published 1900-1960 described 22 characteristic manic symptoms/signs the presence of which were recorded in 25 psychiatric textbooks and three other key documents published 1880-1900. Descriptions of mania in these nineteenth century textbooks closely resembled those in the twentieth century, recording a mean (s.d.) of 15.9 (2.3) and 17.0 (2.3) of the characteristic symptoms, respectively (p = 0.12). The frequency with which individual symptoms were reported was substantially correlated in these two periods (r = +0.64). Mendel's 1881 monograph, Kraepelin's first description of mania in 1883 and the entry for mania in Tuke's Dictionary of Psychological Medicine (1892) described a mean (s.d.) of 19 (1.7) of these characteristic symptoms. These descriptions of mania often contained phenomenologically rich descriptions of euphoria, hyperactivity, grandiosity, flight of ideas, and poor judgment. They also emphasized several features not in DSM criteria including changes in character, moral standards and physical appearance, and increased sense of humor and sexual drive. Fifteen authors described key symptoms/signs of mania most reporting elevated mood, motoric hyperactivity and accelerated mental processes. By 1880, the syndrome of mania had been largely stabilized in its modern form. In the formation of his concept of manic-depressive illness, Kraepelin utilized the syndrome of mania as described in the psychiatric community in which he was trained."}, {"Title": "Self-admission to inpatient treatment in psychiatry: lessons on implementation.", "Abstract": "Interest has increased in programs offering self-admission to inpatient treatment for patients with severe psychiatric illness, whereby patients who are well-known to a service are afforded the opportunity to admit themselves at will for a brief period of time.

Renowned psychiatrists have diagnosed Schumann with syphilis, schizophrenia, and bipolar and personality disorders. Until today, these analyses of his symptomatology have led to contradictory results. Recent discussion has suggested that his hospitalization was due to professional failure and separation wishes on the part of his wife, her family, and her friends. In line with this hypothesis is the opinion that the separation insisted upon by Clara Schumann was reinforced by the economic interests of the psychiatrist who kept Schumann in custody for 2 years until his death in 1856. In this article, we trace the complex interaction of bipolar vulnerability and pathogenic life events with hypersensitive talent and \"creative bipolarity,\" defined as the capacity, motivation, and resilience to transform emotional stress and cognitive inconsistency into coherent artistic products. Finally, we present our conclusions about comprehensive psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment with respect to \"creative bipolarity.\""}, {"Title": "Differential reporting of work-related mental ill-health in doctors.", "Abstract": "Evidence suggests that the medical profession is reluctant to report mental ill-health despite its high prevalence.\nTo compare differential reporting patterns in the incidence of work-related mental ill-health (WRMIH) affecting doctors with selected comparison occupational groups, as determined by surveillance by general practitioners (GPs), specialist psychiatrists and occupational physicians (OPs).\nNew cases of medically reported WRMIH were reported prospectively between 2006 and 2009 by GPs, psychiatrists and OPs as part of The Health and Occupation Research (THOR) network. For GP and psychiatry reporting schemes, incidence rates (IRs) for doctors, nurses, teachers, corporate managers and protective service workers were calculated using information from the Labour Force Survey as the denominator.

Psychiatrists reported a higher incidence of WRMIH in doctors, whereas GPs reported higher incidences of WRMIH in other occupations (chi-squared test, P < 0.001).\nThe distribution of the incidence of new cases reported across different schemes suggests a differential reporting pattern of WRMIH in doctors. The higher IR for doctors in psychiatrist-reported WRMIH could be due to factors such as disease severity and bypassing formal referral channels."}, {"Title": "The microbiome as a novel paradigm in studying stress and mental health.", "Abstract": "At the intersection between neuroscience, microbiology, and psychiatry, the enteric microbiome has potential to become a novel paradigm for studying the psychobiological underpinnings of mental illness. Several studies provide support for the view that the enteric microbiome influences behavior through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship. Finally, and drawing on these independent lines of research, an integrative conceptual model is proposed in which stress-induced enteric dysbiosis and intestinal permeability confer risk for negative mental health outcomes through immunoregulatory, endocrinal, and neural pathways.

They completed an assessment including characteristics of PLEs and bullying victimization. We paid particular attention to different kinds of PLEs and victimization.\nIn total, 50 PLE-positive adolescents screened from 324 HS adolescents (15.4%) constituted the sample. Paranoia and verbal bullying were the PLEs and form of victimization most represented, respectively. Verbal bullying was strongly associated with paranoia (odds ratio (OR): 4.40, confidence interval (CI): 2.8-5.9, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Results remained significant after controlling for confounder (socio-demographic, anxiety, depression and for the latter analysis also other forms of victimization). Furthermore, social manipulation showed a strong association of paranoia and physical bullying with grandiosity. Verbal bullying was also associated with psychotic negative symptoms, but controlling for emotional symptoms and other victimization led to a reduction in the effect. Men were more involved in physical victimization and experienced grandiosity; on the contrary, late adolescents were most involved in social victimization and negative psychotic symptoms Conclusion: PLEs are relevant in HS adolescents. Bullying victimization interacts with the onset of these phenomena. In particular, verbal bullying predicted paranoia onset significantly."}, {"Title": "Clinical research in an academic psychiatry department: some general principles and case studies.", "Abstract": "This paper gives guidance for developing collaborative clinical research within an academic psychiatry department.\nWe describe the experience at the Australian National University Medical School, and present three case studies.\nThe results reveal that general principles include, but are not limited to, intellectual curiosity, mentorship, collaboration and protected time.\nWe conclude that a particular strength of a new research department at a medical school may be close collaborative research within clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Pleiotropic genes in psychiatry: Calcium channels and the stress-related FKBP5 gene in antidepressant resistance.", "Abstract": "A candidate gene and a genome-wide approach were combined to study the pharmacogenetics of antidepressant response and resistance. Investigated genes were selected on the basis of pleiotropic effect across psychiatric phenotypes in previous genome-wide association studies and involvement in antidepressant response. Three samples with major depressive disorder (total=671) were genotyped for 44 SNPs in 8 candidate genes (CACNA1C, CACNB2, ANK3, GRM7, TCF4, ITIH3, SYNE1, FKBP5). Phenotypes were response/remission after 4weeks of treatment and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Genome-wide data from STAR*D were used to replicate findings for response/remission (n=1409) and TRD (n=620). Pathways including the most promising candidate genes were investigated in STAR*D for involvement in TRD. FKBP5 polymorphisms showed replicated but nominal associations with response, remission or TRD. CACNA1C rs1006737 and rs10848635 were the only polymorphisms that survived multiple-testing correction. In STAR*D the best pathway associated with TRD included CACNA1C (GO:0006942, permutated p=0.15). Machine learning models showed that independent SNPs in this pathway predicted TRD with a mean sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.56 after 10-fold cross validation repeated 100 times. FKBP5 polymorphisms appear good candidates for inclusion in antidepressant pharmacogenetic tests. Pathways including the CACNA1C gene may be involved in TRD and they may provide the base for developing multi-marker predictors of TRD."}, {"Title": "ED utilization of medical clearance testing for psychiatric admission: National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey analysis.", "Abstract": "Routine medical clearance testing of emergency department (ED) patients with acute psychiatric illnesses in the absence of a medical indication has minimal proven utility.

The study population was defined as ED visits by patients \u226518years old admitted to a psychiatric facility. We sought to determine the percentage of these ED visits in which at least one medical clearance test was ordered. Using a multivariate logistic regression model, we also evaluated whether patient visit factors or regional variation was associated with use of medical clearance tests.\nA medical clearance test was ordered in 80.4% of ED visits ending with a psychiatric admission. Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a statistically significant increased odds ratio (OR) of medical clearance testing based on age (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.01, 1.03), among visits involving an injury or poisoning (OR 2.38, 95%CI 1.54, 3.68), and in the Midwest region as compared to the Northeast region (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 4.46), after adjusting for other predictors.\nOur study demonstrated that, on a national level, 4 out of 5 ED visits resulting in a psychiatric facility admission had a medical clearance test ordered.

While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms ('self as subject'), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli ('self as object'). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core 'self network' (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula). This framework not only represents a step forward in self research, but also has important clinical significance, resonating recent efforts in computational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Views of people with schizophrenia and their caregivers towards the needs for psychiatric rehabilitation in urban and rural areas of mainland China.", "Abstract": "This qualitative study explores and compares the views of the individuals with schizophrenia and their caregivers in the urban and rural areas of Wuxi towards the needs for psychiatric rehabilitation.

Residual depressive symptoms may be associated with disability and functional impairment but few studies evaluated clinical correlates associated with these symptoms and their impact on functioning after adjustment for potential confounders. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate factors associated with residual depressive symptoms and their impact on the course of MDD. The sample consisted of 210 consecutive MDD euthymic outpatients (67.6% females; mean age = 52.1 \u00b1 15.5), admitted to the Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa (Italy). Residuals depressive symptoms were significantly associated with female gender; use of short half-life benzodiazepines; longer duration of the current depressive episode; higher number of illness episodes; and higher duration of illness. Conversely, prior treatment with first-generation antipsychotics, later age of illness onset and first hospitalization were less frequently observed among patients with residual symptoms. After multivariate analyses, only duration of current illness episodes (\u00df = 0.003; p = <0.005) and substance abuse (\u00df = 0.042; p = <0.05) remained significantly associated with residual symptoms. Our findings indicate that residual depressive symptoms conferred a pernicious illness course in this specific cohort of MDD patients. Future trials mainly targeting these burdensome symptoms are warranted."}, {"Title": "Prescribing practices in Southeastern Europe - focus on benzodiazepine prescription at discharge from nine university psychiatric hospitals.", "Abstract": "There is much concern about the widespread long-term use of benzodiazepines. Our manuscript addressed its use in the region of Southeastern Europe, which seems extensive, but insufficiently explored. At nine university psychiatric hospitals (Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia), we retrospectively analyzed discharge summary documents to find the prevalence of discharge benzodiazepine prescriptions and the prescribed benzodiazepine doses. This study included 1047 adult subjects and showed that 81.9% of them had benzodiazepines prescribed in the discharge summary document, with high mean daily dose of around 5mg lorazepam equivalents. Factors associated with the prescriptions were exclusively clinical factors (diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, more lifetime hospitalizations, psychiatric comorbidity, co-prescription of antidepressant or mood stabilizer, shorter duration of the hospitalization), while socio-demographic factors were not found to influence benzodiazepine discharge prescriptions. Similarly, factors which influenced the prescription of higher daily benzodiazepine dose were more lifetime psychiatric hospitalizations and co-prescription of antidepressant or mood stabilizer, as well as the diagnosis of mental/behavioral disorders due to substance use and co-prescribed antipsychotic.

This study aimed to characterize students' experiences on C-L rotations.\nThis cross-sectional survey study, sponsored by the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine Subcommittee on Medical Student Education, was conducted at 5 US medical schools between 2012 and 2016. After the C-L rotation, students completed a voluntary 17-item survey.\nA total of 235 surveys were collected (mean response rate = 92%). The most frequently endorsed benefit of C-L was learning to manage psychiatric disorders in the context of medical illness (89%). The most frequently endorsed drawback was inconsistent/excessively variable workload (40%). Overall, 82% of respondents recommended C-L to other students; 80% reported that the ideal clerkship would include exposure to both C-L and inpatient psychiatry. Overall, 38% reported that their C-L experience increased their interest in psychiatry as a career. Effect of C-L on interest in psychiatry did not differ by study site, age, sex, clerkship length, or time spent on C-L. Respondents who noted more positive role-modeling on C-L compared to other clerkship rotations were more likely to report increased interest in a psychiatry career (odds ratio = 2.70).\nMost medical students perceive C-L rotations favorably. Positive role modeling may increase their consideration of psychiatry specialization. The findings that C-L rotation length did not correlate with attitudes and that most students preferred exposure to both inpatient and C-L psychiatry suggest that C-L exposure can beneficially be integrated into core clerkships containing other elements."}, {"Title": "Recovered memories in clinical practice - a research review.", "Abstract": "The problem of recovered memories concerns not only psychiatry, psychology or psychotherapy but it is also an important legal and judicial issue.

In view of the dual purpose of the stay in a psychiatric hospital, both therapeutic and preventive, the treatment costs generated by forensic wards are higher than those of general psychiatric wards. This prompts person from outside psychiatry, who do not understand the nature of preventive measures, to call for continuing reductions in the expenditure on forensic psychiatric care.

The authors explored how the two different patient case formats influenced students' perceptions of psychiatric patients and students' reflections on meeting and communicating with psychiatric patients.\nThe authors conducted group interviews with 30 medical students who volunteered to participate in interviews and applied inductive thematic content analysis to the transcribed interviews.\nStudents taught with text-based patient cases emphasized excitement and drama towards the personal clinical narratives presented by the teachers during the course, but never referred to the patient cases. Authority and boundary setting were regarded as important in managing patients. Students taught with video-based patient cases, in contrast, often referred to the patient cases when highlighting new insights, including the importance of patient perspectives when communicating with patients.\nThe format of patient cases included in teaching may have a substantial impact on students' patient-centeredness. Video-based patient cases are probably more effective than text-based patient cases in fostering patient-centered perspectives in medical students. Teachers sharing stories from their own clinical experiences stimulates both engagement and excitement, but may also provoke unintended stigma and influence an authoritative approach in medical students towards managing patients in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "On the transdiagnostic nature of peripheral biomarkers in major psychiatric disorders: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The search for biomarkers has been a leading endeavor in biological psychiatry.

Of the six molecules most commonly studied as plasmatic markers of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, five (BDNF, TNF-alpha, IL-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol) were the same across diagnoses. An analysis of this literature showed that, while 66% of studies compared patients and controls, only 34% were longitudinal, and only 10% presented a measure of diagnostic or prognostic efficacy. Meta-analyses showed variation in the levels of these molecules to be robust across studies, but similar among disorders, suggesting them to reflect transdiagnostic systemic consequences of psychiatric illness.

Seven mental health topics were included in the analysis: generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and suicide. Readability analyses were performed using the Gunning Fog Index, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, the SMOG Readability Formula, and the Automated Readability Index.

In this paper, I examine how the concept of chronicity participates in present-day mental health care settings. Using ethnomethodology and material-semiotic theory within science and technology studies, I investigate how the classification 'chronically mentally ill' interacts with the everyday socio-material shaping of public mental health care in the context of professional institutions.\u00a0Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a psychiatric day hospital and in a community day care centre in Berlin, Germany, I demonstrate how the classification of chronicity acts as a tool of description (of people or their conditions), regulation (of therapy, health care or administration), and connection to infrastructures of care (practised technologies or standards of various kinds). In these ways, I argue, the classification engages in actions of producing treatability, arranging resources, demarcating responsibilities, practicing accountability, and doing presence. Notably, community mental health care has developed into a designated territory of the concept: explicitly arranged for 'the chronically mentally ill' as a human kind, we can take everyday life in these institutions as instructive of how chronicity is defined in daily practice."}, {"Title": "Hypertensive Encephalopathy: A Case of a Male Who Bit Off His Fingers.", "Abstract": "Although altered consciousness and other neurologic manifestations are frequently seen in hypertensive encephalopathy, behavioral and psychotic symptoms are rarely seen.

The Coercion Experience Scale (CES) and the Admission Experience Survey (AES) were used to establish the subjective impact of CI. Instruments measuring psychopathological symptoms and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) were applied alongside the Schedule for the Assessment of Illness (SAI) and the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS). Using a logistic regression approach, considered influencing factors such as number, type and patients' subjective experiences of CI, cognitive and clinical insight, psychopathological symptoms and patients' global perceptions of their hospitalisation were analysed for their predictive value of patients' attitudes towards psychiatry.\nBinary logistic regression revealed that the subjective experience of CI and the perception of fairness and effectiveness during the treatment process predict patients' attitudes towards psychiatry to a greater extent than symptom-related measures or the quantity of CI. Patients presenting a higher degree of self-reflectiveness perceive psychiatric institutions more likely as allies.\nThe manner in which coercion is subjectively experienced has direct influence on patients' perceptions of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Advancing psychiatric genetics through dissecting heterogeneity.", "Abstract": "There has been substantial progress in psychiatric genetics in recent years, through collaborative efforts to build large samples sizes for case/control analyses for a number of psychiatric disorders. The identification of replicated trait-associated genomic loci represents a large stride forward in a field where little is known about the biological processes involved in disorder. As researchers build on this early foundation, they are beginning to advance the field towards more fine-grained approaches that interrogate the many sources of heterogeneity within psychiatric genetics that can obscure the identification of genotypic influences on disorder. In this review, we provide a brief overview, across a range of psychiatric diagnoses, of recent approaches that have been employed to dissect heterogeneity to give a flavour of the current direction of the field. We group these into three main categories; tackling the heterogeneity in phenotype that is found within the diagnostic categories used within psychiatry, the many different forms of genetic variation that might influence psychiatric traits and then finally, the heterogeneity that is seen across individuals of different ancestries."}, {"Title": "[Nursing management of sensory overload in psychiatry \u2013 Theoretical densification and modification of the framework model].", "Abstract": "Background: Within the scope of the research project on the subjects of sensory overload and stimulus regulation, a theoretical framework model of the nursing care of patients with sensory overload in psychiatry was developed. In a second step, this theoretical model should now be theoretically compressed and, if necessary, modified. Aim: Empirical verification as well as modification, enhancement and theoretical densification of the framework model of nursing care of patients with sensory overload in psychiatry. Method: Analysis of 8 expert interviews by summarizing and structuring content analysis methods based on Meuser and Nagel (2009) as well as Mayring (2010). Results: The developed framework model (Scheydt et al., 2016b) could be empirically verified, theoretically densificated and extended by one category (perception modulation). Thus, four categories of nursing care of patients with sensory overload can be described in inpatient psychiatry: removal from stimuli, modulation of environmental factors, perceptual modulation as well as help somebody to help him- or herself / coping support. Conclusions: Based on the methodological approach, a relatively well-saturated, credible conceptualization of a theoretical model for the description of the nursing care of patients with sensory overload in stationary psychiatry could be worked out. In further steps, these measures have to be further developed, implemented and evaluated regarding to their efficacy."}, {"Title": "Yorkshire's influence on the understanding and treatment of mental diseases in Victorian Britain: The golden triad of York, Wakefield, and Leeds.", "Abstract": "In the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a more humane approach to the care of the insane in Britain was catalyzed in part by the illness of King George III. The Reform Movement envisaged \"moral\" treatment in asylums in pleasant rural environments, but these aspirations were overwhelmed by industrialization, urbanization, and the scale of the need, such that most asylums became gigantic institutions for chronic insanity. Three institutions in Yorkshire remained beacons of enlightenment in the general gloom of Victorian alienism: the Retreat in York founded and developed by the Quaker Tuke family; the West Riding Lunatic Asylum in Wakefield led by Sir James Crichton-Browne, which initiated research into brain and mental diseases; and the Leeds Medical School and Wakefield axis associated with Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt, which pioneered teaching of mental diseases and, later, the first Chair of Psychiatry.

Many of these interventions have been shown to be effective in studies but still find little use in everyday therapeutic work. However, it is important that attitude and expectation toward this treatment are generally examined, because these factors have an important effect on the efficacy of the treatment. To measure the general attitude of the users and prescribers toward telemedicine, which may include, for instance, Web-based interventions or interventions through mobile phone apps, there are a small number of extensive tests. The results of studies based on small groups of patients have been published too, but there is no useful short screening tool to give an insight into the general population's attitude. We have developed a screening instrument that examines such attitude through a few graded questions.\nThis study aimed to explore the Attitude toward Telemedicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (ATiPP) and to evaluate the results of general population and some subgroups.\nIn a three-step process, the questionnaire, which is available in three versions (laypeople, physicians, and psychologists), was developed. Afterwards, it was evaluated by four groups: population-representative laypeople, outpatients in different faculties, physicians, and psychotherapists.\nThe results were evaluated from a total of 1554 questionnaires. The sample population included 1000 laypeople, 455 outpatients, 62 physicians, and 37 psychotherapists. The reliability of all three versions of the questionnaire seemed good, as indicated by the Cronbach alpha values of .849 (the laypeople group), .80 (the outpatients' group), .827 (the physicians' group), and .855 (the psychotherapists' group).\nThe ATiPP was found to be useful and reliable for measuring the attitudes toward the Web-based interventions in psychiatry and psychotherapy and should be used in different studies in this field in the future to evaluate and reflect the attitude of the participants."}, {"Title": "[Success Factors and Stumbling Blocks in the Cooperation with Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychotherapy from the Perspective of Social Pedagogues].", "Abstract": "Success Factors and Stumbling Blocks in the Cooperation with Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychotherapy from the Perspective of Social Pedagogues In numerous current studies, experts describe a need for improved cooperation between employees of youth welfare and child and adolescent psychiatry/-psychotherapy.

The objective of this paper was to review the evidence regarding the use of clinical simulation training in geriatric medicine education and consider how the findings may be translated to education in the closely related field of psychiatry of old age. Original papers and descriptive case studies of clinical simulation training programs for medical professionals were considered for inclusion. Papers were grouped according to the participants' level of training: (1) undergraduate medical education; (2) postgraduate medical education; and (3) multiple levels of medical learners. A diverse range of effective simulation modalities for teaching geriatric medicine was identified across all levels of learning. The evidence suggests that there is much fertile ground for trainees in geriatric medicine and psychiatry of old age to participate in joint simulation training programs, thereby maximising their reach while minimising associated resource requirements and financials costs. Given the prominent position of psychiatry of old age at the interface between psychiatry and medicine, old age psychiatrists potentially have much to offer in advancing the field of clinical simulation while simultaneously improving patient care."}, {"Title": "Programmatic Assessment of Professionalism in Psychiatry Education: A Literature Review and Implementation Guide.", "Abstract": "Programmatic assessment is being adopted as a preferred method of assessment in postgraduate medical education in Australia.

Only original articles relevant to professionalism education and assessment in psychiatry were selected, rather than theoretical or review papers that applied research from other fields of medicine to psychiatry.

Within psychiatry, the specific evidence base for use of particular tools in assessing professionalism is limited. However, used in conjunction with psychiatrists' views about what is important in professionalism education, as well as knowledge from other medical disciplines regarding professionalism assessment tools, this evidence can inform implementation of programmatic assessment of professionalism in undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing professional development settings.

This paper reviews the literature regarding the use of OSCE as an assessment tool in both undergraduate and postgraduate psychiatry training settings. Suitable articles were identified using the search terms 'psychiatry AND OSCE' in the ERIC (educational) and PubMed (healthcare) databases and grouped according to their predominant focus: (1) the validity of OSCEs in psychiatry; (2) candidate preparation and other factors impacting on performance; and (3) special topics. The literature suggests that the OSCE has been widely adopted in psychiatry education, as a valid and reliable method of assessing psychiatric competencies that is acceptable to both learners and teachers alike. The limited evidence base regarding its validity for postgraduate psychiatry examinations suggests that more research is needed in this domain. Despite any shortcomings, OSCEs are currently ubiquitous in all areas of undergraduate and postgraduate medicine and proposing a better alternative for competency-based assessment is difficult. A critical question is whether OSCE is sufficient on its own to assess high-level consultancy skills, and aspects of professionalism and ethical practice, that are essential for effective specialist practice, or whether it needs to be supplemented by additional testing modalities."}, {"Title": "Moderating Nutritious Habits in Psychiatric Patients Using Transtheoretical Model of Change and Counseling.", "Abstract": "Motivational Interviewing provides the opportunity to health professionals to have an effective strategy to increase the level of readiness to change health behaviors.

It was hypothesized that axonal myelination would be related to openness, thus linking trait creativity and mental illness.\nWe recruited 37 healthy subjects and administered the NEO Five-Factor Inventory to assess personality factors. Regional T1w/T2w MRI values were computed as surrogate indicators of myelination status and correlations between T1w/T2w values and various personality factors (e.g., trait of openness) were calculated with a voxel-based analysis using statistical parametric mapping.\nSignificant negative correlations were identified between the trait of openness and T1w/T2w values in the medial frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior insula/adjacent putamen. These relationships remained significant even after adjusting for age, sex, and education as covariates. There were no significant correlations between other personality factors and regional volumes.\nIndividual differences in openness may be associated with variations in intra-cortical myelination, specifically in the imaginative network of the brain including the midline core 'hubs' of the default mode network (anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) and regions related to motivational state (posterior insula and adjacent putamen).

While almost all classification systems of modern psychiatry, such as the ICD-10 and the DSM-5, have abandoned the specific category of paranoia, Lacan always viewed paranoia as a major category of \"functional psychosis\". He held that paranoia was a qualitatively different disorder than schizophrenia, and considered it to be the principal or exemplary form of psychosis. Furthermore, in the middle period of his work, Lacan thought of paranoia in much broader terms than those of the definition proposed by Kraepelin, which he revisited, point by point, developing his theory of Freud's concept of \"<i>Verwerfung</i>\" or foreclosure; the latter became the focal diagnostic criterion in his nosographic construction. Lacan's privileging of and evolving theoretical views on paranoia provide a structural approach to what he called the \"resistant nucleus\" of psychosis; his work serves as a counterpoint to the more descriptive neo-Kraepelinian approach of contemporary psychiatric nosology."}, {"Title": "Understanding psychiatric disorder by capturing ecologically relevant features of learning and decision-making.", "Abstract": "Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has begun to uncover the processes underlying increasingly complex voluntary behaviours, including learning and decision-making. Partly this success has been possible by progressing from simple experimental tasks to paradigms that incorporate more ecological features. More specifically, the premise is that to understand cognitions and brain functions relevant for real life, we need to introduce some of the ecological challenges that we have evolved to solve. This often entails an increase in task complexity, which can be managed by using computational models to help parse complex behaviours into specific component mechanisms. Here we propose that using computational models with tasks that capture ecologically relevant learning and decision-making processes may provide a critical advantage for capturing the mechanisms underlying symptoms of disorders in psychiatry. As a result, it may help develop mechanistic approaches towards diagnosis and treatment. We begin this review by mapping out the basic concepts and models of learning and decision-making. We then move on to consider specific challenges that emerge in realistic environments and describe how they can be captured by tasks. These include changes of context, uncertainty, reflexive/emotional biases, cost-benefit decision-making, and balancing exploration and exploitation. Where appropriate we highlight future or current links to psychiatry. We particularly draw examples from research on clinical depression, a disorder that greatly compromises motivated behaviours in real-life, but where simpler paradigms have yielded mixed results.

Participants completed a predictive-inference task designed to identify how action and confidence evolve in response to surprising changes in the environment. While OCD patients (like controls) correctly updated their confidence according to changes in the environment, their actions (unlike those of controls) mostly disregarded this knowledge. Therefore, OCD patients develop an accurate, internal model of the environment but fail to use it to guide behavior. Results demonstrated a novel dissociation between confidence and action, suggesting a\u00a0cognitive architecture whereby confidence estimates can accurately track the statistic of the environment independently from performance."}, {"Title": "Developing capacity-building activities for mental health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries for service users and caregivers, service planners, and researchers.", "Abstract": "There is increasing international recognition of the need to build capacity to strengthen mental health systems. This is a fundamental goal of the 'Emerging mental health systems in low- and middle-income countries' (Emerald) programme, which is being implemented in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda). This paper discusses Emerald's capacity-building approaches and outputs for three target groups in mental health system strengthening: (1) mental health service users and caregivers, (2) service planners and policy-makers, and (3) mental health researchers. When planning the capacity-building activities, the approach taken included a capabilities/skills matrix, needs assessments, a situational analysis, systematic reviews, qualitative interviews and stakeholder meetings, as well as the application of previous theory, evidence and experience. Each of the Emerald LMIC partners was found to have strengths in aspects of mental health system strengthening, which were complementary across the consortium. Furthermore, despite similarities across the countries, capacity-building interventions needed to be tailored to suit the specific needs of individual countries. The capacity-building outputs include three publicly and freely available short courses/workshops in mental health system strengthening for each of the target groups, 27 Masters-level modules (also open access), nine Emerald-linked PhD students, two MSc studentships, mentoring of post-doctoral/mid-level researchers, and ongoing collaboration and dialogue with the three groups. The approach taken by Emerald can provide a potential model for the development of capacity-building activities across the three target groups in LMICs."}, {"Title": "Pregabalin Use Among Users of Illicit Drugs: A Cross-Sectional Survey in Southern Germany.", "Abstract": "The antiepileptic drug pregabalin is one of the best-selling pharmaceutical products worldwide. There are increasing concerns about its potential for misuse and dependence especially among patients with former or current substance use disorders (SUDs).\nOur objective was to clarify the extent and pattern of pregabalin use as well as motives and predictors in this population.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study with patients on a detoxification ward for illicit drugs at the Center for Psychiatry, S\u00fcdw\u00fcrttemberg, Ravensburg in southern Germany from August 2012 until July 2013. We used an extensive questionnaire, part of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) and urine samples.\nOf the 253 participating patients, 56% had used pregabalin at least once. Of these, 92% had acquired it at least in part from illegal sources. The main motives for the use of pregabalin were the attenuation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, the augmentation of other psychotropic substances, and the psychotropic effects of pregabalin itself. Predictors for pregabalin use were opioid and sedative use as well as younger age. The criteria of dependency according to DSM-IV was met by 11% of pregabalin users and 13% of urine samples were positive for pregabalin.\nUse of pregabalin is common among users of illicit drugs in large parts of southern Germany, with motives for use, acquisition, and mode of use suggesting misuse. The mode of use, especially intake of high doses and concomitant use of other drugs, poses a serious risk to this population, including the development of dependency."}, {"Title": "Surveying Psychiatrists' Psychopharmacology Practices Across Common Clinical Scenarios.", "Abstract": "The practice of psychopharmacology has become increasingly complex with the expansion of medication options across psychiatric conditions. The level of variability among psychiatrists in their application of medication treatments has received little attention to date. We surveyed 111 psychiatrists attending one of two annual psychiatry meetings in 2017, asking whether they agreed or disagreed with statements about psychopharmacological approaches to 14 common clinical scenarios. High consistency was found for six scenarios, which generally reflected published treatment guidelines, and in recommending that their patients avoid using marijuana. However, low consistency was found for seven scenarios, particularly for statements addressing the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications. These statements of low consistency generally reflected contradictions or ambiguity across treatment guidelines. In comparison with male psychiatrists, female psychiatrists' responses revealed greater caution around use of medications with addictive potential. Responses to statements were not associated with psychiatrists' perceived adequacy of psychopharmacology training received during residency. Although psychiatrists have high consistency in some aspects of psychopharmacological practice, significant variability exists in important areas of medication use. The consistency of psychotropic medication prescribing may be improved through conducting practical clinical trials that address the existing evidence gaps and by developing educational materials targeting areas of prescriber disagreement."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Military-Connected Families: The Relevance of a Family-Centered Approach.", "Abstract": "Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, military service in the United States has been linked to a range of behavioral health and physical injuries in a significant number of the almost three million service members who have returned from wartime deployment. These injuries have occurred in the larger context of wartime military service, which is characterized by an array of stressors that have been associated with increased risk for behavioral health problems not only for service members but also for their family members. For the past 15 years, military-connected (defined as active-duty, reserve component, and veteran) family members have shared their own experiences of military service, including multiple deployments in the context of danger, high operational stress within their communities, and living with the physical and behavioral health injuries and ongoing care needs of a loved one. This article provides an overview of the evolving research on the specific impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other war zone-related behavioral health problems among families in the context of contemporary warfare, as well as research on the impact of family adjustment on veteran recovery and care. We propose an empirically supported, family-centered framework to inform a continuum of prevention and care for veterans with PTSD and their families. Gaps in the current continuum of behavioral health services for veterans with PTSD are identified, as well as efforts underway to develop trauma-informed, family-centered screening, prevention, and treatment approaches.

It is often preventable. In developed countries, it is among the top ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality. However, it's monitoring is largely unexplored in developing countries like Nepal. Objective To identify and characterize the pattern of Adverse Drug Reactions at BP Koirala Instittue of Health Science (BPKIHS), the Eastern Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre of Nepal. Method It was an observational study among the patients presented to different Clinical Departments of BPKIHS. Study duration was between July 2012 to July 2015. Adverse Drug Reactions were documented in a structured questionnaire and analysis done, in the department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, using Microsoft 2013 Excel. Result There were total 150 Adverse Drug Reactions documented mostly in the age range of 19-40 years (61.4%) with female preponderance (56.7%). Maximum Adverse Drug Reactions were collected from Psychiatry (60.7%) followed by Dental surgery (17.3%) and Internal Medicine (10.7%). Most frequent Adverse Drug Reactions were seen with drugs primarily affecting CNS (64.7%), followed by steroids (18.0%) and Antimicrobial drugs (12.0%). Among CNS drugs, Antidepressants (93.6%) accounted for most documentation. Weight gain (20.1%), Fatigue (12.4%), Rash (8.1%), Acid peptic disorder (7.7%), Headache (7.2%) and Puffiness of face (7.2%) were the most frequently encountered Adverse Drug Reactions. Conclusion Most reported Adverse Drug Reactions were from young (18-40) female presented to the department of Psychiatry.

Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group to build a drug\u00a0repositioning model for schizophrenia. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 123 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes outside the MHC, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results."}, {"Title": "Why involve families in acute mental healthcare? A collaborative conceptual review.", "Abstract": "Family involvement is strongly recommended in clinical guidelines but suffers from poor implementation. To explore this topic at a conceptual level, a multidisciplinary review team including academics, clinicians and individuals with lived experience undertook a review to explore the theoretical background of family involvement models in acute mental health treatment and how this relates to their delivery.\nA conceptual review was undertaken, including a systematic search and narrative synthesis. Included family models were mapped onto the most commonly referenced underlying theories: the diathesis-stress model, systems theories and postmodern theories of mental health. Common components of the models were summarised and compared. Lastly, a thematic analysis was undertaken to explore the role of patients and families in the delivery of the approaches.\nGeneral adult acute mental health treatment.\nSix distinct family involvement models were identified: Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models, ERIC (Equipe Rapide d'Intervention de Crise), Family Psychoeducation Models, Family Systems Approach, Open Dialogue and the Somerset Model. Findings indicated that despite wide variation in the theoretical models underlying family involvement models, there were many commonalities in their components, such as a focus on communication, language use and joint decision-making. Thematic analysis of the role of patients and families identified several issues for implementation. This included potential harms that could emerge during delivery of the models, such as imposing linear 'patient-carer' relationships and the risk of perceived coercion.\nWe conclude that future staff training may benefit from discussing the chosen family involvement model within the context of other theories of mental health. This may help to clarify the underlying purpose of family involvement and address the diverse needs and world views of patients, families and professionals in acute settings."}, {"Title": "Junior doctor psychiatry placements in hospital and community settings: a phenomenological study.", "Abstract": "The proportion of junior doctors required to complete psychiatry placements in the UK has increased, due in part to vacant training posts and psychiatry career workforce shortages, as can be seen across the world.

The majority had completed their medical degree in the UK and were White British.\nThe lived experience of a junior doctor psychiatry placement was understood by three core themes: exposure to patient recovery, connectedness with others in the healthcare team and subjective interpretations of psychiatry. The experiences were moderated by instances of role definition, reaction to the specialty and the organisational fit of the junior doctor capacity in the specialty.\nThe study reinforces and adds to the literature by identifying connectedness as being important for both job satisfaction and morale, which is currently damaged within the junior doctor population. The study provides in-depth insights into the lived experience of psychiatry placements and can be taken forward by educationalists to ensure the placements are meaningful experiences for junior doctors by developing role definition, belonging, structure and psychiatric care responsibility."}, {"Title": "Phelan-McDermid syndrome due to <i>SHANK3</i> mutation in an intellectually disabled adult male: successful treatment with lithium.", "Abstract": "For 30 years, Phelan and co-workers described a syndrome characterised by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, strongly impaired speech, sleep disturbances and hyperreactivity to sensory stimuli. This Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), also presenting with symptoms from the autism spectrum and a higher risk of developing seizure disorders, may be caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q13 or by a mutation in the <i>SHANK3</i> gene. Its core psychopathological phenotype comprises symptoms from the bipolar spectrum for which generally treatment with a mood-stabilising anticonvulsant in combination with an atypical antipsychotic seems to be most effective. In addition to two elsewhere published adolescent patients, we here describe in detail the history of an adult male patient with PMS caused by a <i>SHANK3</i> mutation in whom successive treatment regimens with antipsychotics and mood-stabilising anticonvulsants were all ineffective.

Many countries are attempting to bring mental health legislation in line with the UN - Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UN-CRPD). The UN-CRPD requires policy-makers to rethink the 'medical model' of mental illness and existing laws. It also challenges WHO guidelines on drafting mental health law, described in the WHO Resource Book on Mental Health, Human Rights and Legislation (WHO-RB).\nThis study examines the relationship between the UN-CRPD and the WHO-RB.\nIt compares the documents, highlighting similarities and identifying areas of disagreement. The WHO-RB contains a checklist of human rights standards it recommends are met at national level. This study analyses each component on this checklist and identifies the relevant sections in the UN-CRPD that pertain to each.\nBoth the UN-CRPD and WHO-RB address more than just acute exacerbations of illness, providing guidelines on, inter alia, treatment, education, occupation and housing. They are patient-centred and strongly influenced by social rights. The UN-CRPD, however, gives just superficial consideration to the management of acute illness, forensic and risk issues, and does little to identify the role of family and carers.\nThe UN-CRPD has evolved from disability research and strong advocacy organisations. Careful consideration is needed to enable it to address the specific needs encountered in mental illness. Both the UN-CRPD and WHO-RB highlight common tensions that must be resolved by clinicians, and provide some guidance for stakeholders who commonly need to observe one principle at the expense of another."}, {"Title": "CNS Drug Development: Lessons Learned Part 3: Psychiatric and Central Nervous System Drugs Developed Over the Last Decade-Implications for the Field.", "Abstract": "This column reviews the divergence between the approach to drug development in infectious disease, oncology, and immunology versus psychiatry. Between 2009 and 2016, 254 new drugs were approved. Of those, only 9 were for a psychiatric indication; another 5 were labeled to treat central nervous system disorders that are not considered psychiatric per se but are frequently found in individuals with psychiatric illnesses (eg, substantial weight gain). There were 2 additional new products for psychiatric indications that involved either a combination product (Contrave) or a prodrug for the production of aripiprazole (Aristada). The column discusses the reasons behind these different rates of development of psychiatric and/or central nervous system drugs compared with drugs in the areas of infectious disease, oncology, and immunology, and it predicts that this situation will change over the next century as we develop an improved understanding of the neurobiology underlying specific psychiatric illnesses."}, {"Title": "Outcomes of the Victorian Safewards trial in 13 wards: Impact on seclusion rates and fidelity measurement.", "Abstract": "Restrictive practices are used in response to conflict and aggression in psychiatric inpatient settings. Reducing such practices is the focus internationally of policy and legislative change, many initiatives, and a growing body of research. Safewards is a model and a set of 10 interventions designed to reduce conflict and containment in inpatient services. In the current study, we aimed to assess the impact of implementing Safewards on seclusion in Victorian inpatient mental health services in Australia. The study used a before-and-after design, with a comparison group matched for service type. Thirteen wards opted into a 12-week trial to implement Safewards and 1-year follow up. The comparison group was all other wards (n\u00a0=\u00a031) with seclusion facilities in the jurisdiction, matched to service type. Mandatorily-reported seclusion event data for all 44 wards over a 15-month period were analysed using negative binomial regression. Adherence to Safewards was measured via fidelity checklists at four time points: twice during the trial, post-trial, and at 1-year follow up. Seclusion rates were reduced by 36% in Safewards trial wards by the 12-month follow-up period (incidence rate ratios (IRR)\u00a0=\u00a00.64,) but in the comparison wards seclusion rates did not differ from baseline to post-trial (IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.17) or to follow-up period (IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.35). Fidelity analysis revealed a trajectory of increased use of Safewards interventions after the trial phase to follow up. The findings suggest that Safewards is appropriate for practice change in Victorian inpatient mental health services more broadly than adult acute wards, and is effective in reducing the use of seclusion."}, {"Title": "De-escalation techniques used, and reasons for seclusion and restraint, in a forensic psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "In Finland, the Mental Health Act determines the legal basis for seclusion and restraint. Restrictive measures are implemented to manage challenging situations and should be used as a last resort in psychiatric inpatient care. In the present study, we examined the reasons for seclusion and restraint, as well as whether any de-escalation techniques were used to help patients calm down. Seclusion and restraint files from a 4-year period (1 June 2009-31 May 2013) were retrospectively investigated and analysed by content analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated. A total of 144 episodes of seclusion and restraint were included to analyse the reasons for seclusion and restraint, and 113 episodes were analysed to examine unsuccessful de-escalation techniques. The most commonly-used techniques were one-to-one interaction with a patient (n\u00a0=\u00a074, 65.5% of n\u00a0=\u00a0113) and administration of extra medication (n\u00a0=\u00a037, 32.7% of n\u00a0=\u00a0113). The reasons for seclusion and restraint were threatening harmful behaviour (n\u00a0=\u00a051, 35.4% of n\u00a0=\u00a0144), direct harmful behaviour (n\u00a0=\u00a043, 29.9%), indirect harmful behaviour (n\u00a0=\u00a042, 29.1%), and other behaviours (n\u00a0=\u00a08, 5.6%). In general, the same de-escalation techniques were used with most patients. Most episodes of seclusion or restraint were due to threats of violence or direct violence. Individual means of self-regulation and patient guidance on these techniques are needed. Additionally, staff should be educated on a diverse range of de-escalation techniques.

The model is rooted in presence or absence of decision-making capacity, and the notion of capacity used is an expansion of the usual notion of capacity, in that it is individualized and diachronic. In this article, I argue that an individualized notion of capacity either lacks a coherent foundation or exposes itself to a situation where epistemological error results in a double standard or unjustified enforcement of the directive. I also raise concern that the diachronic notion of capacity leads to an authenticity type account, which fails to incorporate differences in individual prognosis. I then present a rough sketch of an alternative account, more in keeping with current mental health legislation, which uses an individualized notion of \"risk to self\" to justify self-binding directives in bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "The Impact of Translational Neuroscience on Revisiting Psychiatric Diagnosis: State of the Art and Conceptual Analysis.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews translational research in psychiatry, focusing on those programs addressing the problem of the validity of psychiatric diagnoses. In medicine in general, and in psychiatry in particular, the term \"translational\" is used with different meanings. A conceptual analysis suggests that there are at least seven different types of translational research in psychiatry: T1 (\"bench-to-bedside\" development of tools and treatments), T2 (application of animal models to human psychiatry), T3 (papers focusing on the mind-brain gap, studying biological, neurobiological and cognitive dysfunctions), T4 (personalised therapies and prediction of treatment responses), T5 (\"bedside-to-bench\" translation of population data for laboratories), T6 (implementation of treatments at the population level, including accessibility and quality of services), and T7 (improving translational knowledge in residents' trainings and researchers' careers). Concerning the problem of validity of psychiatric diagnoses, new neurocognitive models like the Research Domain Criteria project are considered, in particular the translational program of cross-validation aimed at reducing the gap between neuroimaging data and psychopathological scores derived from rating-scales. It is shown that these programs are useful, filling some of the current research gaps, but it is also stressed that they carry implicit realist and reductionist assumptions. It is finally suggested that the formation of mental symptoms is a complex process involving both neurocognitive and semantic factors, which raises doubts about the possibility of complete translations, without residuals."}, {"Title": "Rotation therapy for maniacs, melancholics and idiots: theory, practice and perception in European medical and literary case histories.", "Abstract": "This article examines the development and use of rotation therapy in the emerging field of psychiatry at the beginning of the 19th century, and the cross-fertilization between British, Irish, German, French and other European proponents of 'Cox's Swing'.

This theory has been refuted for anorexia, but few transcultural studies have been carried out on bulimia nervosa. As a result, knowledge concerning this disorder is limited. On the basis of a clinical case involving a bulimic Chinese girl, we attempt to demonstrate the impact of cultural factors on the disorder. We discuss the atypical characteristics of her symptom profile, in particular the absence of preoccupations concerning her appearance and the psycho-pathological impact of the secrecy surrounding her adoption. In this particular case, bulimia triggered a search for filiation and identity that could have later enabled her to restore harmonious family ties and to gain autonomy. We also examine the case in the context of adoption in China. This clinical case points out how important it is to take cultural factors into account and how useful a transcultural approach is in order to understand bulimia, and suggest effective methods of care."}, {"Title": "Dementia with Lewy bodies presenting as probable epileptic seizure.", "Abstract": "We discuss the case of an 83-year-old man admitted to the hospital after losing control of his vehicle due to an unexplained episode of altered consciousness.

The essay considers the choices available to women with bipolar disorder who become pregnant while taking sodium valproate to treat mania or for mood stabilisation. The implications of three options are considered: to stop all treatment, to switch to a different mood stabiliser or to continue on sodium valproate. The implications for the fetus, on the mother's wellbeing and the ethics of patient choice are discussed.\nPregnancy can be especially challenging for women with bipolar disorder, predominantly because of the heightened probability of relapse, potential fetal harm caused by bipolar medication, and a 250-fold risk of puerperal psychosis compared to the general population. Sodium valproate is a known teratogen, and is discouraged in pregnancy, but what choice is open to women who rely on this medication to stabilise their mood?\nThe large majority of women of childbearing age with bipolar disorder should not be prescribed sodium valproate as the risks to the unborn fetus far outweigh the benefits of the medication, as other drugs have similar if not better efficacy to stabilize the mother's mood, with lower risks to the fetus. In the small minority of women for whom valproate may be the only effective treatment, she must be fully informed of the teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risks, as well as the ways in which the pregnancy can be managed to reduce such risks."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of substance use and mental disorders.", "Abstract": "Comorbidity is a term defined as the presence of two or more conditions occurring either at the same time or having a close relationship to the same individual.

Our sense of smell is linked directly to the limbic system, the emotional part of our brain responsible for memory and behaviour, and therefore, our individual sense of smell is based purely on life's deep experiences and impressions. The roots of \"Aromatherapy\" can be traced back more than 3,500 years, to a time when essential oils were first recorded in human history for their therapeutic and medicinal properties. However, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, it remains one of the most controversial complementary therapies applied in medicine because of its pseudoscience connotations and limited available data on health benefits, despite the importance of smell on human health. Here I introduce the concept of \"eScent\", an emotionally responsive wearable technology that picks up on your emotions and vital signs and sends a personalisable 'scent bubble' to your nose. It combines sensing and dispensing aromatics for immersive experiences and multiple health benefits. It presents an empowering, sensory intervention and resilience builder that emits mood-enhancing aromas in a controllable way, depending on biofeedback. The advantage of essential oils merged with biometric sensors and intelligent tracking devices (e.g. an Apple Watch), could lead to a new palette of scents that are bio-synchronized to an individual's emotional, mental, and/or physical state and in a real-time manner alleviate high levels of stress, thus preventing the risk of a serious mental ill health relapse. Closure of the loop with wearable scent delivery systems requires an innovative, creative and collaborative approach, crossing many disciplines in psychological related sciences, biotechnology and industrial design. Testing such hypotheses in translational human studies is a matter of future research which could not only lead to valuable \"prodromal\" interventions for psychiatry, but new stress management tools for people suffering from affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Study on the use of Antipsychotic Medication in an Intellectual Disability (ID) community caseload.", "Abstract": "People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are prescribed antipsychotic medications for different reasons; sometimes this is for a mental illness such as psychotic or affective symptoms, however antipsychotics are also used to improve behaviours that challenge, which are common in people with intellectual disabilities (ID) or autism or both.

An Audit on the Quality of Handovers was carried out within a Psychiatric Liaison team of a General hospital in UK with an intention to review and improve this.\nHandovers were evaluated against the gold standard of the SBAR tool (Situation/Background/Assessment/Recommendations) over a period of 4 weeks. Handovers were assessed by 2 members of staff (a Consultant & a Specialty doctor). Data was analysed using Microsoft Excel.\nResults showed that the team's handover practice is mostly \"Good\" but there was also an amount of \"Poor\" under \"Situation & Background\", mostly presented by mid-grade doctors & trainees. Nurses scored higher than medics on overall rating, nearly 50%.This could be attributed to the fact that handovers form an essential & integral part of Nurse's training & culture. Also mid-grade (staff grade) doctors have had a significant amount of \"excellent\" scoring that other groups didn't have, mostly on the Assessment & Recommendations domains, which can be attributed to the fact that importance is stressed more on the assessment & treatment module by the doctors.\nThe multi-disciplinary composition of the liaison psychiatry team has a positive impact on the patient care. This audit has revealed overall good communication amongst the members of the team, nevertheless one that needs some improvement, particularly amongst the doctors. Doctors tend to focus on the remedial (assessment & treatment) module rather than the holistic approach. SBAR remains an effective & handy tool to improve the handover quality.

In East London Foundation Trust (ELFT) in Bedfordshire, doctors from Core Psychiatry, Foundation and GP training programmes come to train in Psychiatry. Many will not have worked in Psychiatry before and have little experience of patients with ID. The prevalence of people with ID is increasing with improved life expectancy. They are a complex and vulnerable group with considerable wider legal, ethical and social issues. Recent national reports including the Confidential Inquiry in to Premature Deaths in People with Learning Disability 3 and Transforming Care 4 have recommended increased training and awareness of the roles and responsibilities for all health staff who provide care to people with ID.\nTo survey the knowledge level and expectations of junior doctors on Psychiatry placements in Bedfordshire in relation to ID and local logistical arrangements of services and on call duties.\nThe local ID governance committee together with the Postgraduate Medical Education Department created a questionnaire which was circulated to new trainee Doctors on placements with ELFT. The questionnaire was distributed to new trainees after 3 different inductions throughout the year. This combined self-rating questions using Likert scales, multiple choice answers and others allowing for expanded free text answers.\nThe results show the self-rated knowledge levels of ID psychiatry in general and with regard to local services and on call arrangements amongst new trainees was low. The majority of trainees indicated they would have liked to have received information on the suggested areas at the start of the placement. When given the option of themes of information the psychiatric and medical presentation was most sought, although general and on call specific information was also indicated to be useful. The most popular delivery of information was found to be oral presentation and hand out at induction, followed by an electronic document. 8 trainees were interested in attending clinical sessions in ID and most felt it would be feasible in their posts to get to these.\nThis survey shows that Junior Doctors from different training programmes rate their knowledge of ID psychiatry to be low. This has implications during their rotation in a mental health trust as they are expected to cover an ID ward whilst on call, but also going forward in their careers as all specialties will encounter patients with ID. It is known that awareness of patients with ID is lacking in many healthcare professionals and we know that people with ID are living longer, however continue to have worse health than the general population. The results show trainees would like more education on ID and would be interested in attending clinical sessions in ID psychiatry. The results will enable clinicians in ID services how best to improve the local induction experience for trainees. It also will guide how to educate colleagues outside of the specialty to improve their practice with people with ID, which will improve standards in the quality of care people with ID receive from doctors who treat them."}, {"Title": "Genetics and Psychiatry: Myth or Reality?", "Abstract": "Greek mythology and philosophical speculations were the first human productions on madness and psychiatry.

An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that mental health stigma in the National Health Service was a factor that contributed to her death. Despite the morbidity and mortality attributed to the stigma attached to post-natal mental health problems there are very few programmes that have been developed to challenge it. King's College London Undergraduate Psychiatry Society organized an event entitled, 'A Labour of Love': Perinatal Mental Health to address this issue. The event included a talk from an expert by experience, a mother who developed post-partum mental health problems.\nWe conducted a single-arm, pre-post comparison study on participants who attended the KCL Psych Soc event. Validated stigma scales on knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS)), attitudes (Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI)) and behaviour (Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS)) were administered before and immediately after exposure to the event.\n27/27 (100%) of participants recruited responded. There was a statistically significant difference in the pre-MAKS score compared to the post-MAKS score (p=0.0003), the pre-RIBS score compared to the post-RIBS score (p=0.0068) and in the pre-CAMI score compared to the post-CAMI score (p=0.0042).\nThere were statistically significant reductions in stigma in the domains of knowledge, attitude and behavior following exposure to the KCL Psych Soc event and no adverse effects were reported. Our study revealed that a brief intervention made a highly significant impact and maybe useful in challenging the stigma around post-natal mental illness.

Psychological problems are common in medical students and doctors, however, thelevel of care seeking in this group is low. Fear of exposure to stigmatization is a crucial barrier to accessing and using mental health services. Recent research has revealed that film-based interventions can be used to challenge mental health stigma and encourage care seeking.\nWe conducted a single-arm, pre-post comparison study on students who attended the Wounded Healer film at a University College London Psychiatry Society event (n=11). Before and after exposure to the film, students were asked to complete validated stigma scales that measured mental health-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. Responses were on a Likert scale and participants also provided free free-text comments which were subjected to thematic analyses.\nThere was a statistically significant difference in the mental health-related knowledge pre-intervention score compared to the post-intervention score (p=0.0322). All participants either strongly agreed or agreed with the post-evaluation statement, \"I feel inspired to raise awareness of the importance of mental health and to take action to challenge stigma.\"\nThis pilot study provides provisional support that The Wounded Healer film may be associated with reductions in stigma variables in healthcare students and encourage them to seek care for their own psychological problems.

Can the Situation Be Improved?", "Abstract": "Several papers have been written to show that General Practitioners do not always prescribe according to the guidelines despite the availability of guidelines regarding the dosage and length of treatment with antidepressants to treat a depressive episode. Here we review the evidence as to whether GPs follow antidepressant guidelines, covering the data between 1996 and the present day, and discuss the implications of this evidence. We then propose solutions which could be used to improve adherence to the guidelines. We propose as one solution the development of joint Doctor-Practice Nurse clinics for the treatment of depression. The outcomes of these clinics should be auditable against the guidelines. Such a solution, when linked with easy access to advice and referral to Secondary Care Psychiatry specialists, argues for a collaborative care or shared care program for the treatment of depression in Primary Care."}, {"Title": "The performing arts and psychological well-being.", "Abstract": "Although psychotropic drugs have been hailed as, 'One of the success stories of modern psychiatry' the prescribing of these medicines has not been without commotion, concern and controversy.

We argue that understanding cultural differences in emotion neurobiology requires probing their social origins and connection with individuals' subjective, lived experiences. We suggest that an interdisciplinary, developmental perspective would advance scientific understanding by enabling the invention of protocols aligning neurobiological measures with techniques for documenting cultural contexts, social relationships and subjective experiences.

We conducted a narrative review to explore the opportunities and risks of digital technologies in mental healthcare specifically for people with intellectual disability, a sometimes marginalised and socially excluded group. The scope of digital mental health is vast and the promise of cheaper and more effective interventions delivered digitally is attractive. People with intellectual disability experience high rates of mental illness and could benefit from the development of novel therapies, yet seem to have been relatively neglected in the discourse around digital mental health and are often excluded from the development and implementation of new interventions. People with intellectual disability encounter several barriers to fully embracing digital technology, which may be overcome with appropriate support and adaptations. A small, but growing, literature attests to the value of incorporating digital technologies into the lives of people with intellectual disability, not only for promoting health but also for enhancing educational, vocational and leisure opportunities. Clearly further evidence is needed to establish the safety and clinical efficacy of digital mental health interventions for people with and without intellectual disability.

We determined whether weighted polygenic risk scores (wPRSs) combining multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with lipid levels in the general population are associated with lipid levels [high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides] and/or dyslipidemia in patients receiving weight gain-inducing psychotropic drugs. We also determined whether genetics improve the predictive power of dyslipidemia.\nThe influence of wPRS on lipid levels was firstly assessed in a discovery psychiatric sample (n=332) and was then tested for replication in an independent psychiatric sample (n=140). The contribution of genetic markers to predict dyslipidemia was evaluated in the combined psychiatric sample.\nwPRSs were significantly associated with the four lipid traits in the discovery (P\u22640.02) and in the replication sample (P\u22640.03). Patients whose wPRS was higher than the median wPRS had significantly higher LDL, TC, and triglyceride levels (0.20, 0.32 and 0.26\u2009mmol/l, respectively; P\u22640.004) and significantly lower HDL levels (0.13\u2009mmol/l; P<0.0001) compared with others. Adding wPRS to clinical data significantly improved dyslipidemia prediction of HDL (P=0.03) and a trend for improvement was observed for the prediction of TC dyslipidemia (P=0.08).\nPopulation-based wPRSs have thus significant effects on lipid levels in the psychiatric population. As genetics improved the predictive power of dyslipidemia development, only 24 patients need to be genotyped to prevent the development of one case of HDL hypocholesterolemia.

Several such interventions have been found efficacious, but none is yet widespread, and the cost-effectiveness of population-based implementation is unknown.\nModeled cost-effectiveness analysis compared three ED-initiated suicide prevention interventions previously found to be efficacious-follow-up via postcards or caring letters, follow-up via telephone outreach, and suicide-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-with usual care. Primary outcomes were treatment costs, suicides, and life-years saved, evaluated over the year after the index ED visit.\nCompared with usual care, adding postcards improved outcomes and reduced costs. Adding telephone outreach and suicide-focused CBT, respectively, improved outcomes at a mean incremental cost of $4,300 and $18,800 per life-year saved, respectively. Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 repetitions) revealed the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness to be a certainty for all three interventions, assuming societal willingness to pay \u2265$50,000 per life-year. These main findings were robust to various sensitivity analyses, including conservative assumptions about effect size and incremental costs. Population impact was limited by low sensitivity of detecting ED patients' suicide risk, and health care delivery inefficiencies.\nThe highly favorable cost-effectiveness found for each outpatient intervention provides a strong basis for widespread implementation of any or all of the interventions. The estimated population benefits of doing so would be enhanced by increasing the sensitivity of suicide risk detection among individuals presenting to general hospital EDs."}, {"Title": "Syndromic Surveillance of Mental and Substance Use Disorders: A Validation Study Using Emergency Department Chief Complaints.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated whether emergency department (ED) patient presentations for problems related to mental and substance use disorders could be validly monitored by a syndromic surveillance system that uses chief complaints to identify mental disorders.\nThe study used syndromic surveillance data on 146,315 ED visits to participating Fresno County, California, hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2013. Free-text patient chief complaints are automatically classified into syndromes based on the developer's algorithms. Agreement was assessed between the algorithm's syndrome classification of mental health and substance abuse (MHSA) disorders and ICD-9-CM discharge diagnostic codes.

Potential biological pathways related to mental disorders include inflammation, oxidative stress, the gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications and neuroplasticity. Consistent epidemiological evidence, particularly for depression, suggests an association between measures of diet quality and mental health, across multiple populations and age groups; these do not appear to be explained by other demographic, lifestyle factors or reverse causality. Our recently published intervention trial provides preliminary clinical evidence that dietary interventions in clinically diagnosed populations are feasible and can provide significant clinical benefit. Furthermore, nutraceuticals including n-3 fatty acids, folate, S-adenosylmethionine, N-acetyl cysteine and probiotics, among others, are promising avenues for future research. Continued research is now required to investigate the efficacy of intervention studies in large cohorts and within clinically relevant populations, particularly in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar and anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "When all else fails: supervised treatment in outpatient for schizophrenia (STOPS).", "Abstract": "This was about a case of a patient requiring admission to psychiatry ward twice a year for relapse schizophrenia due to medication non-compliance. Medication adherence was previously monitored by her husband. However, following the death of her husband, she stopped treatment. The lack of insight and poor family support further contributed to her relapse. She presented with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia during her relapse, neglecting her hygiene and oral intake. She was also found to have anaemia as a result of poor diet when she was in relapse. Community psychiatry services had attempted to ensure compliance with postdischarge plan but failed as patient was not present every home visits. Supervised treatment in outpatient for schizophrenia (STOPS) provided an alternative method to ensure compliance in this patient. Patient has remained in remission for 1\u2009year since the use of STOPS."}, {"Title": "Polysubstance use by psychiatry inpatients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "Polysubstance use, the consumption of more than one substance over a defined period, is common and associated with psychiatric problems and poor treatment adherence and outcomes. This study examined past-month polysubstance use at intake among psychiatry inpatients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and outcomes 3 months later.\nParticipants (n=406 psychiatry inpatients with documented mental health and substance use disorders) completed a baseline and a 3-month follow-up (84%) interview. With baseline data, a latent class analysis was conducted on substances used in the past 30days. Analyses of covariance tested for differences among classes on outcomes at 3-month follow-up.\nAt baseline, three classes were estimated: Cannabis+Alcohol (35.1%), Alcohol (49.3%), and Polysubstance, notably, cocaine plus alcohol and marijuana (15.7%). At follow-up, the Polysubstance class had more severe alcohol and drug use, support for abstinence, and motivation for help-seeking, but less abstinence self-efficacy; it was most likely to attend 12-step groups. The Cannabis+Alcohol class was least likely to obtain outpatient substance use treatment, and had the lowest percent days abstinent.\nPsychiatry inpatients with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders have varying substance use patterns that correspond to substance-related outcomes concurrently and over time. Many patients achieved abstinence for most days of the 3-month post-hospitalization period. To further increase abstinence, providers could build on polysubstance-using patients' high motivation to increase self-efficacy. In addition, because patients using mainly cannabis plus alcohol may perceive little harm from cannabis use, providers may consider modifying risk perceptions through effective education."}, {"Title": "Short overview on metabolomic approach and redox changes in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are severe mental disorders and complicated diagnostic entities, due to their phenotypic, biological and genetic heterogeneity, unknown etiology, and poorly understood alterations in biological pathways and biological mechanisms. Disturbed homeostasis between overproduction of oxidant species, overcoming redox regulation and a lack of cellular antioxidant defenses, resulting in free radical-mediated pathology and subsequent neurotoxicity contributes to development of depression, schizophrenia and PTSD, their heterogeneous clinical presentation and resistance to treatment. Metabolomics is a discipline that combines different strategies with the aim to extract, detect, identify and quantify all metabolites that are present in a biological sample and might provide mechanistic insights into the etiology of various psychiatric disorders. Therefore, oxidative stress research combined with metabolomics might offer a novel approach in dissecting psychiatric disorders, since these data-driven but not necessarily hypothesis-driven methods might identify new targets, molecules and pathways responsible for development of schizophrenia, depression or PTSD. Findings from the oxidative research in psychiatry together with metabolomics data might facilitate development of specific and validated prognostic, therapeutic and clinical biomarkers. These methods might reveal bio-signatures of individual patients, leading to individualized treatment approach. In reviewing findings related to oxidative stress and metabolomics in selected psychiatric disorders, we have highlighted how these novel approaches might make a unique contribution to deeper understanding of psychopathological alterations underlying schizophrenia, depression and PTSD."}, {"Title": "Historical and conceptual aspects of motor disorders in the psychoses.", "Abstract": "Historical epistemology is a useful method to understand the longitudinal construction of the movement disorders in psychiatry. Four periods can be identified in such a process. The first, extending from Classical times to the work of Griesinger, included disorders such as catalepsy, crocidism, epilepsy and paralysis. The second period, stretching from Griesinger to Kahlbaum, concentrated on the study of melancholia attonita, stupor and catatonia. The third period, covering the time from Kahlbaum to WWI, witnessed important conceptual shifts such as: the transformation of madness into psychoses; the redefinition of movement and motility in psychiatry; the appearance of self-contained syndromes as dyskinesias, tics, akathisia, complex disorders like the cases of encephalitis lethargica, etc.; the advent of functional and psychodynamic explanations; and the description by Wernicke, Kleist and others of the motility psychoses. The fourth period stretches from WWI to the present and since it corresponds to the views and work reported in the rest of this Special issue it has not been touched upon in this paper. In spite of an increasing methodological refinement, empirical research is yet to clarify what is the clinical meaning of the movement disorders in the context of the psychoses and to explain whether such disorders are primary (i.e. issuing directly from the brain and parallel to the rest of psychotic symptomatology) or secondary (i.e. mediated by cognitive and emotional phenomena characteristic of the psychoses)."}, {"Title": "Staging in bipolar disorder: from theoretical framework to clinical utility.", "Abstract": "Illness staging is widely utilized in several medical disciplines to help predict course or prognosis, and optimize treatment. Staging models in psychiatry in general, and bipolar disorder in particular, depend on the premise that psychopathology moves along a predictable path: an at-risk or latency stage, a prodrome progressing to a first clinical threshold episode, and one or more recurrences with the potential to revert or progress to late or end-stage manifestations. The utility and validity of a staging model for bipolar disorder depend on its linking to clinical outcome, treatment response and neurobiological measures. These include progressive biochemical, neuroimaging and cognitive changes, and potentially stage-specific differences in response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Mechanistically, staging models imply the presence of an active disease process that, if not remediated, can lead to neuroprogression, a more malignant disease course and functional deterioration. Biological elements thought to be operative in bipolar disorder include a genetic diathesis, physical and psychic trauma, epigenetic changes, altered neurogenesis and apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Many available agents, such as lithium, have effects on these targets. Staging models also suggest the utility of stage-specific treatment approaches that may not only target symptom reduction, but also impede illness neuroprogression. These treatment approaches range from prevention for at-risk individuals, to early intervention strategies for prodromal and newly diagnosed individuals, complex combination therapy for rapidly recurrent illness, and palliative-type approaches for those at chronic, late stages of illness. There is hope that prompt initiation of potentially disease modifying therapies may preclude or attenuate the cognitive and structural changes seen in the later stages of bipolar disorder. The aims of this paper are to: a) explore the current level of evidence supporting the descriptive staging of the syndromal pattern of bipolar disorder; b) describe preliminary attempts at validation; c) make recommendations for the direction of further studies; and d) provide a distillation of the potential clinical implications of staging in bipolar disorder within a broader transdiagnostic framework."}, {"Title": "Patient participation as discursive practice-A critical discourse analysis of Danish mental healthcare.", "Abstract": "Patient participation is one of the most prevalent focus areas in the Danish healthcare debate. Patient participation is generally presented as a fundamental democratic right, and is stated in an objective language with legal requirements for healthcare professionals to ensure that patients systematically participate in their own courses of care and treatment. In the research literature, it is not clear what is meant by 'patient participation', and several discourses on patient participation exist side by side. This study explores how discourses of patient participation unfold and are at play in the articulations in official legal and political documents and patient records relating to a Danish psychiatric context. The documents and patient records have been analyzed using a Fairclough-inspired critical discourse approach which is concerned with how power is exercised through language. The research findings show that patient participation within Danish psychiatric healthcare is governed within a neoliberal discourse where underlying discourses; discourse of biomedicine, paternalism, management, evidence and ethics of care are embedded, and a discourse that seems to ascribe stigmatizing traits to mentally ill patients."}, {"Title": "Genetics of Anorexia Nervosa.", "Abstract": "Genetic factors contribute to the etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge about the genetic etiology of AN, provides directions for future research, and discusses clinical implications for this research.\nCandidate gene meta-analyses indicate serotonin genes may be involved in the genetic etiology of AN. Three genome-wide association studies have been conducted and one genome-wide significant locus was identified. Cross-disorder analyses suggest shared genetic risk between AN and several psychiatric, educational, and medical phenotypes. Much has been learned about the genetic etiology of AN over the past 3\u00a0decades. However, to fully understand the genetic architecture, we must consider all aspects including common variation, cross-disorder analysis, rare variation, copy number variation, and gene-environment interplay. Findings have important implications for the development of treatment and prevention approaches and for how AN, and psychiatric and medical diseases in general, are conceptualized."}, {"Title": "Residents Perceive Limited Education on Family Planning and Contraception for Patients with Severe and Persistent Mental Illness.", "Abstract": "The primary goal of this study was to assess perceived adequacy of training by residents from multiple specialties on contraceptive prescribing and family planning for patients with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Secondary goals included the following: (1) explore resident knowledge, attitudes, and behavior towards patients with SPMI and (2) identify barriers to meeting the reproductive health needs of patients with SPMI.\nThe target population was 44,237 residents from four medical specialties. Participants were from a stratified, self-selected sample. Program coordinators were asked to forward a survey link to residents. Consenting residents were provided access to a questionnaire via a secure, web-based application (REDCap). The survey assessed resident education on the reproductive health needs of patients with SPMI and included demographics (age, gender, year of residency, and specialty), perceived adequacy of training, knowledge, and attitudes, and barriers regarding contraception and family planning. Responses were summarized with frequency and compared by medical specialty.\nA total of 768 residents consented: 49% female, 20% male, and 31% did not indicate their gender; 19% were first year residents, 21% second year residents, 21% third year residents, 8% fourth year residents, and 30% did not indicate their year of training. By specialty, 30.6% of residents were from family medicine programs (n\u00a0=\u00a0235), 10.8% were from internal medicine programs (n\u00a0=\u00a083), 18.1% were from OBGYN programs (n\u00a0=\u00a0139), and 10.4% were from psychiatry programs (n\u00a0=\u00a080); 231 (30.1%) did not indicate specialty. Regarding training, 60% of residents disagreed or strongly disagreed that they had proper training on prescribing contraceptives for patients with SPMI (363 of 599). Sixty two percent of residents disagreed or strongly disagreed that they had proper training about family planning for patients with SPMI (368/599). Over 83% of residents surveyed (405/486) would prescribe contraception for patients with SPMI if they had adequate training.\nResults indicate the need for curricular change on the reproductive health needs of patients with SPMI."}, {"Title": "Measuring Burnout Among Psychiatry Clerkship Directors.", "Abstract": "The primary purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of burnout among Psychiatry clerkship directors.\nPsychiatry clerkship directors were solicited via email to complete an electronic version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey and the Respondent Information Form.\nFifty-four out of 110 surveys (49%) were completed. Fourteen percent of respondents scored in the \"high exhaustion\" category, 21.6% scored in the \"low professional efficacy\" category, 20.4% scored in the \"high cynicism\" category, and 15.1% of respondents met threshold for at least two of the three categories. Those who scored in the \"low professional efficacy\" category reported higher levels of salary support for research, while those who scored in the \"high cynicism\" category reported lower levels of salary support at a trend level. Those who scored in the \"high cynicism\" category were younger.\nApproximately 14-22 percent of psychiatry clerkship directors reported some level of burnout depending on the subscale used. Future studies should aim to better identify those clerkship directors who are at greatest risk for becoming burned out by their educational role and to clarify the link between salary support for research, age, and burnout."}, {"Title": "Research Domain Criteria as Psychiatric Nosology.", "Abstract": "Diagnostic classification systems in psychiatry have continued to rely on clinical phenomenology, despite limitations inherent in that approach. In view of these limitations and recent progress in neuroscience, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has initiated the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project to develop a more neuroscientifically based system of characterizing and classifying psychiatric disorders. The RDoC initiative aims to transform psychiatry into an integrative science of psychopathology in which mental illnesses will be defined as involving putative dysfunctions in neural nodes and networks. However, conceptual, methodological, neuroethical, and social issues inherent in and/or derived from the use of RDoC need to be addressed before any attempt is made to implement their use in clinical psychiatry. This article describes current progress in RDoC; defines key technical, neuroethical, and social issues generated by RDoC adoption and use; and posits key questions that must be addressed and resolved if RDoC are to be employed for psychiatric diagnoses and therapeutics. Specifically, we posit that objectivization of complex mental phenomena may raise ethical questions about autonomy, the value of subjective experience, what constitutes normality, what constitutes a disorder, and what represents a treatment, enablement, and/or enhancement. Ethical issues may also arise from the (mis)use of biomarkers and phenotypes in predicting and treating mental disorders, and what such definitions, predictions, and interventions portend for concepts and views of sickness, criminality, professional competency, and social functioning. Given these issues, we offer that a preparatory neuroethical framework is required to define and guide the ways in which RDoC-oriented research can-and arguably should-be utilized in clinical psychiatry, and perhaps more broadly, in the social sphere."}, {"Title": "Suicide in india: Part perceptions, partial insights, and inadequate solutions.", "Abstract": "Suicide is a complex phenomenon, often linked to environment. Despite the identification of many social, cultural, economic and political correlates and risk factors, psychiatry continues to argue for curative solutions based on the reductionistic biomedical model, rather than support public health measures to manage the larger sociocultural, economic and political context. While psychiatry and curative medicine help many people, survival of the human body is best explained by the materialist explanation that locates the variation in health and longevity to tangible resources. There is no single, simple or straightforward solution to reducing population suicide rates; specific mental health interventions are unlikely to impact secular trends in the rates of suicide."}, {"Title": "[The Role of Molecular Karyotyping in the Genetic Etiology of Autism].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the deletions and duplications with a molecular karyotyping technique and to elucidate the etiology of autism.\nA total of 31 patients (20 boys and 11 girls) between 4 to 18 years old with normal chromosomal analysis and no Fragile X mutation were diagnosed in the Ege University Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic with autism (according to DSM-IV-TR criteria) and were enrolled in the study. Symptom severity of the patients was evaluated with a Childhood Autism Rating Scale. Blood samples (EDTA collected) were obtained in order to extract DNA. Whole genome molecular karyotyping analyses were performed with Illumina IScan system by chips, which can scan 330.000 Single Nucleotid Polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect structural anomalies with a 10-kb resolution.\nAll patients had copy number variations (CNV) that sized between 20-kb and 3-Mb. All detected CNVs were analyzed by the help of KaryoStudio software and DGV database. The ones which might be causal and pathogenic were selected. Pathogenic CNVs (7 deletions, 2 duplications) were detected in 9 patients (29%).\nAs a result, this is the first study whereby a molecular karyotyping technique was successfully used in autism patients in Turkey. Moreover, an intermediate resolution of 330.000 SNP chips were proven to be efficient for molecular karyotyping analysis."}, {"Title": "[Clinical and Sociodemographic Characteristics That Affect the Recommendation for Assignment of A Legal Representative in Patients With Bipolar Disorder].", "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with bipolar disorder who had been sent to the Forensic Psychiatry Unit by the court in order to determine factors that affected the decision to appoint a legal representative.\nThe reports of health council, follow-up outpatient, and hospitalization files of a total of 78 patients with bipolar disorder who had been sent to the Department of Forensic Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Bakirk\u00f6y Mental Health and Neurological Diseases Education and Research Hospital between 1st June 2009-31st December 2011 were examined. Patients had been sent by the court in order to determine whether a legal representative was required. Seventy patients meeting enough to sociodemographic and clinical form were separated as appointment group of legal representative or not and decision variables were compared statistically.\nForty-six patients (66%) were recommended assignment of a legal representative. In the patients with bipolar disorder for whom a legal representative was recommended, the presence of other first axis comorbidity, the presence of psychotic episodes, delusions of persecution and reference, hallucinations, the total number of manic and mixed episodes, incidence of alcohol and substance abuse, lifetime total number of attacks, and the total number and duration of hospitalizations were found to be significantly higher. The probability of assignment of a legal representative was increased 11-fold by the presence of first axis comorbidity, 1.3-fold by the number of manic episodes, and 2.2-fold by the number of mixed episodes were specified.\nIn the practice of forensic psychiatry, clinicians should focus on the course of the disease, especially the number and frequency of manic or mixed episodes, total number of episodes and hospitalizations, duration of hospitalizations, alcohol and substance use, the presence of episodes accompanied by psychosis with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, and the presence of the other first axis comorbidity in the patient with bipolar disorder for assessment of the decision to appoint a legal representative."}, {"Title": "Consanguinity Associated with Increased Prevalence and Severity of Bipolar Disorder in Pakistan: A Case Report Highlighting the Genetic Link.", "Abstract": "This case report highlights the genetic link associated with bipolar disorder and rising prevalence of such cases in Pakistan due to the lack of knowledge and understanding of the disease.

For assessing depression, Tamil validated version of Patient Health Questionnaire-12 was used. Frequency of depression and its association with various sociodemographic and clinical factors were assessed.\nStudent <i>t</i>-test and Chi-square test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis were used for statistical analysis.\nOf the 150 subjects, 89 (59.3%) were males. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were present in 131 people (87.3%). Genetic and unknown epilepsies contributed higher proportion (44.7%) as compared to structural epilepsies (37.3%). Majority (88%) were on one or two antiepileptic drugs. Thirty-one people (20.3%) had less than one seizure per year. Depressive symptoms were present in 95 patients (63.3%). In multivariate regression analysis, secondary generalized seizures and seizure frequency >1/month emerged as significant predictors of depression ([OR]: 5.48 [95% (CI): 1.35-22.28] and OR: 2.53 [95% CI: 1.11-5.75], respectively).\nDepression is prevalent in a majority of adult PWE.

Sitters were used for a mean of 3.4 days ranging from 1 to 287 days, with a mean hospital length of stay of 18.9 days. Although 42.4% of all cases with sitters had a psychiatric consultation, psychiatry was consulted on only 8.5% of those with agitation, 6.3% of those who were disoriented, and 12.7% of those with decisional capacity concerns. Psychiatry was consulted on 87.4% of patients with a constant observer for suicide risks. Sitters were most often discontinued when behaviors improved or when patients were discharged.\nThis information will be useful for understanding the optimal way to implement a program that will increase patient safety and decrease cost."}, {"Title": "Toward Neuroproteomics in Biological Psychiatry: A Systems Approach Unravels Okadaic Acid-Induced Alterations in the Neuronal Phosphoproteome.", "Abstract": "Neuroproteomics is an evolving field of postgenomic medicine, highlighting the convergence of psychiatry/neurology and proteomics, yet compared with neurogenetics, it has received little attention. This study in rat primary neuronal cultures provides an example of a neuroproteomic approach relevant to the study of psychiatric disease pathophysiology, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. In this context, okadaic acid (OA) is routinely used in experimental designs to investigate phosphorylation-mediated events. It is a potent protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitor, particularly of PP1 and PP2A. Typically, a single protein and its phosphorylation level are monitored upon OA exposure. Although useful, this can be misleading as protein phosphorylation-mediated events involve complex signaling cascades and an array of kinases, phosphatases, and substrates. Bearing in mind the involvement of multiple pathways and cascade cross talk, this study employed a systems approach to analyze OA-induced molecular responses through PP inhibition. We showed that upon OA exposure, the recovery rate of 245 phosphoproteins significantly increased, while that of 75 significantly decreased. The prominent biological processes affected included anatomical structural development, transport, cell differentiation, and signal transduction. The associated phosphointeraction networks identified nodes representing OA-responsive phosphoproteins. Many of these are key players of signaling cascades relevant to a range of pathologies. In summary, the data presented results from a neuroproteomic preclinical study offering an array of phosphoproteins as potential targets for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in biological psychiatry. We note, however, the nonspecificity of targeting PPs themselves and emphasize the need for future neuroproteomic approaches toward systems psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Medicine, madness and murderers: the context of English forensic psychiatric hospitals.", "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to add to the understanding of context by shedding light on the relationship between context and organisational actors' abilities to resolve ongoing challenges. Design/methodology/approach The authors used qualitative data collection (interviews and focus groups with staff and site visits to English forensic psychiatry hospitals) and the analysis was informed by Lefebvre's writings on space. Findings Responses to ongoing challenges were both constrained and facilitated by the context, which was negotiated and co-produced by the actors involved. Various (i.e. societal and professional) dimensions of context interacted to create tensions, which resulted in changes in service configuration. These changes were reconciled, to some extent, via discourse. Despite some resolution, the co-production of context preserved contradictions which mean that ongoing challenges were modified, but not resolved entirely. Originality/value The paper highlights the importance of viewing context as co-produced in a continuous manner.

One-fourth of the patients received child-focused interventions from adult psychiatry, and out of these 30.7% were involved in interagency collaboration as compared to 7.7% without child-focused interventions. Overall, collaboration with child and adolescent psychiatric services was low for all main diagnoses. If a patient received child-focused interventions from psychiatric services, the likelihood of being involved in interagency collaboration was five times greater as compared to patients receiving no child-focused intervention when controlled for gender, main diagnosis, and inpatient care.\nPsychiatric services play a significant role in identifying the need for and initiating child-focused interventions in families with a parental mental illness, and need to develop and support strategies to enhance interagency collaboration with other welfare services."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial Treatment Options for Major Depressive Disorder in Older Adults.", "Abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD) is a public health concern with deleterious effects on overall health, cognition, quality of life, and mortality. Although LLD is relatively common, it is not a normal part of aging and is often under-recognized in older adults. However, psychotherapy is an effective treatment for LLD that aligns with many patients' preferences and can improve health and functioning. This review synthesized the current literature on evidence-based psychotherapies for the treatment of depression in older adults. Findings suggest that active, skills-based psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] and problem-solving therapy [PST]) may be more effective for LLD than non-directive, supportive counseling. PST may be particularly relevant for offsetting skill deficit associated with LLD, such as in instances of cognitive impairment (especially executive dysfunction) and disability. Emerging treatments also consider contextual factors to improve treatment delivery, such as personalized care, access, and poverty. Tele-mental health represents one such exciting new way of improving access and uptake of treatment by older adults. Although these strategies hold promise, further investigation via randomized controlled trials and comparative effectiveness are necessary to advance our treatment of LLD.

This study aimed to gain preliminary evidence with regards to the efficacy and acceptability of OpenMinds: a peer-designed and facilitated mental health literacy programme for university and secondary school students. The programme involves a structured programme of education and training for university medical students, who then deliver workshops in secondary schools. Pre- and post-surveys were completed by 234 school students who received two workshops and 40 university medical students who completed the OpenMinds programme and delivered the workshops. The main outcomes in both groups were components of mental health literacy (non-stigmatising attitudes, knowledge, social distance and helping attitudes). Perceived teaching efficacy and interest in mental health careers (university medical students) and workshop acceptability (school students) were also examined. University and school student participation in OpenMinds was associated with significant improvements in three of four mental health literacy elements in both samples. Knowledge and attitudes improved in both samples, social distance improved only in the university sample and knowledge of helping behaviours increased in the school sample. University students' perceived teaching efficacy improved but there was no change in their reported interest in pursuing psychiatry in their career. Acceptability was high; over 70% of the school students agreed that they enjoyed the workshops and liked being taught by a university student. This study provides preliminary evidence for the acceptability and efficacy of OpenMinds as a sustainable peer-led model of mental health education for young people.

The retrospective and subjective nature of these methods leads to recall and interviewer biases. Therefore, there is a clear need for more objective and standardized assessment methods to support the diagnostic process. The introduction of virtual reality (VR) creates the possibility to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, VR could contribute to the objectivity and reliability in the assessment of psychiatric disorders.\nIn this literature review, we will evaluate the assessment of psychiatric disorders by means of VR environments. First, we investigate if these VR environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and measuring psychiatric symptoms. Next, we compare these measures with traditional diagnostic measures.\nWe performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo; references of selected articles were checked for eligibility. We identified studies from 1990 to 2016 on VR used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Studies were excluded if VR was used for therapeutic purposes, if a different technique was used, or in case of limitation to a non-clinical sample.\nA total of 39 studies were included for further analysis. The disorders most frequently studied included schizophrenia (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200915), developmental disorders (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200912), eating disorders (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20093), and anxiety disorders (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20096). In attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the most comprehensive measurement was used including several key symptoms of the disorder. Most of the studies, however, concerned the use of VR to assess a single aspect of a psychiatric disorder.\nIn general, nearly all VR environments studied were able to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, in 14 studies, significant correlations were found between VR measures and traditional diagnostic measures. Relatively small clinical sample sizes were used, impeding definite conclusions. Based on this review, the innovative technique of VR shows potential to contribute to objectivity and reliability in the psychiatric diagnostic process."}, {"Title": "Frontline learning of medical teaching: \"you pick up as you go through work and practice\".", "Abstract": "Few medical teachers have received formal teaching education. Along with individual and organizational barriers to participation in teacher training programs, increasing numbers and altered distribution of physicians away from major teaching centers have increased the difficulty of attendance. Furthermore, it is not known if traditional faculty development formats are the optimal learning options given findings from existing studies document both positive and negative outcomes. There is a gap in research that explores how medical teachers learn to teach and also limited research regarding how medical teachers actually teach. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into how physicians describe their teaching of trainees, and the nature of their teaching development and improvement to inform faculty development programs.\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 physicians, with a broad range of teaching experience, purposefully selected from five disciplines: Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Family Medicine. A qualitative, inductive approach was used to analyse the data.\nTeaching was described as being centered on the needs of individual trainees, but was dependent on patient presentation and environmental context. For this group of physicians learning to teach was perceived as a dynamic and evolving process influenced by multiple life experiences. The physicians had not learnt to teach through formal education and then put that learning into practice, but had learnt to teach and improve their teaching through their trial and errors teaching. Life experiences unconnected with the medical environment contributed to their knowledge of teaching along with limited formal learning to teach experiences. Teaching practice was influenced by peers and trainees, feedback, and observation. The findings suggest these medical teachers learn to teach along a continuum largely through their teaching practice.\nThe findings suggested that the participants' major resource for learning how to teach was informal experiential learning, both in and out of the workplace. This may have implications for faculty development strategies for medical teaching education."}, {"Title": "The Educational Potential of YouTube.", "Abstract": "The objective of this paper was to examine the educational potential and effectiveness of a 3\u00a0min video clip of a simulation of schizophrenia published online at YouTube.\nResearchers examined the 267 public comments published on the video-sharing website YouTube over 8\u00a0years by viewers of a schizophrenia simulation video titled \"virtual hallucinations\" made in the Second Life game platform. Comments were independently categorized into six groupings, then cooperatively finalized, and qualitatively analyzed.\nThe six categories of style of comments were \"Emotional\" (n\u00a0=\u00a076), \"Identification\" (n\u00a0=\u00a062), \"Educational Interest\" (n\u00a0=\u00a045), \"Mocking/Displeased\" (n\u00a0=\u00a036), \"Game Interest\" (n\u00a0=\u00a032), and \"Other\" (n\u00a0=\u00a025).\nWithout any advertising or marketing by the creators, over 194,400 views of the video were recorded in 8\u00a0years, an average of about 1500 views per month. The use of YouTube with its viral marketing potential has created a vastly amplified reach for this educational offering that would otherwise have been impossible. Qualitative analysis of publically posted comments in response to the video, which were generally positive, has led to a greater understanding of public reactions to such educational offerings. YouTube videos are already a rich source of data for psychiatric researchers, and psychiatric educators should consider posting high quality video clips on publically available social media platforms such as YouTube in order to reduce public stigma about psychiatric disorders and patients."}, {"Title": "Modeling Stochastic Complexity in Complex Adaptive Systems: Non-Kolmogorov Probability and the Process Algebra Approach.", "Abstract": "Walter Freeman III pioneered the application of nonlinear dynamical systems theories and methodologies in his work on mesoscopic brain dynamics.Sadly, mainstream psychology and psychiatry still cling to linear correlation based data analysis techniques, which threaten to subvert the process of experimentation and theory building. In order to progress, it is necessary to develop tools capable of managing the stochastic complexity of complex biopsychosocial systems, which includes multilevel feedback relationships, nonlinear interactions, chaotic dynamics and adaptability. In addition, however, these systems exhibit intrinsic randomness, non-Gaussian probability distributions, non-stationarity, contextuality, and non-Kolmogorov probabilities, as well as the absence of mean and/or variance and conditional probabilities. These properties and their implications for statistical analysis are discussed. An alternative approach, the Process Algebra approach, is described. It is a generative model, capable of generating non-Kolmogorov probabilities. It has proven useful in addressing fundamental problems in quantum mechanics and in the modeling of developing psychosocial systems."}, {"Title": "A Critical Commentary on the 2017 AGNP Consensus Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Neuropsychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "In 2004, 2011, and 2017, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP), a group of German-speaking psychiatric researchers and psychiatrists, published successive versions of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) expert group consensus guidelines. The 2017 version has as a major strength its encyclopedic nature, including 1358 references. The guideline has 3 major sections: 1) theoretical aspects of TDM, 2) drug concentration levels in blood to guide neuropsychopharmacotherapy, and 3) practical aspects of TDM in psychiatry and neurology. The writer hopes the time is right for a TDM guideline in psychiatry, which is indicated for: 1) psychiatric researchers ready to value how TDM can contribute to moving psychopharmacology forward, 2) flexible clinicians ready to improve their patient care by personalizing dosing, and 3) today's psychiatry residents prepared as a new generation ready to be trained in TDM and willing to continue incorporating TDM as new psychiatric drugs are marketed."}, {"Title": "Glutamatergic Agents in the Treatment of Compulsivity and Impulsivity in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry: a Systematic Review of the Literature.", "Abstract": "Research has implicated glutamatergic projections between the various frontal subregions in the pathogenesis of compulsivity and impulsivity. Reducing striatal glutamate release, or antagonising the action of glutamate at its receptors, may therefore represent viable treatment strategies. Several glutamatergic agents with regulatory approval for other indications are available and may be of potential benefit in the treatment of compulsivity/impulsivity in psychiatric disorders in paediatric patients.\nThis review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and evaluates available scientific literature concerning the use of glutamatergic agents in these patients, in order to determine their reported effectiveness/efficacy and tolerability/safety.\nOut of a total of 1,426 publications, 21 trials examining six glutamatergic substances in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder were included.\nTrial designs as well as results were heterogeneous and thus comparability was limited. Available data support the hypothesis that glutamatergic agents are of potential value in the treatment of compulsivity/impulsivity in children and adolescents. Based on the data reviewed, memantine and N-acetylcysteine suggest the best risk-benefit profile for future trials. Riluzole should primarily be further investigated in adults.

However, more research is needed before the use of VR is considered a clinical standard of practice in some areas. The recent release of first generation consumer VR products signals a change in the viability of further developing VR systems and applications. As applications increase so will the need for good quality research to best understand what makes VR effective, and when VR is not appropriate for clinical services. As the field progresses, it is hopeful that the flexibility afforded by this technology will yield superior outcomes and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms impacting those outcomes."}, {"Title": "A History of Dystonia: Ancient to Modern.", "Abstract": "Before 1911, when Hermann Oppenheim introduced the term dystonia, this movement disorder lacked a unifying descriptor. While words like epilepsy, apoplexy, and palsy have had their meanings since antiquity, references to dystonia are much harder to identify in historical documents. Torticollis is an exception, although there is difficulty distinguishing dystonic torticollis from congenital muscular torticollis. There are, nevertheless, possible representations of dystonia in literature and visual art from the pre-modern world. Eighteenth century systematic nosologists such as Linnaeus, de Sauvages, and Cullen had attempted to classify some spasmodic conditions, including torticollis. But only after Charcot's contributions to clinical neuroscience were the various forms of generalized and focal dystonia clearly delineated. They were categorized as <i>n\u00e9vroses</i>: Charcot's term for conditions without an identifiable neuroanatomical cause. For a time thereafter, psychoanalytic models of dystonia based on Freud's ideas about unconscious conflicts transduced into physical symptoms were ascendant, although there was always a dissenting \"organic\" school. With the rise of subspecialization in movement disorders during the 1970s, the pendulum swung strongly back toward organic causation. David Marsden's clinical and electrophysiological research on the adult-onset focal dystonias was particularly important in establishing a physical basis for these disorders. We are still in a period of \"living history\" of dystonia, with much yet to be understood about pathophysiology. Rigidly dualistic models have crumbled in the face of evidence of electrophysiological and psychopathological overlap between organic and functional dystonia. More flexible biopsychosocial frameworks may address the demand for new diagnostic and therapeutic rationales."}, {"Title": "Management of Chronic Daily Headache and Psychiatric Co-Morbidities by Lifestyle Modification: Participatory Action Research Combining New Communication Media.", "Abstract": "Lifestyle modification has a significant role in chronic daily headache (CDH) management. Participatory action research (PAR) can play an important role in managing chronic medical conditions. However, it has been scarcely used in CDH management.\nThis study aimed to empower patients with CDH to modify their lifestyle in order to reduce both their headache and related psychiatric co-morbidities in a multidisciplinary headache clinic at Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran, IR Iran.\nIn the PAR plan, 37 patients (27 females) diagnosed with CDH were selected using purposeful sampling. Along with face-to-face group sessions, all available communication means such as phone calls, emails, short message system (SMS), and social media (Telegram) were used to facilitate the process. Questionnaires of health promotion lifestyle profile (HPLP\u0406\u0406), visual analog scale (VAS), and depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS21) were used to collect data. The data were analyzed using SPSS software.\nMean age of the patients was 38.33 (\u00b1 9.7) years.

Mental disorders, those beginning in childhood or adolescence may increase the risk of early drop out from education. The latter has been shown to have adverse life-course consequences on individuals such as greater demand on social welfare entitlements. A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out at the department of Psychiatry, Comilla Medical College, Comilla, Bangladesh. All cases were selected from patients attending at Comilla Medical College Hospital and Private Mental Health Facilities in Comilla City from March 2015 to February 2016. We found out the psychiatric disorders and socio-demographic status of patients with educational drop out over the early life course. A total of 50 dropout patients aged 10 to 30 years who fullfiled the enrolment criteria included in the study. Sociodemographic questionnaires, diagnostic information (DSM-5 and ICD-10) as well as an account of a various level of education were used as research instruments. The Frequency tables, summary tables and appropriate graphs were prepared to describe the population characteristics and study finding. The most of the psychiatric morbidity presents in male (62%) and age group of 18-24 years (54%). In this study, anxiety disorders was 8%, behaviour/ impulse control disorders was 8%, mood disorders was 16%, substance use disorders was 24%, schizophrenia spectrum disorders was 12% and composite psychiatric disorders was 32%.

Unlike eugenic psychiatry from the Japanese Colonial Era, the social conditions and contexts forming autonomous system of psychiatry of Korea in the 1960s and 1970s have been concentrated. The discussion approach has been tried to secure two perspectives-treatment and criticism-at the same time and to expand the time and scope of study through the extensive texts such as newspapers, magazines, books, advertisements, and others in the 1960s and 1970s. Through formation of subject, rationalization, and popularization, this study has surveyed the characteristics of psychiatry in the 1960s and 1970s to accentuate complicated conditions and kinetic steps to systemize psychiatry as scientific field to promote treatment of patients by deviating from mental hygiene approaching national mental health from cleanliness and removal. The characteristics are summarized as follows. First, as the ethical models of good doctors, medical paternalistic doctors, and non-authoritarian symmetric doctors have been proposed as good psychiatrists by new medical specialists with experience of globality, a new subject emerges. However, there has been illegalization process of unlicensed medical practitioner excluded by the regulatory authority called \"clearness.\" Second, the rationalization of psychiatry has been accelerated through the dispute of enactment of Mental Hygiene Law, segmentalization of concept of mental illness, and scientific characteristics. Especially, the disputes over enactment of Mental Hygiene Law focused on criminalization of mental patients brought a result to regulate the patients as the target of humanistic treatment and potential criminals at the same time. Third, popularization of psychiatry has embraced invisible mental illness into popular daily life through visual measure called medicine advertisement, and through the discussion about social neurosis, a new paradigm for diagnosis of Korean society has been proposed. Moreover, by focusing on autobiographical works with voices of patients, this article reveals a new doctor-patient relationship."}, {"Title": "Revisiting the wandering womb: Oxytocin in endometriosis and bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Hippocrates attributed women's high emotionality - hysteria - to a 'wandering womb'. Although hysteria diagnoses were abandoned along with the notion that displaced wombs cause emotional disturbance, recent research suggests that elevated levels of oxytocin occur in both bipolar disorder and endometriosis, a gynecological condition involving migration of endometrial tissue beyond the uterus. We propose and evaluate the hypothesis that elevated oxytocinergic system activity jointly contributes to bipolar disorder and endometriosis. First, we provide relevant background on endometriosis and bipolar disorder, and then we examine evidence for comorbidity between these conditions. We next: (1) review oxytocin's associations with personality traits, especially extraversion and openness, and how they overlap with bipolar spectrum traits; (2) describe evidence for higher oxytocinergic activity in both endometriosis and bipolar disorder; (3) examine altered hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis functioning in both conditions; (4) describe data showing that medications that treat one condition can improve symptoms of the other; (5) discuss fitness-related impacts of endometriosis and bipolar disorder; and (6) review a pair of conditions, polycystic ovary syndrome and autism, that show evidence of involving reduced oxytocinergic activity, in direct contrast to endometriosis and bipolar disorder. Considered together, the bipolar spectrum and endometriosis appear to involve dysregulated high extremes of normally adaptive pleiotropy in the female oxytocin system, whereby elevated levels of oxytocinergic activity coordinate outgoing sociality with heightened fertility, apparently characterizing, overall, a faster life history. These findings should prompt a re-examination of how mind-body interactions, and the pleiotropic endocrine systems that underlie them, contribute to health and disease."}, {"Title": "Falls in hospitalized geriatric psychiatry patients: high incidence, but only a few fractures.", "Abstract": "Fall rates from 3.2 to 17.1 falls per 1,000 hospital days in geriatric psychiatry facilities have been reported to date. Up to 5% of the falls result in severe injuries, but data concerning medical consequences are scare. This brief report presents a retrospective analysis of one year fall protocols from a geriatric psychiatry department focusing on consequences of falls. Fall-induced injuries were rated in four categories: no injuries, mild injuries (contusions, hematomas, abrasions), moderate injuries (lacerations, dislocations), and severe injuries (fractures, cerebral hemorrhages). In total, 510 falls were registered during the study period, indicating a fall rate of 17.7 falls per 1,000 hospital days. Overall, 375 falls (73.5%) resulted in no injuries, 67 (13.1%) resulted in mild injuries, 59 (11.6%) resulted in moderate injuries, and only 9 (1.8%) falls led to severe injuries (fractures and cerebral hemorrhages). These results indicate a quite high fall rate in our sample of hospitalized geriatric psychiatry patients with only a relatively small number of severe injuries resulting from the falls. These results raise the question about the use of physical restraints and the use of bedrails in geriatric patients to prevent falls as the medical implications of falls may be less problematic than previously thought."}, {"Title": "Concurrent Improvement in Both Binge Eating and Depressive Symptoms with Naltrexone/Bupropion Therapy in Overweight or Obese Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder in an Open-Label, Uncontrolled Study.", "Abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is associated with obesity and major depressive disorder (MDD).

Design/methodology/approach Examples of successful case management models for formerly incarcerated individuals with SMI found through a secondary analysis of qualitative data and an analysis of the literature are presented. Findings Currently, no international, national, or statewide guidelines exist to ensure that formerly incarcerated individuals with SMI receive case management upon community reentry despite evidence that such services can prevent further criminal justice involvement. Recommendations include establishment of and evaluation of best practices for case management. In addition, the authors recommend additional funding for case management with the goal of greatly increasing the number of individuals with SMI leaving the criminal justice system in their ability to access adequate case management.

More specifically, the ability of mental health professionals to articulate the needs of patients, formulate strategies and engage meaningfully at the appropriate level in pursuit of resources. This is not a skill set routinely taught to mental health professionals.\nA public-private mental health leadership initiative, emanating from a patient access to care programme, was developed with the aim of building leadership capacity within the South African public mental health sector. The express aim was to equip health care professionals with the requisite skills to more effectively advocate for their patients. The initiative involved participants from various sites within South Africa. Inclusion was based on the proposal of an ongoing \"project\", i.e. a clinician-initiated service development with a multidisciplinary focus. The projects were varied in nature but all involved identification of and a plan for addressing an aspect of the participants' daily professional work which negatively impacted on patient care due to unmet needs. Six such projects were included and involved 15 participants, comprising personnel from psychiatry, psychology, occupational therapy and nursing. Each project group was formally mentored as part of the initiative, with mentors being senior professionals with expertise in psychiatry, public health and nursing. The programme design thus provided a unique practical dimension in which skills and learnings were applied to the projects with numerous and diverse outcomes.\nBenefits were noted by participants but extended beyond the individuals to the health institutions in which they worked and the patients that they served. Participants acquired both the skills and the confidence which enabled them to sustain the changes that they themselves had initiated in their institutions. The initiative gave impetus to the inclusion of public mental health as part of the curriculum for specialist training.\nDespite the significant adverse social and economic costs of mental illness, psychiatric and related services receive a low level of priority within the health care system.

Here, we have attempted to identify plasma protein signatures in 39 MDD patients to predict response over a 6-week treatment period with antidepressants. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that differences in the levels of 29 proteins at baseline were found in the group with a favorable treatment outcome. Most of these proteins were components of metabolism or immune response pathways as well as multiple components of the coagulation cascade. After 6 weeks of treatment, 43 proteins were altered in responders of which 2 (alpha-actinin and nardilysin) had been identified at baseline. In addition, 46 proteins were altered in non-responders and 9 of these (alpha-actinin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein B-100, attractin, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen beta chain, nardilysin and serine/threonine-protein kinase Chk1) had been identified at baseline. However, it should be stressed that the small sample size precludes generalization of the main results. Further studies to validate these as potential biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response are warranted considering the potential importance to the field of psychiatric disorders. This study provides the groundwork for development of novel objective clinical tests that can help psychiatrists in the clinical management of MDD through improved prediction and monitoring of patient responses to antidepressant treatments."}, {"Title": "The Chinese herbal formula Free and Easy Wanderer ameliorates oxidative stress through KEAP1-NRF2/HO-1 pathway.", "Abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) gains a lot of attention due to high prevalence and strong psychological upset, but the etiology remains undefined and effective treatment is quite limited. Growing studies demonstrated the involvement of oxidative stress in various psychiatry diseases, suggesting anti-oxidation therapy might be a strategy for PTSD treatment. Free and Easy Wanderer (FAEW) is a poly-herbal drug clinically used in China for hundreds of years in the treatment of psychiatric disorder. We hypothesized that FAEW exerts clinical effects through the activity against oxidative stress with fluoxetine as antidepressant control drug. Our results revealed that FAEW significantly reduced both endogenous and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced exogenous ROS levels in the human glioblastoma T98G and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. Transcriptome-wide microarray analysis indicated NRF2/HO-1 as the common target of FAEW and fluoxetine. Western blotting assay proved that the two drugs promoted NRF2 release from KEAP1 in the cytoplasm and translocation to the nuclei in a KEAP1-dependent manner, the expression of the protein HO-1 increased accordingly, suggesting the participation of KEAP1-NRF2/HO-1 pathway. The chemical constituents of FAEW (i.e. paeoniflorin, baicalin) bound to KEAP1 in silico, which hence might be the effective substances of FAEW.

Therefore the aim of this work was to examine associations between the inflammatory potential of habitual diet and mental health outcomes in a cross-sectional sample of 2047 adults (50.8% female).\nDiet was assessed using a self-completed food frequency questionnaire from which dietary inflammatory index (DII<sup>\u00ae</sup>) scores were determined. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and well-being were assessed using the CES-D, HADS-A and WHO-5 screening tools.\nLogistic regression analyses revealed that higher energy-adjusted DII (E-DII<sup>\u00ae</sup>) scores, reflecting a more pro-inflammatory diet, were associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratios (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.23-2.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and anxiety (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15-2.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and lower likelihood of well-being (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), comparing highest to lowest tertile of E-DII.

This imaging technique can also be used to assess blood flow and transit through tubular organs. Nuclear medicine imaging has been used in paediatrics for decades and this field is continuously evolving.\nThe data presented comes from clinical experience and some milestone papers on the subject.\nNuclear medicine imaging is well-established in paediatric nephro-urology in the context of urinary tract infection, ante-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis and other congenital renal anomalies. Also, in paediatric oncology, I-123-meta-iodobenzyl-guanidine has a key role in the management of children with neuroblastic tumours. Bone scintigraphy is still highly valuable to localize the source of symptoms in children and adolescents with bone pain when other imaging techniques have failed. Thyroid scintigraphy in neonates with congenital hypothyroidism is the most accurate imaging technique to confirm the presence of ectopic functioning thyroid tissue.\nRadionuclide transit studies of the gastro-intestinal tract are potentially useful in suspected gastroparesis or small bowel or colonic dysmotility. However, until now a standardized protocol and a validated normal range have not been agreed, and more work is necessary. Research is ongoing on whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its great advantage of great anatomical detail and no ionizing radiations, can replace nuclear medicine imaging in some clinical context. On the other hand, access to MRI is often difficult in many district general hospitals and general anaesthesia is frequently required, thus adding to the complexity of the examination.\nPatients with bone pain and no cause for it demonstrated on MRI can benefit from bone scintigraphy with single photon emission tomography and low-dose computed tomography. This technique can identify areas of mechanical stress at cortical bone level, difficult to demonstrate on MRI, which can act as pain generators. Positron emission tomography (PET) is being tested in the staging, response assessment and at the end of treatment of several paediatric malignancies. PET is becoming more widely utilized in neurology in the pre-surgical assessment of some children with drug resistant epilepsy.\nThe use of PET/MRI scanners is very attractive as it combines benefits of MR imaging with the assessment of cellular viability and metabolism with PET in one examination. This imaging technique will allow important research on tumour in-vivo metabolism (possible applications include lymphomas, neuroblastomas, malignant germ cell tumours andbrain tumours), with the aim of offering a personalized biological profile of the tumour in a particular patient. Ground-breaking research is also envisaged in neurosciences, especially in epilepsy, using PET tracers that would enable a better identification of the epileptogenic focus, and in psychiatry, with the use of radiolabeled neurotransmitters. In paediatric nephro-urology, the identification of the asymptomatic child with ante-natally diagnosed hydronephrosis at risk of losing renal parenchymal function if left untreated is another area of active research involving radionuclide renography."}, {"Title": "Consensus Guidelines for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in Neuropsychopharmacology: Update 2017.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is the quantification and interpretation of drug concentrations in blood to optimize pharmacotherapy.

A clinical pharmacist was added to our GPAU as a strategy to reduce PIDPs. Objective The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of a clinical pharmacist on PIDPs by measuring acceptance rates of pharmacist interventions (PhIs). Setting This study was conducted at the GPAU of Lausanne University Hospital. Method The clinical pharmacist attended four GPAU meetings weekly. Complete medication reviews were performed daily. The clinical pharmacist conducted standard analyses based on clinical judgment and STOPP/START criteria assessment. A PhI was generated when a PIDP was detected. When a PhI was accepted, the PIDP was considered as eliminated. Acceptance rate of PhI was calculated (number of PhI accepted/total number of PhI). Main outcome measure PhIs acceptance rates. Results In a cohort of 102 patients seen between July 2013 and February 2014, a total of 697 PhIs (average 6.8/patient) were made based on standard evaluation (n\u00a0=\u00a0479) and STOPP/START criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a0243). The global acceptance rate was 68% (standard, 78%; STOPP/START, 47%). Conclusion Good PhIs acceptance rates demonstrated that a clinical pharmacist can reduce PIDPs in a GPAU.

However, historians know little about the specific contexts within which these were mobilised. Although it is rarely acknowledged in the secondary literature, MIND was prominent in campaigning for rights-based services for learning disabled people during this time. This article sets MIND's campaign within the wider historical context of the organisation's origins as a main institution of the inter-war mental hygiene movement. The article begins by outlining the mental hygiene movement's original conceptualisation of 'mental deficiency' as the antithesis of the self-sustaining and responsible individuals that it considered the basis of citizenship and mental health. It then traces how this equation became unravelled, in part by the altered conditions under the post-war Welfare State, in part by the mental hygiene movement's own theorising. The final section describes the reconceptualisation of citizenship that eventually emerged with the collapse of the mental hygiene movement and the emergence of MIND. It shows that representations of MIND's rights-based campaigning (which have, in any case, focused on mental illness) as individualist, and fundamentally opposed to medicine and psychiatry, are inaccurate. In fact, MIND sought a comprehensive community-based service, integrated with the general health and welfare services and oriented around a reconstruction of learning disabled people's citizenship rights."}, {"Title": "Does internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy reduce healthcare costs and resource use in treatment of social anxiety disorder?

Many groups, including ours, have addressed molecular alterations in peripheral tissues in association with symptomatic changes in major illnesses. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) through studies of patient peripheral tissues and animal models. Although the relationship between peripheral changes and brain pathology remain elusive, oxidative stress may bridge such translational efforts. Nonetheless, the molecular substrates of oxidative stress are not well defined in mental conditions. Glutathione (GSH) is a non-enzymatic antioxidant that eliminates free radicals, and has been suggested to have a role in SZ. We performed a cross-sectional study of 48 healthy controls (CON), 52 SZ patients and 62 BP patients to compare the levels of peripheral GSH by a biochemical enzyme assay. We show a significant reduction of plasma GSH in both SZ and BP patients compared with CON. We evaluated possible influences of clinical characteristics on the level of GSH in SZ and BP. A decrease in GSH level correlated with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and positive scores for SZ and correlated with the PANSS general for BP. Taken together, we provide evidence that SZ and BP display a common molecular signature in the reduction of peripheral GSH in the psychosis dimension."}, {"Title": "Improving Ambulatory Care Resident Training: Preparing for Opportunities to Treat Mental Illness in the Primary Care Setting.", "Abstract": "The development of an outpatient psychiatry clinical practice learning experience for PGY2 ambulatory care pharmacy residents in preparation for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in the primary care setting is described.\nWith the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders, significant mortality, and limited access to care, integration of mental health treatment into the primary care setting is necessary to improve patient outcomes.

This multispecialty approach to the management of different painful presentations in thoracic oncology will demonstrate the complexity of each case and the improved patient outcomes which result from the involvement of different disciplines working in concert.In the USA, Europe and other countries, palliative care specialists often become rapidly involved in the management of these patients, coordinating social care and providing psychological support.Thoracic and orthopaedic spine subspecialists provide surgical methods to control tumour invasion, and improve quality of life and preservation of function in settings of even diffuse metastatic disease. Similarly, thoracic oncology and radiation therapists utilise both therapeutic and palliative chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy regimens to prolong and improve quality of life.The pain medicine specialist can, in addition to medication management, offer a variety of interventional approaches including unique drug delivery systems such as epidural analgesia, regional anaesthesia techniques, and intrathecal pumps, as well as neuromodulation techniques and neurolytic or neuroablative procedures.In the USA, these specialists complete an additional fellowship year in pain medicine following the completion of an anaesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology or psychiatry residency.

The aim of this study is to investigate the psychometric properties of the CES-D-10 in healthy community dwelling older adults.\nThe sample consists of 19,114 community-based individuals residing in Australia and the United States who participated in the ASPREE trial baseline assessment. All individuals were free of any major illness at the time. We evaluated construct validity by performing confirmatory factor analysis, examined measurement invariance across country and gender followed by evaluating item discrimination bias in age, gender, race, ethnicity and education level, and assessing internal consistency.\nHigh item-total correlations and Cronbach's alpha indicated high internal consistency. The factor analyses suggested a unidimensional factor structure. Construct validity was supported in the overall sample, and by country and gender sub-groups. The CES-D-10 was invariant across countries, and although evidence of marginal gender non-invariance was observed there was no evidence of notable gender specific item discrimination bias. No notable differences in discrimination parameters or group membership measurement non-invariance were detected by gender, age, race, ethnicity, and education level.\nThese findings suggest the CES-D-10 is a reliable and valid measure of depression in a volunteer sample.

This new framework places neurovisceral integration on a dimension of time, highlighting implications for lifespan development and healthy aging, and helping to bridge the gap between clearly demarcated disciplines such as psychology and epidemiology. The NIACT provides a novel framework, which conceptualizes how everyday psychological moments both affect and are affected by the vagus in ways that have long-term effects on mortality risk.

Historical materials on the Abdication and other respected secondary sources, including biographies of key individuals, were consulted, and the limited sociological and clinical literature on estrangement between elderly parents and adult children was referenced. Although estrangement was perpetuated by the rigid and incompatible positions taken up by both the former king and his widowed mother, the elderly Queen Mary, it was the latter who suffered the greater emotional consequences of the permanent separation that followed the Abdication. Most accounts of the Abdication have put forward views of the conflict of values at its centre that emphasise the vulnerability of the elderly mother.

One of the main problems is that up till now the parent-child relationship has not been assessed and analysed in accordance with reliable, unambiguous standards.<br/> AIM: To search the literature in order to identify the prerequisites for reliable diagnostics of attachment.<br/> METHOD: PubMed articles concerning instruments for measuring attachment were reviewed. The found articles were based on more extensive search strategies used in English-language meta-analysis, and included reflections on possible implications of mental health care.<br/> RESULTS: Accurate detailed analysis of attachment is particularly important in cases that involve cumulative risk factors. The task must be performed by trained professionals who used thoroughly tested, reliable measuring instruments.<br/> CONCLUSION: The application of the concept of attachment in child and adolescent psychiatry is in its infancy. Those applying the concept need to have breadth of vision and evidence-based skills in applying relevant diagnostics."}, {"Title": "[Parental alienation and the controversy surrounding psychiatric diagnostics].", "Abstract": "The phenomenon of parental alienation can arise when a child allies with one parent and refuses to have contact with the other parent. The concept has attracted a great deal of attention over the last few years.

One of the main tasks of psychiatry in this border area is to safeguard the domain of diagnostics.<br/> CONCLUSION: Because so much attention is being given to the question of whether parental alienation syndrome should be recognised as a diagnosis, there is often a tendency to ignore the possible impact of parental alienation and to pay very little attention to ways of coping with the problem."}, {"Title": "[Using resource groups in assertive community treatment; literature review and recommendation].", "Abstract": "In psychiatry there is an increasing interest in giving patients and their relatives control over the goals of treatment and the way in which treatment is carried out.

We found nine trials that had a randomised controlled design (RCT). Only one of these RCTs involved the use of an RG in ACT.<br/> RESULTS: The approaches used in ACT, whereby patients with schizophrenia had control over their treatment, led to significant improvements that were considerably greater than those achieved in standard care. Improvements were found in symptomatology, social functioning and in the quality of life. There are indications that treatment satisfaction and social functioning improve still further if patients' control over their treatment is organised in an RG.<br/> CONCLUSION: Research demonstrates that positive results are achieved with ACT whereby patients have control over their treatment and the way in which it is carried out.

The total scores and item scores on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for older people (Honos 65+) at the beginning and end of treatment were also analysed and were linked to the diagnosis.<br/> RESULTS: Patients improved significantly (es=0.8). The degree of improvement depended on the patient's principal diagnosis; patients with a mood or anxiety disorder improved the most (es=1.0 and 0.8). The degree of improvement varied per Honos 65+ item. In particular, patients with 'depressive problems' and 'other mental and behavioral problems' showed considerable improvement.<br/> CONCLUSION: Many older patients benefited from the treatment they received in gerontopsychiatry departments. This helps to give elderly patients with psychiatric disorders hope for the future.

The underlying structure-function relationships are typically derived from functional manipulations or imaging approaches. Although highly informative, these are experimentally costly. The increasing amount of publicly available brain and genetic data offers a rich source that could be mined to address this problem computationally. Here, we developed an algorithm that fuses gene expression and connectivity data with functional genetic meta data and exploits cumulative effects to derive neuroanatomical maps related to multi-genic functions. We validated the approach by using public available mouse and human data. The generated neuroanatomical maps recapture known functional anatomical annotations from literature and functional MRI data. When applied to multi-genic meta data from mouse quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies and human neuropsychiatric databases, this method predicted known functional maps underlying behavioral or psychiatric traits. Taken together, genetically weighted connectivity analysis (GWCA) allows for high throughput functional exploration of brain anatomy in silico. It maps functional genetic associations onto brain circuitry for refining functional neuroanatomy, or identifying trait-associated brain circuitry, from genetic data."}, {"Title": "Association of White Matter Structure With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.", "Abstract": "Clinical overlap between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly appreciated, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain unknown to date.\nTo examine associations between white matter organization and 2 commonly co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions, ASD and ADHD, through both categorical and dimensional approaches.\nThis investigation was a cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study at an outpatient academic clinical and research center, the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center. Participants were children with ASD, children with ADHD, or typically developing children. Data collection was ongoing from December 2008 to October 2015.\nThe primary measure was voxelwise fractional anisotropy (FA) analyzed via tract-based spatial statistics. Additional voxelwise DTI metrics included radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and mode of anisotropy (MA).\nThis cross-sectional DTI study analyzed data from 174 children (age range, 6.0-12.9 years), selected from a larger sample after quality assurance to be group matched on age and sex. After quality control, the study analyzed data from 69 children with ASD (mean [SD] age, 8.9 [1.7] years; 62 male), 55 children with ADHD (mean [SD] age, 9.5 [1.5] years; 41 male), and 50 typically developing children (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [1.5] years; 38 male). Categorical analyses revealed a significant influence of ASD diagnosis on several DTI metrics (FA, MD, RD, and AD), primarily in the corpus callosum. For example, FA analyses identified a cluster of 4179 voxels (TFCE FEW corrected P\u2009<\u2009.05) in posterior portions of the corpus callosum. Dimensional analyses revealed associations between ASD severity and FA, RD, and MD in more extended portions of the corpus callosum and beyond (eg, corona radiata and inferior longitudinal fasciculus) across all individuals, regardless of diagnosis. For example, FA analyses revealed clusters overall encompassing 12121 voxels (TFCE FWE corrected P\u2009<\u2009.05) with a significant association with parent ratings in the social responsiveness scale. Similar results were evident using an independent measure of ASD traits (ie, children communication checklist, second edition). Total severity of ADHD-traits was not significantly related to DTI metrics but inattention scores were related to AD in corpus callosum in a cluster sized 716 voxels. All these findings were robust to algorithmic correction of motion artifacts with the DTIPrep software.\nDimensional analyses provided a more complete picture of associations between ASD traits and inattention and indexes of white matter organization, particularly in the corpus callosum.

The secondary end points are to analyze risk factors, causes and consequences associated with burnout.\nA cross-sectional study conducted among medical residents working in hospitals located in the governorates of Tunis. Three instruments were used: an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to assess burnout, and Abstract Beck Depression Inventory to evaluate the intensity of depression. Severe burnout was defined as a severely high level of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization associated with a severely low level of personal accomplishment.\nA total of 149 participants (response rate=76.8%) participated in the survey. Among participants, 17.14% (n=26) had a severe burnout. The emergency medicine residents had the highest rate of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and severe depression.

It offers several advantages including a more realistic, lifelike environment that may allow subjects to \"forget\" they are being assessed, allow a better participation and an increased generalization of learning. Moreover, the virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, and can also be used to evaluate the patient's multimodal integration and to aid rehabilitation of cognitive abilities. The use of virtual reality to treat various psychiatric disorders in adults (phobic anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, addictions\u2026) and its efficacy is supported by numerous studies. Similar research for children and adolescents is lagging behind. This may be particularly beneficial to children who often show great interest and considerable success on computer, console or videogame tasks. This article will expose the main studies that have used virtual reality with children and adolescents suffering from psychiatric disorders. The use of virtual reality to treat anxiety disorders in adults is gaining popularity and its efficacy is supported by various studies. Most of the studies attest to the significant efficacy of the virtual reality exposure therapy (or in virtuo exposure). In children, studies have covered arachnophobia social anxiety and school refusal phobia. Despite the limited number of studies, results are very encouraging for treatment in anxiety disorders. Several studies have reported the clinical use of virtual reality technology for children and adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive research has proven the efficiency of technologies as support tools for therapy. Researches are found to be focused on communication and on learning and social imitation skills. Virtual reality is also well accepted by subjects with ASD. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled tasks such as the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like a standard classroom. The virtual reality classroom offers several advantages compared to classical tools such as more realistic and lifelike environment but also records various measures in standardized conditions. Most of the studies using a virtual classroom have found that children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder make significantly fewer correct hits and more commission errors compared with controls. The virtual classroom has proven to be a good clinical tool for evaluation of attention in ADHD. For eating disorders, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program enhanced by a body image specific component using virtual reality techniques was shown to be more efficient than cognitive behavioural therapy alone. The body image-specific component using virtual reality techniques boots efficiency and accelerates the CBT change process for eating disorders. Virtual reality is a relatively new technology and its application in child and adolescent psychiatry is recent. However, this technique is still in its infancy and much work is needed including controlled trials before it can be introduced in routine clinical use. Virtual reality interventions should also investigate how newly acquired skills are transferred to the real world. At present virtual reality can be considered a useful tool in evaluation and treatment for child and adolescent disorders."}, {"Title": "Innovative biomarkers in psychiatric disorders: a major clinical challenge in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Currently, the diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses is based upon DSM-5 criteria.

The present review investigates the innovative post-genomic knowledge used for psychiatric illness diagnostics and treatment response, with a particular focus on proteomics. Areas covered: This review underlines the contribution that psychiatric innovative biomarkers have reached in relation to diagnosis and theragnosis of psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, it encompasses a reliable representation of their involvement in disease through proteomics, metabolomics/pharmacometabolomics and lipidomics techniques, including the possible role that gut microbiota and CYP2D6 polimorphisms may play in psychiatric illnesses. Expert opinion: Etiologic heterogeneity, variable expressivity, and epigenetics may impact clinical manifestations, making it difficult for a single measurement to be pathognomonic for multifaceted psychiatric disorders. Academic, industry, or government's partnerships may successfully identify and validate new biomarkers so that unfailing clinical tests can be developed.

Although violent behaviour is not a typical manifestation of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, the diagnosis of psychosis increases the overall risk of violence. One of the few modifiable factors of violence risk is adherence with medication. In contrast, non-adherence with drug treatment and subsequent relapse increases risk of violent acts. Non-adherence can be addressed partially by long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI). The aim of our review was to examine the role of antipsychotic drugs, especially LAI, in prevention and management of violent behaviour in psychosis.\nThis is a non-systematic, narrative review of the data from open, naturalistic, retrospective, and population studies, case series, and post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials. Search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase) was performed to identify relevant papers.\nNine published papers (3 cross-sectional chart reviews, 4 retrospective studies, 2 prospective, randomised trials) were found. The results indicated positive clinical and antiaggressive effects of LAI in psychotic patients with high risk of violent behaviour.\nReviewed evidence suggests that secured drug treatment with LAI may have clinical benefit in schizophrenia patients with high risk of violent behaviour. LAI significantly reduced the severity of hostility, aggressivity, number of violent incidents, and criminal offences. These findings are supported further by the empirical evidence from clinical practice, high rates of prescribed LAI to schizophrenia patients in high-security and forensic psychiatric facilities.\nAvailable data encourage the use of LAI in forensic psychiatry, especially during court-ordered commitment treatment."}, {"Title": "Amisulpride augmentation in clozapine-unresponsive schizophrenia (AMICUS): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.", "Abstract": "When treatment-refractory schizophrenia shows an insufficient response to a trial of clozapine, clinicians commonly add a second antipsychotic, despite the lack of robust evidence to justify this practice.\nThe main objectives of the study were to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of augmentation of clozapine medication with a second antipsychotic, amisulpride, for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\nThe study was a multicentre, double-blind, individually randomised, placebo-controlled trial with follow-up at 12 weeks.\nThe study was set in NHS multidisciplinary teams in adult psychiatry.\nEligible participants were people aged 18-65 years with treatment-resistant schizophrenia unresponsive, at a criterion level of persistent symptom severity and impaired social function, to an adequate trial of clozapine monotherapy.\nInterventions comprised clozapine augmentation over 12 weeks with amisulpride or placebo. Participants received 400\u2009mg of amisulpride or two matching placebo capsules for the first 4 weeks, after which there was a clinical option to titrate the dosage of amisulpride up to 800\u2009mg or four matching placebo capsules for the remaining 8 weeks.\nThe primary outcome measure was the proportion of 'responders', using a criterion response threshold of a 20% reduction in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.\nA total of 68 participants were randomised. Compared with the participants assigned to placebo, those receiving amisulpride had a greater chance of being a responder by the 12-week follow-up (odds ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 3.42) and a greater improvement in negative symptoms, although neither finding had been present at 6-week follow-up and neither was statistically significant. Amisulpride was associated with a greater side effect burden, including cardiac side effects. Economic analyses indicated that amisulpride augmentation has the potential to be cost-effective in the short term [net saving of between \u00a3329 and \u00a32011; no difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and possibly in the longer term.\nThe trial under-recruited and, therefore, the power of statistical analysis to detect significant differences between the active and placebo groups was limited. The economic analyses indicated high uncertainty because of the short duration and relatively small number of participants.\nThe risk-benefit of amisulpride augmentation of clozapine for schizophrenia that has shown an insufficient response to a trial of clozapine monotherapy is worthy of further investigation in larger studies. The size and extent of the side effect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapine combination may partly reflect the comprehensive assessment of side effects in this study. The design of future trials of such a treatment strategy should take into account that a clinical response may be not be evident within the 4- to 6-week follow-up period usually considered adequate in studies of antipsychotic treatment of acute psychotic episodes. Economic evaluation indicated the need for larger, longer-term studies to address uncertainty about the extent of savings because of amisulpride and impact on QALYs. The extent and nature of the side effect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapine combination has implications for the nature and frequency of safety and tolerability monitoring of clozapine augmentation with a second antipsychotic in both clinical and research settings.\nEudraCT number 2010-018963-40 and Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN68824876.\nThis project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 21, No. 49.

It is a condition of dysfunction or structural damage in physical organs through inappropriate activation of the involuntary nervous system and the biochemical response. In this framework, this review will consider anxiety disorders, from the perspective of the psychobiological mechanisms of vulnerability to extreme stress in severe chronic illnesses. Psychosomatic medicine is a field of behavioral medicine and a part of the practice of consultation-liaison psychiatry. Psychosomatic medicine in palliative care, integrates interdisciplinary evaluation and management involving diverse clinical specialties including psychiatry, psychology, neurology, internal medicine, allergy, dermatology, psychoneuroimmunology, psychosocial oncology and spiritual care. Clinical conditions where psychological processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence. Thus, the psychosomatic symptom develops as a physiological connected of an emotional state. In a state of rage or fear, for example, the stressed person's blood pressure is likely to be elevated and his pulse and respiratory rate to be increased. When the fear passes, the heightened physiologic processes usually subside. If the person has a persistent fear (chronic anxiety), however, which he is unable to express overtly, the emotional state remains unchanged, though unexpressed in the overt behavior, and the physiological symptoms associated with the anxiety state persist.

The paper illustrates dr Beaurain's fate during World War I when he was first a military doctor in Skocz\u00f3w and then an assistant in prof. Piltz's Neurological-Psychiatric Clinic in Krak\u00f3w where he actively participated in the creation of a multidimensional programme of war neurosis treatment. After the war finished, initially Beaurain stayed at his assistant post at the Psychiatric Clinic in Krak\u00f3w but then in 1921 he relocated to the National Psychiatric Hospital in Dziekanka near Pozna\u0144. With his professional expertise he contributed to the strengthening of the Great Poland region psychiatry that had experienced qualified personnel shortages after the German qualified staff left. The growing numbers of patients and the overload of professional duties were probably the factors that led to dr. Beaurain's premature death while he was holding the position of the head physician at the National Psychiatric Hospital in Owi\u0144ska in February 1927."}, {"Title": "Dr. Karol de Beaurain - a psychiatrist's profile. Part 1.", "Abstract": "The paper sets out to recall the profile of Karol de Beaurain, a psychiatrist who belonged to the circle of first Poles who used psychoanalysis in treatment. So far, dr Beaurain has been known from brief references in publications relating to the life and works of Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy) whose psychoanalytic sessions he conducted between 1912 and 1913. De Beaurain was born in 1867 and studied medicine at Swiss universities (Zurich, Berne, Geneva) where he defended his doctoral thesis as well. He was prepared for the career of a health resort physician and when he returned to Poland, he settled down in Poronin where except for working as a district physician, he also engaged in social and cultural activities. Around 1910 his professional interest shifted towards psychiatry and psychotherapy. In the final months of 1911 he relocated to Zakopane where he opened a private practice for \"neu-rotic diseases\". At the same time he started treating patients with the use of psychoanalytic methods. The first part of the paper concerns the life of doctor de Beaurain from birth and the period of studies and preparation for his professional career until the time when he started his psychoanalytic work."}, {"Title": "Significance of personality disorders in the face of drop-outs from psychiatric hospitalizations. The case of selected psychiatric units.", "Abstract": "The World Health Organization's estimations indicate that about 50% of patients in well-developed countries may not adhere to long-term therapies. In the field of psychiatry, drop-outs from psychiatric treatment are particularly important. Personality disorders are a significant part of this sphere. The aim of this research was to empirically verify the hypothesis regarding the relation between comorbid personality disorders and drop-outs from treatment among patients of psychiatric wards.\nThis study was a prospective cohort study. 110 patients, hospitalized in 3 different psychiatric wards, were included. Personality disorders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview For DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II). The research was financed by the Polish National Science Center (DEC-2011/01/N/NZ5/05364).\nThe response rate was 89.1%. 72.56% of patients suffered from personality disorders (SCID-II) (among them the most prevalent were: personality disorder - not otherwise specified - 40.7% and borderline personality disorder - 12.38%; 22.95% of patients dropped out from treatment). However, occurrence of personality disorders was not relevant for those drop-outs. On the other hand, relationships at the level of certain criteria of borderline personality disorders and passive-aggressive personality have been revealed. These relationships became stronger when considered from the perspective of differences in the organization of treatment at individual wards.\nSome personality disorders may play an important role in drop-outs from psychiatric treatment.

Participants completed questionnaires that assessed their sleep quality, daytime fatigue, help-seeking behavior, treatment preferences for sleep problems, and sociodemographic information. Multiple logistic regressions were used to identify correlates of patients who recognized their sleep difficulties and of those who had sought help.\nMental health professionals were the most preferred choice (60.8%) for consultation on sleep problems. Among patients with poor sleep quality (n=275), 28.4% denied having any problems and 38.9% had not sought help. Patients with chronic physical comorbidity were less likely to recognize their sleep problems (OR=0.432, p-value=0.009), while those with psychiatric comorbidity were twice as likely to perceive the problems (OR=2.094, p-value=0.021) and to seek help (OR=1.957, p-value=0.022).

No previous reports have described cases showing comorbidity with psychiatric disease or symptoms. In this case, we showed a patient with PKD who exhibited several manifestations of anxiety disorder.\nA 35-year-old Japanese man with PKD had been maintained on carbamazepine since he was 16 years of age without any attacks. However, 10 years before this referral, he became aware of a feeling of breakdown in his overall physical functions. He had then avoided becoming familiar with people out of concern that his physical dysfunctions might be perceived in a negative light. One day he was referred by the neurologic department at our hospital to the Department of Psychiatry because of severe anxiety and hyperventilation triggered by carbamazepine. We treated with escitalopram, aripiprazole, and ethyl loflazepate. Both his subjective physical condition and objective expressions subsequently showed gradual improvement. At last, the feelings of chest compression and anxiety entirely disappeared. Accordingly, increases in plasma monoamine metabolite levels were observed, and the c.649dupC mutation, which has been found in most Japanese PKD families, was detected in his proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 gene.\nThis is the first report to describe psychiatric comorbidities or symptoms in a PKD case.

Even deep brain stimulation (DBS) has not been studied or used for psychiatric disorders. Neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders has been thwarted by social taboos for many years, and psychiatrists today seem to simply ignore modern developments and therapies offered by neurosurgery such as DBS. As a result, most patients and their families do not know such \"last-resort\" options exist. Historically, as in other countries, frontal lobotomies were widely performed in Japan in the 1940s and 1950s, and some Japanese neurosurgeons used stereotactic methods for the treatment of psychiatric disorders until the 1960s. However, in the 1960s and 1970s such surgical treatments began to receive condemnation based on political judgment, rather than on medical and scientific evaluation. Protest campaigns at the time hinged on the prevailing political beliefs, forming a part of the new \"left\" movement against leading authorities across a wide range of societal institutions including medical schools. Finally, the Japanese Society for Psychiatry and Neurology banned the surgical treatment for psychiatric disorders in 1975. Even today, Japan's dark history continues to exert an enormous negative influence on neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Neuroplasticity and the brain connectome: what can Jean Talairach's reflections bring to modern psychosurgery?", "Abstract": "Contrary to common psychosurgical practice in the 1950s, Dr. Jean Talairach had the intuition, based on clinical experience, that the brain connectome and neuroplasticity had a role to play in psychosurgery. Due to the remarkable progress of pharmacology at that time and to the technical limits of neurosurgery, these concepts were not put into practice. Currently, these concepts are being confirmed by modern techniques such as neuroimaging and computational neurosciences, and could pave the way for therapeutic innovation in psychiatry. Psychosurgery commonly uses a localizationist approach, based on the idea that a lesion to a specific area is responsible for a deficit opposite to its function. To psychosurgeons such as Walter Freeman, who performed extensive lesions causing apparently inevitable deficit, Talairach answered with clinical data: complex psychic functions cannot be described that simply, because the same lesion does not provoke the same deficit in different patients. Moreover, cognitive impairment did not always follow efficacious psychosurgery. Talairach suggested that selectively destructing part of a network could open the door to a new organization, and that early psychotherapy could encourage this psychoplasticity. Talairach did not have the opportunity to put these concepts into practice in psychiatric diseases because of the sudden availability of neuroleptics, but connectomics and neuroplasticity gave rise to major advances in intraparenchymal neurosurgery, from epilepsy to low-grade glioma. In psychiatry, alongside long-standing theories implicating focal lesions and diffuse pathological processes, neuroimaging techniques are currently being developed. In mentally healthy individuals, combining diffusion tensor imaging with functional MRI, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography allows the determination of a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain on many spatial scales, the so-called connectome. Ultimately, global neurocomputational models could predict physiological activity, behavior, and subjective feeling, and describe neuropsychiatric disorders. Connectomic studies comparing psychiatric patients with controls have already confirmed the early intuitions of Talairach. As a striking example, massive dysconnectivity has been found in schizophrenia, leading some authors to propose a \"dysconnection hypothesis.\" Alterations of the connectome have also been demonstrated in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. Furthermore, normalization of the functional dysconnectivity has been observed following clinical improvement in several therapeutic interventions, from psychotherapy to pharmacological treatments. Provided that mental disorders result from abnormal structural or functional wiring, targeted psychosurgery would require that one be able: 1) to identify the pathological network involved in a given patient; 2) to use neurostimulation to safely create a reversible and durable alteration, mimicking a lesion, in a network compatible with neuroplasticity; and 3) to predict which functional lesion would result in adapted neuronal plasticity and/or to guide neuronal plasticity to promote recovery. All these conditions, already suggested by Talairach, could now be achievable considering modern biomarkers and surgical progress."}, {"Title": "The early argument for prefrontal leucotomy: the collision of frontal lobe theory and psychosurgery at the 1935 International Neurological Congress in London.", "Abstract": "The pathophysiology of mental illness and its relationship to the frontal lobe were subjects of immense interest in the latter half of the 19th century. Numerous studies emerged during this time on cortical localization and frontal lobe theory, drawing upon various ideas from neurology and psychiatry. Reflecting the intense interest in this region of the brain, the 1935 International Neurological Congress in London hosted a special session on the frontal lobe. Among other presentations, Yale physiologists John Fulton and Carlyle Jacobsen presented a study on frontal lobectomy in primates, and neurologist Richard Brickner presented a case of frontal ablation for olfactory meningioma performed by the Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon Walter Dandy. Both occurrences are said to have influenced Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz (1874-1955) to commence performing leucotomies on patients beginning in late 1935.

Technological advancement now allows for the detection of minute-to-minute changes while also capturing a longitudinal perspective of an individual's illness. Traditionally, assessments of mood have been conducted by means of clinical interviews and paper surveys. However, these methods are often inaccurate due to recall bias and compliance issues, and are limited in their capacity to collect and process data over long periods of time. The increased capability, availability and affordability of digital technologies in recent decades has offered a novel, non-invasive alternative to monitoring mood and emotion in daily life. This paper reviews the emerging literature addressing the use of digital mood tracking technologies, primarily focusing on the strengths and inherent limitations of using these new methods including electronic self-report, behavioural data collection and wearable physiological biosensors. This developing field holds great promise in generating novel insights into the mechanistic processes of mood disorders and improving personalised clinical care.

We first review the evidence base for approaches to evaluation of capacity-building, highlighting the gaps in this area. We then describe the adaptation of best practice for the Emerald capacity-building evaluation. The resulting mixed method evaluation framework was tailored to each target group and to each country context. We identified a need to expand the evidence base on indicators of successful capacity-building across the different target groups. To address this, we developed an evaluation plan to measure the adequacy and usefulness of quantitative capacity-building indicators when compared with qualitative evaluation. We argue that evaluation needs to be an integral part of capacity-building activities and that expertise needs to be built in methods of evaluation. The Emerald evaluation provides a potential model for capacity-building evaluation across key stakeholder groups and promises to extend understanding of useful indicators of success."}, {"Title": "DRD2 and ANKK1 genes associate with late-onset heroin dependence in men.", "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> Dopamine plays an important role in reward system of heroin dependence (HD), and dopaminergic D2 receptor (DRD2) gene is a candidate for the aetiology of HD. Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) gene is proximal to <i>DRD2</i> and may influence its expression. We explored whether <i>DRD2</i> and <i>ANKK1</i> associate with occurrence of HD, and whether the genetic variants influence personality traits in male patients with HD.<b>Methods:</b><i>DRD2</i>/<i>ANKK1</i> polymorphisms were analysed in 950 unrelated Han Chinese male participants (601\u2009HD patients and 349 healthy controls).

Forensic psychiatry nursing-a subfield of mental health nursing- focuses on individuals who are in conflict with the criminal justice system. We know little about the values of nurses working in forensic psychiatry, and how these values might influence a palliative approach to care for frail and aging patients.\nInterviews with four nurses working on one of two forensic units of a university-affiliated mental health hospital in an urban area of eastern Canada.\nThree specific values were found to guide forensic nurses in their care of aging patients that are commensurate with a palliative approach: hope, inclusivity, and quality of life.\nWhen we started this project, we wondered whether the culture of forensic nursing practice was antithetical to the values of a palliative approach. Instead, we found several parallels between forensic nurses' moral identities and palliative philosophy. These findings have implications for how we think about the palliative approach in contexts not typically associated with palliative care, but in which patients will increasingly age and die."}, {"Title": "[The history of child and adolescent psychiatry in Austria : Essay about a long development].", "Abstract": "The history of child and adolescent psychiatry in Austria is very short - it was established first in 1975, finally it achieved the status of a seperate specialisation in 2007.

All the patients referred to the APS team were enrolled. A standardized data collection template of demographic data, medical history, pain diagnosis, associated diseases, duration of treatment, number of visits by the APS team and type of treatment was employed. The primary outcomes were pain scores before, after treatment and the number of follow-ups. The patients were visited by APS at regular intervals and divided by the number of visits by APS team into several groups: group 1 (one visit and up to 2 follow ups); group 2 (3 to 4 follow-ups); group 3 (5 to 9 follow-ups); group 4 (10 to 19 follow-ups); group 5 (>20 followups). The difference between groups were analyzed with ordinal logistic regression analyses.\nPatients (n=730) (mean age 56\u00b14, female 58%, men 42%) were distributed by service to medical (41%) and surgical (58%). Of these, 48% of patients reported a pain score of moderate to severe pain and 27% reported severe pain on the first assessment. On the last examination before discharge, they reported 25-30% less pain (P=0.002). The median NRS (numerical rating scores) decreased significantly from 9.6 (95% confidence interval, 8.7-9.9) to 6.3 (6.1-7.4) for the severe pain (P<0.0001), from 3.8 (3.2-4.3) to 2.4 (1.8-2.9) for the moderate pain. The odds ratio for frequent follow-ups of the patients between 18 and 85 years (n=609) was 2.33 (95% CI: 1.35-4.02) if the patient had a history of chronic neuropathic pain, 1.80(1.25-2.60) in case the patient had a history of chronic nociceptive pain, 2.06(1.30-3.26) if he had mental diseases, and 3.35(2.21-5.08) if he had opioid dependency at the time of consultation from APS. Strong predictors of frequent visits included female gender (P=0.04).\nBeside the benefits of APS in reducing pain intensity, this study demonstrates that the focus of APS has been shifted from the traditional treatment of acute surgical pain to the clinical challenges of treating hospitalized patients with a high comorbidity of psychiatric diseases, opioid dependency and chronic pain.\nThe concept of an APS will ultimately be redefined according to the new clinical variables. In the light of the increasing number of patients with complex pain states and chronic pain, opioid dependency and psychiatric comorbidities it is mandatory that the interdisciplinary APS team should include other specialties besides the \"classical interdisciplinary APS team\", as psychiatry, psychology, rehabilitation and physiotherapy with experience in treating chronic pain patients."}, {"Title": "Integration of Primary Care and Psychiatry: A New Paradigm for Medical Student Clerkships.", "Abstract": "Public health crises in primary care and psychiatry have prompted development of innovative, integrated care models, yet undergraduate medical education is not currently designed to prepare future physicians to work within such systems.\nTo implement an integrated primary care-psychiatry clerkship for third-year medical students.\nUndergraduate medical education, amid institutional curriculum reform.\nTwo hundred thirty-seven medical students participated in the clerkship in academic years 2015-2017.\nEducators in psychiatry, internal medicine, and pediatrics developed a 12-week integrated Biopsychosocial Approach to Health (BAH)/Primary Care-Psychiatry Clerkship.

His breakthrough was largely due to his doctor friend's accidental injury during autopsy and his consequential death. Semmelweis found the pathological findings in his friend's post mortem examination were very similar to puerperal fever. He postulated his friend's death might be caused by \"cadaverous particles\" from cadavers and further inferred that puerperal fever might also be caused by the cadaverous particles that doctors brought to the delivering women after autopsy classes. He advocated hand-washing with chlorinated lime solution to wash off those particles, which rapidly reduced the maternal mortality in his department by 80% (from 10.65% to 1.98%).

In within-group analysis, MBIs significantly reduced depressive (7 studies, n=100, Hedges' g=0.58, p<0.001) and anxiety (4 studies, n=68, Hedges' g=0.34, p=0.043) symptoms, but not manic symptoms (6 studies, n=89, Hedges' g=0.09, p=0.488) and cognition (3 studies, n=43, Hedges' g=0.35, p=0.171), compared to baseline. In between-group analysis (intervention group versus waiting list group, all patients with BD), MBIs did not reduce depressive (3 studies, n=132, Hedges' g=0.46, p=0.315) or anxiety (3 studies, n=132, Hedges' g=0.33, p=0.578) symptoms.\nOnly three controlled trials compared MBIs to control conditions.\nOur meta-analysis showed significantly beneficial effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms of BD patients in within-group analysis. However, this significance was not observed in comparison with the control groups.

Use of MBC is routine in medical disease management. Unfortunately, MBC is not standard practice in psychiatric care. The current nonsystematic approach to the delivery of mental health care has created considerable variability in practice and may stall recovery. Although MBC has proven benefits, there are perceived barriers to its implementation. Greater research is needed to standardize psychiatric measures and clinical practice guidelines and determine the most effective implementation strategies. A review of the literature was conducted to (a) provide an overview of MBC and relevant screening tools; (b) examine the clinical use of MBC, including its relevance to evidence-based clinical guidelines and empirical support; and (c) detail the benefits and challenges of MBC implementation. As mental health care moves in the direction of value-driven incentives, it will be important for providers and organizations to consider MBC as an evidence-based framework to reduce variability in psychiatric treatment and improve patient outcomes.

Although psychiatric visiting nurses (PVNs) are an important group of professionals who provide medical services for people with mental disorders live in the community, little is known about the experiences and characteristics of violence exposure among PVNs, or the characteristics and work situations of PVNs related to violence exposure. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Approximately 40% of participants were exposed to violence during the previous 12\u00a0months; approximately 50% had been exposed during their PVN careers in PVN settings. The most frequent violence was verbal abuse. Longer career length as a PVN and greater number of visits per month were both positively associated with verbal abuse during the previous 12\u00a0months. Twenty-eight of the 34 participants (83%) who completed the IES-R-J survey had some residual psychological distress, and two (6%) had a potentially high risk of posttraumatic stress disorder. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: In devising policies and strategies against violence, PVN organizations and administrators should consider the characteristics of the violence, especially verbal abuse, as well as the characteristics and work situations of PVNs that are related to verbal abuse. Furthermore, they might provide relevant information on violence in PVN settings within their violence-prevention manuals or education. It would be important to provide support and to construct a safe workplace environment for PVNs who are experiencing residual psychological distress.\nIntroduction Psychiatric visiting nurses (PVNs) play a crucial role by providing medical services for community-living individuals with mental disorders in Japan. However, little is known about violence towards PVNs. Aim This cross-sectional study investigated violence during visits and the resulting psychological effects for PVNs. Methods PVNs were assessed using a violence exposure questionnaire and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R-J); a measure of posttraumatic distress. Result Thirty-eight (41%) of 94 participants had experienced violence during the previous 12\u00a0months and 49 (53%) over their entire career. The most frequent violence was verbal abuse. Career length as a PVN and number of visits per month were significantly positively associated with verbal abuse during the previous 12\u00a0months. The IES-R-J scores indicated 28 of the 34 participants who completed the questionnaire exhibited psychological distress for the most traumatic violence during their career and two had a potentially high risk of posttraumatic stress disorder. Discussion and Implications Policies and strategies aimed at reducing violence in PVN settings should be developed according to characteristics of the violence, as well as the characteristics and work situation of PVNs. Furthermore, the provision of support and a safe workplace environment would be important for PVNs with residual psychological distress."}, {"Title": "How mental health service systems are organized may affect the rate of acute admissions to specialized care: Report from a natural experiment involving 5338 admissions.", "Abstract": "Studies on the dynamics between service organization and acute admissions to psychiatric specialized care have given ambiguous results. We studied the effect of several variables, including service organization, coercion, and patient characteristics on the rate of acute admissions to psychiatric specialist services. In a natural experiment-like study in Norway, we compared a \"deinstitutionalized\" and a \"locally institutionalized\" model of mental health services. One had only community outpatient care and used beds at a large Central Mental Hospital; the other also had small bed-units at the local District Psychiatric Centre.\nFrom the case registries, we identified a total of 5338 admissions, which represented all the admissions to the psychiatric specialist services from 2003 to 2006. The data were analyzed with chi-square tests and Z-tests. In order to control for possible confounders and interaction effects, a multivariate analysis was also performed, with a logistic regression model.\nThe use of coercion emerged as the strongest predictor of acute admissions to specialist care (odds ratio\u2009=\u20097.377, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20094.131-13.174) followed by service organization (odds ratio\u2009=\u20093.247, 95% confidence interval\u2009=\u20092.582-4.083). Diagnoses of patients predicted acute admissions to a lesser extent. We found that having psychiatric beds available at small local institutions rather than beds at a Central Mental Hospital appeared to decrease the rate of acute admissions.\nWhile it is likely that the seriousness of the patients' condition is the most important factor in doctors' decisions to refer psychiatric patients acutely, other variables are likely to be important. This study suggests that the organization of mental health services is of importance to the rate of acute admissions to specialized psychiatric care. Systems with beds at local District Psychiatric Centers may reduce the rate of acute admissions to specialized care, compared to systems with local community outpatient services and beds at Central Mental Hospitals."}, {"Title": "Conventional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Facilitated by an Internet-Based Support System: Feasibility Study at a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic.", "Abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapies have been shown to be effective for a variety of psychiatric and somatic disorders, but some obstacles can be noted in regular psychiatric care; for example, low adherence to treatment protocols may undermine effects. Treatments delivered via the Internet have shown promising results, and it is an open question if the blend of Internet-delivered and conventional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapies may help to overcome some of the barriers of evidence-based treatments in psychiatric care.\nWe evaluated the feasibility of an Internet-based support system at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Sweden. For instance, the support system made it possible to send messages and share information between the therapist and the patient before and after therapy sessions at the clinic.\nNine clinical psychologists participated and 33 patients were enrolled in the current study. We evaluated the usability and technology acceptance after 12 weeks of access. Moreover, clinical data on common psychiatric symptoms were assessed before and after the presentation of the support system.\nIn line with our previous study in a university setting, the Internet-based support system has the potential to be feasible also when delivered in a regular psychiatric setting. Notably, some components in the system were less frequently used. We also found that patients improved on common outcome measures for depressive and anxious symptoms (effect sizes, as determined by Cohen d, ranged from 0.20-0.69).\nThis study adds to the literature suggesting that modern information technology could be aligned with conventional face-to-face services."}, {"Title": "True communication skills assessment in interdepartmental OSCE stations: Standard setting using the MAAS-Global and EduG.", "Abstract": "Comparing outcome of clinical skills assessment is challenging.

Computational models and simulations revealed that this difference was related to a higher base learning rate. These findings are better explained in a context-dependent reinforcement learning model.\nAnxious subjects' exaggerated response to uncertainty leads to a suboptimal decision strategy that makes it difficult for these individuals to determine whether an action is associated with an outcome by chance or by some statistical regularity.

To achieve this, the phenomena under scrutiny should be within the scope of formal methods. As emotions play an important role across many psychiatric disorders, such computational methods must encompass emotions. Here, we consider formal valuation accounts of emotions. We focus on the fact that the flexibility of emotional responses and the nature of appraisals suggest the need for a model-based valuation framework for emotions. However, resource limitations make plain model-based valuation impossible and require metareasoning strategies to apportion cognitive resources adaptively. We argue that emotions may implement such metareasoning approximations by restricting the range of behaviors and states considered. We consider the processes that guide the deployment of the approximations, discerning between innate, model-free, heuristic, and model-based controllers. A formal valuation and metareasoning framework may thus provide a principled approach to examining emotions."}, {"Title": "Navigating the social synapse: the neurobiology of bedside manner.", "Abstract": "This paper seeks to explore the application of neurobiology to further understanding the importance of developing, refining and modelling good bedside manner in psychiatry.

Studies examining personality disorders and contextual factors such as stress and trauma are examined with a focus on the crucial question of development and attachment status in children. Findings converge to reveal that offspring of parents (generally mothers) with most major psychiatric disorders present a higher risk for all mental disorders, and a wide range of disorders are also found in children, adolescent, and finally adult offspring of mothers with mood and anxiety disorders. Developmental psychopathology and infant and child psychiatry have focused on early relationship formation through social interaction and attachment patterns as pathways affected by vulnerability or resilience factors. First year of life longitudinal studies following mothers and infants has shown that maternal psychopathology is positively correlated with higher risk of attachment issues. It would seem that pathology appears when adaptation to real-life contexts becomes difficult in association with an accumulation of negative individual characteristics and environmental circumstances.

Although dopamine function and reward system neural activity are impaired in most psychiatric disorders, it is unknown whether alterations in the dopamine system underlie variations in reward processing across a continuum encompassing health and these disorders. We explored the relationship between dopamine function and neural activity during reward anticipation in 27 participants including healthy volunteers and psychiatric patients with schizophrenia, depression, or cocaine addiction, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) multimodal imaging with a voxel-based statistical approach. Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed with PET and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I as a marker of presynaptic dopamine function, and reward-related neural response was assessed using fMRI with a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task. Across all the participants, DAT availability in the midbrain correlated positively with the neural response to anticipation of reward in the nucleus accumbens. Moreover, this relationship was conserved in each clinical subgroup, despite the heterogeneity of mental illnesses examined. For the first time, a direct link between DAT availability and reward anticipation was detected within the mesolimbic pathway in healthy and psychiatric participants, and suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction is a common mechanism underlying the alterations of reward processing observed in patients across diagnostic categories.

Even following the publication of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) (2006), the WHO-RB remains the most comprehensive checklist for mental health legislation available, rooted in UN and WHO documents and providing the most systematic, detailed framework for human rights analysis of mental health legislation. We sought to determine the extent to which the IMHA will bring Indian legislation in line with the WHO-RB.\nThe IMHA and other relevant pieces of Indian legislation are compared to each of the items in the WHO-RB. We classify each item in a binary manner, as either concordant or not, and provide more nuanced detail in the text.\nThe IMHA addresses 96/175 (55.4%) of the WHO-RB standards examined. When other relevant Indian legislation is taken into account, 118/175 (68.0%) of the standards are addressed in Indian law. Important areas of low concordance include the rights of families and carers, competence and guardianship, non-protesting patients and involuntary community treatment. The important legal constructs of advance directives, supported decision-making and nominated representatives are articulated in the Indian legislation and explored in this paper.\nIn theory, the IMHA is a highly progressive piece of legislation, especially when compared to legislation in other jurisdictions subject to similar analysis. Along with the Indian Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, it will bring Indian law closely in line with the WHO-RB. Vague, opaque language is however, used in certain contentious areas; this may represent arrangement-focused rather than realisation-focused legislation, and lead to inadvertent limitation of certain rights. Finally, the WHO-RB checklist is an extremely useful tool for this kind of analysis; we recommend it is updated to reflect the CRPD and other relevant developments."}, {"Title": "Psychological Features of Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy: Report of Four Cases.", "Abstract": "Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy is a cardiomyopathy in which the patient has a sudden onset, reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction without any significant coronary artery disease. Four women, who were at a mean age of 64 years and suffered from chest pain exacerbated by emotional stress, were admitted as cases of acute coronary syndrome and were completely evaluated through precise history taking, physical examination, and ECG. Coronary angiography or coronary multidetector computed tomography was used to exclude significant coronary artery disease. In these patients with confirmed Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) criteria, a 71-item form of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-Mini-Mult-was employed for psychological assessment. The main common elevated scale was hypochondriasis. Individuals with high scores on this scale are obsessed with themselves, especially in regard to their body, and often use their disease symptoms in order to manipulate others. They are mainly passive aggressive, critical, and demanding, which stems from their lack of effective verbal abilities as a means of communication, specifically when it comes to anger or hostility expression. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available study evaluating patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy using the Mini-Mult questionnaire for psychological assessment."}, {"Title": "Addiction and technology: <i>Plus \u00e7a change plus c'est la m\u00eame</i> (The more things change, the more they remain the same).", "Abstract": "Excessive use of the internet for gambling, gaming and behavioural addiction, are a focus of contemporary interest.

Mobile technology provides a new platform for offering treatment on such units, but it has not been tested for feasibility or usability in this particular setting.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a brief mindfulness meditation mobile phone app intended to reduce anger and aggression in acute psychiatric inpatients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, and a history of violence.\nParticipants were recruited between November 1, 2015 and June 1, 2016. A total of 13 inpatients at an acute care state hospital carried mobile phones for 1 week and were asked to try a commercially available mindfulness app called Headspace. The participants completed a usability questionnaire and engaged in a qualitative interview upon completion of the 7 days. In addition, measures of mindfulness, state and trait anger, and cognitive ability were administered before and after the intervention.\nOf the 13 enrolled participants, 10 used the app for the 7 days of the study and completed all measures. Two additional participants used the app for fewer than 7 days and completed all measures. All participants found the app to be engaging and easy to use. Most (10/12, 83%) felt comfortable using Headspace and 83% (10/12) would recommend it to others.

In his time, however, he was foremost recognized for his work in refining histopathological techniques and thereby contributing to the methodological arsenal for differential diagnosis in clinical psychiatry. In his laboratory that was based at the renowned Munich Psychiatric University Clinic led by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), Alzheimer, his assistants, and students conserved, prepared, and studied slices of deceased patients' brains under the microscope. How could histological postmortem research better clinical diagnoses? Against what norm should the pathologies be compared? What was the normal brain in a context of highly invasive preparation techniques and the artifacts that they produced? In an unpublished lecture series, Alzheimer explicitly addressed these questions and framed them in terms of practical problems and possible solutions: where to get normal brains from; how animal studies could help to enlighten the normal brain and infectious mental disorders; how the study of hereditary idiocy might yield knowledge about normal brain development and general brain pathology. This chapter offers a close reading of parts of Alzheimer's lectures, his habilitation thesis, and his programmatic opening paper of a journal that he cofounded. These sources provide us with an introduction into the making of the normal and the pathological brain in histopathology that focuses more on problems and controversies than providing an undisputable, easy-to-use framework. I examine the premises of Alzheimer's conceptualization of \"pictures of equivalence\" (Aequivalentbilder) to elucidate how the epistemological gap between postmortem research and clinical psychiatry was managed in this particular context. The excavation of this historical epistemology not only fills a gap in the rich history of brain research that has mostly focused on brain localization theory, of which Alzheimer and Kraepelin were skeptical. It also provides a case study for how \"the normal\" and \"the pathological\" were put to work, and were, literally, pictured. In conjunction with the other chapters of this volume, this contribution thereby raises the historiographical and philosophical question of what to include into an assessment of the making and use of models of the brain."}, {"Title": "Inpatient psychiatric treatment is not always effective in adolescent sample.", "Abstract": "Numerous studies confirm efficacy of psychiatric treatment as well as psychiatric placebo.

It is characterized by high levels of comorbidities with other psychiatric conditions or somatic diseases as well as a recurrent or chronic course in 50 to 80% of the cases leading to negative repercussions on the daily functioning, with an impaired quality of life, and to severe direct/indirect costs. Large cohort studies have supported that failure of a first-line antidepressant treatment is observed in more than 60% of patients. In this case, several treatment strategies have been proposed by classical evidence-based guidelines from internationally recognized scientific societies, referring primarily on: I) the switch to another antidepressant of the same or different class; II) the combination with another antidepressant of complementary pharmacological profile; III) the addition of a wide range of pharmacological agents intending to potentiate the therapeutic effects of the ongoing antidepressant medication; IV) the association with appropriate psychological therapies; and, V) the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. However, although based on the most recently available data and rigorous methodology, standard guidelines have the significant disadvantage of not covering a large variety of clinical conditions, while currently observed in everyday clinical practice. From these considerations, formalized recommendations by a large panel of French experts in the management of depressed patients have been developed under the shared sponsorship of the French Association of Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN) and the Fondation FondaMental. These French recommendations are presented in this special issue in order to provide relevant information about the treatment choices to make, depending particularly on the clinical response to previous treatment lines or the complexity of clinical situations (clinical features, specific populations, psychiatric comorbidities, etc.). Thus, the present approach will be especially helpful for the clinicians enabling to substantially facilitate and guide their clinical decision when confronted to difficult-to-treat forms of major depression in the daily clinical practice. This will be expected to significantly improve the poor prognosis of the treatment-resistant depression thereby lowering the clinical, functional and costly impact owing directly to the disease."}, {"Title": "Potential for diagnosis versus therapy monitoring of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a new epigenetic biomarker interacting with both genotype and auto-immunity.", "Abstract": "In view of the need for easily accessible biomarkers, we evaluated in ADHD children the epigenetic status of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) in the SLC6A3 gene, coding for human dopamine transporter (DAT). We analysed buccal swabs and sera from 30 children who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD, assigned to treatment according to severity. Methylation levels at six-selected CpG sites (among which, a CGGCGGCGG and a CGCG motif), alone or in combination with serum titers in auto-antibodies against dopamine transporter (DAT aAbs), were analysed for correlation with CGAS scores (by clinicians) and Conners' scales (by parents), collected at recruitment and after 6\u00a0weeks. In addition, we characterized the DAT genotype, i.e., the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms at the 3'-UTR of the gene. DAT methylation levels were greatly reduced in ADHD patients compared to control, healthy children. Within patients carrying at least one DAT 9 allele (DAT 9/x), methylation at positions CpG2 and/or CpG6 correlated with recovery, as evident from delta-CGAS scores as well as delta Conners' scales ('inattentive' and 'hyperactive' subscales). Moreover, hypermethylation at CpG1 position denoted severity, specifically for those patients carrying a DAT 10/10 genotype. Intriguingly, high serum DAT-aAbs titers appeared to corroborate indications from high CpG1 versus high CpG2/CpG6 levels, likewise denoting severity versus recovery in DAT 10/10 versus 9/x patients, respectively. These profiles suggest that DAT 5'UTR epigenetics plus serum aAbs can serve as suitable biomarkers, to confirm ADHD diagnosis and/or to predict the efficacy of treatment."}, {"Title": "The Individual Experience of Aging Patients and the Current Service Provision in the Context of Italian Forensic Psychiatry: A Case Study.", "Abstract": "After the recent development of residential units for the execution of security measures managed by the National Health Service and the closing down of forensic psychiatric hospitals, no study has been conducted to investigate the individual experience of aging patients and to assess whether the new service is adequately meeting their needs.

The authors used a prospective population-based cohort to delineate the longitudinal relationship between childhood psychiatric problems and brain development.\nA total of 845 children participated in the study. Psychiatric symptoms were measured with the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist at ages 6 and 10. MRI data were collected at ages 8 and 10. Cross-lagged panel models and linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the associations between psychiatric symptom ratings and quantitative anatomic and white matter microstructural measures over time.\nHigher ratings for externalizing and internalizing symptoms at baseline predicted smaller increases in both subcortical gray matter volume and global fractional anisotropy over time. The reverse relationship did not hold; thus, baseline measures of gray matter and white matter were not significantly related to changes in symptom ratings over time.\nChildren presenting with behavioral problems at an early age show differential subcortical and white matter development.

Stakeholders wanted both pertinent findings (95%) and incidental findings (91%) to be made available for research participants. The majority (77%) stated that researchers should not actively search for incidental findings. Persons with mental disorders and relatives were generally more positive about receiving any kind of findings than clinical geneticists and psychiatrists. Compared with blood donors, persons with mental disorders reported to be more positive about receiving raw genomic data and information that is not of serious health importance. Psychiatrists and clinical geneticists were less positive about receiving genomic findings compared with blood donors. The attitudes toward receiving findings were very positive. Stakeholders were willing to refrain from receiving incidental information if it could compromise the research.

These advances have provided the basis for recent efforts to develop a more complex understanding of the function of brain circuits in health and of their relationship to behavior-providing, in turn, a foundation for our understanding of how disruptions in such circuits contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. This review focuses on the use of resting-state functional connectivity MRI to assess brain circuits, on the advances generated by the Human Connectome Project, and on how these advances potentially contribute to understanding neural circuit dysfunction in psychopathology. The review gives particular attention to the methods developed by the Human Connectome Project that may be especially relevant to studies of psychopathology; it outlines some of the key findings about what constitutes a brain region; and it highlights new information about the nature and stability of brain circuits. Some of the Human Connectome Project's new findings particularly relevant to psychopathology-about neural circuits and their relationships to behavior-are also presented. The review ends by discussing the extension of Human Connectome Project methods across the lifespan and into manifest illness. Potential treatment implications are also considered."}, {"Title": "Plasma nesfatin 1 level in patients with first attack psychosis.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between plasma concentrations of nesfatin 1 and first attack psychosis.\nTotally, 32 patients with the first episode psychosis and 33 randomly selected weight- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers admitted to Mustafa Kemal University, Faculty of Medicine, Training and Research Hospital, Psychiatry outpatient clinic were included. Healthy control subjects were matched in terms of weight and body mass index (BMI). The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS) was applied to the patient group. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to measure plasma nesfatin 1 levels.\nThe mean nesfatin 1 level was lower in the patients with the first attack psychosis (0.60 \u00b1 1.00 ng/mL) than in the control group (0.75 \u00b1 1.07 ng/mL).However it did not reach statistical significance (t = -0.567, p = 0.573). There was no statistically significant correlation between plasma nesfatin 1 levels and total PANNS scores in the patient group (r = -0.262, p = 0.148).\nOur study was the first to investigate the nesfatin 1 levels in patients with the first episode psychosis. Based on our study results, nesfatin 1 might be related to some central nervous system pathologies, including the severity of a psychiatric disorder; however, further large-scale studies are required to establish a conclusion (Tab. 1, Ref. 21)."}, {"Title": "Serotonin in psychiatry: in vitro disease modeling using patient-derived neurons.", "Abstract": "Several lines of evidence implicate serotonin in the etiology of multiple psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Much of our current understanding of biological mechanisms underlying serotonergic alterations in mood disorders comes from animal studies.

It is suggested that there could be interactions between \u03b1-synuclein and tau in cytoskeletal disorganization and synaptic dystrophy. Therefore, we aim to determine the serum levels of neurodegenerative molecules such as \u03b1-synuclein and tau in children with ADHD. The study group consisted of 25 children, aged 6-10, diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria and who appeared at Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine, and Department of Child Psychiatry in Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey. 25 children, having no psychiatric disorders and medical illnesses, were selected as healthy control group. Serum \u03b1-synuclein and tau concentrations were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. The \u03b1-synuclein levels of ADHD were not significantly different than those of controls. The tau levels of ADHD were found to be statistically significantly higher than those of controls. Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein levels showed a statistically significantly positive correlation with tau levels in children with ADHD. The results of our preliminary study can suggest that ADHD might possibly share a common disease mechanism with other diseases in terms of tau pathology. Increased serum tau level may be an indication of disturbance of microtubule transportation in the brains of children with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Socio-demographic characteristics and factors associated with hospitalization in psychiatry of old age patients: an international comparison between Ireland and Turkey.", "Abstract": "Taking predictors of hospitalization characteristics into consideration internationally would broaden our understanding of this population on a local basis.\nWe aimed to examine and compare socio-demographic profiles along with hospitalization characteristics including length of hospital stay (LOS), reasons for admission and diagnoses among older adult inpatients hospitalized in Ireland and Turkey, and to assess factors predicting these features.\nThe admission charts of 356 psychiatric inpatients over 65\u00a0years of age who were admitted to two different acute psychiatric hospitals (Sligo/Ireland and Istanbul/Turkey) were analysed by means of descriptive modalities and logistic regression.\nThere were significant differences in several domains of socio-demographics, reasons of admission and diagnoses. LOS was significantly longer in Ireland. Living alone was the only significant predictor for longer LOS in both countries, whereas in addition to living alone, younger age was also a contributor for longer LOS in Turkey.\nGiven that the only factor predicting LOS both in Turkey and Ireland was living alone, helping to identify more acceptable ways of providing social support for living arrangements constitutes an important service to shorten LOS in old age psychiatric population.\nIt is possible to infer that independent from the cultural diversities, living arrangement is a consistent entity to influence length of hospital stay in older adult population."}, {"Title": "1-Hz rTMS in the treatment of tinnitus: A sham-controlled, randomized multicenter trial.", "Abstract": "Chronic tinnitus is a frequent, difficult to treat disease with high morbidity.\nThis multicenter randomized, sham-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the left temporal cortex in patients with chronic tinnitus.\nTinnitus patients were randomized to receive 10 sessions of either real or sham 1-Hz-rTMS (2000 stimuli, 110% motor threshold) to the left temporal cortex.

This study aimed to assess mental health needs and psychological distress among the poorest in rural settings in Burkina Faso where food security and access to water, electricity, schooling, and healthcare are limited.\nWe randomly selected 2000 individuals previously identified as indigents by a community-targeting process. Interviewers visited participants (n\u00a0=\u00a01652) in their homes and completed a questionnaire on mental health variables that included presence and intensity of anxious, depressive, psychotic, and aggressive symptoms, as well as level of psychological distress. Descriptive statistics, Spearman correlations, and logistic regressions were performed.\nIn all, 40.2% of the sample reported 10 or more anxious/depressive symptoms in the past 30\u00a0days, and 25.5% reported having experienced at least one psychotic symptom over their lifetime, 65.6% of whom had had those symptoms for many years. The number of anxious and depressive symptoms was significantly associated with the level of psychological distress (r\u00a0=\u00a00.423, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

However, less progress has been made in harnessing these data to reveal new therapies. Here we propose a framework for drug repositioning by comparing transcriptomes imputed from GWAS data with drug-induced gene expression profiles from the Connectivity Map database and apply this approach to seven psychiatric disorders. We found a number of repositioning candidates, many supported by preclinical or clinical evidence. Repositioning candidates for a number of disorders were also significantly enriched for known psychiatric medications or therapies considered in clinical trials. For example, candidates for schizophrenia were enriched for antipsychotics, while those for bipolar disorder were enriched for both antipsychotics and antidepressants.

Medicare beneficiaries under the age of 65 enrolled in Medicare for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) due to permanent physical or mental disabilities are a population with poor health conditions and high utilization of health services; however, this vulnerable population has received limited attention from researchers and policymakers compared to the Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older. Data from the 2002-2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) with linked Medicare administrative claims data were used to select a total of 4,864 Medicare beneficiaries under the age of 65 with a total of 10,384 person-years (weighted n = 30,086,846 person-years). We found that trends in all-cause and psychiatric ED utilization among the young and disabled Medicare beneficiaries remained stable, but trends in the proportion of all-cause ED visits that were psychiatric related increased, and trends in the proportion of psychiatric ED visits resulting in a psychiatric inpatient stay decreased over time. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of psychiatric ED utilization included younger age, residence in the Northeast region, lower education level, Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, use of psychotropic medication, and greater number of chronic and psychiatric conditions. These findings highlight the need for policies, programs, and system interventions designed to reduce future psychiatric ED events and improve the access and quality of community mental health services for the community-dwelling, young, and disabled Medicare population.

Relapses of the daughter's disease occurred at the time of over-controlling attitude of the mother. Excessive control was associated with the daughter's immediate cut off from the family, discontinuation of medication, and a relapse. The relapse meant a repeated attempt of the mother to take control over the daughter's medication.\nThe analyzed family is genetically predisposed to the development of schizophrenic psychosis. Schizophrenia in the daughter is likely to have a neurodevelopmental background - it has developed as a result of the interaction of biological factors (genetic predisposition) and factors that interfered with the intrauterine development of the fetus.

We conducted a randomised controlled trial to investigate whether an innovative intervention programme prevents compulsory re-admission in people with serious mental illness.\nThe programme addresses primarily patients' self-management skills. It consists of individualised psychoeducation focusing on behaviours prior to and during illness-related crises, crisis cards and, after discharge from the psychiatric hospital, a 24-month preventive monitoring. A total of 238 inpatients with compulsory admission(s) in the past were randomised to the intervention group or to treatment as usual (TAU).\nFewer participants who completed the 24-month programme were compulsorily readmitted to psychiatry (28%), compared with those receiving TAU (43%). Likewise, the number of compulsory readmissions per patient was significantly lower (0.6 v. 1.0) and involuntary episodes were shorter (15 v. 31 days), compared with TAU. A negative binomial regression model showed a significant intervention effect (RR 0.6; 95% confidence interval 0.3-0.9); further factors linked to the risk of compulsory readmission were the number of compulsory admissions in the patient's history (RR 2.8), the diagnosis of a personality disorder (RR 2.8), or a psychotic disorder (RR 1.9). Dropouts (37% intervention group; 22% TAU) were characterised by a high number of compulsory admissions prior to the trial, younger age and foreign nationality.\nThis study suggests that this intervention is a feasible and valuable option to prevent compulsory re-hospitalisation in a high-risk group of people with severe mental health problems, social disabilities, and a history of hospitalisations."}, {"Title": "Latent traits of impulsivity and compulsivity: toward dimensional psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The concepts of impulsivity and compulsivity are commonly used in psychiatry.

Confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify the optimal model.\nThe data were best explained by a two-factor model, corresponding to latent traits of impulsivity and compulsivity, respectively, which were positively correlated with each other. This model was statistically superior to the alternative models of their being one underlying factor ('disinhibition') or two anticorrelated factors. Higher scores on the impulsive and compulsive latent factors were each significantly associated with worse quality of life (both p < 0.0001).\nThis study supports the existence of latent functionally impairing dimensional forms of impulsivity and compulsivity, which are positively correlated.

The relationship between immigration and crimes is a debated issue, and violent radicalization of second or third generations of migrants is under increased scrutiny. Consequently, many politicians and political parties use nationalist and xenophobic language. Inevitably, this will have an impact on reactions of the larger population, as well as that of migrants. Psychiatry can have a major role in dealing with immigrants' health needs, and also assessing risk and preventing violent behaviours due to mental disorders. It is possible to prevent some radicalization by employing strategies of education, leading to better integration of immigrants in the community (based on education, housing, work, etc.). However, often specialist services for migrants are lacking, and mental healthcare professionals may remain poorly trained. Italy is one of the major countries in Southern Europe with a large number of illegal and legal migrants; thereby, creating a major pressure on the resources. It is important to understand the links between globalization, migration, and violence in Italy, in order to prevent future radicalization.

Special situations with vulnerable populations, such as those created by international humanitarian emergencies, refugees or internally displaced people, and victims of human trafficking, are increasing in prevalence. These victims are often resettled in developed countries and come to the emergency department seeking care.

We observe that therapists, during the \"problem presentation\" sequence in clinical encounters, often use a specific form of diagnostic formulations to elicit more diagnostically relevant information. By doing so, they often substitute one type of verb with another, following a diagnostic hypothesis. Specifically, in interviews that arrive at a diagnosis of neurosis, therapists formulate with behavioral verbal processes; in interviews that arrive at a diagnosis of psychosis, they do so with material ones. Such formulations often prove useful to define clinical diagnoses. They can, however, also be dangerous in that they may favor the therapist's agenda over the patient's. Our analysis helps therapists not only better understand the diagnostic process but also reflect upon their own use of diagnostic formulations and become aware of the clinical effects of their interactional performance."}, {"Title": "\"Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place\"-Between Discourses of Empowerment and Solicitude: Danish Public Sector Service Professionals' Discourses of Nonattendance.", "Abstract": "Nonattendance constitutes a profound challenge in public sector services targeting young adults with mental health difficulties. Therefore, researchers and practitioners are occupied with trying to resolve this. For clinicians to be aware of their own naturalized and perhaps inappropriate communicative practices, we investigated the established normative organizational logics behind explanations and strategies related to nonattendance. We performed a critical discourse analysis on material collected through participatory research throughout 2015. Three discourses were identified: solicitude, responsibility, and youth discourse. Although the discourses were complex and entangled, they were used by all practitioners. Furthermore, some of the discourses, especially the responsibility and the solicitude discourses, were inherently tension filled, and practitioners experienced frustration in dealing with these tensions. The youth discourse can be understood as a coping mechanism to deal with these tensions because it distributes responsibility for nonattendance to general social and cultural processes."}, {"Title": "Care, Control, and the Electroconvulsive Therapy Ritual: Making Sense of Polarized Patient Narratives.", "Abstract": "Despite evidence of short-term effectiveness of ECT (electroconvulsive therapy), both positive and negative patient reports are common. However, research examining these polarized accounts has not adequately elucidated why such divergences occur. We thus sought to examine opposing patient narratives to better understand underlying meanings. Eighteen interviews were conducted with U.K.-based people who had experienced the treatment. Our analysis revealed that the quality of relations with staff, ECT artifacts (e.g., the ECT suite), and perceived outcomes all play a role in divergent accounts. Positive reflections on ECT emerged alongside narratives of trust in staff, comfort with ECT, and perception of sufficient personal control. Conversely, where negative evaluations of ECT predominated, there was anger associated with a lack of control, a belief that ECT made little sense, and was linked to past abuses and/or the unacceptability of side effects. We discuss the implications of our findings for professionals."}, {"Title": "When a parent dies - a systematic review of the effects of support programs for parentally bereaved children and their caregivers.", "Abstract": "The death of a parent is a highly stressful life event for bereaved children. Several studies have shown an increased risk of mental ill-health and psychosocial problems among affected children. The aims of this study were to systematically review studies about effective support interventions for parentally bereaved children and to identify gaps in the research.\nThe review's inclusion criteria were comparative studies with samples of parentally bereaved children. The focus of these studies were assessments of the effects on children of a bereavement support intervention. The intervention was directed towards children 0-18\u00a0years; but it could also target the children's remaining parent/caregiver. The study included an outcome measure that dealt with effects of the intervention on children. The following electronic databases were searched up to and including November 2015: PubMed, PsycINFO, Cinahl, PILOTS, ProQuest Sociology (Sociological Abstracts and Social Services Abstracts). The included studies were analysed and summarized based on the following categories: type of intervention, reference and grade of evidence, study population, evaluation design, measure, outcome variable and findings as effect size within and between groups.\nOne thousand, seven hundred and-six abstracts were examined. Following the selection process, 17 studies were included. The included studies consisted of 15 randomized controlled studies, while one study employed a quasi-experimental and one study a pre-post-test design. Thirteen studies provided strong evidence with regards to the quality of the studies due to the grade criteria; three studies provided fairly strong evidence and one study provided weaker evidence. The included studies were published between 1985 and 2015, with the majority published 2000 onwards. The studies were published within several disciplines such as psychology, social work, medicine and psychiatry, which illustrates that support for bereaved children is relevant for different professions. The interventions were based on various forms of support: group interventions for the children, family interventions, guidance for parents and camp activities for children. In fourteen studies, the interventions were directed at both children and their remaining parents. These studies revealed that when parents are supported, they can demonstrate an enhanced capacity to support their children. In three studies, the interventions were primarily directed at the bereaved children. The results showed positive between group effects both for children and caregivers in several areas, namely large effects for children's traumatic grief and parent's feelings of being supported; medium effects for parental warmth, positive parenting, parent's mental health, grief discussions in the family, and children's health. There were small effects on several outcomes, for example children's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety, depression, self-esteem and behaviour problems. There were studies that did not show effects on some measures, namely depression, present grief, and for the subgroup boys on anxiety, depression, internalizing and externalizing.\nThe results indicate that relatively brief interventions can prevent children from developing more severe problems after the loss of a parent, such as traumatic grief and mental health problems. Studies have shown positive effects for both children's and remaining caregiver's health. Further research is required including how best to support younger bereaved children. There is also a need for more empirically rigorous effect studies in this area."}, {"Title": "Synthetic Cannabis Analogues and Suicidal Behavior: Case Report.", "Abstract": "Despite growing legal control, a wide range of synthetic cannabis analogues is currently used for recreational purposes, notwithstanding their well adverse outcomes, which appear to be more frequent and more serious than those associated with cannabis use. We present the case report of a patient with paranoid schizophrenia, who attempted suicide by serious bodily harm after a single use of \"Shiva Ultra Strong,\" a compound of several synthetic cannabis analogues.\nA 32-year-old male patient with paranoid schizophrenia was brought to the emergency department presenting with a severe self-inflicted wound to the neck which lacerated the right jugular vein and ipsilateral airway, and narrowly missed the carotid bifurcation. On examination, the patient exhibited psychomotor agitation and anxiety. Laboratory tests, which included routine substance use screening, proved unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the ENT Department for surgical treatment, after which he was transferred to our Psychiatry Department, exhibiting consistent improvement with his usual antipsychotic regimen, to which he had good previous adherence. Later, after discharge, he admitted to having used a smartshop drug, so-called \"Shiva Ultra Strong,\" shortly before the suicide attempt.\nAlthough current data on the suicide risk of synthetic cannabis analogues are limited, there is growing evidence of relevant psychiatric effects after their use.

These processes enable redox sensing and facilitate homeostatic regulation of redox dependent protein signalling, function, stability and trafficking. Increased S-nitrosylation in an environment of increasing oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) is initially a protective mechanism aimed at maintaining protein structure and function. When O&NS becomes severe, mechanisms governing denitrosylation and transnitrosylation break down leading to the pathological state referred to as hypernitrosylation (HN). Such a state has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and we investigate its potential role in the development and maintenance of neuroprogressive disorders. In this paper, we propose a model whereby the hypernitrosylation of a range of functional proteins and enzymes lead to changes in activity which conspire to produce at least some of the core abnormalities contributing to the development and maintenance of pathology in these illnesses."}, {"Title": "The impact of CT head scans on ED management and length of stay in bizarre behavior patients.", "Abstract": "A 5-year retrospective chart review was conducted at 3 EDs.

This study aims to analyze these possible mechanisms by comparing the effect of IA severity and childhood ADHD on inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in young adults with IA. We hypothesized that IA might have associations with ADHD-like cognitive and behavior symptoms aside from childhood ADHD. Methods Study participants consisted of 61 young male adults. Participants were administered a structured interview. The severity of IA, childhood and current ADHD symptoms, and psychiatry comorbid symptoms were assessed through self-rating scales. The associations between the severity of IA and ADHD symptoms were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. Results Hierarchical regression analyses showed that the severity of IA significantly predicted most dimensions of ADHD symptoms. By contrast, childhood ADHD predicted only one dimension. Discussion The high comorbidity of inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in IA should not solely be accounted by an independent ADHD disorder but should consider the possibility of cognitive symptoms related to IA. Functional and structural brain abnormalities associated with excessive and pathologic Internet usage might be related to these ADHD-like symptoms. Conclusion Inattention and hyperactivity in young adults with IA are more significantly associated with the severity of IA than that of childhood ADHD."}, {"Title": "Suicidal ideation and burnout among psychiatric trainees in Japan.", "Abstract": "Burnout is a psychological condition that may occur in all workers after being exposed to excessive work-related stresses.

Tablets were the commonest (60%) formulation of disulfiram/DLP advised by the dispenser, only 4% of whom were psychiatrists. Surreptitious administration was preferred by family members (76%). Majority of the patients (44%) received the medication only once or twice.\nThe actual product - disulfiram and/or DLP - could not be chemically tested to confirm the identity. Considering the socio-economic and cultural background where the study was conducted, it would be difficult to generalize the findings.\nDisulfiram/DLP was prescribed by physicians and faith healers alike. They seem to promote surreptitious administration of disulfiram with full agreement of relatives, thereby potentially exposing the patient to life threatening complications. Hence it is recommended that disulfiram prescription should involve stricter guidelines and DLP like kudzu in traditional/herbal products should also be brought under the same purview as disulfiram."}, {"Title": "Internet addiction and sleep quality among Vietnamese youths.", "Abstract": "Internet addiction has been a major behavioral disorder over the past decade. Prior meta-analytic review has demonstrated the association between Internet addiction and psychiatric disorders, as well as sleep related disorders.\nThere remains a paucity of literature about Internet addiction and sleep related disorders in low and middle income countries like Vietnam. It is the aim of this exploratory study to determine the association.\nAn online cross-sectional study was conducted between August through to October 2015. Respondent drive sampling technique was utilized in the recruitment of participants. The short form version of the Young's Internet addiction test was administered and sleep related disorders was ascertained by means of a self-report questionnaire. Chi-squared, t-test and ANOVA were used to determine whether there were any significant differences amongst the variables considered. Multivariate logistic regressions were also used in the analysis, in order to identify factors associated with Internet addiction.\n21.2% Of the participants were diagnosed with Internet addiction. 26.7% of those with Internet addiction also reported that they have had sleep related difficulties. 77.2% of these participants were receptive towards seeking medical treatment. Our current study also highlighted that being single and those who were using tobacco products were not at heightened risk of developing associated sleep related issues.\nOur current study is largely a cross-sectional exploratory study that has shown that there is a significant prevalence of both Internet addiction and sleep related disorders amongst Vietnamese youth."}, {"Title": "Detection of domestic violence by community mental health teams: a multi-center, cluster randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Domestic Violence and Abuse (DVA) is associated with a range of psychosocial and mental health problems. Having a psychiatric illness increases likelihood of being a victim of DVA. Despite the evidence of a high risk for DVA and the serious effects of violent victimization in psychiatric patients, detection rates are low and responses are inadequate. The aim of the BRAVE (Better Reduction trough Assessment of Violence and Evaluation) study is to improve detection of and response to DVA in psychiatric patients. In this article, we present the protocol of the BRAVE study which follows the SPIRIT guidelines.\nThe BRAVE study is a cluster randomized controlled trial. We will include 24 community mental health teams from Rotterdam and The Hague. Twelve teams will provide care as usual and 12 teams will receive the intervention. The intervention consists of 1) a knowledge and skills training for mental health professionals about DVA, 2) a knowledge and skills training of DVA professionals about mental illness, 3) provision and implementation of a referral pathway between community mental health and DVA services. The follow up period is 12\u00a0months. Our primary outcome is the rate of detected cases of recent or any history of DVA in patients per team in 12\u00a0months. Detection rates are obtained through a systematic search in electronic patient files. Our secondary aims are to obtain information about the gain and sustainability of knowledge on DVA in mental health professionals, and to obtain insight into the feasibility, sustainability and acceptability of the intervention. Data on our secondary aims will be obtained through structured in depth interviews and a questionnaire on knowledge and attitudes on DVA.\nThis study is the first cluster randomized controlled trial to target both male and female psychiatric patients that experience DVA, using an intervention that involves training of professionals. We expect the rate of detected cases of DVA to increase in the intervention teams. With early detection of victimization of DVA in psychiatric patients we hope to improve the mental health of psychiatric patients in the short and long term.\nISRCTN:14115257 .

The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) has recognized SPD as an independent disease, namely an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, psychiatric treatment is indicated. Therefore, in a large cohort of SPD, we asked whether dermatologists' treatment strategy includes routine referrals to psychiatry. In addition, we describe epidemiological data, treatments and follow up.\nWe performed a retrospective study, searching in our hospital database between January 1 2011 and December 31 2016.\nA total of 154 (141 female, 13 male) patients were included in our study. In less than 5% a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist occurred. More than 90% of all patients received topical and almost 40% systemical anti-acne treatment. The loss of follow-up was very high.\nOur study shows that dermatologists focus on treating acne-like lesions in SPD, but rarely refer to psychiatry. Possible reasons include considerations of patients' reactions who often reject the idea of a psychological origin of the disease. Our results suggest that new treatment strategies should be created to address SPD correctly, i.e. by combined consultations with psychiatrists or specific training of dermatologists in psychiatric therapy and diagnostics."}, {"Title": "A person-centred approach in medicine to reduce the psychosocial and existential burden of chronic and life-threatening medical illness.", "Abstract": "The psychiatric, psychosocial, and existential/spiritual pain determined by chronic medical disorders, especially if in advanced stages, have been repeatedly underlined. The right to approach patients as persons, rather than symptoms of organs to be repaired, has also been reported, from Paul Tournier to Karl Jaspers, in opposition and contrast with the technically-enhanced evidence-based domain of sciences that have reduced the patients to 'objects' and weakened the physician's identity deprived of its ethical value of meeting, listening, and treating subjects. The paper will discuss the main psychosocial and existential burden related to chronic and advanced medical illnesses, and the diagnostic and therapeutic implications for a dignity preserving care within a person-centred approach in medicine, examined in terms of care of the person (of the person's whole health), for the person (for the fulfilment of the person's health aspirations), by the person (with physicians extending themselves as total human beings), and with the person (working respectfully with the medically ill person)."}, {"Title": "Review of Cold War Freud, Psychiatry in Communist Europe, and Psiquiatr\u00eda, Psico\u00e1nalisis y Cultura Comunista: Batallas Ideol\u00f3gicas en la Guerra Fria [Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Communist Culture: Ideological Battles in the Cold War].", "Abstract": "Reviews the books, <i>Cold War Freud</i> by D.

Vezzetti. On the whole, the three books show how the Cold War influenced, in various ways, psychiatric and psychotherapeutic cultures. Beyond the Iron Curtain, as one can perceive from the book edited by Savelli and Marks (2015), politics explicitly set the agenda for the psychological sciences, using them even to invent ad hoc nosologies, useful for purposes related to power. In the United States, on the other hand, as Herzog (2016) pinpoints, the political situation affected the same field, even if indirectly, as in the Christianization of a discipline-psychoanalysis-the creator of which proudly declared himself an atheist Jew. In other Western countries, the relationship between psychiatry and power could bring about paradoxical results. From Vezzetti's (2016) book, one can ascertain that psychiatric culture might assume an overtly opposing stance toward political power. Vezzetti scans the case of Argentina, and partly of France, but they were not isolated cases. In Italy, for example, a movement of radical psychiatrists understood their role as a necessary opposition to political power, having as an aim the \"liberation\" of patients locked up in the psychiatric hospitals (Foot, 2015).

One such putative environmental factor is the electromagnetic field exposure, especially the occupational extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic field, 50\u00a0Hz, 1\u00a0mT, whose neurobiological relevance remains elusive. We evaluated the effects of long-term (60 days) ELF-MF exposure on miRNAs previously related to brain and human diseases (miR-26b-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-106b-5p, miR-107, miR-125a-3p). A total of 64 young (3 weeks-old) and mature (10 weeks-old) male/female Wistar-Albino rats were divided into sham and ELF-MF exposed groups. After sacrifice of the animals, blood samples from rat's tail vein and brain tissues were collected. The expression levels of miRNAs were investigated with Real-Time PCR technique and TaqMan probe Technology. All miRNA expression levels of the young female rats show a significant decrease in blood according to brain samples (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but fewer miRNAs displayed a similar significant decrease in the blood. In conclusion, these new observations might inform future clinical biological psychiatry studies of long-term electromagnetic field exposure, and the ways in which host-environment interactions contribute to brain diseases."}, {"Title": "Aspirin and incident depressive symptoms: A longitudinal cohort study over 8\u00a0years.", "Abstract": "Aspirin exhibits anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties-two potential risk factors for depression.

The personality trait conscientiousness predicted obtaining honors/highest grade in all clinical clerkships. In contrast, students high in neuroticism were less likely to do well in most specialties. Students with higher conscientiousness were more likely to be inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society, while students high in openness or agreeableness traits were more likely to be inducted into the Gold Humanism Honor Society.

Since this is both a difficult and increasingly important area for medical student training, we created an addition to our psychiatry clerkship curriculum to address this need using a standardized patient scenario.\nStandardized patient scenarios are a useful instructional and assessment tool for providing medical students with exposure to specific clinical scenarios that could not be consistently and reliably encountered in clinical rotations. We present a standardized patient scenario designed to challenge psychiatry clerkship students with recognizing and managing substance use disorders in patients with a difficult interaction style and medication-seeking behavior. Our scenario is unique in its expectations of students to appropriately manage a difficult clinical interaction in which collaborative treatment planning and advanced communication skills are critical to treatment success.\nIn a narrative analysis of student postencounter reflections on this experience, most students who provided feedback indicated that the encounter was valuable to their psychiatry clerkship education.\nThe inclusion of this learning opportunity in our clerkship has added value by assessing students' interpersonal communication skills and clinical ability to evaluate and manage substance use disorders, as well as by instructing students to manage a common and difficult clinical scenario regardless of their future specialty choice."}, {"Title": "The Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and Trauma-Related Disorders.", "Abstract": "Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders, focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and Pharmacotherapy of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia in a Geriatric Psychiatry Unit: A Retrospective Analysis.", "Abstract": "To observe (1) the proportion and nature of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients treated at a geriatric psychiatry ward in Germany over a time span of 1 year and (2) the use and effect of various pharmacologic interventions in managing BPSD in a real-world scenario.\nThis study was a naturalistic, retrospective analysis. Between May 2015 and May 2016, 437 patients aged 65 to 100 years with various psychiatric diseases (including dementia, schizophrenia, and depression) were admitted to a geriatric psychiatry unit in Germany. Their medical charts were reviewed to identify patients with dementia who presented with BPSD according to DSM-5 criteria. Since a decline in behavioral organization is a typical clinical manifestation of delirium, delirious patients with behavioral symptoms at admission were also included.\nOf 437 patients, 74 (16.9%) showed severe behavioral symptoms that were categorized into 6 groups: aggression, screaming, wandering, food refusal, self-harm, and a combination of both behavioral and psychological symptoms. Overall, 65 patients (87.5%) showed improvement in their behavior regardless of the pharmacotherapy they were receiving.\nBPSD is one of the main reasons for admission to a geriatric psychiatry unit. Most of the patients with BPSD showed an improvement of behavioral symptoms with pharmacotherapy. Nonetheless, a clear correlation between a specific pharmacologic agent and behavioral improvement could not be established. A multimodal concept that involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches in managing BPSD should be the focus of future research."}, {"Title": "Sixty years in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The author, who has spent over 60 years working in a variety of mental health settings, shares his personal perspective of the way psychiatry has evolved.

The visually inspected EEG (vEEG) can detect various forms of abnormalities, each with its own clinical significance. Abnormalities can be paroxysmal (i.e., suggestive of an epileptic-like process) or stationary. The most important unanswered question remains the value of detecting epileptiform activity in a nonepileptic psychiatric patient in predicting favorable responses to anticonvulsant treatment. Despite the many shortcomings of vEEG, the available evidence suggests that in the presence of paroxysmal activity in a nonepileptic psychiatric patient a trial of a psychotropic anticonvulsant may be warranted if standard treatment has failed. More research on the contribution of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities to the problem of episodic psychiatric symptoms (e.g., panic attacks, dissociative episodes, repeated violence) is sorely needed. It is postulated that at least some of these conditions may represent an epilepsy spectrum disorder. Similarly, the significance of the presence of a slow-wave activity (whether focal or generalized) also deserves further well-designed research to ascertain the exact clinical significance. Nonetheless, the available data suggest that further medical workup is necessary to ascertain the nature and degree of the pathology when present."}, {"Title": "Partnering with Psychiatry to Close the Education Gap: An Approach to the Addiction Epidemic.", "Abstract": "Addiction has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., yet the workforce prepared to care for this population is woefully inadequate. Of the 23 million Americans suffering from addiction, only 11% receive treatment, creating a substantial treatment gap. There have been calls to improve addiction education at all levels of training in order to prepare medical providers with the skills to identify patients with substance use, briefly treat if indicated, and/or refer more complex cases to specialty care. These calls have been put forth to address the education gap, wherein physicians in training are exposed to numerous patients who are suffering from addiction but have few curricular hours dedicated to the identification and management of this population. We propose that strategic partnerships between psychiatry and internal medicine can address the education gap that exists with regard to addiction, ultimately addressing the treatment gap which is plaguing this country."}, {"Title": "Leveraging psychiatric and medical genetics to understand comorbid depression and obesity.", "Abstract": "Precision medicine in psychiatry is on the rise, and depression and obesity - two highly prevalent, comorbid and well-characterised phenotypes - are optimal targets for the approach.

Different profiles of clinical presentation and symptom evolution emerged for patients with schizophrenia who had co-morbid depression (15%), OCD (15%), panic or limited symptom attacks (55%) and social anxiety (5%). At least eighty percent of the sample had one or more of these co-morbidities. Summing up, the data support our previous finding that panic is highly prevalent in Schizophrenia with Auditory Hallucinations (>73% here, versus 100% before), and panic was paroxysmally concurrent with voice onset. Moreover, characteristic clinical findings may help point clinicians to five specific co-morbidity psychosis subtypes. Moreover, co-morbidity dissection of psychotic diagnoses recalls and parallels the historical psychopharmacologic dissection of non-psychotic anxiety and depressive subtypes diagnoses.

Physical health disparities and mental illness: The scandal of premature mortality. Br J Psychiatr. 2011;199:441-442). Numerous factors contribute to premature mortality in persons with SMI, including suicide and accidental death (Richardson RC, Faulkner G, McDevitt J, Skrinar GS, Hutchinson D, Piette JD. Integrating physical activity into mental health services for persons with serious mental illness. Psychiatr Serv. 2005;56(3):324-331; Thornicroft G. Physical health disparities and mental illness: The scandal of premature mortality. Br J Psychiatr. 2011;199:441-442), but research has shown that adverse health behaviors-including smoking, low rate of physical activity, poor diet, and high alcohol consumption-also significantly contribute to premature deaths (Jones J. Life expectancy in mental illness. Psychiatry Services. 2010. Retrieved from http://psychcentral.com/news/2010/07/13/life-expectancy-in-mental-illness). This quality improvement (QI) project sought to improve health and wellness for veterans in the Mental Health Intensive Case Management Program (MHICM), which is a community-based intensive program for veterans with SMI at risk for decompensation and frequent hospitalizations. At the time of this QI project, the program had 69 veterans who were assessed and treated weekly in their homes. The project introduced a pedometer steps intervention adapted from the VA MOVE! Program-a physical activity and weight management program-with the addition of personalized assistance from trained mental health professionals in the veteran's home environment. Because a large percentage of the veterans in the MHICM program had high blood pressure and increased weight, these outcomes were the focus of this project. Through mental health case management involvement and the comfort of their familiar living environment, veterans were assisted to meet their physical and mental health goals with a program that could easily be integrated into their daily lives.\nHealthy People 2020 developed goals to improve levels of physical activity and has ranked physical activity as a leading health indicator (US DHHS. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Physical activity topic overview. In Healthy People 2020. 2016. Retrieved from https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/physical-activity). Individuals with SMI are significantly less active than the general population (Shor and Shalev, 2014). It is sometimes difficult for the average individual to obtain the recommended 10,000 steps and even more difficult for those with SMI. Lifestyle modifications, in particular diet and exercise, are recommended for improvement of chronic disease outcomes (US Preventive Services Counseling Task Force, 2016). The health benefits of physical activity for people with SMI are mixed (Pearsall R, Smith D, Pelosi A, Geddes J. Exercise therapy in adults with serious mental illness: A systematic review and meta-analysis. BMC Psychiatr. 2014;14:117). Some studies found significant physical health benefits, while others did not. However, according to a review by Soundy et\u00a0al., physical exercise is shown to not only have physical benefits but also psychosocial benefits. One of the barriers that hinder participation in physical activities is accessibility (Shor and Shalev, 2014). Integrating a more personalized supported, and in-home pedometer program into mental healthcare should ensure better access to interventions that could possibly reverse the causes of premature death.\nThe program was offered to 69 veterans in the MHICM. Forty-nine agreed to start the program and 20 declined. Twenty-five clients actually started the program with 17 veterans completing it. Preimplementation data included collecting blood pressure and weight measures for all veterans in the MHICM program. Additionally, a focus group was held with case managers to obtain a group perspective on motivating veterans to participate in this program. Further, a teaching session was held to review pedometers use, the client video, the client booklet, methods for getting veterans started, and the progression of the walking intervention. The pedometer physical activity intervention continued for 2 months. At the end of the 2 months, aggregate de-identified data on number of steps, blood pressure, and weight were collected. At the end of the program, the data were reviewed, synthesized, and analyzed, being careful to account for potentially intervening conditions and other chronic illnesses.\nThe postimplementation data revealed that the mean weight decreased by 9 lbs. The percentage of controlled blood pressure increased from 60 to 84, while the percentage of uncontrolled blood pressure decreased from 40 to 16.\nImplementation of a multiple component personalized exercise intervention program for veterans with SMI contributed to reduction in weight and blood pressure."}, {"Title": "The renin-angiotensin system: a possible new target for depression.", "Abstract": "Depression remains a debilitating condition with an uncertain aetiology. Recently, attention has been given to the renin-angiotensin system.

Studies of drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system have yielded promising results. Here, we review the potential beneficial effects of angiotensin blockers in depression and their mechanisms of action. Drugs blocking the angiotensin system have efficacy in several animal models of depression. While no randomised clinical trials were found, case reports and observational studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had positive effects on depression, whereas other antihypertensive agents did not. Drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin system act on inflammatory pathways implicated in depression. Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that these drugs possess antidepressant properties.

The contribution of CTOs to mortality risk associated with CTO facilitation of access to general medical care and prevention of criminal involvement was assessed with logistic regression models. Cohort differences in quality of life were also examined.\nA total of 2,727 patients (10%) in the overall sample died, and the sample had a higher mortality risk than the general population. Probability of death by any cause was 9% lower in the CTO cohort than in the non-CTO cohort. Facilitation of access to medical care accounted for a 20% reduction in risk of non-injury-related deaths in the CTO cohort, compared with the non-CTO cohort. Risk of death by self-harm was 32% higher, compared with the non-CTO cohort. CTO placement appeared to lead to a gain of 3.8 years of life among men and 2.4 years among women, compared with the non-CTO cohort. Quality-of-life scores were modestly less favorable for the non-CTO cohort.\nCTO placement was associated with lower mortality risk via facilitated access to medical care and with modest enhancement of quality of life."}, {"Title": "Mind the Gap: Developing an Integrated Behavioral Health Home to Address Health Disparities in Serious Mental Illness.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated the impact of an integrated behavioral health home (BHH) pilot on adults with psychotic and bipolar disorders.\nQuasi-experimental methods were used to compare outcomes before (September 2014-August 2015) and after the intervention (September 2015-August 2016) among ambulatory BHH patients and a control group.

The realization in the US of the problem of mental health care, as a consequence of the results of medical evaluation for military service during the war, let the US Government to act creating among other things the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). Coincident with that, new drug treatments for these disorders were introduced. War science also created an important number of tools and instruments, such as the radioisotopes, that played a significant role in the development of our story. The scientific context was marked by the development of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and the introduction in the early 80's of the DNA recombinant technologies. The concepts of chemical neurotransmission in the brain and of receptors for drugs and transmitters, although proposed before the war, where not generally accepted. Neurotransmitters were identified and the mechanisms of biosynthesis, storage, release and termination of action by mechanisms such as reuptake, elucidated. Furthermore, the synapse was seen with the electron microscope and more important for our account, neurons and their processes visualized in the brain first by fluorescence histochemistry, then using radioisotopes and autoradiography, and later by immunohistochemistry (IHC), originating the Chemical Neuroanatomy. The concept of chemical neurotransmission evolved from the amines, expanded to excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, then to neuropeptides and finally to gases and other \"atypical\" neurotransmitters. In addition, coexpression of more than one transmitter in a neuron, changed the initial ideas of neurotransmission. The concept of receptors for these and other messengers underwent a significant evolution from an abstract chemical concept to their physical reality as gene products. Important steps were the introduction in the 70's of radioligand binding techniques and the cloning of receptor genes in the 80's. Receptors were first visualized using radioligands and autoradiography, and analyzed with the newly developed computer-assisted image analysis systems. Using Positron Emission Tomography transmitters and receptors were visualized in living human brain. The cloning of receptor genes allowed the use of in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry to visualize with the light and electron microscopes the receptor mRNAs and proteins. The results showed the wide heterogeneity of receptors and the diversity of mode of signal transmission, synaptic and extra-synaptic, again radically modifying the early views of neurotransmission. During the entire period the interplay between basic science and Psychopharmacology and Psychiatry generated different transmitter or receptor-based theories of brain drug action. These concepts and technologies also changed the way new drugs were discovered and developed.

In total, we reviewed 130 reports (controlled study, N=4; clinical chart, N=23; case report, N=54; and editorial/review, N=42).\nSeveral aspects seem to be age specific: (1) although the clinical presentation resembles that in adults, some symptoms are important in children and adolescents (e.g., psychomotor regression). (2) Associated disorders are similar to that found in adults; however, schizophrenia is more frequently observed than mood disorder. Additionally, a history of neurodevelopmental disorders maybe encountered. (3) Morbidity and mortality are among the worst in child psychiatry. (4) Underlying organic conditions are highly prevalent (>20% of the cases), and their search is warranted because some diagnoses may result in specific treatments (e.g., immune-suppressor therapy for autoimmune conditions). (5) Symptomatic approaches - high dose of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - are as efficient in children or adolescents as they are in adults, but this finding needs to be acknowledged because a resistance against the use of ECT or high-dose medication exists among child psychiatrists.\nRecent advances in child and adolescent catatonia research have offered major improvements in understanding catatonia and in new therapeutic opportunities.

Up to that time, the traditional asylums were still governed by the 1904 law that positioned psychiatry within the criminal justice system by assigning it the function of custodia (control, custody) rather than of cura (care). In the 1960s and 1970s, Italian psychiatrist Franco Basaglia initiated a movement of de-institutionalization of the mentally ill that revolutionized psychiatric care in Italy. It also had a deep impact on restructuring the psychiatric system in other European and Latin American countries. In this article, I discuss the different psychiatric practices and imaginaries that resulted from the movement of democratic psychiatry and Basaglia's visions for a community-based and diagnosis-free care of the mentally ill. I ethnographically trace what I call the \"Basaglia effect\" in today's psychiatric practices, and focus on ethnopsychiatry as a counter clinic that emerged from Basaglia's legacy. I reflect on the frictions between care and cure that ethnopsychiatry re-articulates and works with in the context of contemporary migrations to Europe."}, {"Title": "Differences between Japan and Taiwan in the treatment of pregnant women with depressive symptoms by omega-3 fatty acids: An open-label pilot study.", "Abstract": "Although safe approaches for improving depression in pregnancy are required and the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been suggested, the amount of supplemental omega-3 PUFAs has varied among previous studies and adequate amount might be different among countries.

To use the technology, nurses are required to login to an electronic health record, scan a medication and a form of patient identification to ensure that these correspond correctly with the ordered medications prior to medication administration. In acute care settings, patient wristbands have been traditionally used as a form of identification; however, past research has suggested that this method of identification may not be preferred in inpatient mental health settings. If barcode medication administration technology is to be effectively used in this context, healthcare organizations need to understand patient preferences with regards to identification methods.\nThe purpose of this study was to elicit patient perceptions of barcode medication administration identification practices in inpatient mental health settings. Insights gathered can be used to determine patient-centered preferences of identifying patients using barcode medication administration technology.\nUsing a qualitative descriptive approach, fifty-two (n=52) inpatient interviews were completed by a Peer Support Worker using a semi-structured interview guide over a period of two months. Interviews were conducted in a number of inpatient mental health areas including forensic, youth, geriatric, acute, and rehabilitation services. An interprofessional team, inclusive of a Peer Support Worker, completed a thematic analysis of the interview data.\nSix themes emerged as a result of the inductive data analysis.

Pharmacologic, behavioral and other types of challenges are currently applied to induce changes in neurochemical levels that can be inferred through their effects on changes in receptor binding and related outcome measures. Based on the availability of tracers that are sensitive for measuring neurotransmitter release these experiments have focused on the brain's dopamine system, while recent developments have extended those studies to other targets such as the serotonin or choline system. With the introduction of hybrid, truly simultaneous PET/MRI systems, in-vivo imaging of the dynamics of neuroreceptor signal transmission in the brain using PET and functional MRI (fMRI) has become possible. fMRI has the ability to provide information about the effects of receptor function that are complementary to the PET measurement. Dynamic acquisition of both PET and fMRI signals enables not only an in-vivo real-time assessment of neurotransmitter or drug binding to receptors but also dynamic receptor adaptations and receptor-specific neurotransmission. While fMRI temporal resolution is comparatively fast in relation to PET, the timescale of observable biological processes is highly dependent on the kinetics of radiotracers and study design. Overall, the combination of the specificity of PET radiotracers to neuroreceptors, fMRI signal as a functional readout and integrated study design promises to expand our understanding of the location, propagation and connections of brain activity in health and disease."}, {"Title": "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder in an 11-Year Old South American Boy: Medical and Cultural Challenges.", "Abstract": "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is new in the DSM-5, replacing the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood.

We examined patient demographics, discharge diagnoses, physician's written indications for prescriptions, and maximum doses used. If used for insomnia only, we noted any documentation of past sedative trials, concurrent prescriptions of other sedative agents, whether quetiapine was started in hospital or continued as a part of a community regimen, and whether quetiapine was continued on discharge.\nOf 720 admissions, 83 (11.5%) involved the prescription of night-time only quetiapine, and 47 of the 83 (57%) were for insomnia only. Of patients prescribed quetiapine for insomnia only, most common discharge diagnoses were anxiety disorder (35%), depressive disorder (27%), eating disorder (27%), and Cluster B/borderline personality traits/disorder (25%).

The subjectivity of symptom reporting and interpretation contributes to the delay of accurate diagnoses and limits effective treatment of these illnesses. Proteomics, the study of the types and quantities of proteins an organism produces, may offer an objective biological approach to psychiatric diagnosis. For this pilot study, we used the Myriad RBM Discovery Map 250+ platform to quantify 205 serum proteins in subjects with schizophrenia (n=26), schizoaffective disorder (n=20), bipolar disorder (n=16), and healthy controls with no psychiatric illness (n=23). Fifty-seven analytes that differed significantly between groups were used for multivariate modeling with linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Diagnoses generated from these models were compared to SCID-generated clinical diagnoses to determine whether the proteomic markers: 1) distinguished the three disorders from controls, and 2) distinguished between the three disorders. We found that a series of binary classification models including 8-12 analytes produced separation between all subjects and controls, and between each diagnostic group and controls. There was a high degree of accuracy in the separations, with training areas-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.94-1.0, and cross-validation AUC of 0.94-0.95. Models with 7-14 analytes produced separation between the diagnostic groups, though less robustly, with training AUC of 0.72-1.0 and validation AUC of 0.69-0.89.

In recent decades, the decrease in numbers of psychiatric hospital beds has in several countries been found to be linked with increasing criminality among severely mentally ill individuals. It has been concluded that deinstitutionalization could be the main reason for this development.\nTo investigate whether the prevalence of severely mentally ill persons to prison is a growing trend also in Finland.\nWe searched for the annual data in electronic case files of all prisoners about the ICD-10 diagnostic group of the most severe psychotic disorders. We also searched for the comorbid substance use disorders. Psychotic disorders due to substance abuse only were excluded from this study.\nDuring the years 2005-2016, a rapid 10-fold increase in psychotic disorders has occurred in Finnish prisons. In 2016, 185 prisoners (5.9% of all Finnish prisoners) were diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder that was not induced by substance abuse. The causes of this dramatic change are unclear. Comorbid substance abuse disorders were detected in only 39.5% of these prisoners and therefore substance abuse can only partly explain the increasing criminality of the severely mentally ill persons. 80.5% of psychotic disorders were diagnosed in Psychiatric Hospital for prisoners and 19.5% in prison policlinic services.\nTrans-institutionalization has become a serious challenge for the Finnish criminal justice and mental health systems. Further studies are needed to detect the causes of this change.

Studies show that spirituality and mental health influence one another, and that patients often prefer that physicians understand their spirituality. Though models of inpatient chaplaincy-psychiatry collaboration likely exist, none are apparent in the literature. In this study, we present one model of chaplaincy-psychiatry collaboration, hypothesizing that both specialties would find the intervention helpful.\nFrom April through December 2015, the C-L psychiatry service at Brigham & Women's Hospital piloted 13 sessions of interdisciplinary rounds, where chaplains and C-L psychiatrists discussed common oncology patients. Participants completed questionnaires including quantitative and qualitative prompts before the intervention, after each session, and at the study's conclusion.\nEighteen individuals completed baseline questionnaires. Between baseline and final surveys, the proportion of participants describing themselves as \"very satisfied\" with the 2 services' integration rose from 0-36%. The proportion of participants feeling \"not comfortable\" addressing issues in the other discipline declined from 17-0%. The most frequently chosen options on how discussions had been helpful were that they had enhanced understanding of both patient needs (83.3%) and the other discipline (78.6%). Qualitative data yielded similar themes. At conclusion, all respondents expressed preference that interdisciplinary rounds continue.\nThis study describes a model of enhancing collaboration between chaplains and C-L psychiatrists, an intervention not previously studied to our knowledge.

A substantial body of empirical work and recent computational models have characterized the specific roles of phasic and tonic dopamine (DA) in action learning and selection, respectively. Using insights from this work and models, we suggest that TS involves increases in both phasic and tonic DA, which produce increased propensities for tic learning and expression, respectively. We review the evidence from reinforcement-learning and habit-learning studies in TS, which supports the idea that TS involves increased phasic DA responses; we also review the evidence that tics engage the habit-learning circuitry. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that tics are exaggerated, maladaptive, and persistent motor habits reinforced by aberrant, increased phasic DA responses. Increased tonic DA amplifies the tendency to execute learned tics and also provides a fertile ground of motor hyperactivity for tic learning. We review evidence suggesting that antipsychotics may counter both the increased propensity for tic expression, by increasing excitability in the indirect pathway, and the increased propensity for tic learning, by shifting plasticity in the indirect pathway toward long-term potentiation (and possibly also through more complex mechanisms). Finally, we review evidence suggesting that low doses of DA agonists that effectively treat TS decrease both phasic and tonic DA, thereby also reducing the propensity for both tic learning and tic expression, respectively."}, {"Title": "A web-based clinical decision tool to support treatment decision-making in psychiatry: a pilot focus group study with clinicians, patients and carers.", "Abstract": "Treatment decision tools have been developed in many fields of medicine, including psychiatry, however benefits for patients have not been sustained once the support is withdrawn. We have developed a web-based computerised clinical decision support tool (CDST), which can provide patients and clinicians with continuous, up-to-date, personalised information about the efficacy and tolerability of competing interventions. To test the feasibility and acceptability of the CDST we conducted a focus group study, aimed to explore the views of clinicians, patients and carers.\nThe CDST was developed in Oxford. To tailor treatments at an individual level, the CDST combines the best available evidence from the scientific literature with patient preferences and values, and with patient medical profile to generate personalised clinical recommendations. We conducted three focus groups comprising of three different participant types: consultant psychiatrists, participants with a mental health diagnosis and/or experience of caring for someone with a mental health diagnosis, and primary care practitioners and nurses. Each 1-h focus group started with a short visual demonstration of the CDST. To standardise the discussion during the focus groups, we used the same topic guide that covered themes relating to the acceptability and usability of the CDST. Focus groups were recorded and any identifying participant details were anonymised. Data were analysed thematically and managed using the Framework method and the constant comparative method.\nThe focus groups took place in Oxford between October 2016 and January 2017. Overall 31 participants attended (12 consultants, 11 primary care practitioners and 8 patients or carers). The main themes that emerged related to CDST applications in clinical practice, communication, conflicting priorities, record keeping and data management. CDST was considered a useful clinical decision support, with recognised value in promoting clinician-patient collaboration and contributing to the development of personalised medicine. One major benefit of the CDST was perceived to be the open discussion about the possible side-effects of medications. Participants from all the three groups, however, universally commented that the terminology and language presented on the CDST were too medicalised, potentially leading to ethical issues around consent to treatment.\nThe CDST can improve communication pathways between patients, carers and clinicians, identifying care priorities and providing an up-to-date platform for implementing evidence-based practice, with regard to prescribing practices."}, {"Title": "The ideas about advanced life support and affecting factors at the end-stage of life in a hospital in Turkey.", "Abstract": "The participation of the people in health decisions may be structured in various levels.

Social behavior refers to the behavioral response with regard to socially relevant information, and requires the perception and integration of social cues through a complex cognition process (i.e. social cognition) that involves attention, memory, motivation and emotion. Neurobiological and molecular mechanisms underlying social behavior are highly conserved across species, and inter- and intra-specific variability observed in social behavior can be explained to large extent by differential activity of this conserved neural network. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have greatly informed about the brain structures and their connectivity networks that are important for social cognition. Animal research has been crucial for identifying specific circuits and molecular mechanisms that modulate this structural network. From a molecular neurobiology perspective, activity in these brain structures is coordinated by neuronal circuits modulated by several neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Thus, quantitative variation in the levels, release and/or receptor density of these molecules could affect the observed behavioral response. The present review presents an overall framework of the components of the social brain circuitry and its modulation. By integrating multiple research approaches, from human fMRI studies to animal models we can start shedding light into how dysfunction in these circuits could lead to disorders of social-functioning such as Autism."}, {"Title": "Remote mood monitoring for adults with bipolar disorder: An explorative study of compliance and impact on mental health service use and costs.", "Abstract": "Remote monitoring of mood disorders may be an effective and low resource option for patient follow-up, but relevant evidence remains very limited.

The odds of individual attendance at outpatient primary care and mental health visits improved after enrolment. In the context of the implementation of integrated behavioural and physical healthcare in primary care, this interprofessional care management programme reduced emergency department utilisation and hospitalisations while improving utilisation of primary care and psychiatry outpatient care.

Psychiatrists' reluctance toward a psychosis risk standardized assessment was shaped by three difficulties: first the gap between theoretical knowledge and practice; second their impossibility to make reliable prognoses; and third, the many uncertainties surrounding medical judgment, adolescence and the nature of psychosis. Nevertheless, they provided their young patients with multiple months follow up without disclosing any risk category.\nAnticipating a psychosis onset remains a highly uncertain task for psychiatrists.

Evidence indicates that SGAs show an improved safety and tolerability profile compared with FGAs. The incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal side effects is lower, and there is less impairment of cognitive function and treatment-related negative symptoms.

Five RHPs proposed to increase GME funding for primary care, 3 for psychiatry, and 1 for subspecialty care.\nHospital CHNAs and other regional health assessments could be potentially strategic mechanisms to assess community needs as well as GME accountability in light of community needs and to guide GME expansion more strategically. Internal Revenue Service guidance regarding CHNAs could include workforce needs assessment and intervention requirements.

Sensory-based interventions promote adaptive regulation of arousal and emotion. SM is a complementary approach that is associated with reduced rates of seclusion and restraint in mental healthcare, but there is need for more research in this area.\nUsing SM to reduce restraint and seclusion in inpatient mental health care.\nThe study included two similar psychiatric units where one unit implemented SM and one unit served as the control group. In the very beginning of the study, a staff-training program in the use of SM including assessment tools and intervention strategies was established. Data on restraint and forced medicine were sampled post the course of the year of implementation and compared with the control group.\nThe use of belts decreased with 38% compared to the control group. The use of forced medication decreased with 46% compared to the control group. Altogether the use of physical restraint and forced medication decreased significantly with 42% (p\u2009<\u2009.05).\nImplementing a SM approach in mental healthcare facilities has a significant effect on the reduction of restraint and seclusion.

Yet, the ubiquity of this behaviour in borderline personality disorder (BPD) limits its utility as a predictor of risk. Consequently, this study aimed to elucidate the relationship between other features of NSSI, including frequency and severity, and suicide attempts.\nParticipants included 107 youth (15 to 25 year olds) with BPD who were assessed for BPD severity, depressive symptoms, 12-month frequency of NSSI and suicide attempts, as well as the levels of treatment sought following each self-harm event.\nThree-quarters (75.7%) of youth with BPD reported NSSI and two-thirds (66.4%) reported a suicide attempt over the previous 12 months. The frequency of NSSI over the previous 12 months did not show a linear or quadratic relationship with the number of suicide attempts when adjusting for severity of depression, impulsivity and interpersonal problems. NSSI severity was not associated with more frequent suicide attempts. Only impulsivity and depression were uniquely predictive of suicide attempt frequency. A relative increase in the frequency and severity of NSSI occurred in the months prior to a suicide attempt.\nThe prevalence of NSSI and suicide attempts among youth presenting for their first treatment of BPD appear to be perilously high, considerably higher than rates reported by adults with BPD. Findings suggest that clinicians should give more weight to average levels of impulsivity and depression, rather than the absolute frequency and severity of NSSI, when assessing for risk of suicide attempts. Notwithstanding this, a relative increase in the frequency and severity of NSSI appears to be predictive of a forthcoming suicide attempt."}, {"Title": "Multiple possible inaccuracies cast doubt on a recent report suggesting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to be toxic and ineffective.", "Abstract": "According to a systematic review on the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adult depression that was recently published in BMC Psychiatry, the results of which have been widely disseminated in lay media, these drugs increase the risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) while exerting poor antidepressant efficacy. A cursory analysis, however, suggests the analysis of SAEs conducted by the authors to be marred by both methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. After having corrected for these apparent mistakes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we also accounted for a possible moderating effect of age; while this suggests SSRIs to be safe drugs in the non-elderly, they do confirm what is already known, that is, that they may enhance the risk for SAEs in the old. Given the loose definition of SAE, including also innocuous phenomena, the possible clinical significance of the latter observation, however, remains unclear until the nature and actual impact of the SAEs in question have been clarified. Moreover, with respect to efficacy, we find the paper in BMC Psychiatry misleading: first, the authors seem unaware of the well-established shortcomings associated with the conventional efficacy parameter on which their analysis is based, second, they have included suboptimal SSRI doses and third, they have missed some pivotal trials. Unless there are explanations for the many peculiarities in this paper that have escaped us, and which may be satisfactorily clarified by the authors, it seems important that the conclusions presented in this paper be publicly rectified."}, {"Title": "Looking at hospitalized persons throughout the prism of the handicap.", "Abstract": "To describe the disability status of non-selected hospitalized persons.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess activity limitations of every person older than 18 years hospitalized in a regional university hospital covering all medical fields.

It impacts not only patients, but their relatives and their children, as well as the health professionals taking care of them. Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life.

In the context of central nervous system (CNS) development, such sensitive periods shape the formation of neuro-circuits that mediate, regulate, and control behavior. This general mechanism allows for development to be guided by both the genetic blueprint, as well as the environmental context. While allowing for adaptation, such sensitive periods are also windows of vulnerability during which external and internal factors can confer risk to brain disorders by derailing adaptive developmental programs. Our group has been particularly interested in developmental periods that are sensitive to serotonin (5-HT) signaling, and impact behavior and cognition relevant to psychiatry. Specifically, we review a 5-HT-sensitive period that impacts fronto-limbic system development, resulting in cognitive, anxiety, and depression-related behaviors. We discuss preclinical data to establish biological plausibility and mechanistic insights. We also summarize epidemiological findings that underscore the potential public health implications resulting from the current practice of prescribing 5-HT reuptake inhibiting antidepressants during pregnancy. These medications enter the fetal circulation, likely perturb 5-HT signaling in the brain, and may be affecting circuit maturation in ways that parallel our findings in the developing rodent brain. More research is needed to better disambiguate the dual effects of maternal symptoms on fetal and child development from the effects of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors on clinical outcomes in the offspring.

Sex or gender are included as a covariate or effect modifier in the majority of child psychology and psychiatry studies, and differences found between boys and girls have inspired many researchers to postulate underlying mechanisms. Empirical tests of whether including these proposed explanatory variables actually reduces the variance explained by gender are lagging behind somewhat. That is a pity, because a lot can be gained from a greater focus on the active agents of specific gender differences. As opposed to biological sex as such, some of the processes explaining why a specific outcome shows gender differences may be changeable and so possible prevention targets. Moreover, while the sex binary may be reasonable adequate as a classification variable, the gender binary is far from perfect. Gender is a multidimensional, partly context-dependent factor, and the dichotomy generally used in research does not do justice to the diversity existing within boys and girls."}, {"Title": "Development of an instrument to measure patients' attitudes towards involuntary hospitalization.", "Abstract": "To construct and assess the psychometric properties of an instrument to measure patients' attitudes towards involuntary hospitalization.\nThis is a two phase study.

However, there are some limitations to using RCTs as the basis for developing treatment guidelines. While RCTs allow researchers to determine whether a given medication or intervention is effective in a specific patient sample, for practicing clinicians it is more important to know whether it will work for their particular patient in their particular setting. This information cannot be garnered from an RCT. These inherent limitations are exacerbated by biases in design, recruitment, sample populations and data analysis that are inevitable in real-world studies. While trial registration and CONSORT have been implemented to correct and improve these issues, it is worrying that many trials fail to achieve such standards and yet their findings are used to inform clinical decision making. This perspective piece questions the assumptions of RCTs and highlights the widespread distortion of findings that currently undermine the credibility of this powerful design.

Although generally well tolerated, trazodone treatment can be associated with some complications. We describe a case of a 60-year-old man who received trazodone for primary insomnia. He returned, to the emergency department, two days later with distressing visual hallucinations, which prompted inpatient treatment. Trazodone was discontinued, leading to a complete resolution of his visual hallucinations, and he was treated with mirtazapine for 6 months. There has been no relapse in a follow-up period of two years. Patients presenting with visual hallucinations without significant psychiatry history can be a challenging situation. We highlight the importance of careful anamnesis with an accurate medication history. Given the widespread use of trazodone, clinicians should be aware of this possible side effect."}, {"Title": "Hoarding Disorder: A Case Report.", "Abstract": "Hoarding disorder is characterized by a persistent difficulty discarding items, the desire to save items to avoid negative feelings associated with discarding them, significant accumulation of possessions that clutter active living areas and significant distress or impairment in areas of functioning. We present a case of a 52-year-old married man who was referred to the psychiatry department for collecting various objects that were deposited unorganized in the patient's house. He reported to get anxious when someone else discarded some of these items. This behavior had started about 20\u2009years earlier and it worsened with time. The garage, attic, and surroundings of his house were cluttered with these objects. On admission, in the mental status examination, it was observed that the patient was vigil, calm, and oriented; his mood was depressed; his speech was organized, logic, and coherent; and there were no psychotic symptoms. A psychotherapeutic plan was designed for the patient, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and exposure to discarding objects. A pharmacological treatment with fluvoxamine 100\u2009mg tid and quetiapine 200\u2009mg was added to the therapeutic plan, with the progressive improvement of the symptoms. Nine months later, the patient was able to sell/recycle most of the items. Studies evaluating treatment for HD are necessary to improve the quality of life of the patients and to reduce the hazards associated with the disorder."}, {"Title": "'They accused me of strangling her': epilepsy and violence debate in Croatia at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.", "Abstract": "Nineteenth-century psychiatry shifted its focus to the brain as the seat of mental disorders. With a new understanding of mental disorders arose the need to consult forensic psychiatrists in cases of criminal acts committed by persons with mental illness. This article focuses on three murders committed by 'epileptics' at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries in Croatia. An analysis of these cases will help to situate forensic psychiatry at the turn of the century within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and reveal the authority that forensic experts wielded in the courts.

Answers to these questions will not only assist academics and researchers, but will also help higher education institutions (HEIs) make informed decisions in their administrative and research policies.\nTo examine both the questions, we applied the United Kingdom's recently concluded national research assessment exercise known as the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014 as a case study. All the data for this study is sourced from the openly available publications which arose from the digital repositories of REF's results and HEFCE's funding allocations.\nA world leading output earns between \u00a37504 and \u00a314,639 per year within the REF cycle, whereas an internationally excellent output earns between \u00a31876 and \u00a33659, varying according to their area of research. Secondly, an investigation into the impact rating of 25315 journal articles submitted in five areas of research by UK HEIs and their awarded funding revealed a linear relationship between the percentage of quartile-one journal publications and percentage of 4* outputs in Clinical Medicine, Physics and Psychology/Psychiatry/Neuroscience UoAs, and no relationship was found in the Classics and Anthropology/Development Studies UoAs, due to the fact that most publications in the latter two disciplines are not journal articles.\nThe findings provide an indication of the monetary value of a research output, from the perspectives of government funding for research, and also what makes a good output, i.e. whether a relationship exists between good quality output and the source of its publication. The findings may also influence future REF submission strategies in HEIs and ascertain that the impact rating of the journals is not necessarily a reflection of the quality of research in every discipline, and this may have a significant influence on the future of scholarly communications in general.\nAccording to the author's knowledge, this is the first time an investigation has estimated the monetary value of a good research output."}, {"Title": "Posttraumatic stress disorder: a serious post-earthquake complication.", "Abstract": "Earthquakes are unpredictable and devastating natural disasters.

The review also describes other psychiatric complications that can be associated with earthquakes, to provide readers with better overall understanding, and discusses several sociodemographic factors that can be associated with post-earthquake PTSD.\nA search for literature was conducted on major databases such as MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO and in neurology and psychiatry journals, and many other medical journals. Terms used for electronic searches included, but were not limited to, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), posttraumatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, major depressive disorder, earthquake, and natural disaster. The relevant information was then utilized to determine the relationships between earthquakes and posttraumatic stress symptoms.\nIt was found that PTSD is the most commonly occurring mental health condition among earthquake survivors. Major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, and specific phobias were also listed.\nThe PTSD prevalence rate varied widely. It was dependent on multiple risk factors in target populations and also on the interval of time that had elapsed between the exposure to the deadly incident and measurement.

The objective of this study was to find factors measurable on admission that would predict LOS in the acute psychiatric setting.\nThis was a prospective, observational study.\nOverall, 385 subjects were included. The median LOS was 25 days. In the final model, six variables explained 14.6% of the variation in LOS: not having own income, psychiatric admissions in the preceding 2 years, high Clinical Global Impression and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores, diagnosis of schizophrenia, and history of attempted suicide. All variables were associated with longer LOS, apart from history of attempted suicide.\nIdentifying patients who will need to stay longer in psychiatric beds remains a challenge.

These problems affect academic psychiatrists in the universities, and clinicians in publicly funded mental health services. Academic units are isolated and endangered, finding it difficult to recruit. They could benefit from closer relationships with public mental health services, in terms of recruitment, shared teaching and clinical research. However, mental health services are preoccupied with their own problems, particularly in relation to acute clinical demand. How can we stand together to improve academic units and clinical psychiatry?\nClinicians and academic psychiatrists can stand together on important matters, but it takes initiatives from local leaders to overcome the structural barriers between health services and the universities. An example is given of united action by clinicians and academic psychiatrists to address a crisis within a state mental health system. First, psychiatrists undertook independent health services research that compared the state system with those in other Australian and international jurisdictions. The comparative data was used to generate solutions, which were presented at every level from ministerial offices through to service managers. Finally, psychiatrists took up joint academic and clinical leadership roles in the university and the mental health system.

We evaluated methods to automatically identify clinically relevant new information in clinical notes, and compared the quantity of redundant information across specialties and clinical settings.\nStatistical language models augmented with semantic similarity measures were evaluated as a means to detect and quantify clinically relevant new and redundant information over longitudinal clinical notes for a given patient. A corpus of 591 progress notes over 40 inpatient admissions was annotated for new information longitudinally by physicians to generate a reference standard. Note redundancy between various specialties was evaluated on 71,021 outpatient notes and 64,695 inpatient notes from 500 solid organ transplant patients (April 2015 through August 2015).\nOur best method achieved at best performance of 0.87 recall, 0.62 precision, and 0.72\u00a0F-measure. Addition of semantic similarity metrics compared to baseline improved recall but otherwise resulted in similar performance. While outpatient and inpatient notes had relatively similar levels of high redundancy (61% and 68%, respectively), redundancy differed by author specialty with mean redundancy of 75%, 66%, 57%, and 55% observed in pediatric, internal medicine, psychiatry and surgical notes, respectively.\nAutomated techniques with statistical language models for detecting redundant versus clinically relevant new information in clinical notes do not improve with the addition of semantic similarity measures.

On a\u00a0psychopatholocial level a\u00a0close link to the complex basic symptom of autism was stressed. From the very beginnings of modern psychiatry schizoidia was discussed within a\u00a0conceptual frame of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (Kretschmer, Hoch, Polatin). Approaches to operationalize these conceptual works laid the basis for the cluster\u00a0A personalities in DSM-III. Due to the prominent concept of schizotypy (Kety, Rado, Meehl) three split up diagnostic categories of schizotypal, schizoid and paranoid personality disorders resulted. Cluster\u00a0A personality disorders are frequent in community-based epidemiological studies. Health-care seeking behaviour due to primary personality-related problems, however, seems to be less paramount compared to cluster\u00a0B and\u00a0C personality disorders. Many family- and twin-based genetic studies convincingly stress a\u00a0close link between schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia. This link is less pronounced for paranoid personality disorder, and even vanishingly low for schizoid personality disorder. From a\u00a0perspective of schizophrenia spectrum disorders a\u00a0vast amount of data from molecular genetic, neurobiological, neuropsychological and psychosocial research has impressingly confirmed this link for schizotypal personality disorder.

However, the link between schizophrenia and various galectins is unclear.\nThe objective of the present study is to determine whether galectin, a well-known lectin protein that binds to \u03bc-galactoside, is associated with chronic schizophrenia.\nThirty-six patients with schizophrenia and 36 healthy controls participated in this study. Schizophrenia symptoms were assessed using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS). Serum galectin-1 and galectin-3 levels were evaluated using ELISA and compared between the participant groups.

However, genetic variants of complex diseases often only confer a marginal increase in disease risk, which is additionally influenced by the environment. Here we show that embryonic deletion of Cacna1c in forebrain glutamatergic neurons promotes the manifestation of endophenotypes related to psychiatric disorders including cognitive decline, impaired synaptic plasticity, reduced sociability, hyperactivity and increased anxiety. Additional analyses revealed that depletion of Cacna1c during embryonic development also increases the susceptibility to chronic stress, which suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 interacts with the environment to shape disease vulnerability. Remarkably, this was not observed when Cacna1c was deleted in glutamatergic neurons during adulthood, where the later deletion even improved cognitive flexibility, strengthened synaptic plasticity and induced stress resilience. In a parallel gene \u00d7 environment design in humans, we additionally demonstrate that SNPs in CACNA1C significantly interact with adverse life events to alter the risk to develop symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Overall, our results further validate Cacna1c as a cross-disorder risk gene in mice and humans, and additionally suggest a differential role for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 during development and adulthood in shaping cognition, sociability, emotional behavior and stress susceptibility. This may prompt the consideration for pharmacological manipulation of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 in neuropsychiatric disorders with developmental and/or stress-related origins."}, {"Title": "Neuropathology of suicide: recent findings and future directions.", "Abstract": "Suicide is a major public health concern and a leading cause of death in most societies. Suicidal behaviour is complex and heterogeneous, likely resulting from several causes. It associates with multiple factors, including psychopathology, personality traits, early-life adversity and stressful life events, among others. Over the past decades, studies in fields ranging from neuroanatomy, genetics and molecular psychiatry have led to a model whereby behavioural dysregulation, including suicidal behaviour (SB), develops as a function of biological adaptations in key brain systems. More recently, the unravelling of the unique epigenetic processes that occur in the brain has opened promising avenues in suicide research. The present review explores the various facets of the current knowledge on suicidality and discusses how the rapidly evolving field of neurobehavioural epigenetics may fuel our ability to understand, and potentially prevent, SB."}, {"Title": "Symptom modelling can be influenced by psychiatric categories: choices for research domain criteria (RDoC).", "Abstract": "Psychiatric researchers typically assume that the modelling of psychiatric symptoms is not influenced by psychiatric categories; symptoms are modelled and then grouped into a psychiatric category. I highlight this primarily through analysing research domain criteria (RDoC). RDoC's importance makes it worth scrutinizing, and this assessment also serves as a case study with relevance for other areas of psychiatry. RDoC takes inadequacies of existing psychiatric categories as holding back causal investigation. Consequently, RDoC aims to circumnavigate existing psychiatric categories by directly investigating the causal basis of symptoms. The unique methodological approach of RDoC exploits the supposed lack of influence of psychiatric categories on symptom modelling, taking psychiatric symptoms as the same regardless of which psychiatric category is employed or if no psychiatric category is employed. But this supposition is not always true. I will show how psychiatric categories can influence symptom modelling, whereby identical behaviours can be considered as different symptoms based on an individual's psychiatric diagnosis. If the modelling of symptoms is influenced by psychiatric categories, then psychiatric categories will still play a role, a situation which RDoC researchers explicitly aim to avoid. I discuss four ways RDoC could address this issue. This issue also has important implications for factor analysis, cluster analysis, modifying psychiatric categories, and symptom based approaches."}, {"Title": "Islam, mental health and law: a general overview.", "Abstract": "Islam is the dominant religion in about 56 countries around the globe, and has more than 1.2 billion followers.

At the dawn of its historical course and at its moral and ethical core, Islam introduced many interesting and innovative beliefs concerning the mentally ill. Islam underlines the moral necessity for the protection and care of the vulnerable individuals, as dictated by God himself.

Among the approaches toward investigating resilience are so-called a priori approaches, where criteria for inferring resilience are established a priori. In this editorial, we highlight some of the advantages of taking a priori approaches to the study of resilience and we touch on the implications for a priori approaches for the topic of resilience and depression. We argue that depression should take a prominent role in resilience research, because depression is strongly associated with opportunities for successful ageing."}, {"Title": "The slow death of the concept of schizophrenia and the painful birth of the psychosis spectrum.", "Abstract": "The concept of schizophrenia only covers the 30% poor outcome fraction of a much broader multidimensional psychotic syndrome, yet paradoxically has become the dominant prism through which everything 'psychotic' is observed, even affective states with mild psychosis labelled 'ultra-high risk' (for schizophrenia). The inability of psychiatry to frame psychosis as multidimensional syndromal variation of largely unpredictable course and outcome - within and between individuals - hampers research and recovery-oriented practice. 'Psychosis' remains firmly associated with 'schizophrenia', as evidenced by a vigorous stream of high-impact but non-replicable attempts to 'reverse-engineer' the hypothesized biological disease entity, using case-control paradigms that cannot distinguish between risk for illness onset and risk for poor outcome. In this paper, the main issues surrounding the concept of schizophrenia are described. We tentatively conclude that with the advent of broad spectrum phenotypes covering autism and addiction in DSM5, the prospect for introducing a psychosis spectrum disorder - and modernizing psychiatry - appears to be within reach."}, {"Title": "Machine learning methods to predict child posttraumatic stress: a proof of concept study.", "Abstract": "The care of traumatized children would benefit significantly from accurate predictive models for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), using information available around the time of trauma. Machine Learning (ML) computational methods have yielded strong results in recent applications across many diseases and data types, yet they have not been previously applied to childhood PTSD. Since these methods have not been applied to this complex and debilitating disorder, there is a great deal that remains to be learned about their application. The first step is to prove the concept: Can ML methods - as applied in other fields - produce predictive classification models for childhood PTSD? Additionally, we seek to determine if specific variables can be identified - from the aforementioned predictive classification models - with putative causal relations to PTSD.\nML predictive classification methods - with causal discovery feature selection - were applied to a data set of 163 children hospitalized with an injury and PTSD was determined three months after hospital discharge. At the time of hospitalization, 105 risk factor variables were collected spanning a range of biopsychosocial domains.\nSeven percent of subjects had a high level of PTSD symptoms. A predictive classification model was discovered with significant predictive accuracy. A predictive model constructed based on subsets of potentially causally relevant features achieves similar predictivity compared to the best predictive model constructed with all variables. Causal Discovery feature selection methods identified 58 variables of which 10 were identified as most stable.\nIn this first proof-of-concept application of ML methods to predict childhood Posttraumatic Stress we were able to determine both predictive classification models for childhood PTSD and identify several causal variables. This set of techniques has great potential for enhancing the methodological toolkit in the field and future studies should seek to replicate, refine, and extend the results produced in this study."}, {"Title": "Love as delusion, delusions of love: erotomania, narcissism and shame.", "Abstract": "Erotomania has a long, colourful history in psychiatry. It is a rare condition in which the patient ('subject') develops the belief that he or she is loved from afar by another person ('object'). The subject is generally female, though men predominate in forensic samples. The object is generally perceived to belong to a higher social class, reflecting a sociopolitical element in the construction of love. Erotomania requires active treatment and risk management as it can be associated with stalking and other offending behaviour. In addition to featuring in the psychiatry literature, erotomania features in the biography of the economist John Maynard Keynes (the apparent 'object' of a woman's erotomanic delusions in the early 1900s) and in fiction (eg, Ian McEwan's <i>Enduring Love</i>); this reflects, in part, the general popularity of romantic themes in broader literature and society. In psychological terms, certain cases of erotomania might be underpinned by combinations of longing, disappointment, shame and narcissism in specific social contexts. Lesser forms of delusional exaggeration of true love might also exist in some stable relationships, and might even be essential for their continued existence. Overall, the division between love and delusions of love is not as distinct as one might imagine. The potential presence of an element of delusional love in many relationships might well serve important social functions, conferring specific advantages on the parties involved and increasing social and community stability. After all, delusions persist; love dies."}, {"Title": "White Matter Lesions are Associated with Specific Depressive Symptom Trajectories among Incident Depression and Dementia Populations: Three-City Dijon MRI Study.", "Abstract": "Evidence is mixed as to whether periventricular or deep white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) increase the risk for depressive symptoms, partly because of heterogeneity in depression measurement, short follow-up, and confounding by prodromal dementia. The study objective was to evaluate WMH volume in relation to discrete depressive symptoms over 10 years, stratifying by incident depression and dementia.\nIn this prospective longitudinal cohort study of a representative population sample from Dijon, France, 1,440 participants aged 65-80 years (median age: 72 years; 59.5% women) without depression, dementia, or stroke at baseline were studied. Baseline T2-weighted images were obtained in a 1.5-T scanner to quantify WMHs (log cm<sup>3</sup>). Clinic visits were performed up to five times in a 10-year period to assess incident neurologic diseases and comorbidities. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and converted to factor z scores, representing somatic symptoms, depressed affect, low positive affect, and interpersonal problems.\nPeriventricular WMH volume was uniquely associated with low positive affect among incident depression cases (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02-0.29; p\u2009=\u20090.026). Deep WMH volume was uniquely associated with depressed affect among incident dementia cases (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.36; 95% CI: 0.05-0.68; p\u2009=\u20090.025). WMH volume (periventricular, deep, and total) was associated with interpersonal problems among persons who developed dementia with depression.\nThe findings highlight that regional WMH volumes and specific depressive symptoms have clinical and prognostic relevance to help differentiate between persons at risk for depression and dementia."}, {"Title": "A novel flight surgeon training model at a joint military and civilian surgical residency program.", "Abstract": "Graduating military preliminary interns are often required to fill flight surgeon billets. General surgery preliminary interns get experience evaluating surgical and trauma patients, but receive very little training in primary care and flight medicine. At a joint military and civilian training program, we developed a supplemental curriculum to help transition our interns into flight medicine.\nFrom 2013 to 2016, we developed a lecture series focused on aerospace medicine, primary care, and specialty topics including dermatology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, pediatrics, psychiatry, and women's health. During the 2016 iteration attended by 10 interns, pre- and post-participation 10-item Likert scale surveys were administered. Questions focused on perceived preparedness for primary care role and overall enthusiasm for flight medicine. Open-ended surveys from 2013 to 2016 were also used to gauge the effect of the curriculum.\nThe composite number of agreement responses (indicating increased comfort with presented material) increased 63% after course completion. Disagreement responses and neutral responses decreased 78% and 30%, respectively. Open-ended surveys from 14 participants showed an overall positive impression of the curriculum with all indicating it aided their transition to flight medicine.\nSurvey responses indicate an overall perceived benefit from participation in the curriculum with more confidence in primary care topics and improved transition to a flight medicine tour. This model for supplemental aerospace medicine and primary care didactics should be integrated into any residency program responsible for training military preliminary interns who may serve as flight surgeons."}, {"Title": "Asperger syndrome and schizophrenia: \u039deurodevelopmental continuum or separated clinical entities?", "Abstract": "This article is an overview of the literature on Asperger's syndrome and schizophrenia and aim to discuss their similarities and differences. Eugen Bleuler who associated the terms \"schizophrenia\" and \"autism\" a century ago, viewed autism as a form of solitude of schizophrenic patients representing withdrawal from reality. Ever since, there has been confusion as to the boundaries between these conditions. Nowadays recent research, from a variety of perspectives-genomics, neurodevelopment, psychiatry, etc. has given new information on these conditions. It is easier to demarcate these two disorders at the extremes, but it is extremely difficult dissociating milder forms of both disorders. Asperger's syndrome (AS), is considered to be a continuous and lifelong disorder with strong heritability, present from early childhood. It is included within the category of autism spectrum disorders and it is usually diagnosed in childhood. Patients with Asperger syndrome are often diagnosed late or they are considered as having schizophrenia. Misdiagnosing Asperger syndrome creates severe problems by preventing effective therapy. A lot of clinical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome are also present in schizophrenia, such as impaired social interaction, disabilities in communication and restricted interests. On the other side some clinical features may facilitate the differential diagnosis, such as the younger age at onset, family history of pervasive developmental disorders, pragmatic aspects of language use, lack of imagination, ect. It is known that symptoms of Asperger's syndrome have some overlap with those of schizophrenia, but less is known about comorbidity between these two syndromes. It is still a question whether autism spectrum disorders in young children can increase the risk for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, later in life. Both disorders are of neurodevelopmental origin and genetic factors are prominent. In both neurocognitive deficits as well as deficits in social cognition and social functioning are marked. The boundaries between AS and schizophrenia are still not clear even if this distinction is necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient and his family. For the writing of the literature review, the following electronic databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Psycinfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The key words used were: Asperger's syndrome, schizophrenia, children and adolescents, differential diagnosis, autism spectrum disorders."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric specialty training in Greece: Comparative analysis of educational programs (2000 vs 2014)].", "Abstract": "Modern educational programs for specialization in psychiatry should follow the developments in psychiatric science, both in the part of acquired knowledge about mental disorders and their treatment, as well as in the part of clinical practice in the diverse spectrum of modern psychiatric services. In Greece, the institutional framework for psychiatric training during specialization has yet to modernize and conform to European standards. For the moment, it is covered by a 1994 Presidential Decree, which briefly describes the time of specialization in psychiatry and the duration of clinical practice in the relevant educational subjects. This study presents a comparative analysis of training in the specialty of Psychiatry in two distinct periods (2000 vs 2014). Already by the year 2000, psychiatric training showed many structural weaknesses. The areas of clinical experience, theoretical and psychotherapeutic training have shown wide divergences among training centers, and limited potential for convergence with European standards under the existing framework. Important exceptions were certain university clinics, with the bulk of future psychiatrists in the country falling short of educational benefits. Fifteen years later and under the burden of the consequences of the economic crisis, the institutional framework has not yet changed, and the overall situation seems to have deteriorated dramatically. The number of training centers offering full specialization and the number of psychiatrists who receive training increased in reverse proportion to the number of specialized psychiatrists employed in hospitals, which has been drastically reduced due to restrictive measures on staff recruitment. Almost all training indicators show deterioration, but mainly the area of theoretical training shows the most dramatic degradation. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that nowadays several psychiatric clinics endeavor to develop training programs in conjunction with psychiatric services not under their own administration, a practice not provided for in the current legislative framework. At the same time, there is an increase in the number of training centers that adopt some statutory procedures to monitor and evaluate trainees during the training process. The long-term restrictions recorded however, reveal the difficulty hospitals and psychiatric clinics have in developing training programs responding to the full range of modern clinical and theoretical training in psychiatry independently and autonomously. The recent economic crisis in the country and the attempts for much needed administrational reforms, create now more than ever the appropriate conditions for a reform of the educational framework for specialization in psychiatry, taking into account national resources and future expectations for the mental health system of our country."}, {"Title": "The \"Biopsychosocial Model\": 40 years of application in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper \"TheIn 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper \"Theneed for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine\", introducing the term Biopsychosocial Model. This model basedon the results of Engel's studies in ulcerative colitis, depression and psychogenic pain, constituted a challenge for biomedicineand the biomedical model. The basic principles of the model included the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the person's life and theperception that the person suffers as a whole and not as isolated organs. The doctor should use a holistic approach regardingillness and should consider his/her relation with the patient socially equal. The personality and the emotional reserves of thepatient, as well as the particular environmental conditions in which the person lives in should be taken into account. There is no doubt that the biopsychosocial model has established a more empathetic and compassionate approach in medical practice. Already since 1936, the general adaptation syndrome had been proposed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist HansSeley (1907-1982), who emphasized that psychological stressful factors may have injurious consequences on health, while theresponse systems to stress may be dysregulated not only by genetic factors, but also from experiences and stressful life events,as well as by harmful behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise. Psychosocial factors may co-determine the patient's vulnerability and the illness's severity and course. The biopsychosocialmodel consider the interactions with genetic susceptibility, personality, stressful events and, generally, with the patient's socialcontext. Environmental factors increase the probability of the clinical expression of a mental disorder, play a role in the time ofonset of an illness's manifestation, and they can also protect a vulnerable person from the disease. Stressful experiences modify immunological response and influence treatment compliance. Non adherence to pharmacotherapy,as well as to the psychosocial interventions, may cause defective recovery of psychosocial functioning, recurrence ofthe disorder, as well as insufficient use of health resources and a higher health care cost. The psychoeducation of patients andtheir relatives by the application of the biopsychosocial model plays an important role in psychiatric therapeutics, and it mayalso be used via Internet in the frame of telepsychiatry. Results from neuroimaging studies have shown that the different kinds of human experiences, traumatic or therapeutic, havemeasurable influences on the brain function. Psychotherapy may modify the neuronal connections of the brain in the frame ofits plasticity, as was found by the discovery of synaptogenesis in response to learning and can, thus, be considered not only as astrictly psychological but also as a biopsychosocial form of treatment. Among the disadvantages of the biopsychosocial model have been reported the lack of a concise theoretical frameworkregarding its function and content, that it is complicated, difficulties in its coordination and assignment of responsibilities, aswell as problems with the education on it being multifaceted. The biopsychosocial model has been criticized that it does notconstitute a scientific or philosophical model, it does not provide an answer to the crucial question of how the biological, psychologicaland social variables interact in the disease's expression, that it does not provide guidance on the exact time of itsapplication and, finally, that it allows for a wide range of interventions without providing specific guidelines of a concrete therapeutic scheme. The person-centered diagnosis is based on the biopsychosocial model, connects science with humanism and uses all thepossible ways so that the clinicians, the patients and their families collaborate for a more effective management of the disease.This approach has been established by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA, 2007) as the program \"Psychiatry for the Person\". Psychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismPsychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismof the expression of mental disorders, their close relation to psychosocial factors, the lack of explicit pathognomonicelements and the stigmatization of mental illness. For these reasons, the biopsychosocial model is particularly applicable inpsychiatric disorders, but it should not be over looked also in somatic illnesses. The biopsychosocial model, despite the criticism it was subjected to, continues to offer valuable clinical, educational andresearch services, as well as to provide an important contribution to the formation of health policies, not only for psychiatry, butfor the whole of medicine as well."}, {"Title": "Impact of medical comorbidity in psychiatric inpatient length of stay.", "Abstract": "<i>Background:</i> Medical comorbidity is associated with worse psychiatric outcomes, reduced functioning and higher services use, including inpatient psychiatric care.<i>Aim:</i> We explored the relation between medical comorbidity and length of stay, adjusting for potential confounders.<i>Methods:</i> We retrospectively analyzed an administrative database comprising all inpatient admissions between 2005 and 2014 at the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health at Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho Healthcare Center, Vila Nova de Gaia - Portugal.

However, the reports themselves document frequent, severe complications of the LSD. These side effects were regarded by the Army as having been directly caused by the LSD exposure.

Areas of inquiry included whether milestones assisted in identifying areas of deficiency in fellows or programs, whether the graduation milestones matched the goals of training, and what changes were planned, or had been made, based on their implementation.\nTwenty-six of 35 programs responded, for a response rate of 74%. The majority found the milestones somewhat or very useful, half found the graduation-level milestones matched the program's graduation goals, and a significant majority reported that the milestones assisted in identifying improvements, change, or intended change. In choosing terms to describe the milestones, however respondents chose a variety of negative or neutral terms, rather than positive ones.\nThe milestones provided a standard mechanism for identifying areas for improvement and a common language to standardize practice. However, due to the variability across fellowship programs and the limitations of educational resources and time, implementation of the new ACGME requirement was characterized in largely negative terms. Recommendations for improvement included modification of the milestones themselves, flexibility in their implementation, and evidentiary support for their use."}, {"Title": "Opinions Regarding Benzodiazepine Teaching and Prescribing Among Trainees in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for a variety of symptoms and illnesses. There has been limited investigation on the training psychiatry residents receive regarding benzodiazepine prescribing. This study surveyed US psychiatric trainees about their didactic and clinical experience with benzodiazepines, investigating how experience with benzodiazepines may shape trainees' opinions and likelihood to prescribe.\nThe 14-question online survey was distributed to residents and fellows at US training programs through an invitation from their training directors.\nOf 466 programs contacted, with an estimated 1345 trainees, a total of 97 programs (20.8%) and 424 trainees (31.5%) responded. The analyses focused only on the 342 general psychiatry trainees who responded. Most trainees reported having formal didactics on benzodiazepines, and earlier training was correlated with higher trainee quality of instruction assessments (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Most trainees rated their instructors as Above or Well Above Average. Trainees cited the observation and opinion of supervisors as the two most important factors affecting likelihood of future benzodiazepine prescribing. Trainees commonly reported pressure from patients to prescribe benzodiazepines but were split on perceived pressure from supervisors about prescribing and whether a bias exists against prescribing at their program or in general.\nThe survey indicated that psychiatry trainees generally feel adequately trained through didactic and clinical experience with benzodiazepines. Trainees perceived pressure by patients to prescribe benzodiazepines, but generally felt comfortable in managing benzodiazepine usage. Psychiatry attendings' opinions on benzodiazepines most impacted trainees. Influences on trainees' prescribing patterns are important variables that can impact future benzodiazepine prescribing."}, {"Title": "Validation of a Teaching Effectiveness Assessment in Psychiatry Continuing Medical Education.", "Abstract": "Little is known about factors associated with effective continuing medical education (CME) in psychiatry.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the cellular and molecular alterations in PTSD brains in order to design more effective treatment strategies. Although brain imaging strategies have considerably improved our understanding of PTSD, these strategies cannot identify molecular and cellular changes. Post-mortem examination of the brain is a crucial strategy to advance our understanding of the underlying neuropathology, neurochemistry and molecular pathways of PTSD. Unfortunately, there is a worldwide serious shortage of human psychiatric brain tissue available for post-mortem research.

The proposed mechanism involves inhibition of lorazepam glucuronidation via direct inhibition of uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes by valproic acid. However, the clinical significance of this interaction is unclear.\nTo identify site-specific practices and assess clinical responses to the interaction between valproic acid and lorazepam.\nA chart review was conducted for patients over 18 years of age who were admitted, from September 2008 to September 2014 inclusive, to the psychiatry or neurology service at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, and who received concomitant valproic acid and lorazepam therapy.\nOf the 30 patients included in the chart review, 12 (40%) received an intervention. A total of 8 (27%) patients experienced an adverse drug reaction (ADR), such as drowsiness and dizziness. Seven of these 8 patients were among those who received an intervention.

However, this recommendation could not be validated through an analysis of patients exposed to this interaction in the clinical setting or through a review of the literature. Further clinical and pharmacokinetic studies are required to determine whether concurrent treatment with lorazepam and valproic acid should be considered as causing a major drug interaction. Until more data are available, clinicians should remain cognizant of the potential for a drug-drug interaction and should use the lowest effective dose of lorazepam when this drug is administered concomitantly with valproic acid."}, {"Title": "Minor depression in older, long-term unemployed people seeking vocational support.", "Abstract": "Prevalence rates of minor and major depression vary from 0.7 to 6.8 (minor) and 3.8 to 10.9 (major) for the general population.

However, the prevalence rate of minor depression (depression on a subthreshold level with less than 5, but more than 1 depression symptom) in this population is unknown. The first aim of this study is to identify that prevalence rate, because we already know that minor depression increases the risk of developing a major depression and this in turn reduces the chances of reemployment what increases social and individual costs at the same time. The second aim is to find out whether there are symptoms that distinguish the different groups \"no depression\", \"minor depression\" and \"major depression\" in this population.

Symptom severity correlated with baseline mood parameters in laboratory (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.54; P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) and smartphone (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.30; P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-39) data. However, participants with depression showed an intact association between RPEs and happiness in a computational model of momentary mood dynamics (z\u2009=\u20094.55; P\u2009<\u2009.001) that was not attenuated compared with controls (z\u2009=\u2009-0.42; P\u2009=\u2009.67).\nThe neural and emotional impact of RPEs is intact in major depression. These results suggest that depression does not affect the expression of dopaminergic RPEs and that attenuated RPEs in previous reports may reflect downstream effects more closely related to aberrant behavior. The correlation between symptom severity and baseline mood parameters supports an association between depression and momentary mood fluctuations during cognitive tasks. These results demonstrate a potential for smartphones in large-scale computational phenotyping, which is a goal for computational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The impact after 50 years of a new medical education programme with a regional workforce mission.", "Abstract": "Tasmania established its medical programme in 1965 to produce graduates to address medical workforce recruitment challenges. Many Tasmanian graduates work in Tasmania, but workforce problems continue. This paper reports the workforce outcomes of the first 42 graduating cohorts.\nA database for all University of Tasmania medical graduates from the years 1970 to 2011 was developed by combining information from university, registration and local workforce survey databases.\nA total of 2012 doctors graduated from 1971 to 2011 and 1707 (85%) were registered, most commonly in general practice (45.8%), medicine (13%), anaesthetics (7.9%), surgery (7.5%), psychiatry (4.3%), emergency medicine (35, 3.5%), paediatrics (3.4%) and pathology (3.3%). While 41.9% worked in Tasmania, they comprised 35.6% of the local workforce and were clustered around the two larger cities. The proportion entering general practice has fallen since 1980s.\nThe contribution of the Tasmanian medical programme is substantial but appears less than other regional medical schools. Relatively few work in smaller communities, particularly in specialties other than general practice. Lifestyle choices and the availability of training opportunities and career positions might be contributing factors. The medical school has established clinical schools in rural communities, promoted admission of rural applicants and increased rural clinical placement opportunities, with some early signs of success.\nThe Tasmanian medical programme is important in this regional, island economy, but the rural and remote communities have not benefited as much as the two larger cities.

The risk of errors with potential for harm of patients, such as aggression against self and others or non-drug treatment errors is particularly high in this vulnerable group. Aim: To develop priority topics and strategies for action to foster patient safety in mental healthcare. Method: The Swiss patient safety foundation together with experts conducted round table discussions and a Delphi questionnaire to define topics along the treatment pathway, and to prioritise these topics. Finally, fields of action were developed. Results: An action plan was developed including the definition and prioritization of 9 topics where errors may occur. A global rating task revealed errors concerning diagnostics and structural errors as most important. This led to the development of 4 fields of action (awareness raising, research, implementation, and education and training) including practice-oriented potential starting points to enhance patient safety. Conclusions: The action plan highlights issues of high concern for patient safety in mental healthcare. It serves as a starting point for the development of strategies for action as well as of concrete activities."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders in children with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system.", "Abstract": "The profile of psychiatric disorders associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) may differ in children.

Standing at the interface between medicine, psychiatry and law, the best actions may not be clear, and guidelines neither consistently applicable nor explicit. An aggressive, violent or abusive patient may be behaving anti-socially or criminally. But in acute medical settings it is more likely that a medical, mental health or emotional problem, or some combination thereof, is the explanation and usually we will not know the relative contribution of each element. We must assume that difficult behaviour represents the communication of distress or unmet need. We can prevent and de-escalate situations by understanding why they have arisen, identifying the need, and trying to anticipate or meet it. In these situations 'challenging behaviour' is much like any other presenting problem: the medical approach is to diagnose and treat, while trying to maintain safety and function. In addition, the person-centred approach of trying to understand and address psychological and emotional distress is required. Skilled communication, non-confrontation, relationship-building and negotiation represent the best way to manage situations and avoid harm. If an incident is becoming dangerous, doctors need to know how to act to defuse the situation, or make it safe. Doctors must know about de-escalation and non-drug approaches, but also be confident about when physical restraint and drug treatment are necessary, and how to go about using appropriate drugs, doses, monitoring and aftercare. There are necessary safeguards around using these approaches, from the perspectives of physical health, mental wellbeing, and human rights."}, {"Title": "Medical comorbidities in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Somatic disorders occur more often in adult psychiatric patients than in the general adult population.

The students' attitudes towards psychiatry were generally positive and nearly one-third (29.8%) would consider specialising in the field. Overall, perception towards ECT was mixed, with many respondents approving of its use albeit only as a last resort. Notably, low ECT knowledge scores were associated with more negative attitudes towards this treatment modality and a lower perception of psychiatry as a medical speciality.\nThe findings indicate that for these students, media is the main source of ECT knowledge. While they are generally knowledgeable about ECT, they still harbour some misconceptions and negative attitudes about the treatment. Knowledge appears able to amend these attitudes, thus underlining the importance of integrating accurate information about ECT into the preclinical medical curriculum rather than leaving it to mass media to forge warped perceptions and attitudes for these future clinicians."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties and predictive validity of a police version of a violence risk screen - A pilot study.", "Abstract": "The Violence Risk Screening - Police Version (V-RISK-POL) is a seven-item screening tool for use at police stations by police officers and law enforcement officials to assist in the process of decision making regarding release, restrictive measures or arrest for apprehended individuals where the risk of future violence must be considered.

A systematic review and thematic analysis of psychiatric patients' reported perceptions of the situations associated with the process of coercion.", "Abstract": "WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Psychiatric patients have generally negative experiences of being exposed to coercive measures. Existing research has generally not investigated coercion as a process; that is, it does not address issues that arise before, during and after exposure to coercion. A part of existing research within the area does not clarify and define the type of coercive measure(s) investigated. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Patients place great significance on the link between the positive and negative perceived impact of a coercive situation and the professionals' ability and willingness to interact and communicate respectfully. Psychiatric patients associate the use of seclusion, physical restraint/holding, mechanical restraint and forced medication with strong negative perceptions and wish to be treated with respect by professionals, rather than being subjected to the professionals' control. What patients perceive as moderating factors in regard to the use of coercive measures is currently under-researched. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Increased sensitivity to the patient's views of the situation at each point in the coercive process would help professionals to respond to the patients' individual needs. Professionals need to articulate concern and empathy towards patients and to improve communication skills before, during and after a coercive incident. Greater emphasis should be placed on de-escalation and the use of non-coercive strategies or coping skills before the initiation of coercive measures.\nIntroduction There is a lack of research into psychiatric patients' perceptions of coercion that discriminates between different types of coercive measures, while also investigating patients' perceptions of undergoing coercion as a process. This knowledge is required to improve our understanding and provide a foundation for improving clinical practice. Aims To review existing research literature in order to investigate adult psychiatric patients' reported perceptions of situations before, during and after specific and defined types of coercive measures, and to investigate what patients perceive as moderating factors, in regard to the use of these coercive measures. Method A systematic review and thematic analysis of 26 peer-reviewed studies was undertaken. Results The analysis identified six themes and additional subthemes, where \"interactions with professionals\" and \"communication\" were predominant themes across the timeline of coercion. Altogether, themes were associated with either \"positive or negative patient-perceived impact.\" Implications for practice Increased sensitivity to patients' views of the situation at each point in the process is desirable in order to respond to the patients' individual needs.

Four methods for simplifying the serum samples proteome were evaluated for both removing the most abundant proteins and for enriching those of lower-abundance: protein depletion with acetonitrile (ACN), dithiothreitol (DTT), sequential depletion using DTT and ACN, and protein equalization using commercial ProteoMiner\u00ae kit (PM). For proteomic evaluation, 2-D DIGE and nanoLC-MS/MS analysis were employed.\nPM method was the best strategy for removing proteins of high abundance.

This shift from symptom to organ would bring psychiatry in line with the rest of medicine, and is analogous to the change in status of venereal infections from skin pathologies, such as chancres, to bacterial infections. The proposal in question is part of the reconceptualization of mental processes as brain processes, in line with the materialist conception of the mind as neural. A practical advantage of this conceptual change is that it suggests approaching mental disorders as brain dysfunctions treatable by biological and chemical means, in addition to social measures, such as accommodating mental patients in ordinary hospitals rather than in isolated \"madhouses\" at the mercy of amateurs or even charlatans. An additional advantage of the \"embodiment\" of mental diseases is that it suggests reframing some new research projects, such as explaining why the common cold causes mental fogginess, why hypertension can cause irritability, and why nicotine dependence can be even stronger than cocaine addiction. In other words, the present proposal is to complete the so-called \"mapping of the mind onto the brain\" by including the abnormal mental processes, which used to be treated by shamans at a time when the mind was conceived of as an immaterial entity detachable from the body."}, {"Title": "Integrating Clinical Neurosciences in a Psychiatry Residency Training Program: A Brief Report with Pilot Data.", "Abstract": "A novel neuroscience curriculum was developed attempting to address the growing consensus that increased attention be given to incorporating clinical neuroscience in psychiatric residencies.\nEight 2-h sessions delivered over 2 academic years were incorporated into the teaching curriculum at one institution in which residents participated in case-based clinical neuroscience learning.

Organic conditions were diagnosed using a multidisciplinary approach and numerous paraclinical investigations. Given the binary classification needs, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Peacock and Peacock, 2010) to calculate the best classification threshold.\nThe cohort included 67 cases of non-organic catatonia and 37 cases of organic catatonia.

A case for strong aggregate outcomes.", "Abstract": "Clinical trials in psychiatry inherit methods for design and statistical analysis from evidence-based medicine. However, trials in other clinical disciplines benefit from a more specific relationship between instruments that measure disease state (e.g. biomarkers, clinical signs), the underlying pathology and diagnosis such that primary outcomes can be readily defined. Trials in psychiatry use diagnosis (i.e. a categorical label for a syndrome) as a proxy for the underlying disorder, and outcomes are defined, for example, as a percentage change in a univariate total score on some clinical instrument. We label this approach to defining outcomes weak aggregation of disease state. Univariate measures are necessary, because statistical methodology is both tractable and well-developed for scalar outcomes, but we show that weak aggregate approaches do not capture disease state sufficiently, potentially leading to loss of information about response to intervention. We demonstrate how multivariate disease state can be captured using geometric concepts of spaces defined over routine clinical instruments, and show how clinically meaningful disease states (e.g. representing different profiles of symptoms, recovery or remission) can be defined as prototypes (geometric locations) in these spaces. Then, we show how to derive univariate (scalar) measures, which capture patient's relationships to these prototypes and argue these represent strong aggregates of disease state that may be a better basis for outcome measures. We demonstrate our proposal using a large publically available dataset. We conclude by discussing the impact of strong aggregates for analyses in traditional and novel trial designs."}, {"Title": "'There's a Catch-22' - The complexities of pain management for people with advanced dementia nearing the end of life: A qualitative exploration of physicians' perspectives.", "Abstract": "Pain management is a cornerstone of palliative care.

During the 1800s and early 1900s, Ireland-s public asylums were routinely overcrowded, unhygienic and, quite commonly, fatal. The asylums became all-too-convenient options for a society with an apparently insatiable hunger for institutions, incarceration and control. The emergence of clinical professionals, both medical and nursing, was inevitably a factor in this complex mix, but the effects of any search for professional prestige were dwarfed by asylum doctors' clear outrage at what the asylum system became. There were powerful, non-medical, vested interests in keeping large asylums open. Irish society consistently failed to generate solutions to real human suffering (mental illness, disability, disease, poverty, ill fortune) other than the extraordinary network of institutions that characterised so much of Irish history: orphanages, industrial schools, reformatories, workhouses, laundries, borstals, prisons and asylums.

Objective To design and validate a medication assessment tool to assess prescribers' adherence to international guideline recommendations in the management of bipolar disorder (MATBD). Setting Outpatient psychiatry clinic at a secondary healthcare setting in Kuwait. Method International guidelines concerned with the management of bipolar disorder were reviewed in order to develop MATBD. Face and content validity of the developed tool (MATBD) was performed with a research and expert group. A 4-point Likert scale was used to assess the expert group's level of agreement to individual criterion. Content validity ratio (CVR) was calculated for each criterion (n\u00a0=\u00a054) and the content validity index (CVI) was calculated for each section (n\u00a0=\u00a05) of the MATBD. Finally, feasibility testing was performed on 19 patient records to confirm the tool's fitness for purpose. Main Outcomes Measure Perceived relevance, utility, and clarity of individual criteria, and reliability of their application to clinical settings. Results Face validity and content validity were achieved with a research and expert group (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Content validity ratio (CVR) was demonstrated for 54 criteria; criteria with a negative CVR were removed. This resulted in a draft MATBD comprising of 52 criteria (CVI: 0.814).

The Global Functioning: Role scale and level of vocational participation, participant characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic background and family history of serious mental illness), distress, psychotic-like experiences, substance use, and mental health diagnoses were recorded. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery was used to assess sustained attention, visual memory and executive function.\nOf the 107 participants, 33 (31%) were not working or studying and 52 (49%) had a diagnosis of affective disorder. Impairments in neurocognitive tests were evidenced in attention shift, sustained attention target sensitivity, impulsivity and spatial working memory errors. Univariate analyses indicated that information processing and target impulsivity were associated with both vocational participation and global functioning, and that spatial working memory strategy was also associated with vocational participation. After controlling for significant demographic and clinical predictors, strategy formation remained a significant correlate of vocational participation (coefficient (95%CI) = -0.08 (-0.17, -0.01)), but no neurocognitive measures remained significant in the multivariate prediction of global functioning.\nNeurocognitive outcomes were assessed at a single time point, factors such as fluctuations in motivation could impact on test results.\nInterventions targeting work and education participation should consider the capacity of vulnerable young people to develop appropriate plans for role success and provide support accordingly.

This study was undertaken in an effort to better understand the student experience of the Cambridge Integrated Clerkship and how it may have impacted students' perceptions of and interest in psychiatry, as well as performance.\nQualitative surveys were sent via e-mail to the first 11 student cohorts who had completed the Cambridge Integrated Clerkship (from 2004 to 2014) and for whom we had e-mail addresses (N\u00a0=\u00a0100), and the free-text responses were coded thematically. All available standardized scoring data and residency match data for Cambridge Integrated Clerkship graduates were obtained.\nFrom 2006 to 2014, 12 out of 73 Cambridge Integrated Clerkship students who entered the match chose a psychiatry residency (16.4%), four times more than students in traditional clerkships at Harvard Medical School (3.8% of 1355 students) or the national average (4.1% of 146,066 US applicants). Thirty of the 100 surveyed Cambridge Integrated Clerkship graduates (30%) responded to the qualitative survey with free-text remarks on a number of themes.\nCambridge Integrated Clerkship students compared positively to their classmates in terms of standardized test performance. Their fourfold higher match rate into psychiatry compared to other students raises intriguing questions as to what role a longitudinal clerkship might have played in developing interest in psychiatry as a career."}, {"Title": "Feasibility study of a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of using a humanoid robot to improve the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (Kaspar RCT): a study protocol.", "Abstract": "Interventions using robot-assisted therapy may be beneficial for the social skills development of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. The present research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a social skills intervention using Kinesics and Synchronisation in Personal Assistant Robotics (Kaspar) with children with ASD.\nForty children will be recruited. Inclusion criteria are the following: aged 5-10 years, confirmed ASD diagnosis, IQ over 70, English-language comprehension, a carer who can complete questionnaires in English and no current participation in a private social communication intervention. Children will be randomised to receive an intervention with a therapist and Kaspar, or with the therapist only. They will receive two familiarisation sessions and six treatment sessions for 8\u2009weeks. They will be assessed at baseline, and at 10\u2009and 22\u2009weeks after baseline. The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate whether the predetermined feasibility criteria for a full-scale trial are met. The potential primary outcome measures for a full-scale trial are the Social Communication Questionnaire and the Social Skills Improvement System. We will conduct a preliminary economic analysis. After the study has ended, a sample of 20 participants and their families will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the study's methods and intervention.\nParents/carers will provide informed consent, and children will give assent, where appropriate. Care will be taken to avoid pressure or coercion to participate. Aftercare is available from the recruiting NHS Trust, and a phased withdrawal protocol will be followed if children become excessively attached to the robot.

The course of illness is frequently characterised by progressive shortening of interepisode intervals with each recurrence and increasing cognitive dysfunction in a subset of individuals with this condition. Clinically, diagnostic boundaries between bipolar disorder and other psychiatric disorders such as unipolar depression are unclear although pharmacological and psychological treatment strategies differ substantially. Patients with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed and the mean delay between onset and diagnosis is 5-10 years. Although the risk of relapse of depression and mania is high it is for most patients impossible to predict and consequently prevent upcoming episodes in an individual tailored way. The identification of objective biomarkers can both inform bipolar disorder diagnosis and provide biological targets for the development of new and personalised treatments. Accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder in its early stages could help prevent the long-term detrimental effects of the illness.The present Bipolar Illness Onset study aims to identify (1) a composite blood-based biomarker, (2) a composite electronic smartphone-based biomarker and (3) a neurocognitive and neuroimaging-based signature for bipolar disorder.\nThe study will include 300 patients with newly diagnosed/first-episode bipolar disorder, 200 of their healthy siblings or offspring and 100 healthy individuals without a family history of affective disorder. All participants will be followed longitudinally with repeated blood samples and other biological tissues, self-monitored and automatically generated smartphone data, neuropsychological tests and a subset of the cohort with neuroimaging during a 5 to 10-year study period.\nThe study has been approved by the Local Ethical Committee (H-7-2014-007) and the data agency, Capital Region of Copenhagen (RHP-2015-023), and the findings will be widely disseminated at international conferences and meetings including conferences for the International Society for Bipolar Disorders and the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry and in scientific peer-reviewed papers.\nNCT02888262."}, {"Title": "[Arterial Hyper- and Hypotension associated with psychiatric medications: a risk assessment based on the summaries of product characteristics (SmPCs)].", "Abstract": "<b>Introduction</b>\u2002Psychiatric medications are well-known triggers of clinically relevant blood pressure changes. Therefore, we aimed at creating ranking lists for their risk of causing arterial hyper- or hypotension. <b>Methods</b>\u2002We analyzed 784 Summaries of Product characteristics (SmPCs, available online from \"Rote Liste\" or \"Gelbe Liste\" websites) from 105 psychiatric medications registered in adult psychiatry in Germany and extracted the standardized reported risks of increasing or decreasing arterial blood pressure. <b>Results</b>\u2002According to the SmPCs, atomoxetine had the highest risk of arterial hypertension (\"very frequent\", >\u200a10\u200a%), and another 15 substances followed in the category \"frequent\" (>\u200a1\u200a%): duloxetine, milnacipran, venlafaxine, bupropion, citalopram, tranylcypromine (particularly with certain diets), reboxetine, methylphenidate, clozapine, paliperidone, risperidone, buprenorphine+naloxone, memantine, galantamine, and rivastigmine. Conversely, 7 substances, namely amitriptyline, tranylcypromine, chlorprothixen, flupentixol, levomepromazine, olanzapine and trimipramine had the highest reported risk of low blood pressure (\"very frequent\"), and another 25 substances had the risk \"frequent\". No risk of hypertension or hypotension was documented for many other substances. Incidentally, we observed that the reported effects on blood pressure for single substances (e.\u200ag. citalopram) markedly differed between the SmPCs from different manufacturers, rendering a clear risk assessment impossible for many medications. <b>Discussion</b>\u2002According to the German SmPc, many psychiatric medications are associated with the risk of arterial hypertension and, even more so, hypotension. We hardly observed substance group effects, such as high blood pressure with noradrenergic antidepressants. Commonly used tables summarising secondary causes of arterial hypertension should be revised in terms of psychiatric medications. Our rank orders of\u00a0risk may aid choosing the best psychiatric medications in patients with known hypertension or at risk for syncope, as well as when blood pressure changes occur under psychiatric pharmacotherapy.

This study aims to explore whether and to what extent the prevalence of depression varies when using different diagnostic criteria and rating scales, and various samples of older adults.\nA population-based sample of 3353 individuals aged 60-104 years from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) were examined in 2001-2004. Point prevalence of depression was estimated by: 1) diagnostic criteria, ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR/DSM-5; 2) rating scales, MADRS and GDS-15; and 3) self-report. Depression prevalence in sub-samples by dementia status, living place, and socio-demographics were compared.\nThe prevalence of any depression (including all severity grades) was 4.2% (moderate/severe: 1.6%) for ICD-10 and 9.3% (major: 2.1%) for DSM-IV-TR; 10.6% for MADRS and 9.2% for GDS-15; and 9.1% for self-report. Depression prevalence was lower in the dementia-free sample as compared to the total population. Furthermore, having poor physical function, or not having a partner were independently associated with higher depression prevalence, across most of the depression definitions.\nThe response rate was 73.3% and this may have resulted in an underestimation of depression.\nDepression prevalence was similar across all depression definitions except for ICD-10, showing much lower figures. However, independent of the definition used, depression prevalence varies greatly by dementia status, physical functioning, and marital status. These findings may be useful for clinicians when assessing depression in older adults and for researchers when exploring and comparing depression prevalence across studies."}, {"Title": "A comparison of the neutrophil-lymphocyte, platelet-lymphocyte and monocyte-lymphocyte ratios in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients - a retrospective file review.", "Abstract": "Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) have recently been used as indicators of inflammation.

The shortage of geriatric mental health specialists means that most geriatric mental healthcare will be provided by physicians who do not have specialty training in geriatrics. The Institute of Medicine Report of 2012 highlighted the urgent need for development of national competencies and curricula in geriatric mental health for all clinicians. Virtually all physicians can expect to treat older patients with mental health symptoms, yet currently there are no widely accepted learning objectives in geriatric mental health specific for medical students. The authors describe the development of a set of such learning objectives that all medical students should achieve by graduation. The iterative process included initial drafting by content experts from five medical schools with input and feedback from a wider group of geriatric psychiatrists, geriatricians, internists, and medical educators.

Connections were established through secure video conferencing and call-routing software. Patients connected with a personal computer or tablet and providers connected with a desktop computer with a high-definition web camera. In some cases, high-definition digital images were emailed to the provider prior to the virtual consultation. For each patient, the following was collected: (1) patient and injury demographics (diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management), (2) total number of encounters, (3) service for each encounter (burn, psychiatry, and rehabilitation), (4) length of visit, including travel distance and time saved and, (5) complications, including re-admissions and connectivity issues.\n52 virtual encounters were performed with 31 patients during the first year of the pilot project from March 2015 to June 2016. Mean age of the participant was 44 years (range 18-83 years). Mean total burn surface area of the participant was 12% (range 1-80%). Average roundtrip travel distance saved was 188 miles (range 4-822 miles). Average round trip travel time saved was 201min (range 20-564min). There were no unplanned re-admissions and no complications. Five connectivity issues were reported, none of which prevented completion of the visit.\nInteractive Home Telehealth is a safe and feasible modality for delivering follow-up care to burn patients. Burn care providers benefit from the potential to improve outpatient clinic utilization.

Often highly publicized, violent acts raise the question of their detection, prevention, management and treatment. There is no single, direct and exclusive link between aggressiveness and the underlying psychiatric disorder. On the contrary, the processes underlying this violence are multiple and interlinked. In addition to static and dynamic risk factors, cognitive deficits play an important role in the genesis and maintenance of violent and aggressive behavior.\nUsing recent data from the international literature and the main databases, we first clarify the role played by cognitive deficits in the violence of patients with schizophrenia. We then evaluate the place of psychosocial interventions such as cognitive remediation and social cognitive training in managing the violent and aggressive behavior of these patients.\nExecutive functions and working memory are the most studied neurocognitive functions in the field of violence in schizophrenia. Impulsivity, lack of cognitive flexibility, lack of adaptation and inhibition of automatic motor responses, and altered anger regulation may explain this relationship. Three main components of social cognition are associated with violent behaviors in schizophrenia: (1) the recognition of facial emotions through the inoperability of systems of \"emotional monitoring\", violent inhibition and recognition of informative facial zones; (2) the theory of the mind through the erroneous interpretation of the intentions of others; (3) the attributional style through the preferentially aggressive over interpretation of social situations and weak capacities of introspection. Overall, cognitive biases inhibit response in a socially acceptable manner and increase the risk of responding impulsively and aggressively to a stressful or provocative situation. In this context, we studied the place held by psychosocial interventions in the management of the violent and aggressive behaviors of these patients. Various cognitive remediation programs have shown their feasibility in people with schizophrenia and neurocognitive deficits with a history of violence as well as their effectiveness in reducing violence, mainly by reducing impulsivity. Similarly, specific programs dedicated to social cognitive training such as Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT), Reasoning and Rehabilitation Mental Health Program (R&R2 MHP) and Metacognitive Training (MCT) have shown their positive impact on the control and reduction of global aggressive attitudes and on the numbers of physical and verbal aggressive incidents in schizophrenia. The improvement of social cognition would be achieved through the amendment of interpersonal relationships and social functioning. These interventions are effective at different stages of disease progression, in patients with varied profiles, on violent attitudes in general and on the number of verbal and physical attacks, whether for in-patients or out-patients. Beneficial effects can last up to 12months after termination of the study program. The interest of these interventions is preventive if the subject never entered in a violent register or curative in case of a personal history of violence. This type of care can be considered from a symptomatic point of view by limiting downstream the heavy consequences of such acts, but also etiologically by acting on one of the causes of violent behavior. Compliance with the eligibility criteria, carrying out a prior functional analysis and confirmation of the major impulsive part of the patient's violence are prerequisites for the use of these programs. Similarly, the early introduction of such therapies, their repetition over time and the integration of the patient into a comprehensive process of psychosocial rehabilitation will ensure the best chance of success.\nSome cognitive impairments appear to have their place in the genesis, progression and maintenance of violent acts of individuals with schizophrenia. Their management thus opens new therapeutic perspectives such as cognitive remediation, still rarely used in this aim, to complement the action of the traditional care tools. However, further therapeutic trials are needed before considering cognitive remediation and social cognitive training as central care modalities in the therapeutic control of violence in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Association between the violence in the community and the aggressive behaviors of psychotics during their hospitalizations].", "Abstract": "Violence is a common issue in psychiatry and has multiple determiners.

Moreover, we know little about the quantitative relationship between the frequency of traumatic childhood events, strength of memory bias and number of comorbid psychiatric disorders; the latter being an index of severity. The current study examined the association of childhood trauma and negative memory bias with psychopathology in a large naturalistic psychiatric patient sample.\nFrequency of traumatic childhood events (emotional neglect, psychological-, physical- and sexual abuse) was assessed using a questionnaire in a sample of 252 adult psychiatric patients with no psychotic or bipolar-I disorder and no cognitive disorder as main diagnosis. Patients were diagnosed for DSM-IV Axis-I and Axis-II disorders using a structured clinical interview. This allowed for the assessment of comorbidity between disorders. Negative memory bias for verbal stimuli was measured using a computer task.\nLinear regression models revealed that the frequency of childhood trauma as well as negative memory bias was positively associated with psychiatric comorbidity, separately and above and beyond each other (all <i>p</i>\u00a0<<i>\u00a0</i>.01).\nThe results indicate that childhood trauma and negative memory bias may be of importance for a broader spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses, besides the frequently studied affective disorders. Importantly, frequently experiencing traumatic events during childhood increases the risk of comorbid psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "[The presumption of mental health: is it really proved?].", "Abstract": "The article is devoted to one of the most complicated and peculiar problems of modern psychiatry - the presumption of mental health. Its originality is seen in the fact that practically all speaking and writing about it noted the importance of this principle for the protection of rights and legal interests of citizens, failing into the field of psychiatry. However, expressing this opinion, doctors and lawyers offer very few arguments in support of this view. Traditional arguments in favor of the presumption of mental health, scattered and unsystematic, prove to be absolutely insolvent. It was also found out that the similarity of the presumption of mental health with the presumption of innocence is capable to entail negative consequences. The noted similarity strengthens stigmatizing effect of psychiatric diagnosis, making it extremely undesirable for the patient, and the basis of the relationship between the patient and the doctor laid counterproductive antagonistic model as the model of mutual relations of the accused with the prosecutor. The main conclusion of authors is that the supporters of the presumption of mental health have yet to prove its right to exist, to work out its content and try to neutralize some of the negative consequences of its possible implementation in practice. Without compliance with the listed conditions to bring the presumption of mental health to the level of one of the fundamental principles of Russian psychiatry would be premature."}, {"Title": "[A current view on the history of atypical antipsychotics].", "Abstract": "Based on the analysis of the original literature, the author for the first time systemizes the data on the story of atypical antipsychotic drugs. The history of introduction of the first atypical neuroleptics - clozapine and sulpiride, which launched the dichotomic development of psychopharmacology of atypical antipsychotics, is described. Historical facts on the introduction into practice of different sulpiride- and clozapine-like neuroleptics as well as the relationship of their history with the elaboration of dopamine and serotonin hypotheses of mechanisms of action of antipsychotics are presented. The author analyzes the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with different atypical neuroleptics. An importance of evidence-based medicine principles in the history of atypical antipsychotics is described. A significance of the history of some atypical and typical (pericyazine) neuroleptics in the evolution of conceptions on the validity of evidence-based medicine in psychiatry is evaluated.

However, few large-scale studies have investigated the factors that may influence PA participation in individuals with psychosis and data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is especially scarce. Thus, we investigated PA correlates in a large sample of people with a psychosis diagnosis across 47 LMICs.\nCross-sectional data from the World Health Survey, restricting to those with a self-reported lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia/psychotic disorder, was analyzed. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and participants were dichotomized into those that do and do not (low PA) meet the minimum recommended PA weekly targets (\u2265150min). A range of socio-demographic, health behavior, and mental and physical health variables were examined using random effects logistic regression.\nOverall 2407 people (mean 42.0years, 41.5% males) with schizophrenia/psychosis were included. The prevalence of low PA was 39.2% (95%CI=37.0%-41.2%). Male sex (odds ratio (OR)=1.33), increasing age, unemployment (vs. employed OR=2.50), urban setting (vs. rural OR=1.75), inadequate fruit consumption (vs. adequate fruit intake OR=3.03), depression (OR=1.33), sleep/energy disturbance, and mobility limitations were significantly associated with low PA. Marital status, education, wealth, smoking, vegetable and alcohol consumption, anxiety, cognition, pain, and chronic medical conditions were not significant correlates.\nPA is influenced by a range of factors among people with psychosis.

Those detained include asylum-seekers and foreign national prisoners, groups with a higher prevalence of mental health vulnerabilities compared with the general population. In light of little published research on the mental health status of detainees in immigration removal centres (IRCs), the primary aim of this study was to explore whether it was feasible to conduct psychiatric research in such a setting. A secondary aim was to compare the mental health of those seeking asylum with the rest of the detainees.\nCross-sectional study with simple random sampling followed by opportunistic sampling. Exclusion criteria included inadequate knowledge of English and European Union nationality. Six validated tools were used to screen for mental health disorders including developmental disorders like Personality Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disability, as well as for needs assessment. These were the MINI v6, SAPAS, AQ-10, ASRS, LDSQ and CANFOR. Demographic data were obtained using a participant demographic sheet. Researchers were trained in the use of the screening battery and inter-rater reliability assessed by joint ratings.\nA total of 101 subjects were interviewed. Overall response rate was 39%. The most prevalent screened mental disorder was depression (52.5%), followed by personality disorder (34.7%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (20.8%). 21.8% were at moderate to high suicidal risk. 14.9 and 13.9% screened positive for ASD and ADHD, respectively. The greatest unmet needs were in the areas of intimate relationships (76.2%), psychological distress (72.3%) and sexual expression (71.3%). Overall presence of mental disorder was comparable with levels found in prisons. The numbers in each group were too small to carry out any further analysis.\nIt is feasible to undertake a psychiatric morbidity survey in an IRC. Limitations of the study include potential selection bias, use of screening tools, use of single-site study, high refusal rates, the lack of interpreters and lack of women and children in study sample.

Individuals were followed up for 12 months. We also used data from a smaller cohort of individuals presenting to 31 hospitals in England during a 3-month period in 2010/2011, followed up for 6 months. Propensity score (PS) methods were used to address observed confounding. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation.\nFollowing PS stratification, those who received a psychosocial assessment had a lower risk of repeat hospital attendance for self-harm than those who were not assessed [RR 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-0.95]. The risk was reduced most among people less likely to be assessed. Following PS matching, we found no associations between risks of repeat self-harm and admission to a medical bed, referral to outpatient psychiatry or admission to a psychiatric bed. We did not find a relationship between psychosocial assessment and repeat self-harm in the 31 centre cohort.\nThis study shows the potential value of using novel statistical techniques in large mental health datasets to estimate treatment effects. We found that specialist psychosocial assessment may reduce the risk of repeat self-harm.

Many of these disorders affect brain development and its connectivity. In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing brain networks based on the combination of a graph theory measure (eigenvector centrality) and a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM).\nWe applied this approach to resting-state fMRI data from 622 children and adolescents. Eigenvector centrality (EVC) of nodes from positive- and negative-task networks were extracted from each subject and used as input to an OC-SVM to label individual brain networks as typical or atypical. We hypothesised that classification of these subjects regarding the pattern of brain connectivity would predict the level of psychopathology.\nSubjects with atypical brain network organisation had higher levels of psychopathology (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was a greater EVC in the typical group at the bilateral posterior cingulate and bilateral posterior temporal cortices; and significant decreases in EVC at left temporal pole.\nThe combination of graph theory methods and an OC-SVM is a promising method to characterise neurodevelopment, and may be useful to understand the deviations leading to mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Clomipramine trial for treatment-resistant persistent genital arousal disorder: a case series.", "Abstract": "Treatment of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD), as a chronic and disabling condition, implicates substantial compelling complexities.\nIn this case series, seven women diagnosed with PGAD who were referred to the Sexual Dysfunction Unit of Psychotherapy Outpatient Clinic of Bakirkoy Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, Istanbul, Turkey between 2006 and 2009 were included.

Despite descriptions of what ownership is, there is little discussion of how to foster ownership during residency. The objective of this study was to solicit psychiatry resident and faculty perspectives on ways to enhance resident ownership in training.\nTwenty-nine of 74 (39.2%) residents and 31 of 68 (45.6%) faculty members surveyed provided narrative responses to a voluntary, anonymous, electronic survey asking two structured, open-ended questions about what factors make it more or less likely that a resident will take \"ownership\" of patient care.\nThe coding process produced four overarching categories of themes (attending, resident, educational program, and environment) that reflect domains for possible interventions to increase ownership, with conceptual guidance from the Theory of Planned Behavior. From these factors, the authors propose a number of practical yet theory-based interventions which include setting expectations, modeling, promoting autonomy, countertransference supervision, changing residency culture, and longer rotations.\nThese interventions address subjective norms, attitudes, perceived ability and control, environment, and actual resident abilities, all of which, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, would be likely to influence patient care ownership.

Rasch modeling was used to assess scale properties. Sex, cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms were tested for differential item functioning (DIF).\nThe bifactor analysis identified an essential unidimensional (general) factor structure but also specific local factors. The general factor comprises all the 20 items as one factor, and the results showed that the variance in the general and specific factors (subscale) scores is best explained by the single general factor. These findings were demonstrated for both versions of the GAI. Furthermore, the Rasch models identified extensive item overlap, indicating redundant items in the full version of the GAI. The GAI-SF also seems to extract much of the same information as the full form. Test scores and items have the same meaning for older adults across different demographic status.\nThe findings support the use of a total sum score for both GAI and GAI-SF.

In a cluster-level dynamic treatment regimen, the treatment is potentially adapted and re-adapted over time based on changes in the cluster that could be impacted by prior intervention, including aggregate measures of the individuals or patients that compose it. Cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trials can be used to answer multiple open questions preventing scientists from developing high-quality cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens. In a cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial, sequential randomizations occur at the cluster level and outcomes are observed at the individual level. This manuscript makes two contributions to the design and analysis of cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trials. First, a weighted least squares regression approach is proposed for comparing the mean of a patient-level outcome between the cluster-level dynamic treatment regimens embedded in a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial. The regression approach facilitates the use of baseline covariates which is often critical in the analysis of cluster-level trials. Second, sample size calculators are derived for two common cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs for use when the primary aim is a between-dynamic treatment regimen comparison of the mean of a continuous patient-level outcome. The methods are motivated by the Adaptive Implementation of Effective Programs Trial which is, to our knowledge, the first-ever cluster-randomized sequential multiple assignment randomized trial in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The Relation Between Aggression and the Living Group Climate in a Forensic Treatment Unit for Adolescents: A Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "In the current study, the associations between inpatient aggression and the living group climate as perceived by the adolescents admitted to a forensic psychiatric treatment unit, are investigated based on carefully registered longitudinal data.

The aim of this review is to introduce readers to the similarities and dissimilarities between psychedelic states and night dreams, and to draw conclusions related to therapeutic applications of psychedelics in psychiatry.\nResearch literature related to psychedelics and dreaming is reviewed, and these two states of consciousness are systematically compared. Relevant conclusions with regard to psychedelicassisted therapy will be provided.\nCommon features between psychedelic states and night dreams include perception, mental imagery, emotion activation, fear memory extinction, and sense of self and body. Differences between these two states are related to differential perceptual input from the environment, clarity of consciousness and meta-cognitive abilities. Therefore, psychedelic states are closest to lucid dreaming which is characterized by a mixed state of dreaming and waking consciousness.\nThe broad overlap between dreaming and psychedelic states supports the notion that psychedelics acutely induce dreamlike subjective experiences which may have long-term beneficial effects on psychosocial functioning and well-being. Future clinical studies should examine how therapeutic outcome is related to the acute dreamlike effects of psychedelics."}, {"Title": "Phone-Based Interventions in Adolescent Psychiatry: A Perspective and Proof of Concept Pilot Study With a Focus on Depression and Autism.", "Abstract": "Telemedicine has emerged as an innovative platform to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders in a cost-effective fashion. Previous studies have laid the functional framework for monitoring and treating child psychiatric disorders electronically using videoconferencing, mobile phones (smartphones), and Web-based apps. However, phone call and text message (short message service, SMS) interventions in adolescent psychiatry are less studied than other electronic platforms. Further investigations on the development of these interventions are needed.\nThe aim of this paper was to explore the utility of text message interventions in adolescent psychiatry and describe a user feedback-driven iterative design process for text message systems.\nWe developed automated text message interventions using a platform for both depression (EpxDepression) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; EpxAutism) and conducted 2 pilot studies for each intervention (N=3 and N=6, respectively). The interventions were prescribed by and accessible to the patients' healthcare providers. EpxDepression and EpxAutism utilized an automated system to triage patients into 1 of 3 risk categories based on their text responses and alerted providers directly via phone and an online interface when patients met provider-specified risk criteria. Rapid text-based feedback from participants and interviews with providers allowed for quick iterative cycles to improve interventions.\nPatients using EpxDepression had high weekly response rates (100% over 2 to 4 months), but exhibited message fatigue with daily prompts with mean (SD) overall response rates of 66.3% (21.6%) and 64.7% (8.2%) for mood and sleep questionnaires, respectively. In contrast, parents using EpxAutism displayed both high weekly and overall response rates (100% and 85%, respectively, over 1 to 4 months) that did not decay significantly with time. Monthly participant feedback surveys for EpxDepression (7 surveys) and EpxAutism (18 surveys) preliminarily indicated that for both interventions, daily messages constituted the \"perfect amount\" of contact and that EpxAutism, but not EpxDepression, improved patient communication with providers. Notably, EpxDepression detected thoughts of self-harm in patients before their case managers or caregivers were aware of such ideation.\nText-message interventions in adolescent psychiatry can provide a cost-effective and engaging method to track symptoms, behavior, and ideation over time. Following the collection of pilot data and feedback from providers and patients, larger studies are already underway to validate the clinical utility of EpxDepression and EpxAutism.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT03002311; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03002311 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6qQtlCIS0)."}, {"Title": "Does behavioral health integration improve primary care providers' perceptions of health-care system functioning and their own knowledge?", "Abstract": "To examine the impact of behavioral health integration (BHI) on primary care providers' (PCPs') (1) perceptions of behavioral health (BH)-primary care (PC) system functioning and (2) perceptions of their own knowledge regarding how to manage, triage, and access help in caring for patients with mental health conditions and substance use disorders.\nWe implemented BHI based on evidence-based models consisting of seven elements: (1)Screening for mental health and substance use disorders, (2)Training of PC teams, (3)Integration of BH providers into PC teams, (4)Roll-out of unlicensed mental health care managers and establishment of a BH registry, (5)Psychiatry consult service, (6)Site-based BHI meetings, and (7)Site self assessments.

Even though it has not been included in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, \"behavioral addictions\" section, CBD is a hot topic in current clinical psychiatry, because of its relevant prevalence (at least 5% in adult populations) and severe effect on quality of life.The CBD shares some clinical features with substance-related and behavioral addictions, impulse control disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder, and it is often comorbid with other psychiatric illnesses (especially depressive and anxiety disorders). The treatment of CBD is therefore difficult, and clear therapeutic guidelines are not yet available. Treating the comorbid disorders as the first-line approach, or combining drugs with different pharmacodynamic profiles, has been suggested to address this challenging condition.\nA 60-year-old woman affected by a severe form of CBD with comorbid major depressive disorder, resistant/intolerant to previous selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments and only partially responder to mirtazapine, achieved a good clinical improvement adding bupropion.\nCombining 2 agents with different pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of action, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, could be a useful strategy in the management of complex CBD cases."}, {"Title": "Independent housing and support for people with severe mental illness: systematic review.", "Abstract": "To systematically explore the outcomes of Independent Housing and Support (IHS) for people with severe mental disorders when compared to other residential settings.\nSystematic review of Randomised and Non-Randomised Controlled Trials of publications that analyse the outcomes of living in independent settings versus institutionalised accommodation.

To our knowledge, no peer-reviewed articles have been published considering resident perspectives on the Goldwater rule. Furthermore, we have found little published guidance that deals specifically with teaching the Goldwater rule in a general residency curriculum. We propose that residency programs should incorporate a brief (one hour) but thoughtful discussion of the Goldwater rule into their general curriculum. We recommend that such a didactic hour should introduce arguments for and against the rule in its present form. Covered topics could include whether there should be exceptions to the rule, whether the rule is defensible on ethical grounds, and what contexts exist in which psychiatric opinions can be rendered without personal examination.

I argue that the wording of Section 7.3 is ambiguous, and I document disagreement over the scope of the rule and consider the implications of this disagreement. If one reads Section 7.3 narrowly, as banning media comments without interview and consent, but allowing such comments in institutional settings, then the general principle articulated in the text and often repeated in the media begins to appear insubstantial. If one reads Section 7.3 broadly, then the work of psychiatrists in the courts, in government agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, in insurance companies, and in the academy becomes ethically problematic. I trace the American Psychiatric Association's own interpretation of Section 7.3 and conclude that the APA has advocated a narrow reading. I assert the need for an integrated theory of psychiatric ethics for settings where interview and consent are absent. Such a theory, articulating why comments in institutional settings are ethical, but comments to media are not, may reduce public confusion and provide a basis for revising Section 7.3."}, {"Title": "Geriatrics and the Legal System.", "Abstract": "Correctional systems, already struggling to meet the basic and functional requirements of older prisoners, will be further challenged by the increasing medical and psychiatric needs of this population. Mental health and general medical care for older adults requires specific on-site or consultation expertise in geriatric medicine and psychiatry, as well as potential changes in infrastructure, both of which may be prohibitively expensive. However, compassionate and effective treatment of older prisoners requires that prison and legal systems facilitate this expert care. To address this situation, strategic revisions of the criminal justice system are needed to alleviate prison overcrowding and consequent inadequate medical care for inmates, especially the elder ones. The unique, age-related demands of this older population predict an increased need for forensic psychiatrists with a thorough knowledge and expertise in geriatrics, as more forensic psychiatric evaluations will be needed before trial in both civil and criminal cases, during incarceration, and at the time of parole.

Research has shown that dissociation is a risk factor for violence and is seen most often in crimes of extreme violence. The subject matter is most relevant to forensic psychiatry. Peritraumatic dissociation for instance, with or without a history of dissociative disorder, is quite frequently reported by offenders presenting for a forensic psychiatric examination. Dissociation or dissociative amnesia for serious offenses can have legal repercussions stemming from their relevance to the legal constructs of fitness to stand trial, criminal responsibility, and diminished capacity. The complexity in forensic psychiatric assessments often lies in the difficulty of connecting clinical symptomatology reported by violent offenders to a specific condition included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

The authors examined the timing and stability of student career choice of psychiatry compared with other specialties and determined what pre- and intra-medical school factors were associated with choosing a career in psychiatry.\nUsing survey data from students who graduated from U.S. allopathic medical schools in 2013 and 2014 (N=29,713), the authors computed rates of psychiatry specialty choice at the beginning and end of medical school and assessed the stability of that choice. A multivariate-adjusted logistic regression and recursive partitioning were used to determine the association of 29 factors with psychiatry specialty choice.\nChoice of psychiatry increased from 1.6% at the start of medical school to 4.1% at graduation. The stability of psychiatry specialty choice from matriculation to graduation, at just over 50%, was greater than for any other specialty. However, almost 80% of future psychiatrists did not indicate an inclination toward the specialty at matriculation. A rating of \"excellent\" for the psychiatry clerkship (odds ratio=2.66), a major in psychology in college (odds ratio=2.58), and valuing work-life balance (odds ratio=2.25) were the factors most strongly associated with psychiatry career choice.\nStudents who enter medical school planning to become psychiatrists are likely to do so, but the vast majority of students who choose psychiatry do so during medical school.

Prevalence ratios were compared using the Poisson distribution. RESULTS Of 1,022 completed tests, 53 samples tested positive for CRE, yielding a prevalence of 5.2% (95% CI, 3.9%-6.8%). Of 726 tests from ACHs, 36 (5.0%; 95% CI, 3.5%-6.9%) were positive. Of 244 tests from long-term-care facilities, 17 (7.0%; 95% CI, 4.1%-11.2%) were positive. The relative prevalence ratios by facility type were 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5-1.5) and 1.5 (95% CI, 0.9-2.6), respectively. No CRE were identified from the inpatient rehabilitation facility. CONCLUSION A baseline CRE prevalence was established, revealing endemicity across healthcare settings in the District of Columbia. Our study establishes a framework for interfacility collaboration to reduce CRE transmission and infection.

However, the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could be beneficial to improve some BPD symptoms. The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical improvement in patients with BPD after application of rTMS over the right or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).\nTwenty-nine patients with BPD from the National Institute of Psychiatry, Mexico, were randomized in two groups to receive 15 sessions of rTMS applied over the right (1 Hz, n=15) or left (5 Hz, n=14) DLPFC. Improvement was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale for BPD (CGI-BPD), Borderline Evaluation of Severity Over Time (BEST), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS).\nIntragroup comparison showed significant (p < 0.05) reductions in every psychopathologic domain of the CGI-BPD and in the total scores of all scales in both groups.\nBoth protocols produced global improvement in severity and symptoms of BPD, particularly in impulsiveness, affective instability, and anger. Further studies are warranted to explore the therapeutic effect of rTMS in BPD.\nNCT02273674"}, {"Title": "The association of cannabis use on inpatient psychiatric hospital outcomes.", "Abstract": "The associations between cannabis use and psychosis are well documented in numerous studies. There is a need to evaluate the impact of cannabis use on inpatient psychiatric utilization and outcomes.\nTo evaluate the impact of cannabis use on psychiatric hospital outcomes.\nThis study was conducted between April 20, 2015 and October 20, 2015. All patients (n = 120) admitted to Denver Health with psychotic symptoms were administered a urine toxicology screening testing for the presence of 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u0394<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH, the active metabolite of cannabis). Patients with positive tests were compared to those with negative tests on several measures, including length of stay, presence or lack of 30-day readmission, Brief Psychotic Rating Scale (BPRS) score, and use of antipsychotics and/or sedatives/anxiolytics.\nThere were 120 patients. Twenty nine were women and 91 were men. Patients testing positive for THC-COOH had a shorter length of stay compared to patients testing negative for THC-COOH, after adjusting for age, prior psychiatric admissions, history of a psychotic-spectrum disorder, and comorbid additional substance use (p = 0.02). There were no differences in 30-day readmissions, 30-day post-discharge presentation to the Denver Health psychiatric emergency department, BPRS scores, and medication administration.\nPatients presenting with psychotic symptoms and cannabis use require shorter inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations. This study is the first to quantify this observation and highlights the need for future clinical decision-making tools that would ideally correlate cannabis use with the degree of potential need for expensive and scarce mental health resources, such as psychiatric hospitalization."}, {"Title": "[Transitional psychiatry in the Netherlands: experiences and views of mental health professionals].", "Abstract": "Psychopathology manifests itself primarily in late adolescence and continues into adulthood. Continuity of care is essential during this phase of life. The current care service distinguishes between child/adolescent (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS). The separation of services can interfere with the continuity of care.<br/> AIM: To map professionals' experiences of and views on the transition and associated problems that young people can experience as they are transferred from CAMHS to AMHS.<br/> METHOD: We distributed an online questionnaire among professionals providing mental health care to young people (aged 15-25) with psychiatric problems.<br/> RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 518 professionals. Decisions relating to transition were generally based on the professional's own deliberations. The preparation consisted mainly of discussing changes with the adolescent and his or her parents. The majority of transition-related problems were experienced in CAMHS, particularly with regard to collaboration with AMHS. Respondents were of the opinion that the developmental age ought to be the determining factor in the decision-making process with regard to transition and they considered it important that developmentally appropriate services should be available in order to bridge the gap.<br/> CONCLUSION: Professionals in CAMHS and AMHS are encountering problems in preparing the transitional phase and in organising the required structural collaboration between the two separate services. The problems relate mainly to coordination, communication and rules and regulations. Professionals are keen to improve the situation and want to see greater flexibility. In their view, there should be a wider range of specialised facilities for young people, enabling them to benefit from transitional psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The Tragic Tale of a Father and Son: an Unusual Patricide.", "Abstract": "Parricide is a category of homicide in which the victims are the parents, and the killers, their children.

This last decade has witnessed an exponential growth in delirium research in hospitalized patients, including those critically ill, and this research has highlighted that delirium needs to be better understood mechanistically to help foster research that will ultimately lead to its prevention and treatment. In this invited, evidence-based paper, a multinational and interprofessional group of clinicians and researchers from within the fields of critical care medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, anesthesiology, geriatrics, surgery, neurology, nursing, pharmacy, and the neurosciences sought to address five questions: (1) What is the current standard of care in managing ICU delirium? (2) What have been the major recent advances in delirium research and care? (3) What are the common delirium beliefs that have been challenged by recent trials? (4) What are the remaining areas of uncertainty in delirium research? (5) What are some of the top study areas/trials to be done in the next 10\u00a0years?

To evaluate excitatory plasticity, we compared mean motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after PAS at 0, 15, and 30\u2009min. To evaluate inhibitory plasticity, we evaluated the cortical silent period (CSP) elicited by single-pulse TMS in the contracted hand before and after PAS at 0, 15, and 30\u2009min.\nAll participants completed PAS procedures. No adverse events occurred. PAS was well tolerated. PAS-induced significant increases in the ratio of post-PAS MEP to pre-PAS MEP amplitudes (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) at all post-PAS intervals. Neither socioeconomic status nor sex was associated with post-PAS MEP changes. PAS induced significant CSP lengthening in males but not females.\nPAS is a feasible, safe, and well-tolerated index of adolescent motor cortical plasticity. Gender may influence PAS-induced changes in cortical inhibition. PAS is safe and well tolerated by healthy adolescents and may be a novel tool with which to study adolescent neuroplasticity."}, {"Title": "Genetic tests in major psychiatric disorders-integrating molecular medicine with clinical psychiatry-why is it so difficult?", "Abstract": "With the advent of post-genomic era, new technologies create extraordinary possibilities for diagnostics and personalized therapy, transforming todays' medicine. Rooted in both medical genetics and clinical psychiatry, the paper is designed as an integrated source of information of the current and potential future application of emerging genomic technologies as diagnostic tools in psychiatry, moving beyond the classical concept of patient approach. Selected approaches are presented, starting from currently used technologies (next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarrays), followed by newer options (reverse phenotyping). Next, we describe an old concept in a new light (endophenotypes), subsequently coming up with a sophisticated and complex approach (gene networks) ending by a nascent field (computational psychiatry). The challenges and barriers that exist to translate genomic research to real-world patient assessment are further discussed. We emphasize the view that only a paradigm shift can bring a fundamental change in psychiatric practice, allowing to disentangle the intricacies of mental diseases. All the diagnostic methods, as described, are directed at uncovering the integrity of the system including many types of relations within a complex structure. The integrative system approach offers new opportunity to connect genetic background with specific diseases entities, or concurrently, with symptoms regardless of a diagnosis.

Medical students who were concomitantly in a clinical posting in wards of psychiatry or neurology were invited to participate in the study. The medical student version of the scale Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) was used to measure their attitudes towards psychiatry and persons with psychiatric disorder. This 16-item scale is designed to measure attitudes of health care professionals towards people with mental illness, a higher score indicating more stigmatizing attitudes. Items exploring history of psychiatric disorders in close persons were added at the end of the MICA scale. The questionnaire was completed twice by each student, at the beginning and the end of the 11-week clinical posting. All questionnaires were strictly anonymized. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify the variables independently associated with MICA total score.\nAt the beginning of the education program and clinical posting, 174 students completed the MICA scale: the mean MICA total score was equal to 46.4 (SD 6.9) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=72) and 45.1 (SD 7.01) in those in neurology (n=102). At the end of the academic and clinical training, 138 students again completed the questionnaire, with mean MICA total scores equal to 41.4 (SD 8.1) in students in clinical posting in psychiatry (n=51) and 43.5 (SD 7.3) in those in neurology (n=87). Multivariate analyses showed that lower total MICA scores were independently associated with the time of assessment (lower scores at the end of education program and clinical posting) (b=-2.8; P=0.001), female gender (b=-1.8; P=0.03) and history of a psychiatric disorder in a close person (b=-1.92; P=0.02). Type of clinical posting (psychiatry vs. neurology) was not independently associated with MICA total scores (b=-0.02; P=0.98). A significant interaction was found between the variables \"time of assessment\" and \"type of clinical posting\" (P=0.05): stratified analyses showed that MICA total scores decreased significantly only when the clinical posting was in psychiatry (b=-4.66; P=0.001), with no significant change in medical students in neurology wards (b=-1.45; P=0.16).\nStigmatizing attitudes of medical students towards psychiatry and psychiatric disorders are reduced by an education program in psychiatry, with a positive impact more marked when the education program is concomitant to a clinical posting in psychiatry. As future health professionals in charge of persons with psychiatric disorders, medical students are key targets of actions aimed at reducing stigma towards mental health disorders. It is hence of great importance to promote clinical training in psychiatric wards during medical studies for all future practitioners, irrespective of their future specialty."}, {"Title": "The Evolving Practice of Psychiatry in the Era of Integrated Care.", "Abstract": "Integrating behavioral health care into the primary care setting is increasingly recognized as an effective way to manage mental illness and substance use disorders on a population level in the United States.

Accumulating knowledge suggests that neurovirulent strains of the ZIKV have evolved from less pathogenic lineages of the virus. Nevertheless, mechanisms of neurovirulence and host-pathogen neuro-immune interactions remain incompletely elucidated. This review provides a critical discussion of genetic and structural alterations in the ZIKV which could have contributed to the emergence of neurovirulent strains. In addition, a mechanistic framework of neuro-immune mechanisms related to the emergence of neuropathology after ZIKV infection is discussed.

The portrait of a positivist scientist.", "Abstract": "Giuseppe Sergi (1841-1936) was one of the most important anthropologists and psychologists of the age of positivism and this article focuses on three domains of his scientific research: degeneration, eugenics and race. His concept of degeneration is defined as the development of special forms of human adaptation to the environment. This issue is closely related to his theory of the \"stratification of character\", which had a profound impact on Italian psychiatry and criminal anthropology in the late nineteenth century. Thus, special emphasis is placed on the differences between Sergi and Cesare Lombroso regarding their definitions of criminality and genius. Concerning eugenics, the article analyzes Sergi's key role in the Italian context, discussing his eugenic program based on both repression and education. His remedies against the spread of degeneration included not only radical and repressive measures, but also the improvement of popular education and the living conditions of the working class. In the field of physical anthropology, the article examines Sergi's morphological method of classifying ethnic groups. Although sharply criticized in Italy and abroad, this method had two major effects. First, it led to the definitive split between Sergi and Paolo Mantegazza and to the foundation of the Societ\u00e1 Romana di Antropologia in 1893. Second, it was the starting point for Sergi's theory of Mediterranean \"stock\", which claimed that European populations were of African origin in contrast to contemporary theories of Aryan supremacy.

Current treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated modest success in addressing perinatal psychiatric symptoms; however, additional treatment options are needed to address the limitations of current approaches, particularly for women experiencing moderate to severe perinatal mental illness during pregnancy or postpartum. We discuss the use of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) as a promising treatment approach that may be uniquely suited for perinatal women due to its emphasis of values, mindfulness, and acceptance; these psychological constructs notably address the significant psychiatric and behavioral health condition comorbidity, somatic symptoms, and stigma associated with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. In addition, we describe the development of a four-session ACT-based group intervention at the Perinatal Psychiatry Inpatient Unit at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

However, their diagnosis is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers; current detection is based on structured clinical interviews which can be biased by the patient's recall ability, affective state, changing in temporal frames, etc. While digital platforms have been introduced as a possible solution to this complex problem, there is little evidence on the extent of usability and usefulness of these platforms. Therefore, more studies where digital data is collected in larger scales are needed to collect scientific evidence on the capacities of these platforms. Most of the existing platforms for digital psychiatry studies are designed as monolithic systems for a certain type of study; publications from these studies focus on their results, rather than the design features of the data collection platform. Inevitably, more tools and platforms will emerge in the near future to fulfill the need for digital data collection for psychiatry. Currently little knowledge is available from existing digital platforms for future data collection platforms to build upon.\nThe objective of this work was to identify the most important features for designing a digital platform for data collection for mental health studies, and to demonstrate a prototype platform that we built based on these design features.\nWe worked closely in a multidisciplinary collaboration with psychiatrists, software developers, and data scientists and identified the key features which could guarantee short-term and long-term stability and usefulness of the platform from the designing stage to data collection and analysis of collected data.\nThe key design features that we identified were flexibility of access control, flexibility of data sources, and first-order privacy protection. We also designed the prototype platform Non-Intrusive Individual Monitoring Architecture (Niima), where we implemented these key design features. We described why each of these features are important for digital data collection for psychiatry, gave examples of projects where Niima was used or is going to be used in the future, and demonstrated how incorporating these design principles opens new possibilities for studies.\nThe new methods of digital psychiatry are still immature and need further research.

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01119014.\nBetween June 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2014, 231 participants were assessed for elegibility, of whom 113 were randomly assigned to quetiapine-ER (n=55) or aripiprazole (n=58). PANSS positive score did not differ between groups after 12 weeks (adjusted mean change -5\u00b705 [5\u00b746] for quetiapine-ER, -6\u00b721 [5\u00b742] for aripiprazole; p=0\u00b798), but decreased over time in both groups (p<0\u00b70001). Weight gain was more rapid with quetiapine-ER (p=0\u00b70008), with an adjusted mean weight group difference at week 12 of 3\u00b733 kg (SD 7\u00b723; effect size 0\u00b764; p<0\u00b70001). The HOMA-IR group difference at week 12 favoured aripiprazole (adjusted mean log-transformed group difference 0\u00b7259 [SD 0\u00b7906]; effect size 0\u00b735; p=0\u00b70060). Akathisia was more common with aripiprazole at week 2 (observed in 34 [60%] of 57 patients; estimated 63\u00b75%) than with quetiapine-ER (15 [30%] of 50; estimated 31\u00b73%; p=0\u00b70021), but not at other timepoints. Sedation proportions did not change significantly over time with either intervention (observed at weeks 2, 4, and 12, respectively, for quetiapine-ER in 43 [83%] of 52, 40 [83%] of 48, and 34 [72%] of 47 patients and for aripiprazole in 49 [89%] of 55, 52 [96%] of 54, and 44 [92%] of 48 patients), and the overall estimated probability combining all timepoints was significantly higher for aripiprazole (97\u00b71%) than for quetiapine-ER (89\u00b72%; p=0\u00b7012). In addition to sedation and akathisia, the most common adverse events were tremor (42 [79%] patients in the quetiapine-ER group vs 52 [91%] patients in the aripiprazole group), increased duration of sleep (47 [92%] vs 39 [71%]), orthostatic dizziness (42 [78%] vs 46 [81%]), depression (43 [80%] vs 44 [77%]), tension/inner unrest (37 [69%] vs 50 [88%]), failing memory (41 [76%] vs 44 [77%]), and weight gain (46 [87%] vs 38 [68%]).\nThis first head-to-head comparison of quetiapine-ER versus aripiprazole in early-onset psychosis showed no significant group differences in severity of psychopathology after 12 weeks of treatment. Quetiapine-ER was associated with more metabolic adverse events and aripiprazole with more initial akathisia and, unexpectedly, more sedation. The limited antipsychotic efficacy and high level of adverse events were noticeable. This trial provides novel information for the treatment of early-onset psychosis and highlights the importance of adverse event profiles when choosing among antipsychotics for children and adolescents who often require chronic treatment.\nThe National Research Council for Health and Disease Foundation for Health Promotion, AP M\u00f8ller Foundation, Rosalie Petersens Foundation, Stevn and Rindom Foundation, Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Science, The Capital Region Psychiatric Research Foundation, Tryg Foundation, Region of Southern Denmark Research Foundation, Danish Psychiatric Research Educational Fund, Psychiatry Foundation, Foundation of 17-12-1981, Psychiatric Research Foundation Region Zealand, Capital Region Strategic Research Foundation, Knud og Dagny Andresens Foundation, Psychiatric Research Foundation of 1967, The Capital Region Research Foundation, Dr Sofus Carl Emil Friis and Hustru Olga Friis Scholarship, T\u00f8mrerhandler Johannes Fogs Foundation, Brdr Hartmanns Foundation DKK, Aase and Ejnar Danielsens Foundation, Jacob Madsen and wife Olga Madsens Foundation, CC Klestrup and wife Scholarship, Lundbeck Foundation Scholarship, and T\u00f8mrermester J\u00f8rgen Holm and wife Elisas Scholarship."}, {"Title": "Model-Based Control in Dimensional Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "We use parallel interacting goal-directed and habitual strategies to make our daily decisions. The arbitration between these strategies is relevant to inflexible repetitive behaviors in psychiatric disorders. Goal-directed control, also known as model-based control, is based on an affective outcome relying on a learned internal model to prospectively make decisions. In contrast, habit control, also known as model-free control, is based on an integration of previous reinforced learning autonomous of the current outcome value and is implicit and more efficient but at the cost of greater inflexibility. The concept of model-based control can be further extended into pavlovian processes. Here we describe and compare tasks that tap into these constructs and emphasize the clinical relevance and translation of these tasks in psychiatric disorders. Together, these findings highlight a role for model-based control as a transdiagnostic impairment underlying compulsive behaviors and representing a promising therapeutic target."}, {"Title": "[Web TV, a tool favouring collaboration for quality care].", "Abstract": "The Web TV of the EPSM Lille-M\u00e9tropole is an innovative communication tool in mental health.

General practitioners (GPs) are the first point of contact for patients with HF. Therefore, this study aims to investigate GPs' awareness of depression in their HF patients and factors associated with this awareness.\nIn this cross-sectional, observational study 3224 primary care patients with HF were screened for depressive symptomatology using an algorithm based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 9-item subscale on Depression of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and selected items from the PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scales. The 272 GPs of all patients involved in the study were interviewed by telephone regarding their patients' somatic and psychological comorbidities. The awareness rates of depressive symptomatology by the patients' GPs are analyzed using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression analyses are applied to investigate the patient- and GP-based factors associated with the GPs' awareness of depressive symptomatology.\nGPs were aware of their patients' depressive symptomatology in 35% of all cases. Factors associated with the awareness of depressive symptomatology were: higher patient education levels, a history of depression known to the GP, GP-consultations due to emotional distress within the last 6\u00a0months, a higher frequency of GP-contacts within the last 6\u00a0months, a higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and more severe depressive symptomatology. The GPs' characteristics, including further education in psychology/psychiatry, were not associated with GP awareness.\nMany aspects, including the definition of awareness and the practical issues in primary care, may contribute to the unexpectedly low awareness rates of depressive symptomatology in HF patients in primary care. Awareness rates might increase, if GPs encouraged their patients to talk about emotional distress, held detailed medical interviews including a patient's history of depression and payed special attention to HF patients with low education levels. However, it remains to be investigated whether GPs' judgement of depressive symptomatology is a better or worse indicator for the future prognosis and quality of life of HF patients than psychiatry based diagnostic criteria."}, {"Title": "Foundation year one training in neurosurgery: achieving competency a 5-year review.", "Abstract": "F1 doctors are a rare breed in Neurosurgery, featuring in only 4 out of 40 UK centres. It is widely perceived that Neurosurgery would only provide a highly specialised experience for F1s, limiting the opportunity to achieve the core practical and clinical competencies as highlighted by the United Kingdom Foundation Programme (UKFPO). Additionally, Health Education England have increased the number of community placements such as General Practice and Psychiatry further limiting F1 placements offered in specialities like Neurosurgery.\nWe sought to acquire the views, experiences and true perspectives of training from F1 doctors in our neurosurgery centre. Importantly, we wanted to determine whether Neurosurgery provides sufficient opportunities to achieve mandatory core foundation competencies.\nWe invited all F1s (27) to complete a secure-web based online questionnaire comprising nine domains of training. Responses: We had an overall response rate of 96%. Ninety-six per cent of our F1s valued this placement, gaining skills that could be transferred to other specialities. Eighty-eight per cent found the post to be of similar or greater value in comparison to their other F1 posts and 66% would recommend this post to others. Ninety-two per cent of F1s felt they were adequately supervised and regular informal feedback was offered in order to ensure acquisition of core competences. Fourty-four per cent of F1s were involved in post-graduate academia. All trainees attended their mandatory F1 teaching although attendance to additional departmental teaching was limited.\nTrainees found that Neurosurgery provided a generalised exposure not a specialised one. Ninety-two per cent felt Neurosurgery had provided sufficient educational opportunities to achieve their required competencies. Importantly, all trainees managed to achieve their core generic competencies. F1 placements in Neurosurgery are highly beneficial to both trainee and service.

Each reviewer identified each DMC evaluation request as \"warranted\" vs \"unwarranted.\" Unwarranted DMC evaluation requests were defined as those lacking explicit suspicion that the patient might lack DMC or those with explicit evidence of a patient with blatantly impaired DMC. We hypothesized that most (over half) DMC evaluation requests would be deemed unwarranted. Descriptive statistics, chi-square/Fisher exact tests, and t-test/ANOVA were used.\nA total of 146 DMC evaluations were reviewed, and 83 (56.8%) of these were deemed unwarranted. Of these, most were likely driven by a previous neuropsychiatric disturbance (p < 0.001).

The structured, self-administered questionnaires which were hand-delivered covered demographic characteristics of responders, career choices, preferred location of specialisation and factors that influenced the choices.\nOf the 143 medical students approached, 116 (81.0%) returned completed questionnaires. Of the responders, 102 (87.9%) intend to pursue postgraduate specialisation against 2 (1.7%) who declined; 12 (10.3%) were undecided.

The participants were more open-minded in their reasoning than in what they were doing. They understood gendering to be a result of traditions, role models from childhood, ideas about typically male and female innate capacities, lack of knowledge and low self-confidence. Doing seemed to reproduce gender, but being in a group of the same sex could shape unity and a relaxed atmosphere.\nThe findings could be understood as a set of gender frames, which might prevent either of the sexes from developing their full potentials and transgress into e.g. the employment market.

The inverse relationship between self-compassion and burnout remained significant even after accounting for depressive symptoms and demographic variables in a multiple linear regression model. Of all the variables examined, self-compassion was the strongest predictor of burnout.\nThe results of this study support the hypothesis that self-compassion may be associated with resilience to burnout. Alternatively, decreased self-compassion may be a downstream effect of increased burnout. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to determine the directional relationship between these factors, and whether interventions that cultivate self-compassion may decrease burnout and/or protect against its negative personal and professional outcomes."}, {"Title": "Why We Need to Enhance Suicide Postvention: Evaluating a Survey of Psychiatrists' Behaviors after the Suicide of a Patient.", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention efforts are increasing to enhance capabilities and better understand risk factors and etiologies.

In the mid-twentieth century they were a focus within psychiatry as both probes of brain function and experimental therapeutics. By the late 1960s and early 1970s these scientific inquires fell out of favor because classic psychedelics were being used outside of medical research and in association with the emerging counter culture. However, in the twenty-first century, scientific interest in classic psychedelics has returned and grown as a result of several promising studies, validating earlier research. Here, we review therapeutic research on psilocybin, the classic psychedelic that has been the focus of most recent research. For mood and anxiety disorders, three controlled trials have suggested that psilocybin may decrease symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychiatric distress for at least 6 months following a single acute administration. A small, open-label study in patients with treatment-resistant depression showed reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms 3 months after two acute doses. For addiction, small, open-label pilot studies have shown promising success rates for both tobacco and alcohol addiction. Safety data from these various trials, which involve careful screening, preparation, monitoring, and follow-up, indicate the absence of severe drug-related adverse reactions. Modest drug-related adverse effects at the time of medication administration are readily managed.

Sequential change of the values were compared against baseline respectively. <b>Results:</b> Subjective sleep quality scores were significantly decreased at Weeks 2 and 4, and sleep duration, habitual sleep efficacy, and global scores were significantly decreased at Week 4 from baseline. Total scores on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 significantly decreased at Week 4 from baseline. The levels of cortisol and white blood cell count were decreased, significantly at Week 8, and the levels of pulse rate were significantly decreased at Week 4 from baseline. The levels of noradrenaline decreased, although not significantly. The prolactin levels remained unchanged, and no trend was found in the insulin levels. <b>Conclusion:</b> Suvorexant treatment resulted in overall improvement in the quality of sleep and the severity of anxiety and depression. This dual orexin antagonist may be related to autonomic functions and neuroendocrine systems, especially in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in psychiatric subjects."}, {"Title": "An analysis of whether a working-age ward-based liaison psychiatry service requires the input of a liaison psychiatrist.", "Abstract": "<b>Aims and method</b> This article presents a 12-month case series to determine the fraction of ward referrals of adults of working age who needed a liaison psychiatrist in a busy tertiary referral teaching hospital. <b>Results</b> The service received 344 referrals resulting in 1259 face-to-face contacts. Depression accounted for the most face-to-face contacts. We deemed the involvement of a liaison psychiatrist necessary in 241 (70.1%) referrals, with medication management as the most common reason. <b>Clinical implications</b> A substantial amount of liaison ward work involves the treatment and management of severe and complex mental health problems. Our analysis suggests that in the majority of cases the input of a liaison psychiatrist is required."}, {"Title": "Anaesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy: An overview with an update on its role in potentiating electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "Despite advances in pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains a mainstay treatment option in psychiatry since its introduction in 1930s. It can be used primarily in severe illnesses when there is an urgent need for treatment or secondarily after failure or intolerance to pharmacotherapy. The 'unmodified' technique of ECT was practised initially, with a high incidence of musculoskeletal complications. Several modifications including general anaesthesia and muscle relaxation are used to increase the safety and patient acceptability of ECT. Various anaesthetic techniques including medications are considered to provide adequate therapeutic seizure, simultaneously controlling seizure-induced haemodynamic changes and side effects. A brief review of literature on choice of these anaesthetic techniques is discussed. This article is intended to reinforce the knowledge of clinicians, who may have limited exposure to ECT procedure. Importance is given to the recent updates on the role of induction agents in potentiating therapeutic response to ECT in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Modafinil in schizophrenia: is the risk worth taking?", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterised by positive and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are difficult to treat and there is no specific treatment. In small trials, modafinil has been studied in association with antipsychotic treatment.

Further studies are needed to assess its usefulness in schizophrenia and safety in this group of patients."}, {"Title": "Clinical significance of psychotic-like experiences in children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are subtle, subclinical hallucinations and delusions which are quite common in general population. In children and youth prevalence rate is probably age-dependent with higher rate in younger population. PLEs are suggested to be a form of extended psychosis phenotype. Similar demographic, genetic and environmental risk factors observed for PLEs and schizophrenia support this hypothesis. Other mental health problems associated with PLEs include depression, suicidality, low functioning and psychiatric comorbidity. PLEs may be a risk factor for psychosis, but probably only for a minor subgroup of population. It is possible however, that PLEs are a risk factor for different psychiatric disorders. In the majority of children and adolescents PLEs disappear over time. PLEs are supposed to be a heterogenic phenomenon with different subtypes: associated with psychosis risk, associated with other psychiatric disorders and being within the normal range of experiences. Due to lack of widely acknowledged PLEs definition and because of substantial diversity of research methodology interpretation of the previous research should be made with caution."}, {"Title": "Gastrointestinal complications and refeeding guidelines in patients with anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the third most common disorder, after obesity and asthma, in the population of adolescents between 13-18 years of age. Food intake reduction is associated with whole body dysfunction, affecting its physical, psychological and social spheres. As a result of starvation, dysfunction develops in virtually all systems and organs. However, most frequently patients with AN complain of digestive symptoms, such as a feeling of fullness after meals, pain in the upper abdomen, dysphagia, nausea, bloating and constipation. They can have mild functional character, but may also reflect serious complications, including diseases requiring urgent surgical intervention. In addition, gastric complaints may hinder nutritional management of AN. Care of AN patients requires cooperation of many specialists in the field of psychiatry, psychology, paediatrics, internal medicine and nutrition. However, it is often difficult to organize such a team. Therefore, we decided to approach the issues of gastrointestinal symptoms and complications in the course of AN, and the rules of nutritional therapy."}, {"Title": "Genetics and pharmacogenetics of mood disorders.", "Abstract": "Genetic research in Psychiatry is viewed by clinicians with both hope and curiosity sometimes mixed with disillusionment. Indeed, in the last 30 years many results have not been confirmed and clinical applications are still missing. However recent findings suggest that we are at the beginning of a new era. A set of variants within neuroplasticity and inflammation genes have been identified as a valid basis for both bipolar disorder and major depression. Similarly, a set of genes has been identified as a liability factor for response and tolerability to antidepressants and the first clinical applications are already in the market. However, some caution should be applied until definite findings are available."}, {"Title": "Effects of Mental Health Support on the Grief of Bereaved People Caused by Sewol Ferry Accident.", "Abstract": "Few studies have assessed the overall effects of multi-centered, complicated mental health support on the grief process. This study investigated the broader influence of mental health support provided practically to the bereaved family on the severity of complicated grief. Ninety-three bereaved family members of the Sewol ferry accident were recruited. Severity of complicated grief, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive disorder was assessed through self-reporting questionnaire, inventory of complicated grief (ICG), PTSD Check List-5 (PCL-5) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We also included demographic, socioeconomic, health-related variables, and Functional Social Support Questionnaire (FSSQ), which affect the ICG score. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on the experience of psychotherapy or psychiatry clinic service before the accident and mental health support after the disaster. In univariate analysis, these 4 groups showed a significant difference in the mean ICG score (P = 0.020). Participants who received mental health support only after the Sewol ferry accident (group 2) showed a lower mean ICG score than those who received neither psychotherapy or psychiatry clinic service before the disaster nor mental health support after the accident (group 4). There was no significant correlation between the ICG score and other variables except for subjective health status measured 1 month after the disaster (P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in PCL-5 (P = 0.140) and PHQ-9 scores (P = 0.603) among groups, respectively. In conclusion, mental health support significantly reduced the severity of grief only in those participants who had not received any psychotherapy or psychiatry clinic service before the accident."}, {"Title": "Prepartum Psychosis and Neonaticide: Rare Case Study and Forensic-Psychiatric Synthesis of Literature.", "Abstract": "Peripartum psychosis is a rare but serious psychiatric disorder characterized by the presence of a mood episode with psychotic features. Although controversy surrounds the nosological status of peripartum mental disorders, these conditions continue to be of exceptional interest to the medical and forensic mental health communities. The aim of this study was to report a rare case of prepartum psychosis which escalated to the endpoint of neonaticide and summarize literature on peripartum mental disorders and infanticide. A 30-year-old mother murdered her newborn with the spike of her serum delivery system and planned to commit suicide while in hospital after hallucinating due to an acute puerperal psychotic disorder with a prepartum onset and postpartum deterioration. Her disorder was not managed until neonaticide.

His classification of the different types of epilepsy based on clinical symptoms is still relevant today and made him a precursor of contemporary epileptology. In 1851, Delasiauve clinically and etiologically isolated 'acute mental confusion' (acute confusional state) from all other forms of dementia. Never deviating from his republican and progressive ideals, he devoted himself throughout the 19th century to treating those insane asylum patients who received the poorest care: epileptics and children with intellectual disabilities. Studying functional cognitive disability as well as mental disability secondary to congenital malformations, Delasiauve developed a novel specific form of pedagogy to deal with delays in cognitive development. This made him one of the initiators of institutional pediatric psychiatry. His ideas would be carried forward by his favorite student, D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Magloire Bourneville (1840-1909). Committed to social welfare, Delasiauve worked relentlessly to improve access to healthcare for the least fortunate throughout France.

Impairment of the PPI has been reported in several psychiatric disorders, but particularly in schizophrenia, where PPI is considered to be a candidate endophenotype of the disorder. Although the profiles of the ASR differ between races, recent studies of single ethnicity samples in Asia were in accord with a number of studies from Western countries, in reporting that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired PPI. The PPI of the ASR is known to develop before 8years of age, and PPI impairment has only been reported in adults (not children) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involves atypical features that are present from early development. Recent Asian studies of children with ASD suggest that comprehensive investigation of the ASR and its modulation, including the startle response to weak startle stimuli, peak startle latency, and PPI, may contribute to an understanding of the impairment of the neural circuitry in children with ASD and its comorbid behavioral problems. In this review, we review recent findings on the ASR and its modulation from Asian countries, and discuss its potential use for studying sensorimotor gating and its relationship to schizophrenia and ASD. In conclusion, the ASR and its modulation can provide a well-established global neurophysiological index for translational research in psychiatric disorders. Future studies investigating the development of sensorimotor gating in early development may contribute to prevention of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic combinations in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In the treatment of resistant schizophrenia, a number of meta-analyses attempted to quantify the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic (AP) polypharmacy v. monotherapy with contradictory results. Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigated the efficacy and tolerability of AP combination v. monotherapy in schizophrenia. It included 31 studies: 21 double-blind (considered high-quality studies) and 10 open-label (considered low-quality studies). The meta-analysis showed that, overall, the combination of two APs was more effective than monotherapy in terms of symptom reduction (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.87 to -0.19); however, this result was confirmed only in the subgroup of low-quality studies. Negative symptoms improved when combining a D2 antagonist with a D2 partial agonist (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.03) both in double-blind and open-label studies. In the present commentary, the results of this systematic review are critically discussed in terms of their clinical and research implications."}, {"Title": "Application of network methods for understanding mental disorders: pitfalls and promise.", "Abstract": "Galvanized with the availability of sophisticated statistical techniques and large datasets, network medicine has emerged as an active area of investigation. Following this trend, network methods have been utilized to understand the interplay between symptoms of mental disorders. This realistic approach that may provide an improved framework into understanding mental conditions and underlying mechanisms is certainly to be welcomed. However, we have noticed that symptom network studies tend to lose sight of the fundamentals, overlook major limitations embedded in study designs, and make inferences that are difficult to justify with current findings. There is concern that disregarding these flaws may halt the progress of the network approach in psychiatry. Therefore, in this paper, we first attempt to identify the pitfalls: (1) a reductionist understanding of medicine and psychiatry, thereby inadvertently reintroducing the dichotomy of medicine (lung cancer) and psychiatry (depression), (2) a shortsighted view of signs and symptoms, (3) overlooking the limitations of available datasets based on scales with embedded latent class structures, (4) overestimating the importance of the current findings beyond what is supported by the study design. By addressing current issues, the hope is to navigate this rapidly growing field to a more methodologically sound and reproducible path that will contribute to our understanding of mental disorders and its underlying mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Learning environment of the Saudi psychiatry board training program.", "Abstract": "To assess the learning environment of the Saudi psychiatry board program using the Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test (D-RECT) and to explore residents' perception of different domains of the learning environment.\u00a0Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. The D-RECT instrument was distributed to all residents at all training sites of the Saudi psychiatry training program.

Different approaches to the implementation of PBL between programs represented at the SISG are compared in this report.\nThe authors distributed a survey to SISG participants after the 2015 annual AACAP meeting, which gathered information about the different approaches programs use to implement PBL in graduate medical education.\nSix CAP training programs responded to the survey, providing descriptions of the structure and content of PBL seminars. Programs chose to include a wide variety of topics in PBL courses and approach course organization in a number of ways. To the degree that PBL draws from identified reference texts, programs were similar in selecting definitive textbooks, practice parameters, and seminal articles.\nThis small pilot study is intended to provide a snapshot of the state of PBL implementation in CAP fellowship programs. It reflects that programs can incorporate PBL in a variety of ways, tailored to the needs of the institution. Future directions of research include assessment of resident satisfaction with PBL, impact on resident education, and identifying successful methods of implementation of PBL."}, {"Title": "The Psychiatry Major: A Curricular Innovation to Improve Undergraduate Psychiatry Education in China.", "Abstract": "In China, a psychiatry major curriculum (PMC) has been implemented in select medical schools to improve the quality of undergraduate psychiatry education (UPE).

We also benchmarked PMC to UPE programs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China and the United States of America (USA) to determine how well it met standards of well-established programs and to highlight areas for improvement.\nBased on archival information, relevant literature, and communication with key informants, we described PMC and CMC in a Chinese school with both curriculums. We then compared PMC to UPE curriculums in Hong Kong and the USA.\nPMC provides substantially more comprehensive exposure to psychiatry than CMC, with more preclinical experiences and psychiatry clerkship course hours, greater diversity of clinical sites, and exploration of subspecialties. PMC employs a variety of teaching methods and offers mentoring for students. PMC has similar UPE preclinical content and course hours as programs in Hong Kong and the USA. PMC also provides more clinical exposure than programs in Hong Kong or the USA, although there is less variety in clinical settings.\nWe recommend implementation of concrete measures to improve UPE in Chinese medical schools, using the PMC curriculum as a model that has been successfully implemented in China.

I challenge the construction of psychiatry as only treating the individual patient and provide grounded doctor-patient-family member interaction in a Mexican psychiatric clinic in order to review what happens when doctors cannot interact with patients as atomized individuals even though in theory they are trained to think of patients that way. Challenged by severe structural constraints and bolstered by lessons from other nations' efforts at deinstitutionalization, psychiatrists in Puebla push to keep patients out of the inpatient wards and in their respective communities. To this end, psychiatrists call upon co-present kin who are identified both as the customer and part of the caretaking system outside the clinic. This modification to the visit structure changes the dynamic and content of clinical visits while doctors seamlessly respond to unspoken beliefs and values that are central to local life, ultimately showing that efforts to define a \"global psychiatry\" informed by global policy will fail because it cannot exist in a uniform way-interpersonal interaction and personal experience matters."}, {"Title": "Do not treat the numbers: lithium toxicity.", "Abstract": "We describe the case of a 62-year-old man with a history of bipolar disorder, previously stable on lithium for over 20 years, who presented with a manic relapse and signs of lithium toxicity in the form of a coarse tremor.

The natural language processing techniques focused on (a) discerning the discourse information expressed in questions and answers; (b) identifying medical concepts that relate to mental disorders; and (c) accounting for the role of negation. The machine learning techniques rely on the assumptions that (1) the severity of a patient's positive valence symptoms exists on a latent continuous spectrum and (2) all the patient's answers and narratives documented in the psychological evaluation records are informed by the patient's latent severity score along this spectrum. These assumptions motivated our two-step machine learning framework for automatically recognizing psychological symptom severity. In the first step, the latent continuous severity score is inferred from each record; in the second step, the severity score is mapped to one of the four discrete severity levels used in the CEGS/N-GRID challenge. We evaluated three methods for inferring the latent severity score associated with each record: (i) pointwise ridge regression; (ii) pairwise comparison-based classification; and (iii) a hybrid approach combining pointwise regression and the pairwise classifier. The second step was implemented using a tree of cascading support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. While the official evaluation results indicate that all three methods are promising, the hybrid approach not only outperformed the pairwise and pointwise methods, but also produced the second highest performance of all submissions to the CEGS/N-GRID challenge with a normalized MAE score of 84.093% (where higher numbers indicate better performance). These evaluation results enabled us to observe that, for this task, considering pairwise information can produce more accurate severity scores than pointwise regression - an approach widely used in other systems for assigning severity scores. Moreover, our analysis indicates that using a cascading SVM tree outperforms traditional SVM classification methods for the purpose of determining discrete severity levels."}, {"Title": "A review of the role of serotonin system genes in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder that causes the patient to experience intrusive thoughts and/or to carry out repetitive, ritualized behaviors that are time consuming and impairing. OCD is familial and heritable. The genetic factors responsible for pathogenesis, however, remain largely unknown despite the numerous candidate gene studies conducted. Based on efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in treating OCD, serotonin system genes have been a dominant focus in OCD candidate gene studies. We review the most commonly studied candidate serotonin system gene variants (specifically in SLC6A4, HTR2A, HTR1B, and HTR2C) and their association with OCD. Although findings to date are mixed, serotonin transporter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR and HTR2A polymorphism rs6311 (or rs6313) are most consistently associated with OCD. Mixed findings may be the result of genetic complexity and phenotypic heterogeneity that future studies should account for. Homogenous patient subgroups reflecting OCD symptom dimensions, OCD subtypes, and sex should be used for gene discovery."}, {"Title": "HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRY IN GEORGIA: HIDDEN PAGES (DEDICATED TO OUR TEACHERS).", "Abstract": "Psychiatry preserves a special place among the diverse medical specialties.

There is a high risk of mood disorders among the first-degree relatives of patients with BD. In the current clinical practice, the diagnosis of BD is made by history taking, interview and behavioural observations, thereby lacking an objective, biological validation. This approach may result in underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis and eventually poorer outcomes. Due to the heterogeneity of BD, the possibility of developing a single, specific biomarker is still remote; however, there is a set of promising biomarkers which may serve as predictive, prognostic or treatment markers in the future. The review presents a critical appraisal and update on some of the most promising candidates for biomarkers, namely, neuroimaging markers, peripheral biomarkers and genetic markers, including a brief discussion on cognitive endophenotypes as indicative of genetic risk. The lessons learnt from other fields and specialties in medicine need to be applied to psychiatry to translate the knowledge from 'bench to bedside' by means of clinically useful biomarkers.

Quantile regressions showed SAS and CBCL-social have higher correlations for subjects with low social aptitudes and non-significant correlations for subjects with high social aptitudes. Multiple logistic regressions showed that SAS was able to provide independent clinical predictions even after adjusting for CBCL-social scores.\nOur results provide further validity to SAS and exemplify the potential of \"bidirectional\" scales to dimensional assessment, allowing a better understanding of variations that occur in the population and providing information for children with typical and atypical development."}, {"Title": "[Gender Norms and Expertise : Constructions of Gender in Psychiatrists' Legal Opinions in Imperial Germany, 1871-1914].", "Abstract": "This article focuses on notions of gender in psychiatrists' expert opinions written for lawsuits during the German Empire, 1871-1914.

A supportive intervention aimed at reducing the effects of drug abuse should begin in a timely way - during pregnancy at latest, but better before it. To develop an optimal care protocol for both the mother and her child, more knowledge regarding the personal conditions of the women as well as the specific features of later child development after prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) is vital. In this study, the data of 129 women and their newborns with PME who were admitted to a Level-1 perinatal center between 2007 and 2015 were analyzed. At delivery, two-thirds of the women were aged 20-30 years. Only 48% attended their first preventive examination in pregnancy within the first 12 weeks.

The objectives of this naturalistic study were to assess the relationships between serum quetiapine concentration, daily dose, and clinical outcomes as well as the determinants of pharmacokinetic variability. Furthermore, it was elucidated whether the recommended TR for adult patients with psychotic disorders is valid for children and adolescents. <b>Methods</b> TDM was performed in 180 pediatric patients treated with quetiapine. Psychopathological changes were assessed by the Clinical Global Impression - Improvement scale (CGI-I). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed by using a short form of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) side effect rating scale. <b>Results</b> A weak positive linear relationship between daily dose (mean 349.9\u00b1248.9 mg/day) and serum concentration of quetiapine (r<sub>s</sub>=0.496, p<0.001) was found (mean age 15.6\u00b11.9 years, 45.6% male, 31.1% monotherapy), but no relationship between serum concentration and clinical outcome was found. Dose variation accounted for only 12.5% (r<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.125) of the variability of serum concentrations.

However, its status has been subject to instability, as it has lacked indisputable biological correlates that would anchor its place within the canon of medical diagnosis. Informed by a semiotic perspective, this paper focuses on its recent history: how 'schizophrenia' has been claimed, appropriated and contested-and how this connects with its earlier history of signification. It also explores how the dominance of this signifier has influenced the ways in which people with the diagnosis may find themselves constructed in their interactions with professionals, family and wider society, and hence how they may come to see themselves. It is argued that, from a point in the 1990s when 'schizophrenia' had achieved an almost iconic status, the term is now subject to greater instability, with concerns and challenges being raised from both within and outside psychiatry. On the one hand, this uncertainty has triggered a 'calls to arms' from those within the psychiatric establishment who see diagnoses such as 'schizophrenia' as crucial to their professional identity and status. On the other hand, this has created spaces for new conversations and alliances between elements within neurology, psychiatry, social work and other professions, and between these and service users. Some of these conversations are casting doubt on the validity and utility of 'schizophrenia' as a construct, and are beginning to posit alternative regimes of signification."}, {"Title": "Omega-3 Use in Psychiatry: Evidence-Based or Elegance-Based?", "Abstract": "Use of omega-3 in psychiatric practice is on the rise.

Currently, one of key problems of pharmacotherapy is a comorbidity of metabolic syndrome and mental disorder. Depression is more common than schizophrenia. Despite the fact that in everyday clinical practice there are more patients with depression than schizophrenia, there is a bigger interest among scientists for metabolic syndrome after antipsychotic drugs than as an effect of use of antidepressant agents.\nThe aim of an analysis was to review literature committed to influence of depression pharmacotherapy on development of metabolic syndrome. 169 results were provided, including 18 original publications. Final analysis consists of 9 that investigate correlation between antidepressive medicines use and metabolic syndrome development (but not its each individual component).\nIn general, antidepressant pharmacotherapy is associated not only with increased risk of metabolic syndrome occurrence but also their worsening. However, it needs to be emphasized that there is a difference between antidepressants groups - tricyclic antidepressive medicines are the most commonly associated with risk of developing metabolic disorders, but also SNRIs and SSRIs are mentioned as significant contributors. Mechanisms of aforementioned changes are still unclear. However, their influence on histamine and serotonin pathways, which take part in regulation of i.e. food intake, is suggested. The search for mechanisms that are precisely responsible for metabolic changes continues, in hope of finding a way to avoid adverse effects of antidepressant medicines use."}, {"Title": "The use of electronic health records for psychiatric phenotyping and genomics.", "Abstract": "The widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHRs) in healthcare systems has created a vast and continuously growing resource of clinical data and provides new opportunities for population-based research. In particular, the linking of EHRs to biospecimens and genomic data in biobanks may help address what has become a rate-limiting study for genetic research: the need for large sample sizes. The principal roadblock to capitalizing on these resources is the need to establish the validity of phenotypes extracted from the EHR. For psychiatric genetic research, this represents a particular challenge given that diagnosis is based on patient reports and clinician observations that may not be well-captured in billing codes or narrative records. This review addresses the opportunities and pitfalls in EHR-based phenotyping with a focus on their application to psychiatric genetic research. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that diagnostic algorithms with high positive predictive value can be derived from EHRs, especially when structured data are supplemented by text mining approaches. Such algorithms enable semi-automated phenotyping for large-scale case-control studies. In addition, the scale and scope of EHR databases have been used successfully to identify phenotypic subgroups and derive algorithms for longitudinal risk prediction. EHR-based genomics are particularly well-suited to rapid look-up replication of putative risk genes, studies of pleiotropy (phenomewide association studies or PheWAS), investigations of genetic networks and overlap across the phenome, and pharmacogenomic research.

Despite this, it goes undiagnosed and untreated in many women attending antenatal care. Smartphones could help support the prompt identification of antenatal depression in this setting. In addition, these devices enable the implementation of ecological momentary assessment techniques, which could be used to assess how mood is experienced during pregnancy. With this study, we will assess the feasibility of using a bespoke mobile application (app) running on participants' own handsets for the longitudinal (6 months) monitoring of antenatal mood and screening of depression.\nWe will use a randomised controlled study design to compare two types of assessment strategies: retrospective + momentary (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale plus five momentary and two contextual questions), and retrospective (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale only). We will assess the impact that these strategies have on participant adherence to a prespecified sampling protocol, dropout rates and timeliness of data completion. We will evaluate differences in acceptance of the technology through a short quantitative survey and open-ended questions.

Perhaps the most common foraging problem is the choice between exploiting a familiar option for a known reward and exploring unfamiliar options for unknown rewards-the so-called explore/exploit trade-off. This trade-off has been studied extensively in behavioral ecology and computational neuroscience, but is relatively new to the field of psychiatry. Explore/exploit paradigms can offer psychiatry research a new approach to studying motivation, outcome valuation, and effort-related processes, which are disrupted in many mental and emotional disorders. In addition, the explore/exploit trade-off encompasses elements of risk-taking and impulsivity-common behaviors in psychiatric disorders-and provides a novel framework for understanding these behaviors within an ecological context. Here we explain relevant concepts and some common paradigms used to measure explore/exploit decisions in the laboratory, review clinically relevant research on the neurobiology and neuroanatomy of explore/exploit decision making, and discuss how computational psychiatry can benefit from foraging theory."}, {"Title": "A Case of Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Presenting as Conversion Disorder.", "Abstract": "<i>Background</i>. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare disorder of the central nervous system. Its initial diagnosis may be obscured by its variable presentation. This case report illustrates the complexity of diagnosing this disease early in the clinical course, especially when the initial symptoms may be psychiatric. It offers a brief review of the literature and reinforces a role for consultation psychiatry services. <i>Methods</i>. PUBMED/MEDLINE was searched using the terms \"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease\", \"psychiatric symptoms\", \"conversion disorder\", \"somatic symptom disorder\", \"functional movement disorder\", and \"functional neurologic disorder\". <i>Case</i>. The patient was a 64-year-old woman with no prior psychiatric history who was initially diagnosed with conversion disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder but soon thereafter was discovered to have Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. <i>Discussion</i>. This case highlights the central role of psychiatric symptoms in early presentations of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Still, few other cases in the literature report functional neurological symptoms as an initial sign.

She developed a dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, a life-threatening event. The cause of heart failure could be multifactorial, with clozapine, family history, chemotherapy, diabetes type II and/or lithium as possible contributing risk factors. Clozapine was discontinued and the patient was referred to a hospice. Two weeks later, her heart failure slowly improved. Subsequently, she became extremely psychotic with a severe decline in quality of life. Therefore, it was decided to restart clozapine under cardiac monitoring. The patient's psychotic symptoms improved and her heart failure status remained stable for more than a year. Thereafter, a small deterioration was seen in cardiac function. In this case, re-exposure to clozapine was successful for at least 2\u2009years."}, {"Title": "Gender-gaps and glass ceilings: A survey of gender-specific publication trends in Psychiatry between 1994 and 2014.", "Abstract": "Within academic psychiatry, women are underrepresented in the higher academic ranks. However, basic determinants of women's lack of academic advancement such as publication activity are poorly understood. The present study examines women's publication activity in high-impact psychiatry journals over two decades and reports developments in the numbers of male and female authorship over time and across cultural areas.\nWe conducted a retrospective bibliometric review of all articles published in 2004 and 2014 in three high-ranking general psychiatry journals. Statistical comparisons were made between the two years and with results from a baseline assessment in 1994.\nThe overall percentage of female authors increased from 24.6% in 1994 to 33.2% in 2004 to 38.9% in 2014. Though increases in female authorship were statistically significant for both decades, there was less difference between 2004 and 2014, indicating a possible ceiling effect. Rates of female first authors increased between 1994 and 2014, though to a lesser degree between 2004 and 2014. Numbers of female corresponding authors plateaued between 2004 and 2014. Within Europe, Scandinavia displayed the most balanced gender-wise first author ratios. Western European and Central European countries increased their rates of female first authors substantially between 2004 and 2014.\nDespite gains in some areas, our study reveals considerable deficits in the diversity of the current academic psychiatric landscape.

To minimize that risk, a program offering intranasal naloxone rescue kits was piloted at a Veterans Administration Hospital. The purpose of this study was to characterize veterans who accepted these potentially lifesaving kits. Retrospective medical chart review of 158 veterans with opioid use disorder receiving treatment on either the inpatient psychiatry detoxification units or outpatient methadone maintenance setting who were offered overdose education and naloxone rescue kits. One hundred and ten of 158 veterans (70%) accepted overdose education and naloxone rescue. Overall, they had a mean age of 39.1\u00a0years and averaged 12.7\u00a0years of opioid use. In the prior month, they averaged 14.3\u00a0days of heroin use; they used alone 48.5% of the time. They estimated an average of 2.8 accidental overdoses over their lifetimes. There were few significant differences between those who accepted and those who declined with regard to demographic and clinical variables. However, significantly higher percentages of outpatients accepted overdose education and naloxone rescue compared to inpatients (89% versus 63%, p = 0.003, Chi-square); the odds of acceptance were increased four-fold when offered to outpatients. Outpatients were nearly a decade older, with more years of opioid use (19.0 versus 11.0), but with less utilization of inpatient services in the prior year (all p < 0.05). The main finding was that 70% of veterans accepted overdose education and naloxone rescue, but significantly higher proportions of outpatients were more receptive than inpatients (89% versus 63%, p = 0.003).

The role of psychiatrists in this process, and at reducing the consequences of mental morbidity is evident. Psychiatrists are required to play a multifaceted role as clinicians, as experts in multidisciplinary team environments and as advisors in the recognition of public needs in mental health issues, as teachers and mentors for students and other health professionals, as researchers in order to enrich our knowledge in the scientific field of psychiatry, and as public health specialists in the development of the mental health services system. This multifaceted role requires the continuous education of modern psychiatrists, but above all a broad, substantial and comprehensive training regime in the initial stage of their professional career, that is to say during specialization. Training in Psychiatry, as indeed has happened in all other medical specialties, has evolved considerably in recent decades, both in the content of education due to scientific advances in the fields of neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, genetics, psychopharmacology, epidemiology and psychiatric nosology, and also because of advances in the educational process itself. Simple apprenticeship next to an experienced clinician, despite its importance in the clinical training of young psychiatrists, is no longer sufficient to meet the increased demands of the modern role of psychiatrists, resulting in the creation of educational programs defined by setting and pursuing minimum, though comprehensive educational objectives. This development has created the global need to develop organizations intended to supervise training programs. These organizations have various forms worldwide. In the European Union, the competent supervising body for medical specialties is the UEMS (European Union of Medical Specialities) and particularly in the case of the psychiatric specialty, the European Board of Psychiatry. In the US, the supervising bodies are the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, in the United Kingdom the Royal College of Psychiatrists, in Canada the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, etc. In our country, the debate on the need to reform the institutional framework for Psychiatric training has been underway since the mid-90s, with initiatives especially by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, aiming to raise awareness and concern among psychiatrists while responding to requests from competent central bodies of the state, as well as establishing Panhellenic training programs for psychiatric trainees and continuing education programs. But what is the situation of the educational map in the country today, what would be the objectives, and how might we proceed? These questions we will try to answer in an effort initiated by Hellenic Psychiatric Association (HPA) and the journal \"Psychiatriki\" with the publication of thematic articles starting by presenting in the next issue of \"Psychiatriki\"a comparative study of the training in the specialty of psychiatry at two distinct periods of time (2000 and 2014). These time-frames are of great importance, since the first is a period that in retrospect can be considered as wealthier yet missing robust priorities, while the second, at the peak of the economic crisis, constitutes a difficult environment with limited resources. Already in the year 2000, psychiatric residency training in our country had major difficulties due to its outdated framework and its fragmentation. All areas in which training is assessed (clinical experience, theoretical training and training in psychotherapy exhibited inadequacies and limited convergence with European golden standards, in the absence of a plan and the implementation of a national education curriculum. Certain university clinics constituted an important exception, though the bulk of the country's future psychiatrists were lagging behind in educational opportunities. Fifteen years later and under the weight of the consequences of the financial crisis, the institutional framework has not yet changed, and the overall situation seems to have worsened dramatically. Nevertheless, there are positive aspects to be evaluated, reinforced, and utilized in order to minimize the adverse effects of the economic crisis and lay sound foundations for the future. Preparations of a national framework is imperative today more than ever and initiatives to amend the legislation on medical specialties as far as it concerns the field of Psychiatry, could benefit from the evidence, from the willingness of the trainers and trainees concerned, as well as from the elaborated proposals of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association (HPA)."}, {"Title": "Imagining Moral Bioenhancement Practices: Drawing Inspiration from Moral Education, Public Health Ethics, and Forensic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this article, we consider contexts or domains in which (future) moral bioenhancement interventions possibly or most likely will be implemented. By looking closely at similar or related existing practices and their relevant ethical frameworks, we hope to identify ethical considerations that are relevant for evaluating potential moral bioenhancement interventions. We examine, first, debates on the proper scope of moral education; second, proposals for identifying early risk factors for antisocial behaviour; and third, the difficult balancing of individual freedom and third party concerns in (forensic) psychiatry. In imagining moral bioenhancement in practice, we observe that unlike other forms of enhancement, moral enhancement fundamentally asks how the interests and preferences of the individual and the interests of others should be weighed (in view of public safety and managing public risk). Highly diverse domains such as education, mental health, and the judicial domain might be involved, and moral bioenhancement might challenge existing institutional settings. Given these highly varied contexts and domains, it appears unlikely that there will be a distinct set of practices that will be referred to as \"moral bioenhancement.\""}, {"Title": "Anxiety Associated Increased CpG Methylation in the Promoter of Asb1: A Translational Approach Evidenced by Epidemiological and Clinical Studies and a Murine Model.", "Abstract": "Epigenetic regulation in anxiety is suggested, but evidence from large studies is needed. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on anxiety in a population-based cohort and validated our finding in a clinical cohort as well as a murine model. In the KORA cohort, participants (n=1522, age 32-72 years) were administered the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) instrument, whole blood DNA methylation was measured (Illumina 450K BeadChip), and circulating levels of hs-CRP and IL-18 were assessed in the association between anxiety and methylation. DNA methylation was measured using the same instrument in a study of patients with anxiety disorders recruited at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP, 131 non-medicated cases and 169 controls). To expand our mechanistic understanding, these findings were reverse translated in a mouse model of acute social defeat stress. In the KORA study, participants were classified according to mild, moderate, or severe levels of anxiety (29.4%/6.0%/1.5%, respectively). Severe anxiety was associated with 48.5% increased methylation at a single CpG site (cg12701571) located in the promoter of the gene encoding Asb1 (\u03b2-coefficient=0.56 standard error (SE)=0.10, p (Bonferroni)=0.005), a protein hypothetically involved in regulation of cytokine signaling. An interaction between IL-18 and severe anxiety with methylation of this CpG cite showed a tendency towards significance in the total population (p=0.083) and a significant interaction among women (p=0.014). Methylation of the same CpG was positively associated with Panic and Agoraphobia scale (PAS) scores (\u03b2=0.005, SE=0.002, p=0.021, n=131) among cases in the MPIP study. In a murine model of acute social defeat stress, Asb1 gene expression was significantly upregulated in a tissue-specific manner (p=0.006), which correlated with upregulation of the neuroimmunomodulating cytokine interleukin 1 beta. Our findings suggest epigenetic regulation of the stress-responsive Asb1 gene in anxiety-related phenotypes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the causal direction of this association and the potential role of Asb1-mediated immune dysregulation in anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Nalmefene in Alcohol Use Disorder Subjects with Psychiatric Comorbidity: A Naturalistic Study.", "Abstract": "Nalmefene is the first drug to be approved for reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients at high drinking risk. In real-world settings, there is a high prevalence of concurrent psychiatric disorders in AUD subjects, with associated increased morbidity and worse prognosis. This study evaluated the use of nalmefene in AUD patients with stabilized psychiatric comorbidity previously treated unsuccessfully for alcohol dependence, and assessed craving reduction and safety.\nSixty-five AUD outpatients treated with as-needed 18\u00a0mg nalmefene for 24\u00a0weeks were included. Primary outcome measures were: changes in heavy drinking days (HDDs) and total alcohol consumption (TAC, g/day). Secondary outcome measures were: changes in drinking risk level and craving (obsessive-compulsive drinking scale and visual analogue scale for craving).\nForty-two AUD subjects (64.6%) had one or more stabilized psychiatric comorbidity. There was a significant reduction in HDDs, TAC and craving measures (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with no differences between subjects with and without psychiatric comorbidity. Nalmefene was safe and well tolerated in all patients.\nAs-needed nalmefene reduced drinking and craving in AUD subjects with and without psychiatric comorbidity. These findings suggest that nalmefene is a valid therapeutic option in real-world clinical settings, where comorbid conditions are common, and has the potential to engage AUD patients who may otherwise not have sought help.\nLundbeck Italia S.P.A."}, {"Title": "Use of repeated intravenous ketamine therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar depression with suicidal behaviour: a case report from Spain.", "Abstract": "The rapidly-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine are a trend topic in psychiatry. Despite its robust effects, these are ephemeral and can lead to certain adverse events. For this reason, there is still a general concern around the off-label use of ketamine in clinical practice settings. Nonetheless, for refractory depression, it should be an indication to consider. We report the case of a female patient admitted for several months due to a treatment-resistant depressive bipolar episode with chronic suicidal behaviour. After repeated intravenous ketamine infusions without remarkable side effects, the patient experienced a complete clinical recovery during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge. Unfortunately, depressive symptoms reappeared in the 5th week, and the patient was finally readmitted to hospital as a result of a suicide attempt."}, {"Title": "Development of a Diverse Learning Experience for Diverse Psychiatry Resident Needs: A Four-Year Biological Psychiatry Curriculum Incorporating Principles of Neurobiology, Psychopharmacology, and Evidence-Based Practice.", "Abstract": "A clinically relevant approach to patient care grounded in neurobiological constructs and evidence based practice which emphasizes a relevant psychopharmacology is needed to optimally train psychiatry residents.\nWe implemented a biological psychiatry course that now incorporates neurobiology, psychopharmacology, and evidence-based practice in conjunction with a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) perspective. A survey launched prior to course implementation and following each class session, served as the outcome metric of residents' attitudes toward the new curriculum and followed a baseline attitudinal survey designed to evaluate the program.\nGreater than 90% of the psychiatry residents at Duke University who took the attitudinal survey <i>agreed or strongly agreed</i> with needing a course that helped them develop an understanding of neurobiology, psychopharmacology, and evidence-based practice concepts. Most residents also indicated a <i>less than adequate</i> understanding of the neurobiology and psychopharmacology of psychiatric disorders prior to sessions.\nOur biological psychiatry curriculum was associated with enthusiasm among residents regarding the incorporation of neurobiology, psychopharmacology, and evidence-based practice into course topics and discussions.

While available literature pertaining to cardiometabolic and respiratory CDTM services is growing, publications are sparse in psychiatry, particularly outside Veterans Health Administration medical centers. A descriptive study was undertaken to demonstrate how a board-certified psychiatric pharmacist would begin organizing a protocol for clinical pharmacy services at an outpatient, community treatment center for mental health and substance abuse disorders. The primary CDTM service proposed was metabolic monitoring for atypical antipsychotics, though profile reviews for medication reconciliation, drug level monitoring, and insurance coverage were also considered. Potential obstacles identified and worked through during the project included pharmacist-prescriber relationships, federal and state law requirements, pharmacy informatics development, and pharmacy services billing. Discussions with both administrative and medical stakeholders across the health system were essential in helping a pharmacist detail professional qualifications, justify positive impacts on patient outcomes, and navigate these legal and financial issues. The systematic approach arrived at through the study addresses current literature gaps concerning how pharmacists can evolve their practices from ancillary to collaborative design by nature within psychiatric settings."}, {"Title": "Atomic psychiatry?

Students participated in six 1-hour class sessions led by an interdisciplinary faculty. Sessions focused on core areas in SUDs education and used either a lecture with discussion or a small-group team-based learning format. Students completed one motivational interview, attended a 12-step recovery meeting, and wrote a reflection paper. On the first and last day of the clerkship, students measured their attitudes toward individuals with SUDs using the Substance Abuse Attitude Scale (SAAS) and toward interprofessionalism using the Interprofessional Attitudes Scale (IPAS).\nSeventy-one students participated in the course from November 2015 to May 2016. Fifty-nine (83%) students had paired pre- and postcourse SAAS and IPAS data. On the SAAS, students showed significant improvement in their median total score and nonmoralizing, treatment optimism, and treatment intervention scores. On the IPAS, students showed significant improvement in their median score on the teamwork, roles, and responsibilities domain.\nThe authors will continue to assess the course.

In this sense, the challenge of Systems Biology for understanding the \"psychiatric phenotype\" is to provide an improved vision of the shape of the phenotype as it is visualized by \"Gestalt\" psychology, whose fundamental axiom is that the observed phenotype (behavior or mental disorder) will be the result of the integrative composition of every part. Therefore, we propose the term \"Gestaltomics\" as a term from Systems Biology to integrate data coming from different sources of information (such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, metabolome, phenome, and microbiome). In addition to this biological complexity, the mind is integrated through multiple brain functions that receive and process complex information through channels and perception networks (i.e., sight, ear, smell, memory, and attention) that in turn are programmed by genes and influenced by environmental processes (epigenetic). Today, the approach of medical research in human diseases is to isolate one disease for study; however, the presence of an additional disease (co-morbidity) or more than one disease (multimorbidity) adds complexity to the study of these conditions. This review will present the challenge of integrating psychiatric disorders at different levels of information (Gestaltomics). The implications of increasing the level of complexity, for example, studying the co-morbidity with another disease such as cancer, will also be discussed."}, {"Title": "Anticipating the Ethical Challenges of Psychiatric Genetic Testing.", "Abstract": "Genetic testing for mental illness is likely to become increasingly prevalent as the science behind it is refined. This article identifies anticipated ethical challenges for patients, psychiatrists, and genetic counselors and makes recommendations for addressing them.\nMany of the ethical challenges of psychiatric genetic testing are likely to stem from failures to comprehend the nature and implications of test results. Recent studies have identified gaps in the knowledge base of psychiatrists and genetic counselors, which limit their abilities to provide patients with appropriate education. A small number of studies have demonstrated the value of counseling in empowering patients to deal with relevant genetic information. Psychiatrists and other health professionals must be able to assist patients and families in making informed decisions about genetic testing and interpreting test results.

Catatonia was assessed using the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS).\nCatatonia was highly prevalent (n=42; 39.6%), even when using restrictive diagnostic criteria: Fink and Taylor (n=19; 17.9%) and DSM 5 (n=22; 20.8%). Depression was the most frequent psychiatric syndrome among catatonic patients (n=18; 42.8%). Catatonia was more frequent in depression (48.6%) and delirium (66.7%). Affective disorders showed a higher risk than psychotic disorders to develop catatonia (OR=2.68; 95% CI 1.09-6.61). This association was not statistically significant when controlling for dementia and geriatric syndromes. The most prevalent catatonic signs were excitement (64.3%), verbigeration (61.9%), negativism (59.5%), immobility/stupor (57.1%), and staring (52.4%).\nCatatonia in older psychiatric inpatients was highly prevalent. Depression was the most common psychiatric syndrome among catatonic patients, and catatonia was more frequent in depression and mania, as well as in delirium.

A critical literature review.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric practice in India is marked by an increasing gulf between largely urban-based mental health professionals and a majority rural population. Based on the premise that any engagement is a mutually constructed humane process, an understanding of the culture of psychiatry including social process of local knowledge acquisition by trainee psychiatrists is critical. This paper reviews existing literature on training of psychiatrists in India, the cultural construction of their professional identities and autobiographical reflections. The results reveal a scarcity of research on how identities, knowledge, and values are constructed, contested, resisted, sustained, and operationalized through practice. This paper hypothesizes that psychiatric training and practice in India continues to operate chiefly in an instrumental fashion and bears a circular relationship between cultural, hierarchical training structures and patient-carer concerns. The absence of interpretative social science training generates a professional identity that predominantly focuses on the patient and his/her social world as the site of pathology. Infrequent and often superfluous critical cultural reflexivity gained through routine clinical practice further alienates professionals from patients, caregivers, and their own social landscapes. This results in a peculiar brand of theory and practice that is skewed toward a narrow understanding of what constitutes suffering. The authors argue that such omissions could be addressed through nuanced ethnographies on the professional development of psychiatrists during postgraduate training, including the political economies of their social institutions and local cultural landscapes. Further research will also help enhance culturally sensitive epistemology and shape locally responsive mental health training programs.

Data from animal and human studies point to a role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in extinction learning and subsequent retention of extinction memories. Given the increasing interest in developing noninvasive brain stimulation protocols for psychopathology treatment, we piloted whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during extinction learning, vs. during consolidation of extinction learning, might improve extinction recall in veterans with warzone-related PTSD.\nTwenty-eight veterans with PTSD completed a 2-day Pavlovian fear conditioning, extinction, and recall paradigm. Participants received one 10-min session of 2\u00a0mA anodal tDCS over AF3, intended to target the vmPFC. Fourteen received tDCS that started simultaneously with extinction learning onset, and the remaining 14 participants received tDCS during extinction consolidation. Normalized skin conductance reactivity (SCR) was the primary outcome measure. Linear mixed effects models were used to test for effects of tDCS on late extinction and early extinction recall 24\u00a0hr later.\nDuring early recall, veterans who received tDCS during extinction consolidation showed slightly lower SCR in response to previously extinguished stimuli as compared to veterans who received tDCS simultaneous with extinction learning (<i>p\u00a0</i>=\u00a0.08), generating a medium effect size (Cohen's <i>d</i>\u00a0=\u00a0.38).

This creates difficulties for causal inference. We argue for the use of probabilistic models represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These capture the dependence structure of multiple variables and, used appropriately, allow more robust conclusions about the direction of causation. We analyzed British national survey data to assess putative mediators of the association between bullying victimization and persecutory ideation. We compared results using DAGs and the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) logistic regression commands in STATA. We analyzed data from the 2007 English National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity, using the equivalent 2000 survey in an instant replication. Additional details of methods and results are provided in the supplementary material. DAG analysis revealed a richer structure of relationships than could be inferred using the KHB logistic regression commands. Thus, bullying had direct effects on worry, persecutory ideation, mood instability, and drug use. Depression, sleep and anxiety lay downstream, and therefore did not mediate the link between bullying and persecutory ideation. Mediation by worry and mood instability could not be definitively ascertained. Bullying led to hallucinations indirectly, via persecutory ideation and depression. DAG analysis of the 2000 dataset suggested the technique generates stable results. While causality cannot be fully determined from cross-sectional data, DAGs indicate the relationships providing the best fit. They thereby advance investigation of the complex interactions seen in psychiatry, including the mechanisms underpinning psychiatric symptoms.

On the other hand, the validity can be expert driven or data driven, the research can be based on disorders or in symptoms and quantitative or qualitative methods may be used. In this article, we review all these different kinds of perspectives that can be taken towards the definition of validity in psychiatry and the methodology to search for it."}, {"Title": "Somatization in the dermatology patient: Some sociocultural perspectives.", "Abstract": "Somatization in dermatology patients is a challenge to diagnose and manage. Somatization presents as medically unexplained dermatologic symptoms, which are commonly encountered in dermatology and psychiatry practices. These cutaneous symptoms are often intriguing and do not fit into any particular known dermatologic condition. Sometimes, they may evoke negative feelings in the practicing dermatologist. The dermatologic somatic symptoms might be one way of communicating psychologic distress in a culturally acceptable method. These somatic symptoms may be masking another psychiatric disorder such as depression. They could also be an adaptive response to a difficult psychosocial situation and means of coping in a culturally meaningful way; therefore, the underlying conflicts need to be understood and managed in the sociocultural context of the symptoms. This chapter discusses the various unexplained physical symptoms in dermatology patients and the need for comprehensive evaluation."}, {"Title": "The RANZCP guidelines for Schizophrenia: Why is our practice so far short of our recommendations, and what can we do about it?", "Abstract": "The new RANZCP guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders highlights what we know works. In this paper, we examine why patients so often fail to benefit from this knowledge and why clinical practice falls so far short of the recommended standard. Instead of the continuous improvement that we expect of health care in general, in psychiatry we face an accelerating decline in systems of care. There has been a sustained underinvestment in public mental health care and a shared failure by State and Federal governments to construct and commit to a governance and funding model that can deliver the standard of care that is available in other major non-communicable diseases, and which we know is equally possible for severe mental illness. This paper sets out some of the reasons for the poor quality of care received by many people with schizophrenia and related disorders in Australia, and describes ways that care could be improved. In particular, we recommend an explicit statement of what constitutes an adequate standard of care, for people at all stages of these illnesses. This would help provide transparency about whether the care provided by mental health services achieves these benchmarks, and enable publication of results comparing the performance of different states and regional services. Patients and families, as well as professional, consumer and carer organizations would then be able to see clearly where the deficits are and demand resources and care that match the recommendations."}, {"Title": "Broadening the Lens of System-Based Practice: From Micro to Macro and Basic to Complex in Residency Training.", "Abstract": "This paper aimed to develop a model for understanding the various dimensions of system-based practice (SBP) and determine the extent to which psychiatry residents perform behaviors along these dimensions.\nSixty-one supervisors from seven psychiatry programs rated resident performance of SBP behaviors using a 60-item instrument. Multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis were conducted to determine how the instrument items related to one another and the larger concept of SBP. Average supervisor ratings between clusters were compared to determine resident performance along the identified SBP dimensions.\nThe data supports a model of SBP defined along two dimensions: (1) from micro (patient) to macro (population-based) interventions and (2) from low to high system complexity. Residents were more likely to perform behaviors at the patient level compared to those at the population-based level.\nTraining in SBP remains predominately focused on the doctor-patient level and not the greater system of health-care delivery."}, {"Title": "Reliability of the Dissociative Trance Disorder Interview Schedule: A preliminary report.", "Abstract": "One hundred inpatients in a hospital-based Trauma Program in the USA were interviewed with the Dissociative Trance Disorder Interview Schedule (DTDIS).

Individual sessions were offered in an outpatient setting, while both group and individual sessions occurred in an inpatient unit. This pilot study used a mixed methodology to collect data from young people who attended Bod Squad. A database of exercise physiology records for 47 young people were analysed for attendance and physiological indicators. In addition, 7 semi-structured interviews were conducted with young people to explore their experience of Bod Squad. Young people attended a total of 169 sessions during the programmes tenure, with an overall mean of 3.6 sessions. Pre-post measures for 10 young people (who had attended at least 4 sessions) showed modest average reductions for body mass index, waist circumference, chest circumference and resting heart rate. Five themes emerged from the interviews-(1) My reasons for attending, (2) The social aspect, (3) An individualized approach, (4) Outcomes from Bod Squad and (5) My experience of the service. All of these themes included positive experiences of Bod Squad, which young people perceived as relevant to their needs and helpful to their recovery. These findings are congruent with previous studies that have concluded that exercise physiology may be an effective, acceptable and valued intervention for addressing physical and metabolic health issues for young people."}, {"Title": "Genetic Variants Within Key Nodes of the Cascade of Antipsychotic Mechanisms: Effects on Antipsychotic Response and Schizophrenia Psychopathology in a Naturalistic Treatment Setting in Two Independent Korean and Italian Samples.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Genetic factors play an important role in both SCZ liability and its treatment outcome. In the present paper, we investigated the effects of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ten strong candidate genes involved with antipsychotics (APs) mechanisms of action.\nTwo independent samples were investigated in the present study. Totals of 176 SCZ subjects and 326 controls of Korean ancestry, and 83 SCZ subjects and 194 controls of Italian ancestry were recruited and genotyped. SCZ risk and other parameters were also investigated.\nConcerning APs response, only a nominal association with HOMER1 rs3822568 in the Korean sample was found. In the haplotype analysis, rs9801117 C-rs12668837 C-rs4621754 A haplotype within ESYT2 and NCAPG2 genes was associated with APs response in the same sample. As for secondary outcomes, rs7439 within PKDCC and rs12668837 within NCAPG2 were associated with SCZ risk in the Italian sample. In the haplotype analysis, rs2788478 G-rs2657375 T-rs1039621 A within the region between WDR60 and ESYT genes and rs2013 C (ESYT2)-rs6459896 A (NCAPG2) haplotypes were associated with SCZ in the same sample. No association was found in the Korean sample. Finally, our exploratory data suggest a possible modulation of HOMER1, ARC, BDNF, TXNRD2, WDR60, and ESYT2 genes in the APs response to specific symptom clusters.\nOur results did not support a primary role for the genes investigated in the APs response. On the other hand, our secondary results suggest a possible involvement of NACPG2 and PKDCC in SCZ liability. Finally, our exploratory findings may deserve further investigations in specific studies."}, {"Title": "[Prevention in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Mental disorders affect annually about one-fifth of the population and represent one of the biggest health burdens of the mankind in the 21st century.

She came to our attention for a chronic skin ulcer that developed into the radio-treated area about 4 years ago. We performed a skin biopsy and programed adipose tissue grafts to promote wound healing. The result of the biopsy was unexpected: dermal localization of not differentiated breast carcinoma.

Numerous researchers have proposed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) biomarkers to predict therapeutic response, in particular by measuring task-evoked subgenual anterior cingulate (sgACC) and amygdala activation in mood and anxiety disorders. Translating this to the clinic relies on the assumption that blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in these regions are stable within individuals. To test this assumption, we scanned a group of 29 volunteers twice (mean test-retest interval=14.3 days) and calculated the within-subject reliability of the amplitude of the amygdalae and sgACC BOLD responses to emotional faces using three paradigms: emotion identification; emotion matching; and gender classification. We also calculated the reliability of activation in a control region, the right fusiform face area (FFA). All three tasks elicited robust group activations in the amygdalae and sgACC (which changed little on average over scanning sessions), but within-subject reliability was surprisingly low, despite excellent reliability in the control right FFA region. Our findings demonstrate low statistical reliability of two important putative treatment biomarkers in mood and anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Seasonal variation of hospital violence, seclusion and restraint in a forensic psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Several epidemiological studies have reported seasonal patterns in both violent and self-destructive behaviour. However, a few studies on hospital violence have found contradictory results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was any seasonal variation of violence in a forensic psychiatric hospital providing care for persons suffering from psychotic disorders and violent or self-destructive behaviour. Seasonal variation of the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was also investigated. Reports of violent incidents and seclusion and restraint statistics from between 2007 and 2012 were examined with Poisson regression analysis. There was significant variation in the prevalence of seclusion and restraint between months (p<0.001), and between seasons (p<0.001). Monthly prevalence of seclusion and restraint was the lowest in January compared to other months. In comparison, the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was lower in winter than in other seasons. In a hospital with persons suffering from psychotic disorders, no significant variation of violence or self-destructive behaviour was found, similarly as in the society. By contrast, the prevalence of seclusion and restraint showed marked seasonality. Variation in the prevalence of seclusion and restraint was not consistent with the variance in violence, which implies that the use of coercive measures is related to seasonal variation among staff."}, {"Title": "Development of the Vanderbilt Assessment for Delirium in Infants and Children to Standardize Pediatric Delirium Assessment By Psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Pediatric delirium assessment is complicated by variations in baseline language and cognitive skills, impairment during illness, and absence of pediatric-specific modifiers within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders delirium criterion.\nTo develop a standardized approach to pediatric delirium assessment by psychiatrists.\nA multidisciplinary group of clinicians used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criterion as the foundation for the Vanderbilt Assessment for Delirium in Infants and Children (VADIC). Pediatric-specific modifiers were integrated into the delirium criterion, including key developmental and assessment variations for children. The VADIC was used in clinical practice to prospectively assess critically ill infants and children. The VADIC was assessed for content validity by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Delirium Special Interest Group.\nThe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-Delirium Special Interest Group determined that the VADIC demonstrated high content validity. The VADIC (1) preserved the core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual delirium criterion, (2) appropriately paired interactive assessments with key criterion based on development, and (3) addressed confounders for delirium. A cohort of 300 patients with a median age of 20 months was assessed for delirium using the VADIC. Delirium prevalence was 47%.\nThe VADIC provides a comprehensive framework to standardize pediatric delirium assessment by psychiatrists. The need for consistency in both delirium education and diagnosis is highlighted given the high prevalence of pediatric delirium."}, {"Title": "'My husband is possessed by a jinn': a case study in transcultural mental health.", "Abstract": "Objectives The objective of this study was to discuss jinn possession in Muslim culture, and the importance of understanding cultural differences in mental health.

It also helps clinicians to reach an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatments. Beliefs about jinn possession should not automatically be regarded as delusional. In alleged cases of jinn possession, clinicians should consider all the biopsychosocial, cultural and spiritual factors that are unique to the individual.

In this naturalistic prospective inpatient and post-discharge study from an acute psychiatric ward, we investigated total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as risk markers of violence. From March 21, 2012, to March 20, 2013, 158 men and 204 women were included. TC and HDL were measured at admission. Violence was recorded during hospital stay and for the first 3 months post-discharge. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to estimate associations between low TC and low HDL and violence. Results showed that HDL level was significantly inversely associated with violence during hospital stay for all patients. For men, but not for women, HDL level was significantly inversely associated with violence the first 3 months post-discharge. Results indicate that low HDL is a risk marker for inpatient and post-discharge violence in acute psychiatry and also suggest gender differences in HDL as a risk marker for violence."}, {"Title": "The Ethics of Clinical Trials Research in Severe Mood Disorders.", "Abstract": "Mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), are highly prevalent, frequently disabling, and sometimes deadly. Additional research and more effective medications are desperately needed, but clinical trials research in mood disorders is fraught with ethical issues. Although many authors have discussed these issues, most do so from a theoretical viewpoint. This manuscript uses available empirical data to inform a discussion of the primary ethical issues raised in mood disorders research. These include issues of consent and decision-making capacity, including patients' motivations for participating in research. We also address drug withdrawals, placebo controls, and the overall safety of research. Finally, we examine the extant literature for studies discussing potential indirect benefits of clinical trials research to participants. Taken together, the evidence suggests that clinical trials research incorporating drug withdrawals and placebo controls can be conducted safely and ethically, even in patients with severe or treatment-resistant mood disorders. In fact, given the dearth of effective treatment options for this population, it is our opinion that a moral imperative exists to extend the offer of research participation to severely ill or treatment-resistant groups."}, {"Title": "David Stafford-Clark (1916-1999): Seeing through a celebrity psychiatrist.", "Abstract": "This article uses the mass-media career of the British psychiatrist David Stafford-Clark (1916-1999) as a case study in the exercise of cultural authority by celebrity medical professionals in post-war Britain. Stafford-Clark rose to prominence in the mass media, particularly through his presenting work on medical and related topics for BBC TV and Radio, and was in the vanguard of psychiatrists and physicians who eroded professional edicts on anonymity. At the height of his career, he traded upon his celebrity status, and consequent cultural authority, to deliver mass media sermons on a variety of social, cultural, and political topics. Stafford-Clark tried to preserve his sense of personal and intellectual integrity by clinging to a belief that his authority in the public sphere was ultimately to be vindicated by his literary, intellectual, and spiritual significance. But as his credibility dwindled, he came to distrust the cultural intermediaries, such as broadcasters and publishers, who had supported him."}, {"Title": "Athanasios Koukopoulos' Psychiatry: The Primacy of Mania and the Limits of Antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Athanasios Koukopoulos provided a radical model for understanding depressive and manic conditions.\nTo review, explain, and analyze Koukopoulos' concept of the primacy of mania, with special attention to the role of antidepressants.\nA conceptual review of Koukopoulos' writings and lectures on this topic is given.\nKoukopoulos held that depressive states are caused by manic states; the former do not occur without the latter. The most common scenario of the inseparability of depressive and manic symptoms occurs in mixed states, which we estimate to represent about one-half of all depressive episodes in all patients (not just bipolar illness). In a review of the empirical evidence for this topic, we conclude that empirical evidence exists to support the primary of mania thesis in almost 80% of depressed patients. Since antidepressants worsen mania, they would be expected to worsen depression as well in this model. We provide evidence that supports this view in most persons with depressive states.\nKoukopoulos' model of affective illness is one where manic states are the primary pathology, and depressive conditions are a secondary consequence. Hence treatment of depression with antidepressants would be less effective than treatment with mood stabilizers, since treating an effect is less successful than treating its cause. This approach would reverse current assumptions in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Involuntary Psychiatric Admissions and Development of Psychiatric Services as an Alternative to Full-Time Hospitalization in France.", "Abstract": "The development of alternatives to full-time hospitalization in psychiatry is limited because consensus about the benefits of such alternatives is lacking. This study assessed whether the development of such alternatives in French psychiatric sectors was associated with a reduction in involuntary inpatient care, taking into account other factors that are potentially associated with involuntary admission.\nData on whether a patient had at least one involuntary full-time admission in 2012 were extracted from the French national discharge database for psychiatric care. The development of alternatives to full-time hospitalization was estimated as the percentage of human resources allocated to these alternatives out of all human resources allocated to psychiatry, measured at the level of the hospital hosting each sector. Other factors potentially associated with involuntary admission (characteristics of patients, health care providers, and the environment) were extracted from administrative databases, and a multilevel logistic model was carried out to account for the nested structure of the data.\nSignificant variations were observed between psychiatric sectors in rates of involuntary inpatient admissions. A large portion of the variation was explained by characteristics of the sectors. A significant negative association was found between involuntary admissions and the development of alternatives to full-time hospitalization, after adjustment for other factors associated with involuntary admissions.\nFindings suggest that the development of alternatives to full-time hospitalization is beneficial for quality of care, given that it is negatively associated with involuntary full-time admissions. The reduction of such admissions aligns with international recommendations for psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Clinical Decision Making and Mental Health Service Use Among Persons With Severe Mental Illness Across Europe.", "Abstract": "The study explored relationships between preferences for and experiences of clinical decision making (CDM) with service use among persons with severe mental illness.\nData from a prospective observational study in six European countries were examined.

Molecular genetics shows that thousands of common and rare genetic variants contribute to mental illness. Epidemiological studies have identified dozens of environmental exposures that are associated with psychopathology. The effect of environment is likely conditional on genetic factors, resulting in gene-environment interactions. The impact of environmental factors also depends on previous exposures, resulting in environment-environment interactions. Most known genetic and environmental factors are shared across multiple mental disorders. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, in particular, are closely causally linked. Synthesis of findings from twin studies, molecular genetics and epidemiological research suggests that joint consideration of multiple genetic and environmental factors has much greater explanatory power than separate studies of genetic or environmental causation. Multi-factorial gene-environment interactions are likely to be a generic mechanism involved in the majority of cases of mental illness, which is only partially tapped by existing gene-environment studies. Future research may cut across psychiatric disorders and address poly-causation by considering multiple genetic and environmental measures across the life course with a specific focus on the first two decades of life. Integrative analyses of poly-causation including gene-environment and environment-environment interactions can realize the potential for discovering causal types and mechanisms that are likely to generate new preventive and therapeutic tools."}, {"Title": "World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for biological treatment of schizophrenia - a short version for primary care.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder and many patients are treated in primary care settings.

Teams developed 90 curricular products and had 57 presentations and publications. Residents reported satisfaction with the SBIRT activities. Champions reported that SBIRT was a useful approach and that they gained valuable knowledge and relationships from working with the executive team when designing learning materials appropriate for their residency. Champions successfully incorporated SBIRT into routine clinical practice.\nHaving a strong team to support subsequent SBIRT champions was essential for implementation. The champions needed financial support to have the necessary time to implement training. The strategy of building a peer network across programs was critical for sustaining the implementation.

We aimed at studying psychiatric comorbidities, environmental triggers, lifestyle factors, and intensity of CDH in patients referred by the department of neurology from 2011 to 2014. <b>Method:</b> Through medical and psychiatric interviews and using 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS), we assessed patients with CDH, using a checklist, to elicit psychiatric comorbidities, intensity of CDH, environmental factors, and lifestyle derangement. <b>Results:</b> We interviewed 413 (age 16-80 years, mean 40 +/- 14.0) out of 548 patients; 312 (75.5%) were married, and 282 (68.1%) were female. Environmental triggers (374, 90.6%) were the most common cause of CDH, while 214 (51.8%) had no compliance to recommended nutrition. Exercise avoidance (201, 48.7%) was the less prevalent lifestyle factor. Of the patients, 372 (90.1%) were stressed and 162 (39.2%) had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which were the most and less prevalent psychiatric comorbidities, respectively. Intensity of pain was moderate to severe (mean score = 7.1+/- 1.9), while females reported higher VAS scores (p<0.02). Patients with previous history of psychotherapy reported higher score of VAS (p<0.001). Those patients living with a person suffering from head pain reported more VAS score (p<0.003). <b>Conclusion</b>: Notable psychiatric comorbidities were found in patients with CDH, many of which are modifiable such as environmental triggers and unhealthy lifestyle. In heavily populated cities, these factors may double the burden of the CDH by precipitating new or exacerbating previous psychiatric comorbidities.

Importantly, the medial and lateral OFC (mOFC and lOFC) circuits have functionally and anatomically distinct connectivity profiles which differentially contribute to the various aspects of goal-directed behavior. OFC corticostriatal circuits have been consistently implicated across a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and substance use disorders (SUDs). Furthermore, psychiatric disorders related to OFC corticostriatal dysfunction can be addressed via conventional and novel neurostimulatory techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such techniques elicit changes in OFC corticostriatal activity, resulting in changes in clinical symptomatology. Here we review the available literature regarding how disturbances in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal functioning may lead to psychiatric symptomatology in the aforementioned disorders, and how psychiatric treatments may exert their therapeutic effect by rectifying abnormal OFC corticostriatal activity. First, we review the role of OFC corticostriatal circuits in reward-guided learning, decision-making, affect regulation and reappraisal. Second, we discuss the role of OFC corticostriatal circuit dysfunction across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Third, we review available evidence that the therapeutic mechanisms of various neuromodulation techniques may directly involve rectifying abnormal activity in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal circuits. Finally, we examine the potential of future applications of therapeutic brain stimulation targeted at OFC circuitry; specifically, the role of OFC brain stimulation in the growing field of individually-tailored therapies and personalized medicine in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Revisiting the etiological aspects of dissociative identity disorder: a biopsychosocial perspective.", "Abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a chronic post-traumatic disorder where developmentally stressful events in childhood, including abuse, emotional neglect, disturbed attachment, and boundary violations are central and typical etiological factors. Familial, societal, and cultural factors may give rise to the trauma and/or they may influence the expression of DID. Memory and the construction of self-identity are cognitive processes that appear markedly and centrally disrupted in DID and are related to its etiology. Enduring decoupling of psychological modes may create separate senses of self, and metamemory processes may be involved in interidentity amnesia. Neurobiological differences have been demonstrated between dissociative identities within patients with DID and between patients with DID and controls. Given the current evidence, DID as a diagnostic entity cannot be explained as a phenomenon created by iatrogenic influences, suggestibility, malingering, or social role-taking. On the contrary, DID is an empirically robust chronic psychiatric disorder based on neurobiological, cognitive, and interpersonal non-integration as a response to unbearable stress. While current evidence is sufficient to firmly establish this etiological stance, given the wide opportunities for innovative research, the disorder is still understudied. Comparison of well-selected samples of DID patients with non-dissociative subjects who have other psychiatric disorders would further delineate the neurobiological and cognitive features of the disorder, whereas genetic research on DID would further illuminate the interaction of the individual with environmental stress. As such, DID may be seen as an exemplary disease model of the biopsychosocial paradigm in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and prognosis of stress disorders: a review of the epidemiologic literature.", "Abstract": "Given the ubiquity of traumatic events, it is not surprising that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - a common diagnosis following one of these experiences - is characterized as conferring a large burden for individuals and society. Although there is recognition of the importance of PTSD diagnoses throughout psychiatry, the literature on other diagnoses one may receive following a stressful or traumatic event is scant. This review summarizes the literature on stress disorders (classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition [ICD-10]), including acute stress reaction, PTSD, adjustment disorder and unspecified stress reactions. This review focuses on the literature related to common psychiatric and somatic consequences of these disorders. The prevalence and incidence of each disorder are described. A review of epidemiologic studies on comorbid mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety and substance abuse, is included, as well as a review of epidemiologic studies on somatic outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the current literature on all-cause mortality and suicide following stress disorder diagnoses is reviewed. Stress disorders are a critical public health issue with potentially deleterious outcomes that have a significant impact on those living with these disorders, the health care system and society. It is only through an awareness of the impact of stress disorders that appropriate resources can be allocated to prevention and treatment. Future research should expand the work done to date beyond the examination of PTSD, so that the field may obtain a more complete picture of the impact all stress disorders have on the many people living with these diagnoses."}, {"Title": "Speaking fluently with baclofen?", "Abstract": "Baclofen is a new and promising pharmacological compound for the treatment of alcohol dependence (AD). Although several randomised trials found a reduction of craving and higher abstinence rates with low and high doses of baclofen, others failed to show positive effects. In this case study, the successful treatment of a patient with AD with daily 120\u2009mg of baclofen is described. In addition to a decrease in alcohol use, we observed the cessation of stuttering during treatment with baclofen, reoccurrence of stuttering following discontinuation, and cessation of stuttering after reinstatement of the treatment. Based on this observation, the direct effects of baclofen on muscle relaxation and anxiety reduction and its indirect effect on dopaminergic inhibition, we believe that baclofen might be a new treatment for stuttering. Further research into the effect of baclofen on stuttering is warranted."}, {"Title": "Identifying Patient and Provider-specific Gaps in Care Among Patients With Hepatitis B.", "Abstract": "To examine patient, provider, and health system barriers to clinical follow-up among US veterans with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV).\nStudies have demonstrated deficiencies in clinical care and follow-up in HBV; however, patient, provider, and health-system barriers in non-Asian populations are understudied.\nA retrospective cohort of 517 US veterans with chronic HBV at 3 diverse Veterans Affairs sites from 1999 to 2015. Laboratory testing and completion of clinical appointments were collected for 2 years following initial presentation.\nAmong HBV patients, 36% had drug abuse, 41% alcohol misuse, and 45% had psychiatric disorders. Patients had an average of 4.4 primary care visits within 2 years of the index hepatitis B surface antigen positive result, 38% had psychiatry visits, 21% had a psychiatric hospitalization; 26% saw gastroenterology/hepatology specialists. Within 1 year of the index hepatitis B surface antigen positive result, 75% had alanine aminotransferase testing, 14% had HBV entered into the problem list, and 8% had serologic confirmation.

Any claim that cannot be objectively demonstrated has no place in science, because the subject does not deviate from the role, which it has set out to play in the life of mankind. Psychiatry, as a scientific discipline, plays along these basic principles. In the etiology, symptomatology, and management of psychiatric disorders, the biopsychosocial model recognizes the role of biological, psychological, and social factors.

However, some patients may suffer from post-surgical depression and post-surgical increased suicide rates have been reported for breast augmentation patients. Difficulty adapting to the new image, unfulfilled psychological needs expected to be met by the surgery, side effects of the surgery like tissue swelling or bruising, uncontrolled pain, presence of body dysmorphic disorder and previous history of mood disorder may be some of the risk factors for post-surgical depression.\nHere, we present a case without prior psychiatric history who developed major depressive disorder after hair transplantation and died of suicide.\nHe started experiencing religious struggle related to his decision about the hair transplant which he interpreted as acting against God's will. While religious involvement has been reported to be a protective factor against depression, spiritual struggle, which includes religious guilt, has been described as an important risk factor for depression, hopelessness and suicidality which might explain the severity of depression in our patient.\nThis case highlights the importance of a detailed psychiatric evaluation and exploration of religious concerns of any patient before any type of aesthetic surgery. Major depressive disorder is a treatable condition; however, mild depression can go unnoticed. Religious belief and related religious practices affect an individual's personal health attitudes; therefore, we think that every physician is needed to explore the religious concerns of any patient during any medical examination or surgical procedure. Relevant religious authorities should be consulted when necessary."}, {"Title": "Prescribing pattern of psychotropic medications in child psychiatric practice in a mental referral hospital in Botswana.", "Abstract": "There is a growing preference for psycho-pharmacological therapy over non-pharmacological care. The prescription pattern and the choice of psychotropic medications vary in different settings. Whilst newer agents and rational prescribing are favored in the more specialized settings, the pattern remains unclear in less specialized units, largely due to lack of data. The aims were to conduct a treatment audit in the only mental referral hospital in Botswana, which is a non-specialized child and adolescent care setting and see how it conforms to best practice.\nA retrospective audit which involved the extraction of socio-demographic and clinical information from the records of patients who were \u2264 17 years and seen from January 1, 2012-July 31, 2016.\nA total of 238 files were used for this report. Mean age (SD) was 12.41 (4.1) years. Of the 120 (50.4%) patients who had pharmacological intervention, only 85(70.8%) had monotherapy. The most commonly prescribed psychotropic agents were antipsychotics (40%). Off-label use of antipsychotics and polypharmacy were 31.2% and 29.2% respectively.\nThe level of conformity to standard practice in terms of psychotropic prescribing in our setting is consistent with the reports from developed countries where more specialized care ostensibly exists.

Additional data collected included general demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and questionnaires evaluating depression and anxiety symptoms. Statistical analyses utilizing SPSS were performed to determine the prevalence of OSA and EDS, as well as their respective associations with patient profiles.\nOur results showed that 39.5% of participants were found to have a high risk of sleep apnea and 9.9% of the participants were found to have abnormal daytime sleepiness. The risk of developing OSA was associated with a higher body mass index (BMI) (<i>P</i>=0.02), and depression severity (patient health questionnaire 9 score) (<i>P</i>=0.01). Increasing severity of depressive symptoms was associated with a higher risk of sleep apnea (<i>P</i>=0.01). BMI (odds ratio [OR] =5.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-18.82) and depression severity (OR =4.04, 95% CI 1.80-9.07) were also found to be predictors of OSA. The psychiatric diagnoses of the participants were not found to have a significant association with the risk of sleep apnea.\nThe risk of OSA is increased among hospitalized psychiatric patients, and this condition can have detrimental effects on psychiatric patients. OSA appears to be under-recognized in this population, psychiatrists should screen for OSA in hospitalized psychiatric patients and refer them for diagnostic testing or treatment when indicated."}, {"Title": "Mutual associations between intellectual disability and epilepsy-related psychiatry disability: Population-based study.", "Abstract": "Epilepsy is the third-leading cause of psychiatry disability in China, and intellectual disability (ID) is also 1 major type of disabilities in China.

Previous studies had recruited older (63-65 years) patients with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine, 1.3-1.4 mg/dl). A 2012 report in the <i>Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry</i> described tolvaptan as a \"lifesaving drug\". A major outcome concern in the treatment of chronic hyponatremia is potentially fatal pontine demyelination from over-rapid correction of serum sodium >0.5 mEq/dL/h. The maximum reported correction of serum sodium within 24 hours was 13 mEq/L in a case of SIADH. We recently experienced the dramatic correction of hyponatremia at 1 mEq/dL/h over 18 hours, following 15 mg of oral tolvaptan in a 32-year old male patient with normal kidney function (serum creatinine 0.76 mg/dL), following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Tolvaptan is indeed an effective and life-saving drug for post-TBI hyponatremia.

All the patients were observed during a clinical acute and postacute phase. Patients were prescribed 50-800 mg of quetiapine. Patients were evaluated at baseline, after 15 days and after 3 months using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale with particular reference to the dimensions of depression, anxiety, and hostility. The plasma concentrations of quetiapine and N-desalkylquetiapine were determined after 3 months using blood samples taken at steady state.\nThere was a significant relationship between the N-desalkylquetiapine/quetiapine ratio and the improvement in the depression dimension, and there was not a significant relationship between the N-desalkylquetiapine/quetiapine ratio and anxiety and hostility improvement. Quetiapine treatment was well tolerated, and there were no extrapyramidal, anticholinergic, or other side effects to note. There was no relationship between plasma quetiapine or N-desalkylquetiapine concentrations and side effects.\nOur findings confirm the efficacy of quetiapine on depressive symptoms, and the available data support that quetiapine's antidepressant activity is mediated by the active metabolite norquetiapine, and it exemplifies the case of an active metabolite that can make a drug like quetiapine originally introduced as an antipsychotic a useful antidepressant agent."}, {"Title": "A pharmacodynamic modelling and simulation study identifying gender differences of daily olanzapine dose and dopamine D2-receptor occupancy.", "Abstract": "Gender differences in treatment response rates for patients treated with antipsychotics are known.

However, this region is of special interest to affective neuroscience and psychiatry. The Multi-echo EPI (MEPI) approach has several advantages over EPI but its performance against EPI in the vmPFC has not yet been examined in a study with sufficient statistical power using a task specifically eliciting activity in this region. We used a fear conditioning task with MEPI to compare the performance of MEPI and EPI in vmPFC and control regions in 32 healthy young subjects. We analyzed activity associated with short (12ms), standard (29ms) and long (46ms) echo times, and a voxel-wise combination of these three echo times. Behavioral data revealed successful differentiation of the conditioned versus safety stimulus; activity in the vmPFC was shown by the contrast \"safety stimulus > conditioned stimulus\" as in previous research and proved significantly stronger with the combined MEPI than standard single-echo EPI. Then, we aimed to demonstrate that the additional cluster extent (ventral extension) detected in the vmPFC with MEPI reflects activation in a relevant cluster (i.e., not just non-neuronal noise). To do this, we used resting state data from the same subjects to show that the time-course of this region was both connected to bilateral amygdala and the default mode network. Overall, we demonstrate that MEPI (by means of the weighted sum combination approach) outperforms standard EPI in vmPFC; MEPI performs always at least as good as the best echo time for a given brain region but provides all necessary echo times for an optimal BOLD sensitivity for the whole brain. This is relevant for affective neuroscience and psychiatry given the critical role of the vmPFC in emotion regulation."}, {"Title": "Population Pharmacokinetics of Valproic Acid in Patients with Mania: Implication for Individualized Dosing Regimens.", "Abstract": "This study characterized the population pharmacokinetic properties of valproic acid in patients with mania and determined potential factors that affect the pharmacokinetic properties of valproic acid in this population.\nRoutine therapeutic drug monitoring of valproic acid concentrations, demographic data, and concomitant medications from 206 hospitalized patients with mania were retrospectively collected from Somdet Chaopraya Institute of Psychiatry and Srithanya Hospital, Thailand. Nonlinear mixed-effect modeling was used for data analysis. Covariate model building was conducted using stepwise forward addition and stepwise backward elimination. The final model was evaluated using bootstrap analysis and normalized prediction distribution error. The results were compared with those previously reported in patients with epilepsy given that there is an evidence of a difference in valproic acid clearance between patients with mania and those with epilepsy.\nValproic acid data were adequately described by a 1-compartment model. Significant predictors for valproic acid clearance included valproic acid dose and weight. The population estimates for valproic acid CL/F and V/F were 0.464 L/h and 23.3 L, respectively. Valproic acid clearance obtained from this study did not seem to be significantly different from that of patients with epilepsy.\nA qualified population pharmacokinetic model for valproic acid in patients with mania was developed. This model could be used to optimize valproic acid therapy in patients with mania. Valproic acid clearance could be predicted from valproic acid dose and weight of patients. This predicted clearance can subsequently be used for individualization of optimum valproic acid maintenance dose."}, {"Title": "[Mindful neuropsychology: Mindfulness-based cognitive remediation].", "Abstract": "Mindfulness based interventions (MBI) have recently gained much interest in western medicine. MBSR paradigm is based on teaching participants to pay complete attention to the present experience and act nonjudgmentally towards stressful events. During this mental practice the meditator focuses his or her attention on the sensations of the body. While the distractions (mental images, thoughts, emotional or somatic states) arise the participant is taught to acknowledge discursive thoughts and cultivate the state of awareness without immediate reaction. The effectiveness of these programs is well documented in the field of emotional response regulation in depression (relapse prevention), anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder or eating disorders. Furthermore, converging lines of evidence support the hypothesis that mindfulness practice improves cognition, especially the ability to sustain attention and think in a more flexible manner. Nevertheless, formal rehabilitation programs targeting cognitive disturbances resulting from psychiatric (depression, disorder bipolar, schizophrenia) or neurologic conditions (brain injury, dementia) seldom rely on MBI principles. This review of literature aims at discussing possible links between MBI and clinical neuropsychology.\nWe conducted a review of literature using electronic databases up to December 2016, screening studies with variants of the keywords (\"Mindfulness\", \"MBI\", \"MBSR\", \"Meditation\") OR/AND (\"Cognition\", \"Attention\", \"Executive function\", \"Memory\", \"Learning\") RESULTS: In the first part, we describe key concepts of the neuropsychology of attention in the light of Posner's model of attention control. We also underline the potential scope of different therapeutic contexts where disturbances of attention may be clinically relevant. Second, we review the efficacy of MBI in the field of cognition (thinking disturbances, attention biases, memory and executive processes impairment or low metacognitive abilities), mood (emotional dysregulation, anxiety, depression, mood shifts) and somatic preoccupations (stress induced immune dysregulation, chronic pain, body representation, eating disorders, sleep quality, fatigue). In psychiatry, these three components closely coexist and interact which explains the complexity of patient assessment and care. Numerous studies show that meditation inspired interventions offer a promising solution in the prevention and rehabilitation of cognitive impairment. In the last part, we discuss the benefits and risks of integrating meditation practice into broader programs of cognitive remediation and therapeutic education in patients suffering from cognitive disorders. We propose a number of possible guidelines for developing mindfulness inspired cognitive remediation tools. Along with Jon Kabatt Zinn (Kabatt-Zinn & Maskens, 2012), we suggest that the construction of neuropsychological tools relies on seven attitudinal foundations of mindfulness practice.\nThis paper highlights the importance of referring to holistic approaches such as MBI when dealing with patients with neuropsychological impairment, especially in the field of psychiatry. We advocate introducing mindfulness principles in order to help patients stabilize their attention and improve cognitive flexibility. We believe this transition in neuropsychological care may offer an interesting paradigm shift promoting a more efficient approach towards cognition and its links to emotion, body, and environment."}, {"Title": "[Impact of a Multimodal Intervention on the Psychological Profile of Schizophrenic and Bipolar I Patients: A Study of PRISMA Program].", "Abstract": "Bipolar Disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are included in the group of severe mental illness and are main causes of disability and morbidity in the local population due to the bio-psycho-social implications in patients.

The MI group received care from psychiatry, general medicine, neuropsychology, family therapy, and occupational therapy. The TI group received care from psychiatry and general medicine. The Hamilton and Young scales, and the Scales for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Postive Symptoms (SAPS) were used on bipolar and schizophrenic patients, respectively. The scales AQ-12, TEMPS-A, FAST, Zuckerman sensation seeking scale, BIS-11, SAI-E and EEAG were applied to measure the psychological variables. The scales were performed before and after the interventions. The psychotherapy used in this study was cognitive behavioural therapy.\nThere were statistically significant differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables in the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder group. There were no statistically significant differences in the psychological scales after conducting a multivariate analysis between the intervention groups and for both times (initial and final).\nThis study did not show any changes in variables of psychological functioning variables between bipolar and schizophrenic groups, who were subjected to TI vs MI (who received cognitive behavioural therapy).

Within a short time following his treatise, it became all too clear to those in the field that Parkinson's disease is more than just a motor disorder, and as was aptly conceptualized by Paul McHugh, Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1975 until 2001, Parkinson's disease is closer to being a \"triadic disorder,\" encompassing motor, cognitive, and psychiatric elements (McHugh, 1989).

A second sample of 41 attendees were included for the test-retest analysis. Exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha analysis, Pearson correlations and paired-samples t-tests were performed.\nExploratory factor analysis indicated one factor, which was in line with the intentions of the scale. The alpha value was 0.85 and all CITC were above 0.30. The tests for convergent validity resulted in correlations ranging between 0.23 and 0.47, most of which were moderately strong and mainly confirmed the hypotheses. Discriminant validity was clearly indicated, since all correlations with the selected constructs were <0.20. GOES also showed preliminary test-retest stability (r\u2009=\u20090.32).\nThe GOES is ready for use in rehabilitation services and research where productive and other types of activities are of interest.

This paper describes the Principles Unite Local Services Assisting Recovery (PULSAR) Specialist Care trial protocol for a recovery-oriented practice training intervention delivered to specialist mental health services staff. The primary aim is to evaluate whether adult consumers accessing services where staff have received the intervention report superior recovery outcomes compared to adult consumers accessing services where staff have not yet received the intervention. A qualitative sub-study aims to examine staff and consumer views on implementing recovery-oriented practice. A process evaluation sub-study aims to articulate important explanatory variables affecting the interventions rollout and outcomes.\nThe mixed methods design incorporates a two-step stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) examining cross-sectional data from three phases, and nested qualitative and process evaluation sub-studies. Participating specialist mental health care services in Melbourne, Victoria are divided into 14 clusters with half randomly allocated to receive the staff training in year one and half in year two. Research participants are consumers aged 18-75\u00a0years who attended the cluster within a previous three-month period either at baseline, 12 (step 1) or 24\u00a0months (step 2). In the two nested sub-studies, participation extends to cluster staff. The primary outcome is the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery collected from 756 consumers (252 each at baseline, step 1, step 2). Secondary and other outcomes measuring well-being, service satisfaction and health economic impact are collected from a subset of 252 consumers (63 at baseline; 126 at step 1; 63 at step 2) via interviews. Interview-based longitudinal data are also collected 12\u00a0months apart from 88 consumers with a psychotic disorder diagnosis (44 at baseline, step 1; 44 at step 1, step 2). cRCT data will be analyzed using multilevel mixed-effects modelling to account for clustering and some repeated measures, supplemented by thematic analysis of qualitative interview data.

He formulated the concept of anxiety sensitivity, an individual difference variable signifying a person's proneness to respond fearfully to bodily sensations that accompany anxiety. He was the key developer of the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), a self-report measure of the fear of anxiety sensations translated into more than 20 languages. Reiss was a pioneer in the field of dual diagnosis-the study and treatment of mental disorders in people with intellectual disabilities. Reiss's third major field of inquiry was human motivation. For the past 20 years, he has been studying individual differences in motivational profiles. To measure individual differences in 16 basic desires, he developed the Reiss Motivation Profile.

Hyperconnectivity in the default mode network has been associated with psychopathology, but psychedelic serotonin agonists like psilocybin may profoundly disrupt these dysfunctional neural network circuits and provide a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. We have reviewed the current literature to investigate the efficacy and safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. There were seven clinical trials that investigated psilocybin-assisted therapy as a treatment for psychiatric disorders related to anxiety, depression, and substance use. All trials demonstrated reductions in psychiatric rating scale scores or increased response and remission rates. There were large effect sizes related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. Psilocybin may also potentially reduce alcohol or tobacco use and increase abstinence rates in addiction, but the benefits of these two trials were less clear due to open-label study designs without statistical analysis. Psilocybin-assisted therapy efficacy and safety appear promising, but more robust clinical trials will be required to support FDA approval and identify the potential role in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Should a routine genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms be recommended to predict venlafaxine efficacy in depressed patients treated in psychiatric settings?", "Abstract": "The antidepressant venlafaxine (VEN) is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.

The availability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to directly probe virtually any cortical areas, thus providing a unique way to assess the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons. This article presents a review of studies employing TMS in combination with Motor Evoked Potentials (TMS/MEPs) and high density Electroencephalogram (TMS/hd-EEG) in schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Studies were identified by conducting a PubMed search using the following search item: \"transcranial magnetic stimulation and (Schizophrenia or OCD or MDD or ADHD)\". Studies that utilized TMS/MEP and/or TMS/hd-EEG measures to characterize cortical excitability, inhibition, oscillatory activity, and/or connectivity in psychiatric patients were selected. Across disorders, patients displayed a pattern of reduced cortical inhibition, and to a lesser extent increased excitability, in the motor cortex, which was most consistently established in Schizophrenia. Furthermore, psychiatric patients showed abnormalities in a number of TMS-evoked EEG oscillations, which was most prominent in the prefrontal cortex of Schizophrenia relative to healthy comparison subjects. Overall, results from this review point to significant impairments in cortical excitability, inhibition, and oscillatory activity, especially in frontal areas, in several major psychiatric disorders. Building on these findings, future studies employing TMS-based experimental paradigms may help elucidating the neurobiology of these psychiatric disorders, and may assess the contribution of TMS-related measures in monitoring and possibly maximizing the effectiveness of treatment interventions in psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Why Psychiatry Needs 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine: A Child Psychiatrist's Perspective.", "Abstract": "Since the late 1980s the psychoactive drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has had a well-known history as the recreationally used drug ecstasy. What is less well known by the public is that MDMA started its life as a therapeutic agent and that in recent years an increasing amount of clinical research has been undertaken to revisit the drug's medical potential. MDMA has unique pharmacological properties that translate well to its proposed agent to assist trauma-focused psychotherapy. Psychological trauma-especially that which arises early in life from child abuse-underpins many chronic adult mental disorders, including addictions. Several studies of recent years have investigated the potential role of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, with ongoing plans to see MDMA therapy licensed and approved within the next 5 years. Issues of safety and controversy frequently surround this research, owing to MDMA's often negative media-driven bias. However, accurate examination of the relative risks and benefits of clinical MDMA-in contrast to the recreational use of ecstasy-must be considered when assessing its potential benefits and the merits of future research.

In the current study, caregivers of 61 adolescent girls and women with ASD and 223 boys and men with ASD completed an online survey. Descriptive analyses were conducted to better understand the clinical needs and associated service use patterns of girls and women with ASD. Sex/gender comparisons were made of individuals' clinical needs and service use. Adolescent girls and women with ASD had prevalent co-occurring mental and physical conditions and parents reported elevated levels of caregiver strain. Multiple service use was common across age groups, particularly among adolescent girls and women with intellectual disability. Overall, few sex/gender differences emerged, although a significantly greater proportion of girls and women accessed psychiatry and emergency department services as compared to boys and men. Though the current study is limited by its use of parent report and small sample size, it suggests that girls and women with ASD may share many of the same high clinical needs and patterns of services use as boys and men with ASD.

The SAD PERSONS suicide risk assessment scale is widely implemented in clinical settings despite limited supporting evidence. This article aims to determine the ability of the SAD PERSONS scale (SPS) to predict future suicide in the emergency department.\nFive thousand four hundred sixty-two consecutive adults were seen by psychiatry consultation teams in two tertiary emergency departments with linkage to population-based administrative data to determine suicide deaths within 6 months, 1, and 5 years.\nSeventy-seven (1.4%) individuals died by suicide during the study period. When predicting suicide at 12 months, medium- and high-risk scores on SPS had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 60%; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.9 and 99%, respectively. Half of the suicides at both 6- and 12-month intervals were classified as low risk by SPS at index visit. The area under the curve at 12 months for the Modified SPS was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] range 0.51-0.67). High-risk scores (compared to low risk) were significantly associated with death by suicide over the 5-year study period using the SPS (hazard ratio 2.49; 95% CI 1.34-4.61) and modified version (hazard ratio 2.29; 95% CI 1.24-2.29).\nAlthough widely used in educational and clinical settings, these findings do not support the use of the SPS and Modified SPS to predict suicide in adults seen by psychiatric services in the emergency department."}, {"Title": "'Mechanical restraint-confounders, risk, alliance score': testing the clinical validity of a new risk assessment instrument.", "Abstract": "Unstructured risk assessment, as well as confounders (underlying reasons for the patient's risk behaviour and alliance), risk behaviour, and parameters of alliance, have been identified as factors that prolong the duration of mechanical restraint among forensic mental health inpatients.\nTo clinically validate a new, structured short-term risk assessment instrument called the Mechanical Restraint-Confounders, Risk, Alliance Score (MR-CRAS), with the intended purpose of supporting the clinicians' observation and assessment of the patient's readiness to be released from mechanical restraint.\nThe content and layout of MR-CRAS and its user manual were evaluated using face validation by forensic mental health clinicians, content validation by an expert panel, and pilot testing within two, closed forensic mental health inpatient units.\nThe three sub-scales (Confounders, Risk, and a parameter of Alliance) showed excellent content validity. The clinical validations also showed that MR-CRAS was perceived and experienced as a comprehensible, relevant, comprehensive, and useable risk assessment instrument.\nMR-CRAS contains 18 clinically valid items, and the instrument can be used to support the clinical decision-making regarding the possibility of releasing the patient from mechanical restraint.\nThe present three studies have clinically validated a short MR-CRAS scale that is currently being psychometrically tested in a larger study."}, {"Title": "Systematic assessment of environmental risk factors for bipolar disorder: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.", "Abstract": "The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder is likely to involve both genetic and environmental risk factors.

Only irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) emerged as a risk factor for BD supported by convincing evidence (k=6; odds ratio [OR]=2.48; 95% CI=2.35-2.61; P<.001), and childhood adversity was supported by highly suggestive evidence. Asthma and obesity were risk factors for BD supported by suggestive evidence, and seropositivity to Toxoplasma gondii and a history of head injury were supported by weak evidence.\nNotwithstanding that several environmental risk factors for BD were identified, few meta-analyses of observational studies were available.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between irritability and symptom burden, functioning, quality of life, social support, suicidality, and overall illness severity in a naturalistic cohort of people with bipolar I or schizoaffective disorder.\nWe used data from 239 adult outpatients with bipolar I or schizoaffective disorder in the Bipolar Comprehensive Outcomes Study (BCOS) - a non-interventional observational study with a 2-year follow-up period. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with and without irritability were compared. A mixed-model repeated measures analysis was conducted to examine the longitudinal effect of irritability on clinical and quality-of-life variables over follow-up using significant baseline variables.\nAt baseline, 54% of participants were irritable. Baseline irritability was associated with illness severity, mania, depression, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, poor functioning, and quality of life, but not diagnosis (schizoaffective/bipolar disorder). Participants with irritability were less likely to have a partner and perceived less adequate social support. On average, over follow-up, those with irritability reported more symptoms, functional impairment, and suicidality. Furthermore, the effects of irritability could not be fully explained by illness severity.\nIrritability was associated with more negative symptomatic, functional, and quality-of-life outcomes and suicidality.

A response integrating the experiences and views of service users with critical reflections of psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "While therapeutic relationships are appropriately recognised as the foundation of mental health service, service users commonly report suboptimal experiences. With shared understanding critical to improvement in practice, we explored service users' experiences and expectations of psychiatrists and consultations, engaging psychiatrists throughout the process. Using an iterative qualitative approach we co-produced a response to the question 'what makes an excellent mental health doctor?' Experiences and expectations of psychiatrists were explored in interviews with 22 service users. Data collection, analysis and interpretation were informed by consultation with peer workers. Findings were contextualised in formal consultations with psychiatrists. As 'masters of their craft', excellent mental health doctors engage authentically with service users as people (not diagnoses). They listen, validate experiences and empathise affectively and cognitively. They demonstrate phronesis, applying clinical knowledge compassionately. Psychiatrists share service users' aspiration of equitable partnership but competing demands and 'professional boundaries' constrain engagement. Consistent delivery of the person-centred, recovery-oriented care promoted by policy and sought by service users will require substantial revision of the structure and priorities of mental health services. The insights and experiences of service users must be integral to medical education, and systems must provide robust support to psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Serum clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine levels in a CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetics within psychiatry has the potential to aid in the dose and selection of medications. A substantial number of psychiatric medications are metabolized through either of the highly polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Of these, clomipramine is subject to metabolism by both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, leaving individuals with deficiencies of these drug-metabolizing enzymes at risk of higher concentrations of the parent molecule. Herein, we present the case of a 29-year-old male with diagnoses of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder who had trialed and failed a dozen psychiatric medications, many of which are subject to metabolism by CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19, and had most recently been taking clomipramine for approximately 2.5 years. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed this patient to be an intermediate metabolizer for both CYP2C19 (*1/*2) and CYP2D6 (*4/*41), which resulted in considerably elevated serum trough concentrations of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine. This case provides a retrospective view of how the knowledge of an individual's pharmacogenetic test results can aid in their clinical care."}, {"Title": "Intracellular Fibroblast Growth Factor 14: Emerging Risk Factor for Brain Disorders.", "Abstract": "The finely tuned regulation of neuronal firing relies on the integrity of ion channel macromolecular complexes. Minimal disturbances of these tightly regulated networks can lead to persistent maladaptive plasticity of brain circuitry. The intracellular fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) belongs to the nexus of proteins interacting with voltage-gated Na+ (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels at the axonal initial segment. Through isoform-specific interactions with the intracellular C-terminal tail of neuronal Na<sub>v</sub> channels (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6), FGF14 controls channel gating, axonal targeting and phosphorylation in neurons effecting excitability. FGF14 has been also involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity and neurogenesis in the cortico-mesolimbic circuit with cognitive and affective behavioral outcomes. In translational studies, interest in FGF14 continues to rise with a growing list of associative links to diseases of the cognitive and affective domains such as neurodegeneration, depression, anxiety, addictive behaviors and recently schizophrenia, suggesting its role as a converging node in the etiology of complex brain disorders. Yet, a full understanding of FGF14 function in neurons is far from being complete and likely to involve other functions unrelated to the direct regulation of Na<sub>v</sub> channels. The goal of this Mini Review article is to provide a summary of studies on the emerging role of FGF14 in complex brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Interactions of Tryptophan and Its Catabolites With Melatonin and the Alpha 7 Nicotinic Receptor in Central Nervous System and Psychiatric Disorders: Role of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor and Direct Mitochondria Regulation.", "Abstract": "Recent work indicates an intimate interaction of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathways with the melatonergic pathways, primarily via TRYCAT pathway induction taking tryptophan away from the production of serotonin, which is a necessary precursor for the melatonergic pathways. The alpha 7 nicotinic receptor may be significantly modulated by this interaction, given its inactivation by the TRYCAT, kynurenic acid, and its induction by melatonin. Similarly, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is activated by both kynurenic acid and kynurenine, leading to CYP1A2 and melatonin metabolism, whereas melatonin may act to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. These 2 receptors and pathways may therefore be intimately linked, with relevance to a host of intracellular processes of clinical relevance. In this article, these interactions are reviewed. Interestingly, mitochondria may be a site for direct interactions of these pathways and receptors, suggesting that their differential induction may not only be modulating neuronal, glia, and immune cell processes and activity but also be directly acting to regulate mitochondrial functioning. This is likely to have significant consequences as to how an array of diverse central nervous system and psychiatric conditions are conceptualized and treated."}, {"Title": "The 'secret' source of 'female hysteria': the role that syphilis played in the construction of female sexuality and psychoanalysis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.", "Abstract": "In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the unspoken fear of syphilis played a significant role in the development of beliefs about female sexuality. Many women were afraid of sexual relationships with men because they feared contracting syphilis, which was, at that time, untreatable. Women also feared passing this disease on to their children. Women's sexual aversion, or repression, became a focus for Freud and his colleagues, whose theory of psychosexual development was based on their treatment of women. This article examines the case of Dora, the memoirs of Mabel Dodge Luhan and other sources to argue that the fear of syphilis was a significant factor in upper- and middle-class women's avoidance of heterosexual relationships. The fear of syphilis, in turn, became a significant factor in the psychoanalytic construction of female sexuality. The social suppression of the fear of syphilis has had a profound impact on theories of women's development. The implication for psychiatry is that our models of psychological development occur within a sociocultural milieu and cannot escape suppressed aspects of our culture."}, {"Title": "A substantial peer-worker workforce in a psychiatric service will improve patient outcomes - the case against.", "Abstract": "The aim of this work was to examine, via narrative review, the evidence supporting the drive for more peer workers to gauge the likely impact on patient outcomes.\nDespite considerable research into the effectiveness of peer workers in clinical psychiatry, there is insufficient evidence to support the proposition that a substantial peer workforce would improve the outcomes of people living with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and Religion: Opponents or Collaborators? The Power of Spirituality in Contemporary Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Religion and psychiatry have had complicated, sometimes neutral or friendly and cooperative, sometimes competitive and antagonistic relations over their long histories. Relations between psychiatry and religion are influenced by complex belief systems, each diverse and changing. Psychiatry has often ignored spiritual and religious dimension in health and illness while religions influenced the treatment of mental disorders directly by defining mental disorders as evil spirit possessions and prescribing exorcism as treatment. It has been a long way to prevail looking for natural over supra-natural explanations for mental disorders. Psychiatry and religion as social practices should be regarded as allies against pseudoscientific nonsense and superstitions. This alliance is based on the next evidence: 1. religious and spiritual well-being is an important component of mental health as well as of health in general; 2. research and empirical evidence reveals that healthy-minded and distorted or sick faith are quite distinct in the effects in the lives of the faithful; 3. psychiatrists are professionally expected to always respect and be sensitive to the spiritual and religious beliefs and practices of their patients; 4. religious and spiritual beliefs and practice is very important aspect of person-centered psychiatry. The enduring task for both psychiatry and religion is to enable human beings to live their lives with courage, sense, and optimism, to strive towards creating conditions of well-being and individual, public and global mental health as well as to dispel beliefs and patterns which trap people in lives of misery and mental disorders. Psychiatry and religion in creative dialogues as allies can significantly contribute to the healing of our broken world and promoting compassionate society and empathic civilization. When psychiatry and religion see each other as opponents or even enemies this is only because of their mutual misreading and pseudoscientific thinking."}, {"Title": "Cultural Sensitive Care Provision in a Public Child and Adolescent Mental Health Centre: A Case Study from the Toulouse University Hospital Intercultural Consultation.", "Abstract": "Child and adolescent mental health services in Europe are confronted with children with increasingly diverse socio-cultural backgrounds. Clinicians encounter cultural environments of hyperdiversity in terms of languages and countries of origin, growing diversity within groups, and accelerated change with regards to social and administrational situations (Hannah, in: DelVecchio Good et al. (eds) Shattering culture: American medicine responds to cultural diversity, Russel Sage Foundation, New York, 2011). Children and families who live in these complex constellations face multiple vulnerabilizing factors related to overlapping or intersecting social identities (Crenshaw in Univ Chic Leg Forum 140:139-167, 1989). Mobilizing existing resources in terms of social and family support, and encouraging creative strategies of interculturation in therapeutic work (Denoux, in: Blomart and Krewer (eds) Perspectives de l'interculturel, L'Harmattan, Paris, 1994) may be helpful in order to enhance resilience. Drawing from experiences in the context of French transcultural and intercultural psychiatry, and inspired by the Mc Gill Cultural Consultation in Child Psychiatry, we developed an innovative model, the Intercultural Consultation Service (ICS). This consultation proposes short term interventions to children and families with complex migration experiences. It has been implemented into a local public health care structure in Toulouse, the Medical and Psychological Centre la Grave. The innovation includes the creation of a specific setting for short term therapeutic interventions and team training via shared case discussions. Our objectives are (a) to improve outcomes of mental health care for the children through a better understanding of the child's family context (exploration of family dynamics and their relatedness to complex migration histories), (b) to enhance intercultural competencies in professionals via shared case discussions, and, (c) to improve the therapeutic relationship between children and professionals on the basis of the work with the family and the dialogue with the team. In our paper, we present the rationale and functioning of the ICS and illustrate our work with a case study.

Web-based portals may facilitate this shift, but little is known about how such tools are used or the role they may play in personal recovery.\nThe aim was to illustrate uses and experiences with the secure e-recovery portal \"ReConnect\" as an adjunct to ongoing community mental health care and explore its potential role in shifting practices toward recovery.\nReConnect was introduced into two Norwegian mental health care communities and used for 6 months. The aim was to support personal recovery and collaboration between service users and health care providers. Among inclusion criteria for participation were long-term care needs and at least one provider willing to interact with service users through ReConnect. The portal was designed to support ongoing collaboration as each service user-provider dyad/team found appropriate and consisted of (1) a toolbox of resources for articulating and working with recovery processes, such as status/goals/activities relative to life domains (eg, employment, social network, health), medications, network map, and exercises (eg, sleep hygiene, mindfulness); (2) messaging with providers who had partial access to toolbox content; and (3) a peer support forum. Quantitative data (ie, system log, questionnaires) were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data (eg, focus groups, forum postings) are presented relative to four recovery-oriented practice domains: personally defined recovery, promoting citizenship, working relationships, and organizational commitment.\nFifty-six participants (29 service users and 27 providers) made up 29 service user-provider dyads. Service users reported having 11 different mental health diagnoses, with a median 2 (range 1-7) diagnoses each. The 27 providers represented nine different professional backgrounds. The forum was the most frequently used module with 1870 visits and 542 postings. Service users' control over toolbox resources (eg, defining and working toward personal goals), coupled with peer support, activated service users in their personal recovery processes and in community engagement. Some providers (30%, 8/27) did not interact with service users through ReConnect. Dyads that used the portal resources did so in highly diverse ways, and participants reported needing more than 6 months to discover and adapt optimal uses relative to their individual and collaborative needs.\nRegardless of providers' portal use, service users' control over toolbox resources, coupled with peer support, offered an empowering common frame of reference that represented a shift toward recovery-oriented practices within communities. Although service users' autonomous use of the portal can eventually influence providers in the direction of recovery practices, a fundamental shift is unlikely without broader organizational commitments aligned with recovery principles (eg, quantified goals for service user involvement in care plans)."}, {"Title": "Patients on outpatient commitment orders in Northern Norway.", "Abstract": "In recent years, an increasing number of countries have introduced outpatient commitment orders (OC), which imply that patients can be subject to compulsory follow-up and treatment while living in the community.

Incidence and prevalence rates were relatively stable, but decreased during the last years of the study period. For all the 54 patients receiving their first ever OC order in 2008 and 2009, need for treatment was the reason for imposing OC, and all received psychotropic medication. The number of inpatient admissions and inpatient days was greater, while the number of days for each admission was lower three years after the OC order than three years before. The first ever OC lasted under a year for 76% of the patients. Receiving depot medication and follow-up by psychiatrists predicted longer OC durations than such treatment and care by psychologists. Only nine patients were not hospitalized during the three-year follow-up after the first ever OC order.\nPatients on first ever OC orders in Northern Norway used inpatient services more after OC orders than before.

Effective communication is fundamental to the assessment and treatment of psychiatric conditions, but there has been less attention to this in clinical practice for psychiatrists in training. This review examines the outcomes of communication skills training interventions in psychiatric specialty training.\nThe published English-language literature was examined using multiple online databases, grey literature and hand searches. The review was conducted and reported using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies examining the efficacy of communication skills training were included. Randomised controlled trials, pseudo-randomised studies and quasi-experimental studies, as well as observational analytical studies and qualitative studies that met criteria, were selected and critically appraised. No limits were applied for date of publication up until 16 July 2016.\nTotal search results yielded 2574 records. Of these, 12 studies were identified and reviewed. Two were randomised controlled trials and the remaining 10 were one-group pretest/posttest designs or posttest-only designs, including self-report evaluations of communication skills training and objective evaluations of trainee skills. There were no studies with outcomes related to behaviour change or patient outcomes. Two randomised controlled trials reported an improvement in clinician empathy and psychotherapeutic interviewing skills due to specific training protocols focused on those areas. Non-randomised studies showed varying levels of skills gains and self-reported trainee satisfaction ratings with programmes, with the intervention being some form of communication skills training.\nThe heterogeneity of communication skills training is a barrier to evaluating the efficacy of different communication skills training programmes. Further validation studies examining specific models and frameworks would support a stronger evidence base for communication skills training in psychiatry. It remains a challenge to develop research to investigate behaviour change over time in clinical practice or to measure patient outcomes due to the effects of communication skills training."}, {"Title": "Have antipsychotics a different speed of action in the acute treatment of mania?

Our sample consisted of 1187 adult, treatment-seeking OCD outpatients from the U.S. (n=236) and Brazil (n=951). With regards to the demographics, U.S. participants with OCD were older, more likely to identify as Caucasian, had achieved a higher educational level, and were less likely to be partnered when compared to Brazilians. Concerning the clinical variables, after controlling for demographics the two samples presented largely similar profiles. Brazilian participants with OCD, however, endorsed significantly greater rates of generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, whereas U.S. subjects were significantly more likely to endorse a lifetime history of addiction (alcohol-use and substance-use disorders).

Cost is the most frequently cited barrier to sustainment, yet very little is known about these costs. This study provides a method for quantifying incremental costs of an EBP compared with usual care and preliminary data on the costs in staff time, lost revenue, and other expenses of sustaining an EBP (trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy [TF-CBT]) in community mental health settings.\nFourteen community mental health agencies (CMHAs) completed a measure developed for this study to collect administrative data on implementation costs to sustain TF-CBT. Survey items captured activities that were related specifically to TF-CBT and that would not otherwise be conducted for usual care, such as TF-CBT training. Staff time in hours was converted to monetary estimates.\nCosts varied widely across agencies. Preliminary results indicated that agencies spent on average $65,192 per year (2014 U.S.$) on incremental costs for TF-CBT sustainment (excluding costs of external trainers and other support); the average incremental cost per client was $1,896.\nThe costs to sustain the EBP suggest that maintaining an EBP is a financial burden for CMHAs and that these costs can be a potential barrier to broader EBP uptake.

This project evaluated an intervention implemented in an Australian youth mental health service that utilized peer workers to promote shared decision making via an online tool.\nAll new clients ages 16-25 were invited to participate in this nonrandomized comparative study, which used a historical comparison group (N=80). Intervention participants (N=149) engaged with a peer worker and used the online tool before and during their intake assessment. Pre- and postintake data were collected for both groups; measures included decisional conflict, perceived shared decision making, and satisfaction. A series of paired t tests, analyses of variance, and multiple regressions were conducted to assess differences in scores across intervention and comparison groups and pre- and postintake assessments.\nRatings of perceived shared decision making with intake workers were higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group (p=.015). In both groups, decisional conflict scores were significantly lower after the intake assessment (p<.001 for both groups). Both perceived shared decision making and lower decisional conflict were associated with satisfaction (p<.015).\nYoung people who participated in an intervention that combined peer work and shared decision making reported feeling more involved in their assessment. Feeling involved and having lower decisional conflict after seeing an intake worker were important for client satisfaction. These findings demonstrate the importance of both peer work and shared decision making for promoting optimal outcomes in youth mental health services."}, {"Title": "Editorial: Pharmacotherapy and adolescent depression - an important treatment option.", "Abstract": "Over the past decade, rates of depression and of suicide in adolescents have been increasing (Collishaw, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 56, 2015, 370; Bor et\u00a0al., The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 48, 2014, 606). At the same time, there is some evidence that rates of diagnosis and, in the US at least, referral for depression in adolescents has been declining (Libby et\u00a0al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 66, 2009, 633; John et\u00a0al., Psychological Medicine, 46, 2016, 3315). These worrying statistics highlight the importance of disseminating accurate information about the risks and benefits of treatments for adolescent depression, in order to combat therapeutic nihilism. Extant controversy about the best ways to treat adolescent depression, and in particular with regards to the use of antidepressants, may have contributed to these trends. More specifically, we believe that some recent, high profile publications have incorrectly interpreted the benefit to risk ratio for the use of antidepressants in adolescent depression as unfavourable (e.g. Cipriani et\u00a0al., The Lancet, 388, 2016, 881).

Both prevention and therapeutic management can be offered with a better chance of success during these periods. Our specific Consultation Liaison (CL) team PPUMMA was created in order to respond to the need for early detection of psychopathology and rapid implementation of therapeutic management and preventive measure for mother and child. The importance of urgently intervening \"on site\" seemed a necessity since duration of hospitalization in maternity wards is very short. Women might not know or understand their symptoms or be ready to ask for a referral for themselves but could be ready to respond positively to a team approach where the psychiatrist is part of the Ob-Gyn department. Working with an interdisciplinary approach tends to lower stress linked to the psychiatric side of the consultation and stigma related to psychological or psychiatric issues; therefore, PPUMMA intervenes within 48\u00a0to 72hours of birth. It deals with assessment and diagnosis during the peripartum period and orientation and referral for both mother and infant when necessary after birth. The Perinatal Psychiatry emergency mobile unit PPUMMA was created in order to address these issues.\nFrom 2008\u00a0to 2015, 1907\u00a0patients were assessed but data were missing for 90\u00a0patients. We therefore analyzed 1817\u00a0patient files looking at age, diagnosis origin of referral, time of referral (pre or postpartum) and delay from referral to assessment.\nMost patients were between 20\u00a0and 40 (81.5\u00a0%). One hundred and eighteen patients were under 20\u00a0years of age, of whom 64\u00a0were minors (3.5\u00a0%), and 218\u00a0were 40\u00a0or more (12\u00a0%). These two groups were over-represented close to threefold when comparing with national birth data records. A psychologist had first seen three out of four women. Midwives and Ob-Gyn referred 9\u00a0% and 8\u00a0% of patients while Social workers sent in 4\u00a0%. Two thirds of the women were seen during pregnancy, 50\u00a0% were seen the same day and 80\u00a0% received a consultation within 72hours. Three out of five of women had an assessment that concluded in a \"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders\" type code disorder linked to stress and somatoform disorder in ICD 10 (F40-F49). This is due to a high number (47.2\u00a0%) of F43 \"Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders\". Twentynine present of women had a mood disorder (F30-39), and close to one third (31.6\u00a0%) had a personality disorder diagnosis attached. Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-F29) represented 4.4\u00a0% of diagnoses. One third of the population had comorbid disorders: meeting either two (28.5\u00a0%) or three (3.7\u00a0%) diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Most co-morbidity is due to personality disorder (82\u00a0% F60-F69).\nThe number of referrals and diagnostic criteria met show how essential a psychiatric CL team assessing and orienting women during pregnancy and immediate postpartum is. Opportunity for adaptation of treatment during the peripartum period and more long-term tailored management of disorders can be organized during this period in a multidisciplinary approach. Knowing how essential maternal mental health is for women, for infant development and for mother-infant interactions, this is a unique window for access to care and intervention. Maternal mental health is a public health issue. Access to psychiatric assessment and care during the peripartum period offers unique possibilities for prevention and care."}, {"Title": "The attitudes of psychiatrists toward people suffering from mental illnesses.", "Abstract": "Stigmatizing convictions, emotions and behaviors toward the mentally ill have impact on the social distance and more acute course of the illness. Research shows that the sufferers are the object of stigmatization also by representatives of medical professionals, including psychiatrists. The aim of the study was to examine the opinions of Polish psychiatrists regarding the mentally ill and to compare them with similar studies in the general population.\nPolish psychiatrists were the investigated group. A diagnostic survey was conducted with a self-completion questionnaire. 232 questionnaires were analyzed.\nThe results were compared with the general population. 61.5% of the respondents (59% in the general population) believe that a person who is mentally ill has a chance of recovery and 79% (vs. 77%) that coercion in Polish psychiatry is used frequently enough. 95% (vs. 75%) consider mental illness a health problem which is concealed from the others. 43% (vs. 56%) believe that mental illness significantly reduces the ability of regular employment, 13.5% (vs. 30%) believe that it reduces the ability to work in a team and 33% (vs. 71%) that it reduces the ability to do work which requires a lot of self-reliance. 16% (vs. 22%) is opposed to having institutions for the mentally ill near their place of residence. Psychiatrists more often declared a close friendship with people suffering from mental illness (87.5% vs. 32%), and a positive attitude toward the mentally ill and their participation in social life (86.5% vs. 65%).\n1.

Unfortunately, it is well known that general practitioners (GPs) and other frontline health providers (i.e., child protection workers, public health nurses, and pediatricians) are not adequately trained to address these ubiquitous problems (Braddick et al. Child and Adolescent mental health in Europe: infrastructures, policy and programmes, European Communities, 2009; Levav et al. Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 13:395-401, 2004). Advances in technology may offer a solution to this problem with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that are designed to help professionals make sound clinical decisions in real time. This paper offers a systematic review of currently available CDSS for child and adolescent mental health disorders prepared according to the PRISMA-Protocols (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols). Applying strict eligibility criteria, the identified studies (n\u00a0=\u00a05048) were screened. Ten studies, describing eight original clinical decision support systems for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, fulfilled inclusion criteria. Based on this systematic review, there appears to be a need for a new, readily available CDSS for child neuropsychiatric disorder which promotes evidence-based, best practices, while enabling consideration of national variation in practices by leveraging data-reuse to generate predictions regarding treatment outcome, addressing a broader cluster of clinical disorders, and targeting frontline practice environments."}, {"Title": "Brain microglia in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "The role of immune activation in psychiatric disorders has attracted considerable attention over the past two decades, contributing to the rise of a new era for psychiatry. Microglia, the macrophages of the brain, are progressively becoming the main focus of the research in this field. In this Review, we assess the literature on microglia activation across different psychiatric disorders, including post-mortem and in-vivo studies in humans and experimental studies in animals. Although microglia activation has been noted in all types of psychiatric disorder, no association was seen with specific diagnostic categories. Furthermore, the findings from these studies highlight that not all psychiatric patients have microglial activation. Therefore, the cause of the neuroinflammation in these cohorts and its implications are unclear. We discuss psychosocial stress as one of the main factors determining microglial activation in patients with psychiatric disorders, and explore the relevance of these findings for future treatment strategies."}, {"Title": "Outcome-focused judgements of moral dilemmas in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Previous research on moral judgement in healthy adults suggests a complex interplay of automatic, emotional and deliberative processing. We aimed to advance understanding of these processes by examining moral judgement in individuals with schizophrenia, a population characterised by social-cognitive deficits and interpersonal difficulties. Forty-five patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy controls judged high-conflict moral dilemmas in response to 3rd-person (i.e. \"Is it morally okay to [perform X]?\") and 1st-person (i.e. \"Would you [perform X]?\") probes. Controls were less utilitarian for 3rd-person than 1st-person probes, while this discrepancy did not hold for patients. Utilitarianism in patients correlated with higher levels of interpersonal conflict. Findings suggest that people with schizophrenia focus equally on outcomes across moral-judgement conditions that ought normally to elicit an outcome-action discrepancy, suggesting that they are less influenced by an automatic aversive response to harmful acts in dilemma scenarios, consistent with a dual-process model of moral judgement."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry, Sex, and Science: The Making of \"Adolescent\" Motherhood in Southern Brazil.", "Abstract": "Research linking teen motherhood to psychoneurodevelopmental causes and pathologies has proliferated in the past two decades. In Brazil, a psychodevelopmental project of teen motherhood has gained traction despite many experts' long-standing commitment to psychodynamic psychiatry and social epidemiology, generating epistemic tension rather than substitution. Drawing on historical ethnography conducted in Southern Brazil, I explore how this project materialized through the co-production of epistemic struggles, remedial interventions, and ontological politics. In showing how this co-production became interwoven with incremental changes in young women's emotions, sexualities, relationships, and bodies, I describe how one particular \"kind\" of teen motherhood emerged and became entangled with both psychiatric knowledge-production and the angst of working-class political agency. In giving women a contested psychiatric language with which to rework their social-moral worlds, I argue that science did more than conceptualize teen childbearing in pathological terms; it contributed to its troubled transformation."}, {"Title": "Improving Mental Health in the Community: Outcome Evaluation of a Geriatric Mental Health Day Treatment Service.", "Abstract": "This program evaluation reviewed the outcomes of a new 10-week multi-modal mental health day treatment program for elderly clients with mood and anxiety disorders.\nA retrospective chart review of clients admitted during the first 3 years of the program (N = 255) was conducted. Paired sample t-tests were used to compare admission and discharge data. Focus groups were run with clients who attended the program during the previous months, to delineate the strengths of the program and to identify areas for improvement.\nAnalyses showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in client symptomatology, as evidenced by reductions on the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure in clients who completed the program. Focus group participants overwhelmingly described the program as very beneficial, but the desire for on-going follow-up was clearly articulated.\nA practice model employing group-based cognitive-behavioural and interpersonal strategies that emphasizes behavioral activation and socialization is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms and psychological distress in a large sample of elderly adults in a day treatment service with mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nIn the future, a mechanism for on-going mental health support should be included.

When more active intervention beyond watchful monitoring is indicated, hierarchical evaluation of treatment targets (i.e., tics vs. comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial. Behavioral treatments for tics are restricted to older children and are not readily available to all centers, mainly due to the paucity of well-trained therapists. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and \u03b12A-agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety monitoring must be provided. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches, as well as neuromodulation strategies, remain under-investigated in this population of patients.\nThe treatment of children with tics and Tourette syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and pediatrics may be helpful to address the complex needs of these children."}, {"Title": "[Gastric trichobezoar: about a case].", "Abstract": "Trichobezoar is rare, most often asymptomatic condition which can be easily diagnosed using oesogastroduodenal fibroscopy.

There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed.

Although the reasons are unclear, one hypothesis suggests that nicotine is a form of 'self-medication' in order to restore normal levels of nicotinic signaling and target abnormalities in neuronal function associated with cognitive processes. This brief review discusses evidence from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia patients that nicotinic agonists may effectively target dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the illness. Evidence suggests that nicotine significantly modulates a number of these circuits, although relatively few studies have used modern neuroimaging techniques (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) to examine the effects of nicotinic drugs on disease-related neurobiology. The neuronal effects of nicotine and other nicotinic agonists in schizophrenia remain a priority for psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "Treating Smoking in Adults With Co-occurring Acute Psychiatric and Addictive Disorders.", "Abstract": "Tobacco use is undertreated in individuals with psychiatric and substance use disorders (SUDs), with concerns that quitting smoking may compromise recovery. We evaluated outcomes of a tobacco intervention among psychiatric patients with co-occurring SUDs.\nData from 2 randomized tobacco treatment trials conducted in inpatient psychiatry were combined; analyses focused on the subsample with co-occurring SUDs (n\u200a=\u200a216). Usual care provided brief advice to quit and nicotine replacement therapy during the smoke-free hospitalization. The intervention, initiated during hospitalization and continued 6 months after hospitalization, was tailored to readiness to quit smoking, and added a computer-assisted intervention at baseline, and 3 and 6 months; brief counseling; and 10 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy after hospitalization. Outcomes were 7-day point prevalence abstinence from 3 to 12 months and past 30-day reports of alcohol and illicit drug use.\nThe sample consisted of 34% women, among which 36% were Caucasian, averaging 19\u200acigarettes/d prehospitalization; the groups were comparable at baseline. At 12 months, 22% of the intervention versus 11% of usual care participants were tobacco-abstinent (risk ratio 2.01, P\u200a=\u200a0.03). Past 30-day abstinence from alcohol/drugs did not differ by group (22%); however, successful quitters were less likely than continued smokers to report past 30-day cannabis (18% vs 42%) and alcohol (22% vs 58%) use (P\u200a<\u200a0.05), with no difference in other drug use.\nTobacco treatment in psychiatric patients with co-occurring SUDs was effective and did not adversely impact recovery.

During years one and two of the modernized MBBCh program, students complete 17 cases as part of the newly developed C21 curriculum that emphasizes a patient-oriented and student-centered approach to learning. The mental health case, which is presented in year 2, incorporates a number of novel teaching resources that aim to enhance the students' learning experience and to further reinforce the patient-oriented and community-based philosophy of C21. These include the use of fictionalized video diaries, virtual patient cases, e-learning workbooks, an interactive practical session, and community placements. Novel teaching methods and resources were evaluated by students in terms of effectiveness and value as learning resources through the administration of a structured mixed questionnaire. The results revealed that students valued the inclusion of these resources, which they evaluated as having contributed to their understanding of the subject area. Furthermore, the case was found to have had an impact on student interest in psychiatry as a specialty as well as a career choice.

Following discharge, service users are vulnerable to becoming overwhelmed by the challenges involved in readapting to their home environments, which could result in serious problems and lead to readmission. The short transitional intervention in psychiatry (STeP) is a bridging intervention that includes pre- and post-discharge sections. It aims to prepare patients for specific situations in the period immediately following discharge from a psychiatric hospital. We conducted a quasi-experimental pilot study to determine the feasibility of the intervention, and gain insight into the effects of the STeP. Two inpatient wards at a Swiss psychiatric hospital participated in the study, and represented the intervention and control arms. Patient recruitment and baseline assessment were performed 2\u00a0weeks prior to discharge. Follow-up data were collected 1\u00a0week subsequent to discharge. Questionnaires measured coping, admission and health-care usage, self-efficacy, working alliance, experience of transition, and the number of difficulties experienced following discharge. Fourteen and 15 patients completed the follow-up assessment in the control and intervention groups, respectively. The STeP did not affect primary or secondary outcomes; however, it was shown to be feasible, and patients' feedback highlighted the importance of post-discharge contact sessions.

Residents who held this opinion gave higher ratings for the importance of providing preventive counseling and reported counseling a higher percentage of patients on a variety of topics. They also reported screening more patients for several medical conditions. Residents who considered psychiatry to be primary care did not report greater comfort with treating these conditions, with the exception of dyslipidemia. The most commonly cited barrier to integrating primary care services was lack of time.\nResidents' perceptions of psychiatry as a primary care field appears to be associated with a higher reported likelihood of counseling about, and screening for, medical conditions in their patients."}, {"Title": "Comprehensive Psychopathological Assessment Based on the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) System: Development, Methodological Foundation, Application in Clinical Routine, and Research.", "Abstract": "The documentation of psychopathology is core to the clinical practice of the psychiatrist and clinical psychologist. However, both in initial as well as further training and specialization in their fields, this particular aspect of their work receives scanty attention only. Yet, for the past 50\u2009years, the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) System has been in existence and available as a tool to serve precisely the purpose of offering a systematic introduction to the terminology and documentation of psychopathology. The motivation for its development was based on the need for an assessment procedure for the reliable documentation of the effectiveness of newly developed psychopharmacological substances. Subsequently, the AMDP-System began to be applied in the context of investigations into a number of methodological issues in psychiatry (e.g., the frequency and specificity of particular symptoms, the comparison of rating scales). The System then became increasingly important also in clinical practice and, today, represents the most used instrument for the documentation of psychopathology in the German-speaking countries of Europe. This paper intends to offer an overview of the AMDP-System, its origins, design, and functionality. After an initial account of the history and development of the AMDP-System, the discussion will in turn focus on the System's underlying methodological principles, the transfer of clinical skills and competencies in its practical application, and its use in research and clinical practice.

First, the debate typically presupposes a sharp division between conscience-based refusals based on personal core moral beliefs and refusals based on professional (eg, medical) reasons. Only the former might involve the moral gravity to warrant accommodation. The case story challenges this division, and it is argued that just as much might sometimes be at stake morally in refusals based on professional reasons. The objector's moral integrity might be equally threatened in objections based on professional reasons as in objections based on personal beliefs. Second, the literature on conscientious objection typically presupposes that conflicts of conscience pertain to well-circumscribed and typical situations which can be identified as controversial without attention to individualising features of the concrete situation. However, the case shows that conflicts of conscience can sometimes be more particular, born from concrete features of the actual situation, and difficult, if not impossible, to predict before they arise.

In this first part, the 100 most relevant articles in neurosurgical journals were identified and ranked by total citations per year since publication. We queried the Web of Science database for the 1000 most-cited articles in neurosurgical journals. The number of citations per year was calculated for these 1000 articles, and the top 100 were identified.\nAmong the top 100 most relevant articles, 63 were from the Journal of Neurosurgery, 26 from Neurosurgery, 7 from the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 3 from Acta Neurochirurgica, and 1 from Surgical Neurology. The average year of publication for the 100 most relevant articles is 1995, compared with 1984 for the list of most-cited articles published by Ponce and Lozano in 2010 (P < 0.001).\nThese results suggest that ranking articles based on relevancy rather than historical popularity results in a list of more recently published articles and includes more studies addressing topics of surgical management and outcomes.

Despite the known efficacy of treatment and the substantial costs of untreated attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), access to healthcare and treatment is not a given for many patients in South Africa (SA). In SA, there is poor identification and treatment of common mental disorders at primary healthcare level and limited access to specialist resources with a service delivery and treatment gap of up to 75%. Medication options are also often limited in emerging markets and in SA psychiatrists, and patients do not have access to the medication armamentarium available in established markets. Furthermore, the majority of South Africans currently utilise the public healthcare sector and may not have access to treatment options referred to in these guidelines. These guidelines should therefore not be seen as a policy document.\nThe South African Society of Psychiatrists' Special Interest Group (SIG) for adult ADHD was launched on 25 September 2015, with doctors Rykie Liebenberg and Renata Schoeman as convenor and co-convenor, respectively. The overall objective of the ADHD SIG is to improve the basket of care available to patients with ADHD. This is only possible through a combined and concerted effort of individuals with a special interest in and passion for ADHD to improve knowledge about and funding for the care of individuals with the disorder. One of the specific aims of the ADHD SIG was to develop South African guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD specifically and update guidelines for the treatment of child, adolescent and adult ADHD.

One of the primary challenges in such faculty development is creating a change that improves the clinical assessment of students in a meaningful way.\nIn the current study we evaluated the effects of a pair of brief interventions designed to facilitate greater use of the 'Not observed' option in faculty member assessments of clerkship students (as opposed to use of 'Meets expectations' for skills actually not observed by the rater) within a psychiatry rotation for third-year medical students in the USA.\nThe intervention demonstrated statistically significant effects, both intentional and unintentional. Specifically, faculty members rated themselves as having increased their own understanding and confidence regarding the use of the assessment forms after the intervention. With regard to actual ratings of clerkship students, faculty members were less likely to use the 'Not observed' option after the intervention. Also, the mean rating increased slightly, and to a greater degree than could be explained entirely by the shift away from using 'Meets expectations' when 'Not observed' was more appropriate.

Hawai'i, along with the rest of the nation, faces a serious shortage of mental health providers. This article describes the research undertaken to create a more accurate assessment of the current mental health provider workforce in Hawai'i through developing an estimation strategy to appraise local mental health workforce needs. The results indicate the supply of psychiatrists for Hawai'i's 2010 census population was found to be 161.4 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) psychiatrists, or 11.86 psychiatrists/100,000 population, with the greatest number of psychiatrists per capita on the island of O'ahu. Of the 161.4 FTEs, 50.4 FTEs or 31.2% were accepting new Medicaid patients. The state's results show that Hawai'i is short of meeting current patient need by more than 100 psychiatrists though the state was only short by 6 FTE psychiatrists with regard to estimates of Medicaid patients' need. While the first number is likely accurate, the second number is likely to be significantly underestimated for a number of reasons. One reason is that practitioners who reported accepting new Medicaid patients likely see comparatively few. Another reason is that it is likely that Medicaid patients make up more than the approximate 20% of the psychiatric patient population. It is reported nationally that a greater percentage of the mentally ill receive Medicaid than the population at large. Thus, there are probably many more patients on Medicaid than our estimations accounted for. It is clear more research and more changes need to be made in Hawai'i's publicly funded healthcare system to incentivize physician acceptance and make mental healthcare more accessible to this growing population."}, {"Title": "Impaired Tuning of Neural Ensembles and the Pathophysiology of Schizophrenia: A Translational and Computational Neuroscience Perspective.", "Abstract": "The functional optimization of neural ensembles is central to human higher cognitive functions. When the functions through which neural activity is tuned fail to develop or break down, symptoms and cognitive impairments arise. This review considers ways in which disturbances in the balance of excitation and inhibition might develop and be expressed in cortical networks in association with schizophrenia. This presentation is framed within a developmental perspective that begins with disturbances in glutamate synaptic development in utero. It considers developmental correlates and consequences, including compensatory mechanisms that increase intrinsic excitability or reduce inhibitory tone. It also considers the possibility that these homeostatic increases in excitability have potential negative functional and structural consequences. These negative functional consequences of disinhibition may include reduced working memory-related cortical activity associated with the downslope of the \"inverted-U\" input-output curve, impaired spatial tuning of neural activity and impaired sparse coding of information, and deficits in the temporal tuning of neural activity and its implication for neural codes. The review concludes by considering the functional significance of noisy activity for neural network function. The presentation draws on computational neuroscience and pharmacologic and genetic studies in animals and humans, particularly those involving N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonists, to illustrate principles of network regulation that give rise to features of neural dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. While this presentation focuses on schizophrenia, the general principles outlined in the review may have broad implications for considering disturbances in the regulation of neural ensembles in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Linking the biological underpinnings of depression: Role of mitochondria interactions with melatonin, inflammation, sirtuins, tryptophan catabolites, DNA repair and oxidative and nitrosative stress, with consequences for classification and cognition.", "Abstract": "The pathophysiological underpinnings of neuroprogressive processes in recurrent major depressive disorder (rMDD) are reviewed. A wide array of biochemical processes underlie MDD presentations and their shift to a recurrent, neuroprogressive course, including: increased immune-inflammation, tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), mitochondrial dysfunction, aryl hydrocarbonn receptor activation, and oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), as well as decreased sirtuins and melatonergic pathway activity. These biochemical changes may have their roots in central, systemic and/or peripheral sites, including in the gut, as well as in developmental processes, such as prenatal stressors and breastfeeding consequences. Consequently, conceptualizations of MDD have dramatically moved from simple psychological and central biochemical models, such as lowered brain serotonin, to a conceptualization that incorporates whole body processes over a lifespan developmental timescale. However, important hubs are proposed, including the gut-brain axis, and mitochondrial functioning, which may provide achievable common treatment targets despite considerable inter-individual variability in biochemical changes. This provides a more realistic model of the complexity of MDD and the pathophysiological processes that underpin the shift to rMDD and consequent cognitive deficits. Such accumulating data on the pathophysiological processes underpinning MDD highlights the need in psychiatry to shift to a classification system that is based on biochemical processes, rather than subjective phenomenology."}, {"Title": "Clinicians' conflicting emotional responses to high suicide-risk patients-Association with short-term suicide behaviors: A prospective pilot study.", "Abstract": "Clinician's emotional responses to patients have been recognized as potentially relating to treatment outcome, however they have received little attention in the literature on suicide risk.

This has been the case in France, where claims of a specific ethical tradition in psychiatry have accompanied the institutionalization of psychiatric ethics and the perceived globalization of an Anglo-American model of mental health care. This study traces the history of the 'French ethical tradition in psychiatry' and its relationship with establishing institutional spaces for ethical decision-making. The 'ethical tradition' thus conceived proves to be functional in terms of preserving the threatened identity of French psychiatry. Nevertheless, this movement also pinpoints impasses that transcend the French context and may provide valuable resources for ethical reflections on mental health on a global scale."}, {"Title": "Development and initial validation of a short three-dimensional inventory of character strengths.", "Abstract": "Character strength is described as a positive and organized pattern of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It serves as a schema that organizes categories of information toward the self, others, and the world, and provides the self-aware knowledge that facilitates the pursuit of goals, values, and ethical principles. Recent research has suggested that three reliable factors emerge from the measures of character strengths: caring, inquisitiveness, and self-control. The goal of this paper is to develop a psychometrically sound short measure of character strength.\nThe questions were addressed in two studies using two independent samples: a cross-cultural (i.e., 518 Asians and 556 Westerners) sample, and a cross-population (i.e., 175 community participants and 171 inpatients) sample in China.\nFindings from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggested a cross-cultural three-factor model of character strength that could be measured by the Three-dimensional Inventory of Character Strengths (TICS). A multigroup confirmatory factor analysis further indicated that the number of factors and factor loadings was invariant in the medical and community samples. This result indicated that the brief inventory could be applied to a medical context. Internal reliability, content validity, and predictive validity were good, although the predictive validity of the three character strengths for psychological symptoms in the medical sample was more modest than that in the community sample.\nTICS is expected to be used for screening populations at risk, and a tool to aid mental health professionals in group-based treatment/intervention planning.

Sample size is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous disorders such as schizophrenia, where machine learning models built on relatively low numbers of subjects may suffer from poor generalizability. Via multicenter studies and consortium initiatives researchers have tried to solve this problem by combining data sets from multiple sites. The necessary sharing of (raw) data is, however, often hindered by legal and ethical issues. Moreover, in the case of very large samples, the computational complexity might become too large. The solution to this problem could be distributed learning. In this paper we investigated the possibility to create a meta-model by combining support vector machines (SVM) classifiers trained on the local datasets, without the need for sharing medical images or any other personal data. Validation was done in a 4-center setup comprising of 480 first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in total. We built SVM models to separate patients from controls based on three different kinds of imaging features derived from structural MRI scans, and compared models built on the joint multicenter data to the meta-models. The results showed that the combined meta-model had high similarity to the model built on all data pooled together and comparable classification performance on all three imaging features. Both similarity and performance was superior to that of the local models. We conclude that combining models is thus a viable alternative that facilitates data sharing and creating bigger and more informative models."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of a Model of Integrated Care for Patients With Chronic Medical and Psychiatric Illness.", "Abstract": "Chronic illnesses are prevalent in general medical and psychiatric practices, causing significant disease burden to care givers and providers.

In DLB, parahippocampal, entorhinal and temporal pole thickness associated with total CAMCOG and CAMCOG memory scores, parahippocampal thickness associated with MMSE scores, and entorhinal thickness associated with CAMCOG executive function scores.\nIn this large sample, these results are in agreement with other studies indicating that hippocampal atrophy is less severe in DLB than AD. Hippocampal atrophy and medial temporal lobe cortical thickness were associated with the severity of cognitive symptoms, suggesting that atrophy in these structures, as a potential proxy of AD pathology, may partly mediate specific DLB cognitive symptoms. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

We propose that recent technological and analytic advances in magnetoencephalography (MEG), a technique that allows measurement of neuronal events directly and noninvasively with millisecond resolution, provides novel opportunities to address these fundamental questions. Because of its potential in delineating normal and abnormal brain dynamics, we propose that MEG provides a crucial tool to advance our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of major neuropsychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and the dementias. We summarize the mechanisms underlying the generation of MEG signals and the tools available to reconstruct generators and underlying networks using advanced source-reconstruction techniques. We then surveyed recent studies that have used MEG to examine aberrant rhythmic activity in neuropsychiatric disorders. This was followed by links with preclinical research that has highlighted possible neurobiological mechanisms, such as disturbances in excitation/inhibition parameters, that could account for measured changes in neural oscillations. Finally, we discuss challenges as well as novel methodological developments that could pave the way for widespread application of MEG in translational research with the aim of developing biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis."}, {"Title": "[Area 10, 38: Prospective Functions in BA10 and Semantic Hub in BA38].", "Abstract": "This paper reviews the structural specificities and functional roles in Brodmann areas 10 and 38. A number of studies have focused on both areas through various approaches including neuropsychology, neuroimaging, psychiatry, neurology, and neurosurgery. Both areas 10 and 38 may have a substantially very complex higher-order cognitive functions, which are quite hard to disentangle. Here, I picked up some fundamental perspectives for reviewing previous studies, to provide efficient research orientations for the elucidation of functions in both areas."}, {"Title": "Security Policy and Infrastructure in the Context of a Multi-Centeric Information System Dedicated to Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neuro-developmental disorders affecting children in their early age. The diagnosis of ASD relies on multidisciplinary investigations, in psychiatry, neurology, genetics, electrophysiology, neuro-imagery, audiology and ophthalmology. In order to support clinicians, researchers and public health decision makers, we designed an information system dedicated to ASD, called TEDIS. TEDIS was designed to manage systematic, exhaustive and continuous multi-centric patient data collection via secured Internet connections. In this paper, we present the security policy and security infrastructure we developed to protect ASD' patients' clinical data and patients' privacy. We tested our system on 359 ASD patient records in a local secured intranet environment and showed that the security system is functional, with a consistent, transparent and safe encrypting-decrypting behavior. It is ready for deployment in the nine ASD expert assessment centers in the Ile de France district."}, {"Title": "Academic Productivity in Psychiatry: Benchmarks for the H-Index.", "Abstract": "Bibliometrics play an increasingly critical role in the assessment of faculty for promotion and merit increases. Bibliometrics is the statistical analysis of publications, aimed at evaluating their impact. The objective of this study is to describe h-index and citation benchmarks in academic psychiatry.\nFaculty lists were acquired from online resources for all academic departments of psychiatry listed as having residency training programs in Canada (as of June 2016). Potential authors were then searched on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) for their corresponding h-index and total number of citations.\nThe sample included 1683 faculty members in academic psychiatry departments. Restricted to those with a rank of assistant, associate, or full professor resulted in 1601 faculty members (assistant\u2009=\u2009911, associate\u2009=\u2009387, full\u2009=\u2009303). h-index and total citations differed significantly by academic rank. Both were highest in the full professor rank, followed by associate, then assistant. The range in each, however, was large.\nThis study provides the initial benchmarks for the h-index and total citations in academic psychiatry. Regardless of any controversies or criticisms of bibliometrics, they are increasingly influencing promotion, merit increases, and grant support. As such, benchmarking by specialties is needed in order to provide needed context."}, {"Title": "A Digital Tool to Promote Alcohol and Drug Use Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment Skill Translation: A Mobile App Development and Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol.", "Abstract": "Translation of knowledge and skills from classroom settings to clinical practice is a major challenge in healthcare training, especially for behavioral interventions. For example, screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a highly-promoted approach to identifying and treating individuals at risk for alcohol or drug problems, yet effective, routine use of SBIRT has lagged.\nThe objective of this paper is to describe the development, pilot testing, and trial protocol of a mobile app based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to promote SBIRT skill translation and application.\nIntended for use after classroom training occurs, the mobile app has three primary functions designed to increase behavioral intent to deliver SBIRT: (1) review skills (ie, address knowledge and beliefs about SBIRT), (2) apply skills with patients (ie, build confidence and perceived behavioral control), and (3) report performance data (ie, increase accountability and social norms and/or influence). The app includes depression and anxiety screening tools due to high comorbidity with substance use. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is in progress among health and social service learners (N=200) recruited from 3 universities and 6 different training programs in nursing, social work, internal medicine, psychiatry, and psychology. Participants are randomized to SBIRT classroom instruction alone or classroom instruction plus app access prior to beginning their field placement rotations. TPB-based data are collected via Qualtrics or via the mobile app pre-post and SBIRT utilization, weekly for 10 weeks. Key outcomes include the frequency of and self-reported confidence in delivery of SBIRT.\nBeta testing with advanced practice nursing students (N=22) indicated that the app and its associated assessment tools were acceptable and useful. The system usability scale (SUS) mean was 65.8 (n=19), which indicated that the SBIRT app was acceptable but could benefit from improvement. Indeed, modifications were implemented prior to starting the trial. Enrollment of trial participants began in September 2016. Results are expected by December 2017.\nThis report describes the process of TPB-based app development and testing, and the protocol for a RCT to determine the effectiveness of the app in enhancing skill translation. If effective, this approach could improve SBIRT implementation, fidelity, and clinical outcomes."}, {"Title": "What leads to high antipsychotic dosing in forensic patients with schizophrenia?", "Abstract": "Earlier findings suggest that forensic schizophrenia patients are treated with higher doses of antipsychotics. This practice-based specificity is insufficiently studied, and clinicians' motives regarding this practice remain poorly understood. In this editorial, the authors provide their data on treatment of forensic schizophrenia patients and identify characteristics of psychopathology and previous types of behaviors, including suicidal attempts, as potential reasons for the practice. They also emphasize that \"these previous acts\" often took place years ago, and suggest that current or recent aggression is unlikely the main reason for dosing, but rather the clinicians' intention to maintain \"must remain unaggressive\" condition. Therefore, the authors suggest new ideas that may contribute to a better understanding of the specific prescribing patterns in the forensic population and hope that these ideas would be implemented in further well-designed prospective studies."}, {"Title": "Acute masseter dystonia in a pediatric patient receiving aripiprazole and methylphenidate following induction of general anesthesia.", "Abstract": "An 11-year-old male receiving aripiprazole, methylphenidate, and clonidine developed acute masseter dystonia inhibiting tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with propofol and rocuronium. Following emergence, he had trismus and jaw discomfort. Psychiatry consultation suspected an acute dystonic reaction, so diphenhydramine was administered intravenously which resolved symptoms. We suspect chronic aripiprazole and methylphenidate usage combined with propofol administration in the short-term absence of methylphenidate made this patient susceptible to dystonic reactions."}, {"Title": "A review of the nutritional challenges experienced by people living with severe mental illness: a role for dietitians in addressing physical health gaps.", "Abstract": "People experiencing a severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder or depression with psychotic features, have a 20-year mortality gap compared to the general population. This 'scandal of premature mortality' is primarily driven by preventable cardiometabolic disease, and recent research suggests that the mortality gap is widening. Multidisciplinary mental health teams often include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, specialist mental health nurses, social workers and occupational therapists, offering a range of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments to enhance the recovery of clients who have experienced, or are experiencing a SMI. Until recently, lifestyle and life skills interventions targeting the poor physical health experienced by people living with SMI have not been offered in most routine clinical settings. Furthermore, there are calls to include dietary intervention as mainstream in psychiatry to enhance mental health recovery. With the integration of dietitians being a relatively new approach, it is important to review and assess the literature to inform practice. This review assesses the dietary challenges experienced by people with a SMI and discusses potential strategies for improving mental and physical health."}, {"Title": "Immunopsychiatry: important facts.", "Abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicate a role for the immune system particularly inflammation and autoimmunity in the aetiology of major psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. In this paper, we discuss some of the key advances in immunopsychiatry in order to highlight to psychiatrists and other health professionals how an increased understanding of this field might enhance our knowledge of illness mechanism and approaches to treatment. We present a brief overview of clinical research that link inflammation and autoimmunity with depression and psychosis, including potential role of inflammation in treatment response, current evidence for the effectiveness of immune-modulating treatment for depression and psychosis, and possible role of inflammation in common physical comorbidities for these disorders such as coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Gaining a better understanding of the role of immune system could be paradigm changing for psychiatry.

Understanding how CES users perceive the importance of CES outcomes can contribute to a better understanding, use of and normative reflection on CES outcomes.\nTo describe the perceptions of Dutch healthcare professionals on important outcomes of moral case deliberation (MCD), prior to MCD participation, and to compare results between respondents.\nThis mixed-methods study used both the Euro-MCD instrument and semi-structured interviews. Healthcare professionals who were about to implement MCD were recruited from nursing homes, hospitals, psychiatry and mentally disabled care institutions.\n331 healthcare professionals completed the Euro-MCD instrument, 13 healthcare professionals were interviewed. The outcomes perceived as most important were 'more open communication', 'better mutual understanding', 'concrete actions', 'see the situation from different perspectives', 'consensus on how to manage the situation' and 'find more courses of action'. Interviewees also perceived improving quality of care, professionalism and the organization as important. Women, nurses, managers and professionals in mentally disabled care rated outcomes more highly than other respondents.\nDutch healthcare professionals perceived the MCD outcomes related to collaboration as most important. The empirical findings can contribute to shared ownership of MCD and a more specific use of MCD in different contexts. They can inform international comparative research on different CES types and contribute to normative discussions concerning CES outcomes. Future studies should reflect upon important MCD outcomes after having experienced MCD."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and predictors of anxiety in an African sample of recent stroke survivors.", "Abstract": "Studies considering emotional disturbances in the setting of stroke have primarily focused on depression and been conducted in high-income countries.

Depression has emerged as a disease complication, with prevalence estimates ranging from 15 to 62%. This is a pilot study examining the effects of psychological counseling for depression in FD on depression, adaptive functioning (AF), quality of life (QOL), and subjective pain experience. Telecounseling was also piloted, as it has beneficial effects in other chronic diseases which make in-person counseling problematic. Subjects completed 6\u00a0months of in-person or telecounseling with the same health psychologist, followed by 6\u00a0months without counseling. Self-report measures of depression, AF, QOL, and subjective pain were completed every 3\u00a0months. All subjects experienced improvements in depression, which were sustained during the follow-up period. Improvements in depression were correlated with improvements in mental health QOL and subjective pain severity, while improvements in mental health QOL were correlated with improvements in AF. While statistical comparison between counseling modes was not possible with the given sample size, relevant observations were noted. Recommendations for future research include replication of results with a larger sample size and a longer counseling period. The use of video counseling may be beneficial. In conclusion, the present pilot study supports the efficacy of psychological treatment for depression in people with FD, highlighting the importance of having health psychologists housed in LSD treatment centers, rather than specialty psychology/psychiatry settings, to increase participation and decrease potential obstacles to access due to perceived stigma."}, {"Title": "Sexual Behavior Among Persons With Cognitive Impairments.", "Abstract": "Although the cognitively impaired are frequently included in heterogeneous studies of problematic sexual behavior, the epidemiology, etiology, and approach to assessment and treatment of persons with dementia and intellectual disability are distinct from those of the general population. The incidence of inappropriate sexual behavior among the intellectually disabled is 15-33%; however, the nature tends to be more socially inappropriate than with violative intent. Limited sociosexual education is a large contributor, and better addressing this area offers a target for prevention and treatment. A thorough clinical assessment of problematic sexual behaviors in the cognitively impaired requires understanding the patient's internal experience, which can be challenging. Assessment tools validated for the general population have not been validated for this population. Very few studies have assessed treatment approaches specifically among the cognitively impaired; however, research does suggest utility in habilitative, psychotherapeutic, and pharmacologic approaches which have been validated among the general population."}, {"Title": "Commentary: On the importance of looking at nonlinearity and developmental effects - a reflection on Flom et\u00a0al.

(Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2017) also raise interesting questions for future research. First, studies should look at variables that may explain the associations between activity level and mental development, such as self-regulation and attention. Second, longitudinal changes in the strength of the association between activity level and mental development should be examined to determine when this association is at its strongest. Finally, longitudinal research looking at bidirectional effects is needed to confirm the direction of the associations between activity level and mental development.

Validity studies are scarce, and limited to concurrent validity with other measures and clinical diagnoses.\nTo evaluate the K-SADS interview in an outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) setting with a Longitudinal Expert All Data (LEAD) procedure.\nCAP residents performed a K-SADS-PL interview with the revised 2009 version containing the new PDD section on 239 clinically referred outpatients of 6-17 years old and their parent(s). A consensus LEAD diagnosis by two senior clinicians 1.2 (SD\u2009=\u20090.6) years later was based on clinical records including the K-SADS and subsequent information from further assessments, information from teachers and other informants, outcome of treatment, and at least three visits after the K-SADS.\nPredictive validity for K-SADS vs LEAD diagnoses were good-to-excellent for broader categories of anxiety disorders (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.94), depressive (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.91), behavioural (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.91) and tic (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.81) disorders, good for ADHD (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.80), and good-to-moderate for autism spectrum disorders (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.62). Bipolar, psychotic, and eating disorders were too few to be analysed.\nThe K-SADS diagnoses elicited from an interview with the child and one from parents on one occasion have an excellent validity for most major child psychiatric disorders.

The burden of ADHD or its associated factors in Uganda are not known. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the associated factors of ADHD among children attending the neurology and psychiatry clinics at Mulago National Referral Hospital.\nUsing the disruptive behavior scale (45 items), we investigated the presence of ADHD symptoms among children attending Mulago Hospital. Questionnaires were administered to the primary care-takers of the study participants to gather information on the factors associated with ADHD. All children were subject to a clinical examination. Children presumed to have ADHD, using the aforementioned rating scale were further assessed by a child psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and associated co-morbid conditions.\nThe estimated prevalence of DSM-IV ADHD symptoms was 11%.

Few studies demonstrate how linguistic barriers complicate psychiatric care; in consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry, there are no published data about care disparities for patients with LEP or for whom English is not the preferred language (PL).\nWe sought to determine if PL affects the psychiatric consultation rate.\nAmong adult patients admitted during 1 year to a large urban academic medical center, we compared psychiatric consultation rates in English PL patients with non-English PL patients. PL was ascertained from demographics during the medical record. The occurrence of psychiatric consultation was ascertained from C-L service logs.\nThere were 54,534 admissions: the no-consultation group (N = 53,196) and the consultation group (N = 1,398).

We analyze handwritten material, writing tests and letters, from patients in an early 20th-century psychiatric hospital in southern Germany (Irsee/Kaufbeuren). In this institution, early psychiatrists assessed handwriting features, providing us novel insights into the earliest practices of psychiatric handwriting analysis, which can be connected to Berkenkotter's research on medical admission records.

ABMT may target rapid, implicit threat reactions, whereas CBT may target slowly deployed threat responses. The authors used amygdala-based connectivity during a threat-attention task and a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate potential complementary features of these treatments in pediatric anxiety disorders.\nPrior to treatment, youths (8-17 years old) with anxiety disorders (N=54), as well as healthy comparison youths (N=51), performed a threat-attention task during functional MRI acquisition. Task-related amygdala-based functional connectivity was assessed. Patients with and without imaging data (N=85) were then randomly assigned to receive CBT paired with either active or placebo ABMT. Clinical response was evaluated, and pretreatment amygdala-based connectivity profiles were compared among patients with varying levels of clinical response.\nCompared with the CBT plus placebo ABMT group, the CBT plus active ABMT group exhibited less severe anxiety after treatment. The patient and healthy comparison groups differed in amygdala-insula connectivity during the threat-attention task. Patients whose connectivity profiles were most different from those of the healthy comparison group exhibited the poorest response to treatment, particularly those who received CBT plus placebo ABMT.\nThe study provides evidence of enhanced clinical effects for patients receiving active ABMT. Moreover, ABMT appears to be most effective for patients with abnormal amygdala-insula connectivity. ABMT may target specific threat processes associated with dysfunctional amygdala-insula connectivity that are not targeted by CBT alone. This may explain the observation of enhanced clinical response to CBT plus active ABMT."}, {"Title": "The Biological Basis to Personality Disorders.", "Abstract": "To provide understanding into the biological basis of thinking and behavior in people with personality disorders, explain anatomic findings, and appraise therapeutic options.\nPubMed was searched with no date restrictions using the terms personality disorders DSM-5, cluster B personality disorders, biological psychiatry of personality disorders, neurobiology of personality disorders, and neurobiology of cluster B personality disorders.\nWe identified 2,790 English-language articles and utilized 18 in this report.\nThere are anatomic features typical to the brains of individuals with cluster B personality disorders, for example, abnormalities in the superior frontal cortex and amygdala and enlarged striatal volumes.

Two large studies showed that metabolic disorders were untreated in a majority of the patients. Since then, guidelines have urged monitoring of metabolic health. This study examined the course of metabolic disorders over time in people with psychotic disorders and investigated current treatment rates.\nA total of 1,259 patients with psychotic disorders, as defined by the DSM-IV, from 4 Dutch mental health institutions participated in 3 yearly assessments of the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring and Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS) between 2006 and 2014. Patients' metabolic parameters were measured, and the use of pharmacologic treatment for hypertension (systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mm Hg), dyslipidemia (5% \u2264 Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE] risk < 10% and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level \u2265 2.5 mmol/L or SCORE risk \u2265 10% and LDL cholesterol level \u2265 1.8 mmol/L and/or triglycerides \u2265 2.3 mmol/L), and hyperglycemia (hemoglobin A1c concentration > 7% and/or fasting glucose concentration \u2265 7.2 mmol/L) was recorded.\nPrevalence of the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria, was > 50% at each assessment. On the basis of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, pharmacotherapy for metabolic disorders was recommended for 52%-59% of the patients at each assessment. Treatment rates with antihypertensive (from 31% to 38%, P < .001) pharmacotherapy increased throughout the assessments. However, half of the patients were not treated for their metabolic risk factors while being monitored for 3 years or longer. Older patients were more likely to receive treatment, and patients who received treatment had lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations than patients not receiving the recommended treatment.\nMetabolic risk factors are still seriously undertreated in people with psychotic disorders.

The variables were sociodemographic (age, gender, and education), clinical (diagnoses, drug treatment, and treatment duration), attitudinal (attitudes toward psychopharmacological medication and preferences regarding participation in decision-making), perception of control over health (health locus of control, self-efficacy, and psychological reactance), and level of adherence to psychopharmacological medications. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the nonstraightforward relationships and the interactive effects among the analyzed variables.\nStructural equation modeling demonstrated that psychiatric patients' treatment adherence was associated: 1) negatively with cognitive psychological reactance (adherence decreased as cognitive psychological reactance increased), 2) positively with patients' trust in their psychiatrists (doctors' subscale), 3) negatively with patients' belief that they are in control of their mental health and that their mental health depends on their own actions (internal subscale), and 4) positively (although weakly) with age. Self-efficacy indirectly influenced treatment adherence through internal health locus of control.\nThis study provides support for the hypothesis that perceived health control variables play a relevant role in psychiatric patients' adherence to psychopharmacological medications. The findings highlight the importance of considering prospective studies of patients' psychological reactance and health locus of control as they may be clinically relevant factors contributing to adherence to psychopharmacological medications."}, {"Title": "The new field of 'precision psychiatry'.", "Abstract": "Precision medicine is a new and important topic in psychiatry.

Thus, the vision of precision medicine as applied to psychiatry - 'precision psychiatry' - promises to be even more transformative than in other fields of medicine, which have already lessened the translational gap.\nHerein, we describe 'precision psychiatry' and how its several implications promise to transform the psychiatric landscape. We pay particular attention to biomarkers and to how the development of new technologies now makes their discovery possible and timely. The adoption of the term 'precision psychiatry' will help propel the field, since the current term 'precision medicine', as applied to psychiatry, is impractical and does not appropriately distinguish the field. Naming the field 'precision psychiatry' will help establish a stronger, unique identity to what promises to be the most important area in psychiatry in years to come.\nIn summary, we provide a wide-angle lens overview of what this new field is, suggest how to propel the field forward, and provide a vision of the near future, with 'precision psychiatry' representing a paradigm shift that promises to change the landscape of how psychiatry is currently conceived."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry in East Germany (GDR) Between Awakening and Stagnation: The Brandenburg Proposition to the \"Therapeutic Community\" (1974/76)].", "Abstract": "Inspired by the concept of the English psychiatrist Maxwell Jones, the Brandenburg proposition or thesis towards the \"Therapeutic Community\" was formulated in 1974.

Patients from both groups were matched for age and sex. Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was calculated as log<sub>10</sub>(triglycerides/HDL cholesterol). Castelli atherogenic indices were calculated as follows: AI<sub>LDL/HDL</sub> is the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and AI<sub>TC/HDL</sub> is the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.\nHDL levels were significantly decreased in depressed patients (48.2\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4\u2009mg/dL vs. 54.5\u2009\u00b1\u200917.7\u2009mg/dL).

In order to examine media representations of mental health and expert knowledge in this field, two major Swedish daily newspapers from the year 2009 were qualitatively analysed. Drawing on the theory of social representations, the analysis focused on how issues concerning mental health and different perspectives are represented. The results show how the concept of mental illness is used in different and often taken-for-granted ways and how the distinction between normal and pathological is a central underlying question. Laypersons' perspectives are supplemented by views of professionals in the newspapers, where signs of confidence and dependence on expert knowledge are juxtaposed with critique and expressions of distrust. The newspaper discourse thus has salient argumentative features and the way that conflicts are made explicit and issues concerning authoritative knowledge are addressed indicates ambivalence towards the authoritative role of expert knowledge concerning mental health. In this way, the newspapers provide a complex epistemic context for everyday sense-making that can be assumed to have implications for relations between laypersons and professionals in the field of mental health."}, {"Title": "Placebo-like response in absence of treatment in children with Autism.", "Abstract": "Caregiver report is the most common measure of change in pediatric psychiatry.

Twenty caregivers answered questions about their child's behavior on their smartphone each week and completed a battery of paper questionnaires during weeks one and eight. No treatment was administered. Caregivers reported a significant decrease in problem behaviors on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) (29% decrease) and general ASD behaviors on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (7% decrease). There was also a trend of behavior improvement from smartphone questions but no significant changes in clinical ratings of core diagnostic features of ASD.

Despite decades of empirical research on thought disorder, our present understanding of it is poor, our clinical assessments focus on a limited set of extreme behaviors, and treatments are palliative at best. Applying a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework to thought disorder research offers advantages to explicate its phenotype; isolate its mechanisms; and develop more effective assessments, treatments, and potential cures. In this commentary, we discuss ways in which thought disorder can be understood within the RDoC framework. We propose operationalizing thought disorder within the RDoC construct of language using psycholinguistic sciences, to help objectify and quantify language within individuals; technologically sophisticated paradigms, to allow naturalistic behavioral sampling techniques with unprecedented ecological validity; and computational modeling, to account for a network of interconnected and dynamic linguistic, cognitive, affective, and social functions. We also highlight challenges for understanding thought disorder within an RDoC framework. Thought disorder likely does not occur as an isomorphic dysfunction in a single RDoC construct, but rather, as multiple potential dysfunctions in a network of RDoC constructs. Moreover, thought disorder is dynamic over time and context within individuals. In sum, RDoC is a useful framework to integrate multidisciplinary research efforts aimed at operationalizing, understanding, and ameliorating thought disorder."}, {"Title": "Two subgroups of antipsychotic-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients identified with a Gaussian mixture model on cognition and electrophysiology.", "Abstract": "Deficits in information processing and cognition are among the most robust findings in schizophrenia patients. Previous efforts to translate group-level deficits into clinically relevant and individualized information have, however, been non-successful, which is possibly explained by biologically different disease subgroups. We applied machine learning algorithms on measures of electrophysiology and cognition to identify potential subgroups of schizophrenia. Next, we explored subgroup differences regarding treatment response. Sixty-six antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and sixty-five healthy controls underwent extensive electrophysiological and neurocognitive test batteries. Patients were assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before and after 6 weeks of monotherapy with the relatively selective D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist, amisulpride (280.3\u00b1159\u2009mg per day). A reduced principal component space based on 19 electrophysiological variables and 26 cognitive variables was used as input for a Gaussian mixture model to identify subgroups of patients.

We found no significant baseline psychopathological differences between these subgroups, but the effect of treatment in the groups was predicted with an accuracy of 74.3% (P=0.003). In conclusion, electrophysiology and cognition data may be used to classify subgroups of schizophrenia patients. The two distinct subgroups, which we identified, were psychopathologically inseparable before treatment, yet their response to dopaminergic blockade was predicted with significant accuracy.

To promote adolescent adaptive ('resilient') psychosocial functioning (PSF), appropriate conceptualisation and quantification of such functioning and its predictors is a crucial first step. Here, we quantify resilient functioning as the degree to which an individual functions better or worse than expected given their self-reported childhood family experiences, and relate this to adolescent family and friendship support.\nWe used Principal Component and regression analyses to investigate the relationship between childhood family experiences and PSF (psychiatric symptomatology, personality traits and mental wellbeing) in healthy adolescents (the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network; N = 2389; ages 14-24). Residuals from the relation between childhood family experiences and PSF reflect resilient functioning; the degree to which an individual is functioning better, or worse, than expected given their childhood family experiences. Next, we relate family and friendship support with resilient functioning both cross-sectionally and 1 year later.\nFriendship and family support were positive predictors of immediate resilient PSF, with friendship support being the strongest predictor. However, whereas friendship support was a significant positive predictor of later resilient functioning, family support had a negative relationship with later resilient PSF.\nWe show that friendship support, but not family support, is an important positive predictor of both immediate and later resilient PSF in adolescence and early adulthood.

Unlike the established trauma-focused treatment approaches MCT does not aim at prolonged exposure to the trauma narrative. Instead, patients shall learn to leave the distressing thoughts alone and to reduce the perseverating thinking processes (rumination and worrying). Adaptations to URM comprise preceding strategies of stabilization and culture specific aspects.

Nurses are expected to offer physical and mental support to these patients. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is commonly used in psychiatry as well as in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. CBT is believed to reduce mental distress in patients by changing their negative cognitive schema. The present article discusses the mental problems of patients with breast cancer and introduces the effects of using CBT on patients with breast cancer. Successful examples of training clinical nurses to apply CBT to the patients are introduced in order to facilitate the design of effective CBT training programs for nurses that improve professional knowledge and skills in dealing with the mental health problems of these patients and further enhance the quality of nursing care."}, {"Title": "Hepatic encephalopathy: what the multidisciplinary team can do.", "Abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex disease requiring a multidisciplinary approach among specialists, primary care team, family, and caregivers. HE is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring an extensive workup to exclude other possible etiologies, including mental status changes, metabolic, infectious, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. The categorization of HE encompasses a continuum, varying from the clinically silent minimal HE (MHE), which is only detectable using psychometric tests, to overt HE, which is further divided into four grades of severity. While there has been an increased effort to create fast and reliable methods for the detection of MHE, screening is still underperformed due to the lack of standardization and efficient methods of diagnosis. The management of HE requires consultation from various disciplines, including hepatology, primary care physicians, neurology, psychiatry, dietician/nutritionist, social workers, and other medical and surgical subspecialties based on clinical presentation and clear communication among these disciplines to best manage patients with HE throughout their course. The first-line therapy for HE is lactulose with or without rifaximin. Following the initial episode of overt HE, secondary prophylaxis with lactulose and/or rifaximin is indicated with the goal to prevent recurrent episodes and improve quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated the negative impact of MHE on quality of life and clinical outcomes. In light of all this, we emphasize the importance of screening and treating MHE in patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly through a multidisciplinary team approach."}, {"Title": "Moral insanity and psychological disorder: the hybrid roots of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper traces the significance of the diagnosis of 'moral insanity' (and the related diagnoses of 'monomania' and ' manie sans d\u00e9lire') to the development of psychiatry as a profession in the nineteenth century. The pioneers of psychiatric thought were motivated to explore such diagnoses because they promised public recognition in the high status surroundings of the criminal court. Some success was achieved in presenting a form of expertise that centred on the ability of the experts to detect quite subtle, 'psychological' forms of dangerous madness within the minds of offenders in France and more extensively in England. Significant backlash in the press against these new ideas pushed the profession away from such psychological exploration and back towards its medical roots that located criminal insanity simply within the organic constitution of its sufferers."}, {"Title": "A first step toward integrating schema theory in geriatric psychiatry: a Delphi study.", "Abstract": "Schematherapy (ST) is an effective therapy for personality disorders (PD's) in adults, however, empirical research into ST in older adults is limited. The manifestation of schemas over the life course is unclear. Besides, long-term patterns of schemas in old age and whether schemas change during the aging process remain unknown.\nWe performed a Delphi study involving a group meeting of nine experts in the field of ST in older adults.\nFull consensus was achieved that schemas vary later in life, and that this is due to biopsychosocial factors. The concepts of schema triggering (the chance that a maladaptive schema is activated) and schema coping (the psychological and behavioral effort a person makes to minimize the stress that comes with the schema) in the past are important in clinical practice. Understanding how schemas are triggered during the life course and how patients deal with their schemas throughout life will help the therapist to complete the diagnostic puzzle in older individuals and to choose appropriate interventions.\nSchemas are flexible and dynamic constructs that can fade or intensify due to multiple factors. This study is a first step toward advancing the state of knowledge regarding schema theory in an aging population. The results will contribute to improvements in ST in older adults by developing an understanding of the plasticity of schemas during the life course."}, {"Title": "On shame and voice-hearing.", "Abstract": "Hearing voices in the absence of another speaker-what psychiatry terms an auditory verbal hallucination-is often associated with a wide range of negative emotions. Mainstream clinical research addressing the emotional dimensions of voice-hearing has tended to treat these as self-evident, undifferentiated and so effectively interchangeable. But what happens when a richer, more nuanced understanding of specific emotions is brought to bear on the analysis of distressing voices? This article draws findings from the 'What is it like to hear voices' study conducted as part of the interdisciplinary Hearing the Voice project into conversation with philosopher Dan Zahavi's <i>Self and Other: Exploring Subjectivity, Empathy and Shame</i> to consider how a focus on shame can open up new questions about the experience of hearing voices.

Indeed, a challenge is to assess the potential for change of patients so as to offer appropriate therapeutic interventions and enhance treatment program efficacy. This naturalistic study aimed to identify the socio-demographical characteristics and clinical profiles at admission of patients referred to a specialized Crisis Intervention Center (CIC) and to examine the effectiveness of the intervention.\nThe sample was composed of 352 adult outpatients recruited among the referrals to the CIC. Assessment completed at admission and at discharge examined psychiatric symptoms, defense mechanisms, recovery styles and global functioning. The crisis intervention consisted in a psychodynamically oriented multimodal approach associated with medication.\nRegarding the clinical profiles at intake, patients were middle-aged (M\u00a0=\u00a038.56, SD\u00a0=\u00a010.91), with a higher proportion of women (62.22%). They were addressed to the CIC because they had attempted to commit suicide or had suicidal ideation or presented depressed mood related to interpersonal difficulties. No statistical differences were found between patients dropping out (n\u00a0=\u00a0215) and those attending the crisis intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a0137). Crisis intervention demonstrated a beneficial effect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) on almost all variables, with Effect Sizes (ES) ranging from small to large (0.12\u00a0<\u00a0ES\u00a0<\u00a00.75; median\u00a0=\u00a00.49).

Our findings suggest that people presenting an emotional crisis benefit from crisis intervention. However, given methodological constraints, these results need to be considered with caution. Moreover, the clinical significance of the improvements is not confirmed. Thus, the effectiveness of crisis intervention in naturalistic context is not fully determined and should be more rigorously studied in future research."}, {"Title": "Insular and cingulate attenuation during decision making is associated with future transition to stimulant use disorder.", "Abstract": "To understand processes placing individuals at risk for stimulant (amphetamine and cocaine) use disorder.\nLongitudinal study.\nUniversity of California, San Diego Department of Psychiatry, CA, USA.\nOccasional stimulant users (OSU; n\u00a0=\u00a0184) underwent a baseline clinical interview and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session.

Taking the effect size indicated by a meta-analysis as the best estimate of the likely true effect size, and assuming a threshold for declaring statistical significance of 5%, we found that approximately 50% of studies have statistical power in the 0-10% or 11-20% range, well below the minimum of 80% that is often considered conventional. Studies with low statistical power appear to be common in the biomedical sciences, at least in the specific subject areas captured by our search strategy.

Despite being the most commonly used, the 2-year impact factor is limited by a lack of generalisability and comparability, in part due to substantial variation within and between fields. Similar limitations apply to metrics such as citations per paper. New approaches compare a paper's citation count to others in the research area, while others measure social and traditional media impact. However, none of these measures take into account an individual author's contribution to the paper or the number of authors, which we argue are key limitations.

The broad view, by contrast, counts even basic social attachment as being on a spectrum of addictive motivations, underwritten by similar neurochemical processes as more conventional addictions.

Fisher exact, analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests compared the characteristics of caregivers who had contemplated suicide with two comparison groups.\nWithin 24\u00a0months, 76 caregivers reported symptoms of a potential depression and were further assessed for suicidal thoughts. Nine carers (11.8%, 4.7% of the total sample) reported suicidal thoughts with three of those at multiple points. Caregivers with suicidal thoughts had more severe depressive and anxious symptoms, had a lower sense of competence and mastery, felt less happy and experienced more health problems, less family support and more feelings of loneliness than caregivers who had not.\nSuicidal thoughts are present in dementia caregivers and can persist across the care trajectory.

On the one hand, we reconstruct the overall theoretical and methodological development of his positions over the course of the different periods in his oeuvre. On the other hand, we also take a\u00a0closer look at Foucault's philosophical considerations regarding the subjects of his investigations. After an initial introduction of our conceptual approach, we draw on the most recent research on Foucault to show to what extent the phenomenological description of the topic at hand and the historical-critical perspective that are reflected in his early writings of 1954 (the Introduction to Binswanger's Dream and Existence and Mental Illness and Personality) laid the ground for his later work. Moving on to Foucault's work during the 1960s, we look at the core features and methodological bases of his 1961 classic Folie et d\u00e9raison (History of Madness). His propositions regarding the \"absence of madness\" in modernity are conceptualized as an inherently contradictory attempt to liberate the topic under study from the common assumptions at that time. We then situate his 1973/74 lectures on Psychiatric Power in the context of his shift towards analyzing the dynamics of power and highlight the renewed shift of focus in his statements on the \"productivity\" of madness as an effect of power. Finally, we sum up our critique by taking into account the history of the reception of Foucault's writings and ask about their potential significance for the contemporary philosophy and history of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy versus supportive therapy in affective relapse prevention in bipolar patients with a history of trauma: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Up to 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have a history of traumatic events, which is associated with greater episode severity, higher risk of comorbidity and higher relapse rates.

I argue that, at root, these developments can be best understood by contrasting two approaches to the relationship between DSM disorders and their criteria. In a constitutive relationship, criteria definitively define the disorder. Having a disorder is nothing more than meeting the criteria. In an indexical relationship, the criteria are fallible indices of a disorder understood as a hypothetical, tentative diagnostic construct. I trace the origins of the constitutive model to the philosophical theory of operationalism. I then examine a range of historical and empirical results that favor the indexical over the constitutive position including (i) evidence that individual criteria for DSM-III were selected from a broader pool of possible symptoms/signs, (ii) revisions of DSM have implicitly assumed an indexical criteria-disorder relationship, (iii) the indexical position allows DSM criteria to be wrong and misdiagnose patients while such a result is incoherent for a constitutive model, an implausible position, (iv) we assume an indexical criteria-scale relationships for many personality and symptom measures commonly used in psychiatric practice and research, and (v) empirical studies suggesting similar performance for DSM and non-DSM symptoms for major depression. I then review four reasons for the rise of the constitutive position: (i) the 'official' nature of the DSM criteria, (ii) the strong investment psychiatry has had in the DSM manual and its widespread use and success, iii) lack of a clear pathophysiology for our disorders, and (iv) the absence of informative diagnostic signs of minimal clinical importance.

These studies comprised nine animal models, four case studies, and two open-label studies in humans. In anxiety, exogenous ketone supplementation reduced anxiety-related behaviors in a rat model. In depression, KD significantly reduced depression-like behaviors in rat and mice models in two controlled studies. In bipolar disorder, one case study reported a reduction in symptomatology, while a second case study reported no improvement. In schizophrenia, an open-label study in female patients (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200910) reported reduced symptoms after 2\u2009weeks of KD, a single case study reported no improvement. In a brief report, 3\u2009weeks of KD in a mouse model normalized pathological behaviors. In ASD, an open-label study in children (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200930) reported no significant improvement; one case study reported a pronounced and sustained response to KD. In ASD, in four controlled animal studies, KD significantly reduced ASD-related behaviors in mice and rats. In ADHD, in one controlled trial of KD in dogs with comorbid epilepsy, both conditions significantly improved.\nDespite its long history in neurology, the role of KD in mental disorders is unclear. Half of the published studies are based on animal models of mental disorders with limited generalizability to the analog conditions in humans. The review lists some major limitations including the lack of measuring ketone levels in four studies and the issue of compliance to the rigid diet in humans. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for the use of KD in mental disorders, and it is not a recommended treatment option.

These may require management approaches such as use of coercive practices, which impact the well-being of staff members, visiting families and friends, peers, as well as patients themselves. Studies have proposed that not only patients' conditions, but also treatment environment and ward culture may affect patients' behaviour. Seclusion and restraint could possibly be prevented with staff education about user-centred, more humane approaches. Staff education could also increase collaboration between patients, family members and staff, which may further positively affect treatment culture and lower the need for using coercive treatment methods.\nThis is a single-blind, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial involving 28 psychiatric hospital wards across Finland. Units will be randomised to receive either a staff educational programme delivered by the team of researchers, or standard care. The primary outcome is the incidence of use of patient seclusion rooms, assessed from the local/national health registers. Secondary outcomes include use of other coercive methods (limb restraint, forced injection, and physical restraint), service use, treatment satisfaction, general functioning among patients, and team climate and employee turn-over (nursing staff).\nThe study, designed in close collaboration with staff members, patients and their relatives, will provide evidence for a co-operative and user-centred educational intervention aiming to decrease the prevalence of coercive methods and service use in the units, increase the functional status of patients and improve team climate in the units.

We conducted a systematic search for all eligible English and non-English peer-reviewed articles.\nNine cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analyses, providing data on 1547 participants. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that serum and plasma levels of Hcy were increased in subjects with BD in either mania or euthymia when compared to healthy controls, with a large effect size in the mania group (g=0.98, 95% CI: 0.8-1.17, P<0.001, n=495) and a small effect in the euthymia group (g=0.3, 95% CI: 0.11-0.48, P=0.002, n=1052).\nOur meta-analysis provides evidence that Hcy levels are elevated in persons with BD during mania and euthymia.

Because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. Alongside important research using electroencephalography (EEG), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. Here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from MEG resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The clinical MEG resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fMRI and EEG. Taken together, MEG appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in MDD and BD. In particular, a major strength of MEG is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). The reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. However, before we can fully take advantage of MEG connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to MEG connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. Thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. MEG resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fMRI-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations."}, {"Title": "Revolutionizing Cuban Psychiatry: The Freud Wars, 1955-1970.", "Abstract": "This article traces the battle over Freud within Cuban psychiatry from its pre-1959 origins through the \"disappearance\" of Freud by the early 1970s. It devotes particular attention to the visit of two Soviet psychiatrists to Cuba in the early 1960s as part of a broader campaign to promote Pavlov. The decade-long controversy over Freud responded to both theoretical and political concerns. If for some Freud represented political conservatism and theoretical mystification, Pavlov held out the promise of a dialectical materialist future. Meanwhile, other psychiatrists clung to psychodynamic perspectives, or at least the possibility of heterogeneity. The Freudians would end up on the losing side of this battle, with many departing Cuba over the course of the 1960s. But banishing Freud did not necessarily make for stalwart Pavlovians-or vanguard revolutionaries. Psychiatry would find itself relegated to a handmaiden position in the work of revolutionary mental engineering, with the government itself occupying the vanguard."}, {"Title": "Banning the Soviet Lobotomy: Psychiatry, Ethics, and Professional Politics during Late Stalinism.", "Abstract": "This article examines how lobotomy came to be banned in the Soviet Union in 1950. The author finds that Soviet psychiatrists viewed lobotomy as a treatment of \"last resort,\" and justified its use on the grounds that it helped make patients more manageable in hospitals and allowed some to return to work. Lobotomy was challenged by psychiatrists who saw mental illness as a \"whole body\" process and believed that injuries caused by lobotomy were therefore more significant than changes to behavior. Between 1947 and 1949, these theoretical and ethical debates within Soviet psychiatry became politicized. Psychiatrists competing for institutional control attacked their rivals' ideas using slogans drawn from Communist Party ideological campaigns. Party authorities intervened in psychiatry in 1949 and 1950, persecuting Jewish psychiatrists and demanding adherence to Ivan Pavlov's theories. Psychiatrists' existing conflict over lobotomy was adopted as part of the party's own campaign against harmful Western influence in Soviet society."}, {"Title": "Relationship between depression and frailty in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Depression and frailty are prevalent and burdensome in older age.

This systematic review aimed to determine the usefulness of different factors in predicting mental disorder amongst emergency workers and to inform practice regarding screening procedures. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE to identify cohort studies linking pre-employment or pre-duty measures in first responders with later mental health outcomes. Possible predictors of poor mental health were grouped into six categories and their overall level of evidence was assessed. Twenty-one prospective cohort studies were identified. Dynamic measures including physiological responses to simulated trauma and maladaptive coping styles (e.g. negative self-appraisal) had stronger evidence as predictors of vulnerability in first responders than more traditional static factors (e.g. pre-existing psychopathology). Personality factors (e.g. trait anger) had moderate evidence for predictive power. Based on the evidence reviewed, however, we are unable to provide emergency services with specific information to enhance their current personnel selection. The results indicate that pre-duty screening protocols that include personality assessments and dynamic measures of physiological and psychological coping strategies may be able to identify some personnel at increased risk of mental health problems.

Binge eating on palatable food (PF) is a core, maladaptive symptom that cuts across all major types of eating disorders and can be studied via animal models. Using an individual differences rat model of binge eating that identifies binge eating prone (BEP) and binge eating resistant (BER) phenotypes, we previously showed that, compared with males, females consume more PF and are more likely to be classified as BEP. One potential explanation for this sex difference is that PF is inherently more rewarding to females, leading to higher rates of binge eating. Here we tested the hypothesis that females have more robust behavioral and neural responses to PF reward than males. Adult male (N=18) and female (N=17) Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the Conditioned Place Preference paradigm using PF as the unconditioned stimulus. Select males (N=9) and females (N=9) were video-recorded during three of the PF-paired conditioning sessions to score feeding behavior. Following CPP, 13 male and 12 female rats were exposed to PF just prior to sacrifice to induce expression of the neural activation marker Fos, and Fos expression was quantified in mesocorticolimbic, hypothalamic, and amygdalar circuits. In the CPP paradigm, females displayed a more robust shift in preference for the chamber paired with PF compared with males, and behavioral analyses revealed that average duration of individual feeding bouts during pairing sessions was longer in females than in males. Fos expression was significantly higher in females vs. males in select regions of the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit, with no sex differences in hypothalamic or amygdalar regions. These results provide initial evidence that PF may be more rewarding to females than to males, possibly due to heightened responsiveness of neural substrates that mediate the hedonic and motivational responses to PF, which in part, may underlie sex differences in binge eating proneness."}, {"Title": "National Survey on Pediatric Acute Agitation and Behavioral Escalation in Academic Inpatient Pediatric Care Settings.", "Abstract": "Pediatric acute agitation and behavioral escalation (PAABE) is common and disruptive to pediatric inpatient health care.

This review focuses on the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders among children and adolescents, with attention to separation anxiety disorder, social phobia disorder (social anxiety disorder), panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Comprehensive assessment of child and adolescent anxiety disorders benefits from a multimethod approach to evaluation and diagnosis, including semistructured interviews; child and informant questionnaires; collateral information from parents, teachers, pediatricians, and school psychologists; and behavioral observations. Because anxiety symptoms can include avoidance behaviors, somatic complaints, social difficulties, and sleep disturbances, consideration of a differential diagnosis is important. Among the available psychosocial interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure-based therapies have emerged as the most well-established treatment approaches for addressing anxiety disorders among children and adolescents. Pharmacologically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been established to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of pediatric anxiety and are considered the medications of choice for this population. Research indicates that CBT plus SSRI medication is the most effective treatment of anxiety for youths ages seven to 17, compared with either CBT or medication alone.

This study aims to establish levels of irritability and prevalence of DMDD in a clinical sample of children with ADHD, and examine their association with anxiety, depression and family history of depression.\nThe sample consisted of 696 children (mean age 10.9 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD, recruited from UK child psychiatry and paediatric clinics. Parents completed the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment, a semi-structured diagnostic interview, about their child. This was used to establish prevalence of DMDD, anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, as well as obtain symptom scores for irritability, anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessed current parental depression, and family history of depression.\nIrritability was common, with 91% endorsing at least one irritable symptom. 3-month DMDD prevalence was 31%. Children with higher levels of irritability or DMDD were more likely to have comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression and a family history of depression.\nResults are based on a clinical sample, so may not be generalizable to children with ADHD in the general population.\nIrritability and DMDD were common, and were associated with markers of depression liability.

Only the coastal cities with their Western oriented universities provided Western type mental healthcare. In general, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) embracing medicinal herbs and acupuncture was practiced. Mental hospitals were non-existent before 1889 and care of the chronically mentally ill rested with their families and the community; however, the prevalence and spectrum of mental disorders were similar to those in Western countries. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China old-fashioned mental hospitals were founded. The \"Great Leap Forward\" starting in 1958 envisaged the creation of a\u00a0mental healthcare system based on Soviet Union standards. Psychiatry had a\u00a0strong biological orientation, and psychotherapy did not exist. Psychology was rejected as not being science and was not taught at universities before 1978. With the Reform and Opening Policy in 1978 the education of psychology was stepped up. Psychology was introduced as an academic discipline in 1978 and psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine were established in mental healthcare. The current mental healthcare in China resembles the standard in Germany before the \"Psychiatrie-Enquete\" (expert commission official report). With the Mental Health Act adopted in 2013 after 27\u00a0years of planning, China has laid the legal foundation for planning and establishing a\u00a0humane system of mental healthcare.

We present a Python solution, based on the CubicWeb open-source semantic framework, aimed at building population imaging study repositories. In addition, we focus on the tools developed around this framework to overcome the challenges associated with data sharing and collaborative requirements. We describe a set of three highly adaptive web services that transform the CubicWeb framework into a (1) multi-center upload platform, (2) collaborative quality assessment platform, and (3) publication platform endowed with massive-download capabilities.

Spin was identified when concerns or limitations were expressed by the FDA (about the efficacy of the study drug) but not in the corresponding published paper. Concerns mentioned in the papers but not by the FDA were scored as 'non-FDA' concerns.\nOnly six out of 35 (17%) of the FDA concerns pertaining to drug efficacy were reported in the papers. Two papers mentioned a concern that fit the FDA categories, but was not mentioned in the corresponding FDA review. Eighty-seven non-FDA concerns were counted, which often reflected general concerns or concerns related to the study design.\nResults indicate the presence of substantial spin in the clinical trial literature on drugs for anxiety disorders. In papers describing RCTs on anxiety medication, the concerns raised by the authors differed from those raised by the FDA. Published papers mentioned a large number of generic concerns about RCTs, such as a lack of long-term research and limited generalisability, while they mentioned few concerns about drug efficacy. These results warrant the promotion of independent statistical review, reporting of patient-level data, more study of spin, and an increased expectation that authors report FDA concerns."}, {"Title": "Theranostic Biomarkers for Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, chronic, severe, disabling neurodevelopmental brain disorder with a heterogeneous genetic and neurobiological background, which is still poorly understood. To allow better diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia patients, use of easy accessible biomarkers is suggested. The most frequently used biomarkers in schizophrenia are those associated with the neuroimmune and neuroendocrine system, metabolism, different neurotransmitter systems and neurotrophic factors. However, there are still no validated and reliable biomarkers in clinical use for schizophrenia. This review will address potential biomarkers in schizophrenia. It will discuss biomarkers in schizophrenia and propose the use of specific blood-based panels that will include a set of markers associated with immune processes, metabolic disorders, and neuroendocrine/neurotrophin/neurotransmitter alterations. The combination of different markers, or complex multi-marker panels, might help in the discrimination of patients with different underlying pathologies and in the better classification of the more homogenous groups. Therefore, the development of the diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic biomarkers is an urgent and an unmet need in psychiatry, with the aim of improving diagnosis, therapy monitoring, prediction of treatment outcome and focus on the personal medicine approach in order to improve the quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and decrease health costs worldwide."}, {"Title": "Training on the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview improves cultural competence in general psychiatry residents: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess whether a 1-hour didactic session on the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) improves the cultural competence of general psychiatry residents. The main hypothesis was that teaching adult psychiatry residents a 1-hour session on the CFI would improve cultural competence. The exploratory hypothesis was that trainees with more experience in cultural diversity would have a greater increase in cultural competency scores. Psychiatry residents at a metropolitan, county hospital completed demographics and preintervention questionnaires, were exposed to a 1-hour session on the CFI, and were given a postintervention questionnaire. The questionnaire was an adapted version of the validated Cultural Competence Assessment Tool . Paired samples t tests compared pre- to posttest change. Hierarchical linear regression assessed whether pretraining characteristics predicted posttest scores. The mean change of total pre- and posttest scores was significant ( p\u2009=\u2009.002), as was the mean change in subscales Nonverbal Communications ( p\u2009<\u2009.001) and Cultural Knowledge ( p\u2009=\u2009.002).

Historians of psychiatry have understood the Claybury laboratory as a predecessor of the Maudsley Hospital in London: not only was this laboratory closed when the Maudsley was opened in 1916, but its director, Frederick Walker Mott, a champion of the 'German' model in psychiatry, was instrumental in the establishment of this institution. Yet, as I argue in this essay, for all the continuities with the Maudsley, the Claybury laboratory should not be seen solely as its predecessor - or as a British answer to continental laboratories such as Theodor Meynert's in Vienna.

This non-dualistic position refusing the partition along functional versus organic lines is in line with Jean Delay, and with Robert Spitzer who wanted to include in the definition of mental disorder discussed by the DSM-III task force the statement that \"mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders\". However, it is interesting to note that Spitzer and colleagues ingeniously introduced the definition of \"mental disorder\" in the DSM-III in the following statement: \"there is no satisfactory definition that specifies precise boundaries for the concept \"mental disorder\" (also true for such concepts as physical disorder and mental and physical health)\". Indeed, as for \"mental disorders\", it is as difficult to define what they are as it is to define what constitutes a \"physical disorder\". The problem is not the words \"mental\" or \"organic\" but the word \"disorder\". In this line, Wakefield has proposed a useful \"harmful dysfunction\" analysis of mental disorder. They raise the issue of the dualistic opposition between organic and mental disorders, and situate the debate rather between the biological/physiological and the social. The paper provides a brief analysis of this shift on the question of what is a mental disorder, and demonstrates that a mental disorder is not more \"organic\" than any other medical condition. While establishing a dichotomy between organic and psychiatry is no longer intellectually tenable, the solution is not to reduce psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders to the level of \"organic disorders\" but rather to continue to adopt both a critical and clinically pertinent approach to what constitutes a \"disorder\" in medicine."}, {"Title": "Editorial: Child psychology and psychiatry - using science to make a difference.", "Abstract": "The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry has, I think it is fair to say, a special place in the hearts of scientists and scientist-practitioners working broadly in the field of developmental psychopathology.

As psychiatry begins to recognize the shortcomings of a purely symptom-based psychiatric nosology, new data-driven approaches have begun to be utilized with the goal of solving these problems: specifically, identifying trans-diagnostic aspects of clinical phenomenology based on their association with neurobiological processes. In this review, we describe key methodological approaches to understanding OCD from this perspective and highlight the candidate traits that have already been identified as a result of these early endeavours. We discuss how important inferences can be made from pre-existing case-control studies as well as showcasing newer methods that rely on large general population datasets to refine and validate psychiatric phenotypes. As exemplars, we take 'compulsivity' and 'anxiety', putatively trans-diagnostic symptom dimensions that are linked to well-defined neurobiological mechanisms, goal-directed learning and error-related negativity, respectively. We argue that the identification of biologically valid, more homogeneous, dimensions such as these provides renewed optimism for identifying reliable genetic contributions to OCD and other disorders, improving animal models and critically, provides a path towards a future of more targeted psychiatric treatments."}, {"Title": "[The room of errors, a fun learning tool].", "Abstract": "Simulation in health care, a source of innovative pedagogical developments, is particularly well-suited to the training of nursing teams.

A thematic analysis of the narratives was carried out.\nCommunity-based, across the UK.\nPeople were eligible to take part if they had had a close relationship (either as friend, colleague or family member) with a woman who had experienced DV, and were aged 16 or over during the time they knew the survivor. Participants were recruited via posters in community venues, social media and radio advertisement. 23 participants were recruited and interviewed; the majority were women, most were white and ages ranged from mid-20s to 80.\nGenerated themes included: negative impacts on psychological and emotional well-being of informal supporters, and related physical health impacts. Some psychological impacts were over a limited period; others were chronic and had the potential to be severe and enduring. The impacts described suggested that those providing informal support to survivors may be experiencing secondary traumatic stress as they journey alongside the survivor.\nFriends and relatives of DV survivors experience substantial impact on their own health and well-being. There are no direct services to support this group. These findings have practical and policy implications, so that the needs of informal supporters are legitimised and met."}, {"Title": "Genetic Overlap Between Schizophrenia and Developmental Psychopathology: Longitudinal and Multivariate Polygenic Risk Prediction of Common Psychiatric Traits During Development.", "Abstract": "Several nonpsychotic psychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence can precede the onset of schizophrenia, but the etiology of this relationship remains unclear. We investigated to what extent the association between schizophrenia and psychiatric disorders in childhood is explained by correlated genetic risk factors.\nPolygenic risk scores (PRS), reflecting an individual's genetic risk for schizophrenia, were constructed for 2588 children from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) and 6127 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children (ALSPAC). The associations between schizophrenia PRS and measures of anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD) were estimated at age 7, 10, 12/13, and 15 years in the 2 cohorts. Results were then meta-analyzed, and a meta-regression analysis was performed to test differences in effects sizes over, age and disorders.\nSchizophrenia PRS were associated with childhood and adolescent psychopathology. Meta-regression analysis showed differences in the associations over disorders, with the strongest association with childhood and adolescent depression and a weaker association for ODD/CD at age 7. The associations increased with age and this increase was steepest for ADHD and ODD/CD. Genetic correlations varied between 0.10 and 0.25.\nBy optimally using longitudinal data across diagnoses in a multivariate meta-analysis this study sheds light on the development of childhood disorders into severe adult psychiatric disorders. The results are consistent with a common genetic etiology of schizophrenia and developmental psychopathology as well as with a stronger shared genetic etiology between schizophrenia and adolescent onset psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Computational Psychiatry and the Challenge of Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia research is plagued by enormous challenges in integrating and analyzing large datasets and difficulties developing formal theories related to the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this disorder. Computational psychiatry provides a path to enhance analyses of these large and complex datasets and to promote the development and refinement of formal models for features of this disorder.

As the retina is an anatomical and developmental extension of the central nervous system (CNS), changes in retinal function may reflect neurological dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders. The last and most integrated retinal relay before visual information transfer to the brain is the ganglion cell layer. Here, based on collected arguments, we argue that these cells offer a crucial site for indirectly investigating brain function. We describe the anatomical and physiological properties of these cells together with measurements of their functional properties named pattern electroretinogram (PERG). Based on ganglion cell dysfunctions measured with PERG in neurological disorders, we argue for the relevance of studying ganglion cell function in psychiatric research. We review studies that have evaluated ganglion cell function in psychiatric and addictive disorders and discuss how changes in PERG measurements could be functional markers of pathophysiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "The anticholinergic impregnation scale: Towards the elaboration of a scale adapted to prescriptions in French psychiatric settings.", "Abstract": "Some drugs have anticholinergic activity and can cause peripheral or central side effects. Several scales exist to evaluate the potential anticholinergic effect of prescribed drugs but: (i) they are validated in the elderly and mainly assess the cognitive side effect of treatments; (ii) they do not concern some of the drugs frequently used in clinical psychiatry in France. The aim of our study is to develop a new scale, the anticholinergic impregnation scale (AIS), with drugs used in France and based on an assessment of the drugs used against peripheral anticholinergic adverse effects.\nWe assigned a score, ranging from 1 to 3, to a list of 128 drugs with a consensus approach obtained via literature data and expert opinions. We collected data from 7278 prescriptions in 34 French psychiatric facilities: age, sex, atropinic drugs, laxatives and treatments of xerophthalmia and xerostomia, in order to evaluate the association between AIS score and the prescription of drugs aiming to reduce peripheral anticholinergic side effects.\nThe most frequently prescribed drugs were cyamemazine (n=1429; 20%) and tropatepine (n=1403; 19%), two drugs marketed almost exclusively in France and with a score of 3. The frequency of patients with a high AIS score, greater than 5, was significantly higher in patients who received laxatives and treatments of xerostomia. AIS score represents the first validated solution to evaluate anticholinergic load in psychiatry settings in France.\nThe anticholinergic problem remains underevaluated in mental health settings. In order to rule out the confounding factor of mental disease, assessment of peripheral side effects can be considered more objective than the evaluation of cognitive function in psychiatric patients. Building scales appropriate for each state also appear essential to obtain an useful and effective tool in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Cognitive Impairment in Euthymic Pediatric Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "Abstract": "To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating neurocognition in euthymic youths with bipolar disorder (BD) compared to healthy controls (HCs).\nA systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases from inception up until March 23, 2016, for original peer-reviewed articles that investigated neurocognition in euthymic youths with BD compared to HCs. Effect sizes (ES) for individual tests were extracted. In addition, results were grouped according to cognitive domain. This review complied with the PRISMA statement guidelines.\nA total of 24 studies met inclusion criteria (N\u00a0=\u00a01,146; 510 with BD). Overall, euthymic youths with BD were significantly impaired in verbal learning, verbal memory, working memory, visual learning, and visual memory, with moderate to large ESs (Hedge's g\u00a00.76-0.99); significant impairments were not observed for attention/vigilance, reasoning and problem solving, and/or processing speed. Heterogeneity was moderate to large (I<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265 50%) for most ES estimates. Differences in the definition of euthymia across studies explained the heterogeneity in the ES estimate for verbal learning and memory. We also found evidence for other potential sources of\u00a0heterogeneity in several ES estimates including co-occurring attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety disorders, and the use of medications. In addition, the use of different neuropsychological tests appeared to contribute to heterogeneity of some estimates (e.g., attention/vigilance domain).\nEuthymic youths with BD exhibit significant cognitive dysfunction encompassing verbal learning and memory, working memory, and/or visual learning and memory domains. These data indicate that for a subset of individuals with BD, neurodevelopmental factors may contribute to cognitive dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Genetic Heterogeneity in Depressive Symptoms Following the Death of a Spouse: Polygenic Score Analysis of the U.S. Health and Retirement Study.", "Abstract": "Experience of stressful life events is associated with risk of depression. Yet many exposed individuals do not become depressed. A controversial hypothesis is that genetic factors influence vulnerability to depression following stress. This hypothesis is often tested with a \"diathesis-stress\" model, in which genes confer excess vulnerability. The authors tested an alternative formulation of this model: genes may buffer against depressogenic effects of life stress.\nThe hypothesized genetic buffer was measured using a polygenic score derived from a published genome-wide association study of subjective well-being. The authors tested whether married older adults who had higher polygenic scores were less vulnerable to depressive symptoms following the death of their spouse compared with age-matched peers who had also lost their spouse and who had lower polygenic scores. Data were analyzed from 8,588 non-Hispanic white adults in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-representative longitudinal study of older adults in the United States.\nHRS adults with higher well-being polygenic scores experienced fewer depressive symptoms during follow-up. Those who survived the death of their spouses (N=1,647) experienced a sharp increase in depressive symptoms following the death and returned toward baseline over the following 2 years. Having a higher well-being polygenic score buffered against increased depressive symptoms following a spouse's death.\nThe effects were small, and the clinical relevance is uncertain, although polygenic score analyses may provide clues to behavioral pathways that can serve as therapeutic targets. Future studies of gene-environment interplay in depression may benefit from focus on genetics discovered for putative protective factors."}, {"Title": "The Development of Psychiatric Services Providing an Alternative to Full-Time Hospitalization Is Associated with Shorter Length of Stay in French Public Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "International recommendations for mental health care have advocated for a reduction in the length of stay (LOS) in full-time hospitalization and the development of alternatives to full-time hospitalizations (AFTH) could facilitate alignment with those recommendations. Our objective was therefore to assess whether the development of AFTH in French psychiatric sectors was associated with a reduction in the LOS in full-time hospitalization. Using data from the French national discharge database of psychiatric care, we computed the LOS of patients admitted for full-time hospitalization. The level of development of AFTH was estimated by the share of human resources allocated to those alternatives in the hospital enrolling the staff of each sector. Multi-level modelling was carried out to adjust the analysis on other factors potentially associated with the LOS (patients', psychiatric sectors' and environmental characteristics). We observed considerable variations in the LOS between sectors. Although the majority of these variations resulted from patients' characteristics, a significant negative association was found between the LOS and the development of AFTH, after adjusting for other factors. Our results provide first evidence of the impact of the development of AFTH on mental health care and will provide a lever for policy makers to further develop these alternatives."}, {"Title": "Year-End Resident Clinic Handoffs: Narrative Review and Recommendations for Improvement.", "Abstract": "Year-end clinic handoffs in resident continuity clinics are an important patient safety issue.\nIntervention articles addressing the year-end resident clinic handoff were identified in a targeted literature search.

Analyses of demographics, clinical history, recent stressors, and suicide details were conducted in 5 subgroups of suicide decedents: BD self-poisoning, BD other methods, non-BD self-poisoning, non-BD other methods, and unipolar depression self-poisoning. Toxicology results for lethal and present substances were also compared between BD and non-BD self-poisoning subgroups as well as between BD and unipolar depression self-poisoning subgroups.\nAmong BD suicide decedents, self-poisoning was significantly associated with female sex, past suicide attempts, and comorbid substance abuse. In both the BD and non-BD self-poisoning groups, opioids were the most common class of lethal medication. For both groups, benzodiazepines and antidepressants were the most common medications present at time of death, and in 23% of the BD group, an antidepressant was present without a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. Only 31% of the BD group had any mood stabilizer present, with carbamazepine being most common. No antidepressant, mood stabilizer, or antipsychotic was present in 15.5% of the BD group.

Our study sought to examine whether or not we could effectively integrate smartphone-based safety planning into the discharge process on a child and adolescent inpatient psychiatry unit.\nStaff members completed a survey to determine the extent of smartphone ownership in a population of admitted child and adolescent inpatients. In addition to quantifying smartphone ownership, the survey also tracked whether youth would integrate their previously-established safety plan with a specific safety planning application on their smartphone (<i>Be Safe</i>) at the time of discharge.\nSixty-six percent (50/76) of discharged youth owned a smartphone, which is consistent with prior reports of high smartphone ownership in adult psychiatric populations. A minority of youth (18%) downloaded the <i>Be Safe</i> app prior to discharge, with most (68%) suggesting they would download the app after discharge. Notably, all patients who downloaded the app prior to discharge were on their first admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit.\nChild and adolescent psychiatric inpatients have a clear interest in smartphone-based safety planning. Our results suggest that integrating smartphone-related interventions earlier in an admission might improve access before discharge. This highlights the tension between restricting and incorporating smartphone access for child and adolescent inpatients and may inform future study in this area."}, {"Title": "Fellow travellers: Working memory and mental time travel in rodents.", "Abstract": "The impairment of mental time travel is a severe cognitive symptom in patients with brain lesions and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

The translation process gives rise to ethical challenges that are distinctive from challenges posed within psychiatric genomics research itself, or that form part of the delivery of clinical psychiatric genetics services. This article outlines and considers three distinct ethical concerns posed by the process of translating genomic research into frontline psychiatric practice and policy making. First, the genetic essentialism that is commonly associated with the genomics revolution in health care might inadvertently exacerbate stigma towards people with mental disorders. Secondly, the promises of genomic medicine advance a narrative of individual empowerment. This narrative could promote a fatalism towards patients' biology in ways that function in practice to undermine patients' agency and autonomy, or, alternatively, a heightened sense of subjective genetic responsibility could become embedded within mental health services that leads to psychosocial therapeutic approaches and the clinician-patient therapeutic alliance being undermined. Finally, adopting a genomics-focused approach to public mental health risks shifting attention away from the complex causal relationships between inequitable socio-economic, political, and cultural structures and negative mental health outcomes. The article concludes by outlining a number of potential pathways for future ethics research that emphasizes the importance of examining appropriate translation mechanisms, the complementarity between genetic and psychosocial models of mental disorder, the implications of genomic information for the clinician-patient relationship, and funding priorities and resource allocation decision making in mental health."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric comorbidity and suicidal ideation in psoriasis, melanoma and allergic disorders.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders and suicide risk (especially in psoriasis) are frequent and disabling conditions in patients with skin diseases.

Four clinical scenarios represented defensive behaviours and reactions (feelings and actions) to malpractice claims.\nForty-four (20.6%) certified psychiatrists and four (1.9%) residents were directly involved in malpractice claims, while 132 (62.1%) participants admitted to practising DP. Residents acknowledged the practice of DP more than did senior psychiatrists (p=0.038).Awareness of DP correlated with unnecessary hospitalisation of suicidal patients, increased unnecessary follow-up visits and prescribing smaller drug dosages than required for pregnant women and elderly patients.\nThis study provides evidence that DP is well established in the routine clinical daily practice of psychiatrists.

Lithium is a neurotropic drug widely used in psychiatry. In work, we studied effects of lithium administration (for 2 or 7 days) on the expression of Bcl-xL mRNA and protein in the hippocampi and cortices of rats subjected to stress that induced depression-like behavior in the animals. In contrast to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose expression decreased in the hippocampus in response to acute stress, stress increased the level of Bcl-xL mRNA in the hippocampus, but decreased it in the frontal cortex. Treatment of stressed animals with lithium for 2 or 7 days increased Bcl-xL protein levels 1.5-fold in the hippocampus, but it decreased them in the cortex. Therefore, Bcl-xL expression in the brain can be modulated by both stress and psychotropic drugs, and the effects of these factors are brain region-specific: both stress exposure and lithium administration activated Bcl-xL expression in the hippocampus and suppressed it in the frontal cortex. The activation of Bcl-xL expression in the hippocampus by lithium, demonstrated for the first time in this study, suggests an important role of this protein in the therapeutic effects of lithium in the treatment of stress-induced psychoemotional disorders."}, {"Title": "Suicide Following Deliberate Self-Harm.", "Abstract": "The authors sought to identify risk factors for repeat self-harm and completed suicide over the following year among adults with deliberate self-harm.\nA national cohort of Medicaid-financed adults clinically diagnosed with deliberate self-harm (N=61,297) was followed for up to 1 year.

To do so, a closely collaboration with the oncopsychiatrist but also with the referent or liaison psychiatry team is necessary during the patient's oncologic care. Some clinical vignettes will illustrate the modalities of care of bipolar disorders in oncology."}, {"Title": "Findings from a couple-based open trial for adult anorexia nervosa.", "Abstract": "Adult anorexia nervosa (AN) often is persistent, significantly erodes quality of life for both the patient and loved ones, and carries high medical and psychiatric comorbidity. Whereas individual psychotherapy for adult AN leads to improvement in some patients, recent findings indicate that the magnitude of improvement is limited: Only a small percentage of individuals fully recover and dropout rates are high. Thus, it is important to build upon current interventions to improve treatment response. We present results from an open trial of a couple-based intervention for adult anorexia nervosa as an adjunct treatment to standard multidisciplinary care. Twenty couples received treatment over approximately 26 weeks, including a couple-based intervention, individual CBT sessions, psychiatry visits for medication management, and nutritional counseling sessions. The results indicate that patients improved at posttest and 3-month follow-up on a variety of AN-related measures, anxiety and depression, and relationship adjustment. Partners also improved on anxiety, depression, and relationship adjustment. In an exploratory analysis, the multicomponent couple treatment intervention was benchmarked to well-conducted randomized controlled trials of individual therapy for AN; the couple intervention seems to compare favorably on AN-related measures and was associated with a lower dropout rate. In spite of methodological limitations, the findings suggest that including partners in the treatment of adult AN holds potential for bolstering treatment outcomes.

However, little is known about the experiences psychiatrists have had using pharmacotherapy to treat aggression in patients who have both ASD and ADHD (ASD/ADHD). The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of Japanese child and adolescent psychiatrists in prescribing medication for aggression in patients with ASD/ADHD.\nA prospective questionnaire was mailed to 2001 psychiatrists affiliated with the Japanese Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting the outcome of pharmacotherapeutic treatment of aggression in pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD/ADHD.\nOf 2001 psychiatrists, 571 (28.5%) completed the full questionnaire (final sample). Of these, 488 (85.4%) prescribed psychotropic medication in treating pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD/ADHD, 299 (61.3%) of them doing so to treat aggression. Prescribers' duration of practice (odds ratio, 1.055; P\u2009=\u20090.038) and patient symptoms of residual impulsivity (odds ratio, 2.479; P\u2009=\u20090.039) increased the odds of prescribing psychotropic medications to treat aggression in these patients. The respondents reported a similar effect for patients with ADHD/ASD compared with those with ADHD only in treating aggression.\nJapanese psychiatrists tended to prescribe psychotropic medication for aggression in pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD/ADHD. Future studies examining aggression in pediatric and adolescent patients with ASD/ADHD should aim to accumulate evidence for the use of psychotropic medications, which could help clinicians make better decisions."}, {"Title": "Impact of providing psychiatry specialty pharmacist intervention on reducing drug-related problems among children with autism spectrum disorder related to disruptive behavioural symptoms: A prospective randomized open-label study.", "Abstract": "Psychopharmacologic therapy has so far focused on ameliorating disruptive behaviours to improve patient's function and quality of life. Due to the complicated neurobiological aetiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a traditional pharmacist intervention may be insufficient to initiate the optimal care for this vulnerable population. We evaluate the impact of providing specialty psychiatry (PS) pharmacist intervention in identifying and resolving drug-related problems (DRPs) among children with ASD associated with disruptive behaviours.\nAn eight-week-long, prospective, randomized open-label study was conducted. Children between 2.5 and 12\u00a0years of age with ASD and showing disruptive behaviours were included. They were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Patients in the intervention group received pharmacist interventions delivered by a PS pharmacist, while those in control group were cared by a hospital pharmacist. The primary outcome was the number of patients who resolved of at least one DRP by the end of the study. The secondary outcome was to compare the mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) scores between the two groups.\nTwenty-five patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. At week 8, the total number of patients who resolved of at least one DRP was 13 (52%) in the intervention group and 4 (16%) in the control group, respectively (P=.016). Improper drug selection, medication non-adherence and subtherapeutic dosage were the most common DRPs. Mean ABC-I scores improved in the intervention group more than in the control group (9.8\u00b15.6 vs 17.7\u00b17.9; P<.001).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrated that PS pharmacist intervention is an effective strategy to resolve DRPs in patient with ASD. The reduction in common DRPs mostly resulted from the PS pharmacist interventions, including selection of antipsychotic agent, adjustment of dosage based on ABC-I scores and provision of individualized drug counselling. Reducing DRPs led to the improvement of any disruptive behaviour. In addition, multidisciplinary team should develop drug therapy protocols to promote the role of pharmacists in this setting."}, {"Title": "Assessing Entrustable Professional Activities During the Psychiatry Clerkship.", "Abstract": "Within 10\u00a0years, the Association of American Medical Colleges envisions graduating medical students will be entrusted by their school to perform 13 core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) without direct supervision. The authors focused on eight EPAs that appear most relevant to clinical training during the psychiatry clerkship at their institution to evaluate whether students assess themselves as making progress in EPAs during this clerkship, to see how students' self-assessments compare with the clerkship director's assessments, and to see if weaknesses in the curriculum were found.\nAn EPA-assessment scale was designed (ratings 1 to 5) to assess progress toward entrustment in each EPA. Medical students completed pre- and post-psychiatry clerkship self-assessments. The clerkship director independently assessed each student's progress in EPAs utilizing assessment methods already present in the curriculum.\nSeventy of 116 students (60.3%) completed both pre- and post-clerkship self-assessments. These ratings increased significantly from pre- to post-clerkship, representing large effect sizes from 0.83 to 1.13. The largest mean rating increase was observed for EPA 2, Prioritize a differential diagnosis following a clinical encounter. Mean post-clerkship self-assessment ratings were significantly higher than mean post-clerkship instructor ratings for seven of the eight EPAs.\nThe results suggest training during the psychiatry clerkship can contribute to the professional development of medical students in the eight EPAs studied but that student self-assessments tend to be higher than those of the clerkship director. Further study is needed of the relative value and role of student self-assessments versus faculty assessments of progress in EPAs."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry professionals' views of general hospital care for patients with mental illness: The care of patients with mental illness in the general hospital setting.", "Abstract": "Explore the experiences of liaison psychiatry professionals, to gain a greater understanding of the quality of care patients with mental illness receive in the general hospital setting; the factors that affect the quality of care; and their insights on interventions that could improve care.\nA survey questionnaire and qualitative in depth interviews were used to collect data.

Qualitative analysis was done using thematic analysis.\nAreas of concern in the quality of care of patients with co-morbid mental illness included 'diagnostic overshadowing', 'poor communication with patient', 'patient dignity not respected' and 'delay in investigation or treatment'. Eleven contributing factors were identified, the two most frequently mentioned were 'stigmatising attitudes of staff towards patients with co-morbid mental illness' and 'complex diagnosis'. The general overview of care was positive with areas for improvement highlighted. Interventions suggested included 'formal education' and 'changing the liaison psychiatry team'.\nThe cases discussed highlighted several areas where the quality of care received by patients with co-morbid mental illness is lacking, the consequences of which could be contributing to physical health disparities.

However, studies have indicated that few clinicians in psychiatry use the outcome of ROM in their daily work. The aim of this study was to explore the degree of ROM use in clinical practice as well as the explanatory factors of this use.\nIn the Northern Netherlands, a ROM-protocol (ROM-Phamous) for patients with a psychotic disorder has been implemented. To establish the degree of ROM-Phamous use in clinical practice, the ROM results of patients (n=204) were compared to the treatment goals formulated in their treatment plans. To investigate factors that might influence ROM use, clinicians (n=32) were asked to fill out a questionnaire about ROM-Phamous.\nCare domains that were problematic according to the ROM-Phamous results were mentioned in the treatment plan in 28% of cases on average (range 5-45%). The use of ROM-Phamous in the treatment process varies considerably among clinicians. Most of the clinicians find ROM-Phamous both useful and important for good clinical practice. In contrast, the perceived ease-of-use is low and most clinicians report insufficient time to use ROM-Phamous.\nMore frequent ROM use should be facilitated in clinicians. This could be achieved by improving the fit with clinical routines and the ease-of-use of ROM systems. It is important for all stakeholders to invest in integrating ROM in clinical practice.

The objective of this study was to conduct a retrospective investigation of FTD patients in the psychiatry departments of multiple institutions to determine the types and frequencies of any law violations and compare them with those of AD patients. All patients were examined between January 2011 and December 2015 at the specialized dementia outpatient clinics of 10 facilities (5 psychiatry departments of university hospitals, 5 psychiatric hospitals). According to diagnostic criteria, 73 behavior variant FTD (bvFTD) patients, 84 semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) patients, and 255 age- and sex-matched AD subjects as the control group were selected. The findings revealed a higher rate of law violations in the bvFTD and svPPA patients before the initial consultation as compared to the AD group (bvFTD: 33%, svPPA: 21%, AD: 6%) and that many patients had been referred due to such violations. Laws had been broken 4 times or 5 or more times in several cases in the FTD group before the initial consultation. Regarding rates for different types of violation, in bvFTD subjects, the highest rate was for theft, followed by nuisance acts and hit and run. In svPPA, theft had the highest rate, followed by ignoring road signs. There was no gender difference in law violations but they were more frequent when the disease was severe at the initial consultation in the FTD group. As the rates of law violations after the initial consultation were lower than before it, interventions were considered to have been effective. These findings may be useful for future prevention as well as to the legal system."}, {"Title": "N-acetylcysteine Prevents Alcohol Related Neuroinflammation in Rats.", "Abstract": "Alcoholism has been characterized as a systemic pro-inflammatory condition and alcohol withdrawal has been linked to various changes in the brain homeostasis, including oxidative stress and glutamate hyperactivity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant multi-target drug with promising results in psychiatry, including drug addiction. We assessed the effects of NAC on the serum and brain inflammatory cytokines after cessation of chronic alcohol treatment in rats. Male Wistar rats received 2\u00a0g/kg alcohol or vehicle twice a day by oral gavage for 30 days. Rats were treated, from day 31 to 34, with NAC (60 or 90\u00a0mg/kg) or saline, intraperitoneally, once daily. Rats were sacrificed at day 35, trunk blood was collected and the frontal cortex and hippocampus dissected for assessment of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, IL-10. NAC prevented the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokine in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. No changes were observed on serum cytokines. We conclude that NAC protects against inflammation induced by chronic (30 days) alcohol ingestion followed by 5 days cessation in two rat brain areas. Because inflammation has been documented and associated with craving and relapse in alcoholics, the data revealed by this study points to the validity of NAC clinical evaluation in the context of alcohol detoxification and withdrawal."}, {"Title": "Predictive accuracy of risk scales following self-harm: multicentre, prospective cohort study.", "Abstract": "<b>Background</b>Scales are widely used in psychiatric assessments following self-harm. Robust evidence for their diagnostic use is lacking.<b>Aims</b>To evaluate the performance of risk scales (Manchester Self-Harm Rule, ReACT Self-Harm Rule, SAD PERSONS scale, Modified SAD PERSONS scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale); and patient and clinician estimates of risk in identifying patients who repeat self-harm within 6 months.<b>Method</b>A multisite prospective cohort study was conducted of adults aged 18 years and over referred to liaison psychiatry services following self-harm. Scale <i>a priori</i> cut-offs were evaluated using diagnostic accuracy statistics. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine optimal cut-offs and compare global accuracy.<b>Results</b>In total, 483 episodes of self-harm were included in the study. The episode-based 6-month repetition rate was 30% (<i>n</i> = 145). Sensitivity ranged from 1% (95% CI 0-5) for the SAD PERSONS scale, to 97% (95% CI 93-99) for the Manchester Self-Harm Rule. Positive predictive values ranged from 13% (95% CI 2-47) for the Modified SAD PERSONS Scale to 47% (95% CI 41-53) for the clinician assessment of risk. The AUC ranged from 0.55 (95% CI 0.50-0.61) for the SAD PERSONS scale to 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.79) for the clinician global scale.

The present review provides a framework for considering the different aspects of reward processing and their assessment, and highlights recent insights from the field of neuroeconomics that may aid in understanding these processes. Although altered reward processing in psychopathology has often been treated as a general hypo- or hyperresponsivity to reward, increasing data indicate that a comprehensive understanding of reward dysfunction requires characterization within more specific reward-processing domains, including subjective valuation, discounting, hedonics, reward anticipation and facilitation, and reinforcement learning. As such, more nuanced models of the nature of these abnormalities are needed. We describe several processing abnormalities capable of producing the types of selective alterations in reward-related behavior observed in different forms of psychopathology, including (mal)adaptive scaling and anchoring, dysfunctional weighting of reward and cost variables, competition between valuation systems, and reward prediction error signaling."}, {"Title": "Kraepelin's views on obsessive neurosis: a comparison with DSM-5 criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) is considered one of the founders of modern psychiatric nosology. However, his conceptualization of obsessive-compulsive phenomena is relatively understudied. In this article, we compare and contrast excerpts from the eighth edition (1909-1915) of Kraepelin's Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry focusing on what Kraepelin called \"obsessive neurosis\" and related \"original pathological conditions\" with the current DSM-5 criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Consistently with DSM-5 OCD, Kraepelin described obsessive neurosis as characterized by obsessive ideas, compulsive acts, or both together. His detailed descriptions of these symptoms are broadly coherent with their characterization in DSM-5, which is also true for the differential diagnoses he provided. He also mentioned cases illustrating decreased insight into symptoms and association with tic disorders. In conclusion, Kraepelin's experience, which reflects decades of consistent clinical work, may help validate current ideas and explain how the current conceptualization has emerged and developed. Even though one can hardly say that the classification laid out in DSM-5 goes back to Kraepelin's views directly, it still is true that Kraepelin played an outstanding role in systematizing psychiatric diagnostic criteria in general, and provided a major contribution to the conceptual history of OCD."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric and Psychologic Impact of Surgery While Awake in Children for Resection of Brain Tumors.", "Abstract": "Intraoperative direct stimulation during surgery while awake is considered to be the gold standard for identifying eloquent cortical sites.

It aims to increase people's ability to manage a life with a long-term illness. For people with bipolar disorder, psychoeducation is one of a range of psychosocial interventions now considered part of contemporary mental health practice. It has taken on a 'common sense' status that results in little critique of psychoeducation practices. Using a published manual on psychoeducation and bipolar disorder as its data, Foucauldian discourse analysis was used in the present study for a critical perspective on psychoeducation in order to explore the taken-for-granted assumptions on which it is based. It identifies that the text produces three key subject positions for people with bipolar disorder. To practice self-management, a person must: (i) accept and recognize the authority of psychiatry to know them; (ii) come to see that they can moderate themselves; and (iii)\u00a0see themselves as able to undertake a reflexive process of self-examination and change. These findings highlight the circular and discursive quality to the construct of insight that is central to how psychoeducation is practiced. Using Foucault's construct of pastoral power, it also draws attention to the asymmetrical nature of power relations between the clinician and the person with bipolar disorder. An effect of the use of medical discourse in psychoeducation is to limit its ability to work with ambivalence and contradiction. A critical approach to psychotherapy and education offers an alternate paradigm on which to basis psychoeducation practices."}, {"Title": "Understanding the role of serotonin in psychiatric diseases.", "Abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) continues to attract researchers' interest after almost a century.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a one-day visit to a high secure forensic psychiatric unit on medical students' attitudes towards psychiatry and also assesses career intentions and the factors influencing these.\nChange in attitudes and career intention were measured by administering a questionnaire, which included the 30-item Attitudes Toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) survey, at the start (time 1) and end (time 2) of the one-day visit. Qualitative data on factors influencing career choice was also gathered.\nEvaluation of 284 responses revealed a significant increase in positive attitude towards psychiatry from time 1 to time 2 in the sample as a whole. The most influential factor on consideration of psychiatry as a career across all groups was the medical school clinical placement. For those that tended away from choosing psychiatry as a career, patient prognosis was important.\nPoor recruitment in psychiatry in the UK is already established which will doubtless be compounded by controversies surrounding the proposed new junior doctors' contract. Now more than ever, the need to inspire and motivate those at medical school encountering psychiatry is crucial. Our findings add to the body of evidence that the medical school clinical attachment is fundamental in shaping attitudes. However, these results also show that a well-planned visit to a specialised psychiatric unit outside of traditional placements can have a significant impact on students' attitudes toward psychiatry and mental illness in general.

We argue that there is a need to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that confer psychiatric vulnerability following maltreatment, if we are to progress from simply treating those with a manifest disorder, to developing effective preventative approaches that can help offset the likelihood that such disorders will emerge in the first place.\nWe review extant functional neuroimaging studies of children and adolescents exposed to early neglect and/or maltreatment, including physical, sexual and emotional abuse across four neurocognitive domains: threat processing, reward processing, emotion regulation and executive control. Findings are discussed in the context of 'latent vulnerability', where alterations in neurocognitive function are considered to carry adaptive value in early adverse caregiving environments but confer long-term risk.\nStudies on threat processing indicate heightened as well as depressed neural responsiveness in maltreated samples, particularly in the amygdala, thought to reflect threat hypervigilance and avoidance respectively. Studies on reward processing generally report blunted neural response to anticipation and receipt of rewards, particularly in the striatum, patterns associated with depressive symptomatology. Studies on emotion regulation report increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during active emotion regulation, possibly reflecting greater effortful processing. Finally, studies of executive control report increased dorsal ACC activity during error monitoring and inhibition.\nAn emerging body of work indicates that altered neurocognitive functioning following maltreatment: (a) is evident even in the absence of overt psychopathology; (b) is consistent with perturbations seen in individuals presenting with psychiatric disorder; (c) can predict future psychiatric symptomatology. These findings suggest that maltreatment leads to neurocognitive alterations that embed latent vulnerability to psychiatric disorder, establishing a compelling case for identifying those children at most risk and developing mechanistically informed models of preventative intervention. Such interventions should aim to offset the likelihood of any future psychiatric disorder."}, {"Title": "Cardioembolic strokes resulting from a self-inflicted needle puncture involving both sides of the heart.", "Abstract": "Foreign bodies in the heart are rare occurrences with a limited evidence base to guide recommendations on management.

This study aimed to clarify the extent to which mental and substance use disorders individually and in combination contribute to correctional outcomes in order to determine optimal treatment and promote public safety.\nDifferences were examined between four groups of federal offenders in Canada (N=715): those with a mental disorder only, those with a substance use disorder only, those with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, and those with no disorder. Groups were compared on profiles, criminal histories, charges while incarcerated (institutional charges), and reconvictions after release from incarceration by using chi-square tests and Cox regression analyses that controlled for risk factors.\nOf the four groups, those with co-occurring disorders had the most substantial criminal histories and the highest rates of institutional charges, transfers to segregation while incarcerated, and reconvictions. The group with only mental disorders had outcomes intermediate between the groups with only substance use disorders and the group with neither type of disorder.\nHaving a substance use disorder appeared to be the key factor contributing to poorer correctional outcomes for offenders with mental disorders.

The primary goal of this research was to investigate whether personality dimensions, including temperament, character, and trait impulsivity, were associated with comorbid MDD, as well as with suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients suffering from combat-related PTSD.\nThe sample consisted of 148 Croatian male war veterans (mean age 49.53 years) treated for PTSD at the National Center for Psychotrauma, Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Center Zagreb. Fifty-one (34%) of them met ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for current or lifetime MDD, while 97 (66%) were diagnosed with PTSD alone. All the participants were assessed with the M.I.N.I. diagnostic interview and they completed the following battery of self-report instruments: the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11).\nComparisons between the two clinical groups showed that PTSD+MDD patients were more suicidal and differed with regard to temperament dimensions Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Persistence, character dimension Self-Directedness, and trait impulsivity. In three multivariate regression analyses, it was revealed that character dimension Cooperativeness as well as trait impulsivity were unique predictors of suicidal ideation, while controlling for the influence of sociodemographics, length of treatment and comorbid depression.\nCombat-related PTSD patients with comorbid depression exhibit increased suicide thoughts and different personality profiles in comparison with those suffering from PTSD alone. Character dimension Cooperativeness and trait impulsivity seem to be uniquely predictive of suicide ideation in this population. Elucidation of individual psychological factors that increase the risk of MDD and suicidal tendencies in war veterans with PTSD may facilitate more effective prevention and treatment methods."}, {"Title": "Explanatory model of illness of the patients with schizophrenia and the role of educational intervention.", "Abstract": "This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Department of Psychiatry, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from February to August 2015 to explore beliefs and concepts of patients with schizophrenia about their illness and to find out the effectiveness of structured educational intervention in changing the explanatory models of illness of the patients and in their symptoms reduction. One hundred and three patients were recruited in the trial who were randomly assigned to two groups i.e., Experimental (n=53) and Control i.e., Treatment As Usual, TAU (n=50).

Guidelines typically use a single dimension of information, and generally discard contextual evidence and formal expert knowledge and consumer's experiences in the process. In recognition of the limitations of guidelines in complex cases, complex interventions and systems research, there has been significant effort to develop new tools, guides, resources and structures to use alongside EBM methods of guideline development. In addition to these advances, a new framework based on the philosophy of science is required. Guidelines should be defined as implementation decision support tools for improving the decision-making process in real-world practice and not only as a procedure to optimise the knowledge base of scientific discovery and corroboration. A shift from the model of the EBM pyramid of corroboration of evidence to the use of broader multi-domain perspective graphically depicted as 'Greek temple' could be considered. This model takes into account the different stages of scientific knowledge (discovery, corroboration and implementation), the sources of knowledge relevant to guideline development (experimental, observational, contextual, expert-based and experiential); their underlying inference mechanisms (deduction, induction, abduction, means-end inferences) and a more precise definition of evidence and related terms.

The relative virtues of a syndromal versus etiologic psychiatric nosology have actually been debated within our field for a long time. To deepen and historically contextualize our current discussion, I review in detail the proposal for etiologic diagnostic systems for insanity by David Skae (1814-1873). While his proposal was intuitive and appealing to some, others questioned its viability and utility pointing out a number of potential problems in its implementation that remain relevant today. Something critical might be lost for psychiatric disorders, they argued, if mental symptoms were removed from diagnostic criteria. Etiologically based diagnoses work best for mono-causal disorders and those where the causes all operate on the same scientific level. However, psychiatric disorders are highly multifactorial with a wide diversity of risk factors spread across biological, psychological and social-environmental domains so identification of a particular cause on which to base diagnoses would be difficult. Not only do individual risk factors contribute to many different disorders but most disorders are influenced by many etiologic factors. With respect to causes and disorders, psychiatry is characterized by a 'many to many' relationship which would make an etiologic nosologic system inherently problematic. Finally, causes and effects can be devilishly difficult to distinguish for psychiatric illness and, while clinically based nosologies aid in differential diagnosis, etiologically based system might not operate similarly."}, {"Title": "Schizophrenia illness severity is associated with reduced loss aversion.", "Abstract": "Loss aversion, whereby losses weigh more heavily than equal-sized gains, has been demonstrated in many decision-making settings.

In this study, 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 16 control participants, matched by age and sex, played two versions of the Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma, one version with only positive payoffs and another version in which negative payoffs were possible, with the second version being derived from the first by subtracting a constant value from all payoffs. The control group demonstrated significantly lower cooperation rates under negative payoffs, compared with the version with only positive payoffs, indicative of loss aversion. The patient group on average showed no loss aversion response. Moreover, the extent of loss aversion in patients was found to be negatively correlated with schizophrenia illness severity, with less ill patients showing loss aversion more similar to controls.

In most instances, there are no scientific grounds in order to ascribe with reasonable certainty liability to medical personnel and nursing staff, while often judges tend to stretch the concept of \u201cprotection\u201d to a degree to which the psychiatrist is deemed to have a legal obligation to stave off the development of any adverse consequence which psychic distress may bring upon the patient. The case-records pertaining to suicide are symptomatic of such a tendency on the part of the Supreme Court as to convict healthcare professionals, the lack of incontrovertible evidence notwithstanding. The authors of this paper expound and elaborate on the conditions needed to ascribe liability to the psychiatrist, and the cause and effect relationship between the doctor\u2019s professional behavior and the patient\u2019s eventual suicide. On such basis, several sentences are perused in which the failure to institutionalize, the discharging of a patient, the granting of leaves and an obligation to supervise all come into play, highlighting how suicide is far too complex an outcome to be rationalized into the principle of causality beyond the reasonable doubt, as dictated by the criminal procedure codes, neither can it be kept from happening through the patients\u2019 loss of personal liberty. Within such a legal framework, what becomes apparent is the inadequateness of any set of standardized rules and laws regulating professional liability, and its inability to properly take into account the complexities and peculiarities inherent to psychiatry. Consequently, a proper overhaul of such proceedings appears to be urgent, via a newly devised set of provisions, crafted to provide a new array of undisputable, basic behavioral standards, the breaching of which would entail the sanctioning on the part of the lawful authorities of such violations, even in absence of the suicide of a patient, or persisting the inability to demonstrate a cause-effect relationship."}, {"Title": "Free will, neuroscience, and choice: towards a decisional capacity model for insanity defense evaluations.", "Abstract": "Free will has often been considered central to criminal responsibility. Yet, the concept of free will is also difficult to define and operationalize, and, moreover, it is intensely debated. In particular, the very existence of free will has been denied based on recent neuroscience findings. This debate has significant implications on those fields in which the link between free will and behaviour is the main focus of interest, such as forensic psychiatry. In fact, a tension is often experienced between the centrality of the notion of free will on the one hand, and its controversial status on the other. This tension needs to be addressed, especially in forensic psychiatry, since it is relevant for actual assessments of legal insanity. In the present paper we will try to operationalize \u201cfree will\u201d using a fourpartite decision-making capacity model, which can be used in forensic assessment of insanity.

Some fundamentally disagreed with the principle of harm reduction for self-harm because it challenged their core beliefs about the morality of self-harm, or the ethical and potential legal ramifications of allowing individuals to harm themselves.\nThis study was conducted solely with practitioners working on inpatient units. The majority of staff interviewed had no experience of harm reduction and so their concerns may not reflect challenges encountered by practitioners in clinical practice.\nHarm reduction is being used to support people who self-harm within inpatient psychiatry and some practitioners report potential benefits of this approach. However, this raises particularly complex practical, ethical and legal issues and further research is needed to assess the safety, acceptability and efficacy of the approach."}, {"Title": "Imaging Genetics and Genomics in Psychiatry: A Critical Review of Progress and Potential.", "Abstract": "Imaging genetics and genomics research has begun to provide insight into the molecular and genetic architecture of neural phenotypes and the neural mechanisms through which genetic risk for psychopathology may emerge. As it approaches its third decade, imaging genetics is confronted by many challenges, including the proliferation of studies using small sample sizes and diverse designs, limited replication, problems with harmonization of neural phenotypes for meta-analysis, unclear mechanisms, and evidence that effect sizes may be more modest than originally posited, with increasing evidence of polygenicity. These concerns have encouraged the field to grow in many new directions, including the development of consortia and large-scale data collection projects and the use of novel methods (e.g., polygenic approaches, machine learning) that enhance the quality of imaging genetic studies but also introduce new challenges. We critically review progress in imaging genetics and offer suggestions and highlight potential pitfalls of novel approaches. Ultimately, the strength of imaging genetics and genomics lies in their translational and integrative potential with other research approaches (e.g., nonhuman animal models, psychiatric genetics, pharmacologic challenge) to elucidate brain-based pathways that give rise to the vast individual differences in behavior as well as risk for psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Pituitary Hyperplasia in a Female Patient with a Severe Childhood Abuse History.", "Abstract": "A 24-year-old Caucasian female patient was referred to our endocrinology service to investigate a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) finding of \"pituitary mass\". The first two sMRI were identified as pituitary adenoma but the following two examinations suggested the possibility of pituitary hyperplasia (PH). The patient was referred to our service for diagnostic clarification and therapy due to the divergence in sMRI reports and the surgical procedure indicated by the neurosurgical team of the other institution. The patient had no complaints, laboratory tests were all normal, and the sMRI clearly showed a PH. However, what caught our attention was her behavior. During the interview she was intermittently talking and acting like a child even though her age was 24. She reported being a foster child and was severely mistreated during childhood. Parallel psychiatric evaluation was requested and an association between the PH and the childhood abuse was identified. Early life stress may be associated with accelerated pituitary gland volume development, but there is still a paucity of data in literature about this issue. We should be aware of other cases like this one, and a correct differential diagnosis may contribute to contraindicate transsphenoidal surgery. When a childhood abuse history is present, we recommend admission to a psychiatric facility for adequate treatment."}, {"Title": "The Phenomenon of Pathological Dissociation in the Ancient Chinese Medicine Literature.", "Abstract": "Dissociative symptoms and disorders have been reported in many different cultures. If pathological dissociation is naturally occurring and related to adverse experiences, such phenomena should have been witnessed and portrayed before the modern age. To investigate whether this is the case, the author made use of the rich ancient Chinese medicine literature and looked for descriptions of pathological dissociation in medical documents written by ancient Chinese medical practitioners. In this paper, the author presents six cases selected from the ancient Chinese medicine literature. The phenomenon of pathological dissociation is observed in these cases. This is the first report of case descriptions of pathological dissociation documented in Chinese cultures before 1900."}, {"Title": "A model-based analysis of decision making under risk in obsessive-compulsive and hoarding disorders.", "Abstract": "Attitudes towards risk are highly consequential in clinical disorders thought to be prone to \"risky behavior\", such as substance dependence, as well as those commonly associated with excessive risk aversion, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding disorder (HD). Moreover, it has recently been suggested that attitudes towards risk may serve as a behavioral biomarker for OCD. We investigated the risk preferences of participants with OCD and HD using a novel adaptive task and a quantitative model from behavioral economics that decomposes risk preferences into outcome sensitivity and probability sensitivity. Contrary to expectation, compared to healthy controls, participants with OCD and HD exhibited less outcome sensitivity, implying less risk aversion in the standard economic framework. In addition, risk attitudes were strongly correlated with depression, hoarding, and compulsion scores, while compulsion (hoarding) scores were associated with more (less) \"rational\" risk preferences. These results demonstrate how fundamental attitudes towards risk relate to specific psychopathology and thereby contribute to our understanding of the cognitive manifestations of mental disorders. In addition, our findings indicate that the conclusion made in recent work that decision making under risk is unaltered in OCD is premature."}, {"Title": "The use of cyproterone acetate in a forensic psychiatric cohort of male sex offenders and its associations with sexual activity and sexual functioning.", "Abstract": "Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a steroidal anti-androgenic medication used in the field of psychiatry for the treatment of paraphilic disorders, hypersexuality, and inappropriate sexual behaviour which may be present in patients with disorders such as mild and major neurocognitive disorders. In the forensic psychiatric population, it is prescribed for these indications especially for patients with a history of committing a sexual offence or who are at moderate to high risk of recidivism.\nTo investigate the use of CPA in a forensic psychiatric cohort of male sex offenders and its associations with sexual activity and sexual functioning.\nSeventy-six forensic psychiatric patients from Weskoppies Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, participated in the study which measured their sexual functioning. A specifically designed questionnaire was used to capture relevant background information. The use of CPA was studied. The Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, Male Clinical Version (CSFQ-M-C) was used to measure sexual functioning of participants. The CSFQ-M-C scores, and those of all its subscales, of participants on CPA were compared to those not on the drug. Relevant statistical analyses were performed.\nThirteen out of the 76 participants were being treated with CPA (17.11%). In total, 53.85% of the participants on CPA and 65.08% not on CPA had scores indicating the presence of sexual dysfunction. The total CSFQ-M-C scores for participants on CPA (mean = 40.54; median = 42) were not statistically significantly lower than those not on the drug (mean = 41.22; median = 41). More notable is that the use of CPA in this population was associated with lower levels of desire, frequency of and pleasure from sexual activity. There was an association between having intellectual disability and being treated with CPA.\nThat all the participants were being treated with psychotropic medication could account for the high percentage of sexual dysfunction in any or all areas of sexual functioning and contribute to the small difference in CSFQ-M-C scores between the two groups. Only a tentative conclusion can be made that CPA may be more effective in decreasing levels of desire, frequency and pleasure related to sexual activity than other areas of sexual functioning. The indication for the use of CPA in this population should be assessed clinically according to patient circumstances and risk assessment."}, {"Title": "Neurodevelopmental Perspectives on Wnt Signaling in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that Wnt signaling is relevant to pathophysiology of diverse mental illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. In the 35 years since Wnt ligands were first described, animal studies have richly explored how downstream Wnt signaling pathways affect an array of neurodevelopmental processes and how their disruption can lead to both neurological and behavioral phenotypes. Recently, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models have begun to contribute to this literature while pushing it in increasingly translational directions. Simultaneously, large-scale human genomic studies are providing evidence that sequence variation in Wnt signal pathway genes contributes to pathogenesis in several psychiatric disorders. This article reviews neurodevelopmental and postneurodevelopmental functions of Wnt signaling, highlighting mechanisms, whereby its disruption might contribute to psychiatric illness, and then reviews the most reliable recent genetic evidence supporting that mutations in Wnt pathway genes contribute to psychiatric illness. We are proponents of the notion that studies in animal and hiPSC models informed by the human genetic data combined with the deep knowledge base and tool kits generated over the last several decades of basic neurodevelopmental research will yield near-term tangible advances in neuropsychiatry."}, {"Title": "Children seeking help for auditory verbal hallucinations; who are they?", "Abstract": "Auditory Verbal Hallucinations (AVH) in children and adolescents are a relatively common and mostly transient feature in community samples. However, it should not be regarded as a merely benign phenomenon, as childhood AVH are associated with psychopathology. Little is known about the clinical group of children seeking help for AVH. This brings uncertainty on how to assess and treat these children.\nThis study describes the characteristics of 95 help-seeking children (aged 6 to 18years) with AVH attending an outpatient clinic specifically dedicated to help youth with this complaint. We aim to provide pointers regarding diagnostic assessment and interventions.\nChildren seeking help for AVH suffered from a diversity of co morbid psychiatric diagnoses and consistently experienced high stress from AVH. When the DSM-IV-TR criteria for psychotic disorder NOS were used, all 95 children obtained this diagnosis. However, when a psychotic disorder was defined using the A-criterion of schizophrenia, only a minority of 11 cases (11.6%) was diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder. All children were in need of psycho-education and coping strategies and only the minority (11.6%) fulfilling criteria for a more narrowly defined psychotic disorder was prescribed antipsychotic medication.\nChildren seeking help for AVH form a heterogeneous group with high stress and reduced functioning.

Revival of studies on psychological trauma and dissociation, which remained outside mainstream psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis for the most part of the past century, has provided a new opportunity to revisit this intellectual and scientific endeavor. This paper attempts to integrate a series of empirical and theoretical studies on psychological consequences of developmental traumatization, which may yield further insight into factors which threaten the integrity of human consciousness. The paper proposes that an individual's experience of distorted reality and betrayal precipitates a cyclical dynamic between the individual and the external world by disrupting the developmental function of mutuality which is essential for maintenance of the integrity of the internal world while this inner world is in turn regulated vis-\u00e0-vis external reality. Dissociation -the common factor in all types of post-traumatic syndromes- is facilitated by violation of boundaries by relational omission and intrusion as represented by distinct effects and consequences of childhood neglect and abuse. Recent research conducted on clinical and non-clinical populations shows both bimodal (undermodulation and overmodulation) and bipolar (intrusion and avoidance) neurobiological and phenomenological characteristics of post-traumatic response. These seem to reflect \"parallel-distinct structures\" that control separate networks covering sensori-motor and cognitive-emotional systems. This understanding provides a conceptual framework to assist explanation of diverse post-traumatic mental trajectories which culminate in a common final pathway comprised of partly overlapping clinical syndromes such as complex PTSD, dissociative depression, dissociative identity disorder (DID), or \"borderline\" phenomena. Of crucial theoretical and clinical importance is that these maladaptive post-traumatic psychological formations are regarded as processes in their own right rather than as a personality disorder innate to the individual. Such mental division may perform in that internal detachment can serve to preserve the genuine aspects of the subject until such time as they can be reclaimed via psychotherapy. The paper attempts to integrate these ideas with reference to the previously proposed theory of the \"Functional Dissociation of Self\" (\u015ear and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, 2007)."}, {"Title": "Surviving the Lunacy Act of 1890: English Psychiatrists and Professional Development during the Early Twentieth Century.", "Abstract": "In recent decades, historians of English psychiatry have shifted their major concerns away from asylums and psychiatrists in the nineteenth century. This is also seen in the studies of twentieth-century psychiatry where historians have debated the rise of psychology, eugenics and community care. This shift in interest, however, does not indicate that English psychiatrists became passive and unimportant actors in the last century. In fact, they promoted Lunacy Law reform for a less asylum-dependent mode of psychiatry, with a strong emphasis on professional development. This paper illustrates the historical dynamics around the professional development of English psychiatry by employing Andrew Abbott's concept of professional development. Abbott redefines professional development as arising from both abstraction of professional knowledge and competition regarding professional jurisdiction. A profession, he suggests, develops through continuous re-formation of its occupational structure, mode of practice and political language in competing with other professional and non-professional forces. In early twentieth-century England, psychiatrists promoted professional development by framing political discourse, conducting a daily trade and promoting new legislation to defend their professional jurisdiction. This professional development story began with the Lunacy Act of 1890, which caused a professional crisis in psychiatry and led to inter-professional competition with non-psychiatric medical service providers. To this end, psychiatrists devised a new political rhetoric, 'early treatment of mental disorder', in their professional interests and succeeded in enacting the Mental Treatment Act of 1930, which re-instated psychiatrists as masters of English psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Characteristics and health conditions of a group of nursing home patients with mental-physical multimorbidity - the MAPPING study.", "Abstract": "Long-term care facilities have partly taken over the traditional asylum function of psychiatric hospitals and house an increasing group of patients with mental-physical multimorbidity (MPM). Little is known about the characteristics, behavior, and care dependency of these patients. This paper aims to describe these aspects.\nExplorative, descriptive study among patients with MPM without dementia (n = 142), living in 17 geronto-psychiatric nursing home (NH) units across the Netherlands, stratified by those referred from mental healthcare services (MHS) and other healthcare services (OHS). Data collection consisted of chart review, semi-structured interviews, (brief) neuropsychological testing, and self-report questionnaires. Patients referred from MHS (n = 58) and from OHS (n = 84) were compared by descriptive statistics.\nDespite exclusion of patients with dementia, the majority of participants had cognitive impairment. Prevalence and severity of frontal impairment were high, as well as the number of patients with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms. MHS patients were younger, had more chronic psychiatric disorders, and more often used antipsychotics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, domains of care dependency, physical conditions and concomitant medication use differed not significantly between the subgroups.\nBoth groups of patients with MPM showed heterogeneity in various aspects but differed not significantly regarding the consequences of their multimorbidity. In a variety of characteristics, this group seems to be different from other NH patient groups, which requires extra knowledge and skills of the staff. To uncover which knowledge and skills are necessary, the next step should be to investigate the specific care needs of NH patients with MPM without dementia."}, {"Title": "Mental Health Conditions and Symptoms in Pediatric Hospitalizations: A Single-Center Point Prevalence Study.", "Abstract": "Children and adolescents necessitating hospitalization for physical health conditions are at high risk for mental health conditions; however, the prevalence of mental health conditions and symptoms among hospitalized children and adolescents is uncertain.

Lifetime prevalence of depression is reported more frequently in temporal lobe epilepsy and is estimated at 35%. This co-morbidity appears to be related with various mechanisms. The aim of this study was to determine the quality of life (QoL) of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy with and without co-morbid depression in an Argentinean population.\nPatients admitted to the video-EEG monitoring unit during the period 2010-2013 went through a standardized psychiatric assessment using SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I diagnoses of DSM-IV), BDI II (Beck Depression Inventory) GAF (Global assessment of functioning), and Q LES Q-SF (for quality of life). Patients were divided in two groups: with and without depression (according to DSM-IV). Sociodemographic data, BDI II scores, GAF, and quality of life (QoL) were compared between the two groups. Comparisons were made using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Frequency distributions were compared by Chi-square test. Spearman correlation coefficients were determined.\nSeventy-seven patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy were eligible for this study, 41 patients were included in the group with depression (mean BDI II 15.93), and 36 in the group without depression (mean BDI II 3.36) (p=0.001). The overall QoL was significantly lower in the group with depression compared to the group without depression (p<0.01). The most affected areas were: physical health (p=0.013), mood (p=0.006), course activities (referring to school as well as to hobbies or classes outside of school) (p=0.003), leisure time activities (p=0.011), social activities (p=0.047), general activities (p=0.042), and medication (p=0.022). Severity of depression according to BDI II had a negative correlation with overall QoL (r - 0.339, p<0.01). No correlations were found between seizure frequency, QoL and BDI II.\nPatients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and co-morbid depression reported worst QoL. Depression disrupts daily functioning (leisure, social functioning) and is a negative influence for subjective perception of health and medication.

This study examines the relationships between NSSI and the number of negative ('negative\u00a0complex') and opposing valence ('conflicting') emotions. One hundred and seven youth (aged 15-25 years) with first-presentation BPD were assessed using a combination of self-report and ecological momentary assessment to investigate trait levels of emotional acceptance and in vivo changes in the number of negative complex and conflicting emotions before and after self-injurious thoughts and behaviours. Multilevel modelling revealed that changes in the number of negative complex emotions mirrored distress levels before and after self-injurious thoughts and behaviours, approximating a quadratic curve. Increases in the number of negative complex emotions reported prior to self-injurious thoughts and behaviours were associated with lower acceptance of negative emotions. These findings indicate that the number of negative emotions experienced contributes to distress prior to engagement in NSSI. The relationship between non-acceptance of negative emotions and negative complex emotions prior to NSSI suggests that improved emotional awareness and acceptance should be a focus for early interventions aimed at reducing self-injury."}, {"Title": "[Deconstructing Kanner].", "Abstract": "Kanner, in 1943, and Asperger, in 1944, published papers that have been considered the first descriptions of autism. Kanner is acknowledged as having been the first to recognise this condition, while Asperger is attributed with the identification of a milder form of autism which has been denominated Asperger's syndrome. Kanner's paper played an important role in the development of the conceptualisation of autism due to its being published in the United States, where it became popular in the field of child psychiatry. In contrast, Asperger's work, written in German during the period dominated by Nazism, was practically ignored until almost four decades later. A review of the historical data, mostly collected by Silberman, reveals that Kanner had first-hand knowledge of the work on autism that Asperger had begun ten years earlier. Moreover, on re-reading and analysing the pioneering publications it becomes clear that the contributions made by Asperger are still fully valid today, to the point of having intuited a complex polygenic aetiology and that it would fit in perfectly with autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5."}, {"Title": "Risk factors of coercion among psychiatric inpatients: a nationwide register-based cohort study.", "Abstract": "Reducing the use of coercion among patients with mental disorders has long been a political priority. However, risk factors for coercive measures have primarily been investigated in smaller studies. To reduce the use of coercion, it is crucial to identify people at risk which we aim to do in this first large-scale study.\nA cohort study was conducted among all psychiatric inpatients in Denmark, following 112,233 individuals during 1999-2014. Data from Danish registers were analysed using logistic regression for repeated measures.\n24,594 inpatients were exposed to a coercive measure (21.9%). Clinical characteristics were the foremost predictors of coercion and patients with organic mental disorder had the highest increased risk of being subjected to a coercive measure (OR\u2009=\u20095.56; 95% CI\u2009=\u20095.04, 6.14). The risk of coercion was the highest in the first admission and decreased with the number of admissions (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). The following socioeconomic variables were associated with an increased risk of coercion: male sex, unemployment, lower social class and immigrants from low and middle income countries (all p\u2009<\u20090.001). Early retirement and social relations, such as being married and having children, reduced the risk of being subjected to coercive measure (all p\u2009<\u20090.05).\nFrom our nationwide data, we identified a broad range of risk factors associated with coercive measures.

The majority of children with tic disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a0191, 93.1%) had Tourette syndrome, the primary population targeted for these studies. Children with Tourette syndrome were similar across sites in terms of tic severity and the occurrence of comorbid conditions. The occurrence of psychiatric comorbidities in the control group was comparable with that in the general pediatric population of the United States, making this a well-justified comparison group.\nThrough collaboration, two sites conducting independent research developed convergent research methods to enable pooling of data, and by extension increased power, for future analyses.

However, there is limited research on how relatives of patients at risk of suicide experience their opportunities to participate in care during periods when their close ones are subject to inpatient care. The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of participation, as experienced by relatives of persons who are subject to inpatient psychiatric care due to a risk of suicide. The study was conducted through a reflective lifeworld research (RLR) approach, based on phenomenological philosophy. Eight relatives of patients receiving care from professionals in a psychiatric specialist health care context in Sweden participated in phenomenon-oriented interviews. Data were analysed to elucidate a meaning structure of the phenomenon. The findings show that the phenomenon of participation was more associated with patients' recovery processes than with the caring process, and means \"being actively involved in a process in which the person regains the desire to live\". The meaning of participation is further described by its meaning constituents: struggling for being able to be present for the person at risk of suicide, being able to share everyday life, and nurturing sources for vitality. These insights into the meaning of participation highlight the importance of allowing supportive relatives to be a part of the patient's life, while the person is cared for in an inpatient hospital setting. Thus, participation enables relatives to be acknowledged as resourceful human beings in the patient's recovery process, and thereby facilitates a sense of being able to manage and share life itself together with the person. This means that mental health nurses need to recognize individual variations of relatives' participation processes, and take on the responsibility of acknowledging relatives' lifeworlds."}, {"Title": "Intersecting Cultures in Deaf Mental Health: An Ethnographic Study of NHS Professionals Diagnosing Autism in D/deaf Children.", "Abstract": "Autism assessments for children who are deaf are particularly complex for a number of reasons, including overlapping cultural and clinical factors.

Our objective was to analyse how mental health services interact with Deaf culture, as a source of cultural-linguistic identity. We ground the study in the practices and perceptions of 16 professionals, who have conducted autism assessments for deaf children aged 0-18. We adopt a framework of intersectionality to capture the multiple, mutually enforcing factors involved in this diagnostic process. We observed that professionals working in specialist Deaf services, or with experience working with the Deaf community, had intersectional understandings of assessments: the ways in which cultural, linguistic, sensory, and social factors work together to produce diagnoses. Working with a diagnostic system that focuses heavily on 'norms' based on populations from a hearing culture was a key source of frustration for professionals.

Over 6-months, marijuana use decreased (B=-1.20, p<.001), but patterns varied by demographic and clinical characteristics. Depression (B=0.03, p<.001) symptoms contributed to increased marijuana use over the follow-up, and those aged 50+(B=0.44, p<.001) increased their marijuana use compared to the youngest age group. Marijuana use worsened depression (B=1.24, p<.001) and anxiety (B=0.80, p=.025) symptoms; marijuana use led to poorer mental health (B=-2.03, p=.010) functioning. Medical marijuana (26.8%; n=33) was associated with poorer physical health (B=-3.35, p=.044) functioning.\nParticipants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability.\nMarijuana use is common and associated with poor recovery among psychiatry outpatients with depression. Assessing for marijuana use and considering its use in light of its impact on depression recovery may help improve outcomes."}, {"Title": "Post-traumatic stress disorder in internally displaced people of Colombia: An ecological study.", "Abstract": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been described as one of the most frequently reported mental condition among refugees and internally displaced populations (IDPs). Despite this, few has been reported about it in Latin America, even in Colombia, the country with the highest number of IDPs in the in the world.\nThis ecological study assessed incidence and differences of PTSD in general population and IDPs in Colombia and its departments (32) during 2009-2012. Epidemiological data was collected from the National Health Records System (RIPS), retrieving the ICD-10 code F43.1 in both populations. We estimated PTSD incidence rates on both populations (cases/100,000 pop), using reference population of the IDPs (SISDHES and the general population was taken from the (DANE). Incidence rates ratios were calculated comparing both populations.\nIn general population, 6619 cases of PTSD occurred (14.5 cases/100,000 pop, 95%CI 14.0-15.0) while 177 among IDPs (73.8 cases/100,000 pop, 95%CI 63.0-85.0). PTSD was 5.1 times higher among IDPs than in general population. Ranging from 1.6 (Tolima) to 15.8 (Quind\u00edo) (median: 4.4). In departments with higher incidence, also it was in IDPs (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.4899; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).\nThis study evidenced a significantly higher PTSD incidence among IDPs, when compared with general population in the same territories. This has relevant implications for screening, diagnosis and management of PTSD among IDPs, especially in high incidence areas. More studies are required to improve the understanding of this condition among vulnerable populations, as well to provide better medical and psychological interventions and for the development of public policies in countries, such as Colombia, with IDPs."}, {"Title": "Nutritional Psychiatry: Where to Next?", "Abstract": "The nascent field of 'Nutritional Psychiatry' offers much promise for addressing the large disease burden associated with mental disorders. A consistent evidence base from the observational literature confirms that the quality of individuals' diets is related to their risk for common mental disorders, such as depression. This is the case across countries and age groups. Moreover, new intervention studies implementing dietary changes suggest promise for the prevention and treatment of depression. Concurrently, data point to the utility of selected nutraceuticals as adjunctive treatments for mental disorders and as monotherapies for conditions such as ADHD. Finally, new studies focused on understanding the biological pathways that mediate the observed relationships between diet, nutrition and mental health are pointing to the immune system, oxidative biology, brain plasticity and the microbiome-gut-brain axis as key targets for nutritional interventions. On the other hand, the field is currently limited by a lack of data and methodological issues such as heterogeneity, residual confounding, measurement error, and challenges in measuring and ensuring dietary adherence in intervention studies. Key challenges for the field are to now: replicate, refine and scale up promising clinical and population level dietary strategies; identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the identified associations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and 'psychobiotic' interventions that also examine predictors of treatment response; conduct observational and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and related risk factors and treatments; and continue to advocate for policy change to improve the food environment at the population level."}, {"Title": "Possible role of rare variants in Trace amine associated receptor 1 in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic mental illness with behavioral abnormalities. Recent common variant based genome wide association studies and rare variant detection using next generation sequencing approaches have identified numerous variants that confer risk for SZ, but etiology remains unclear propelling continuing investigations. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a rare heterozygous variant (c.545G>T; p.Cys182Phe) in Trace amine associated receptor 1 gene (TAAR1 6q23.2) in three affected members in a small SZ family. The variant predicted to be damaging by 15 prediction tools, causes breakage of a conserved disulfide bond in this G-protein-coupled receptor. On screening this intronless gene for additional variant(s) in ~800 sporadic SZ patients, we identified six rare protein altering variants (MAF<0.001) namely p.Ser47Cys, p.Phe51Leu, p.Tyr294Ter, p.Leu295Ser in four unrelated north Indian cases (n=475); p.Ala109Thr and p.Val250Ala in two independent Caucasian/African-American patients (n=310). Five of these variants were also predicted to be damaging. Besides, a rare synonymous variant was observed in SZ patients. These rare variants were absent in north Indian healthy controls (n=410) but significantly enriched in patients (p=0.036). Conversely, three common coding SNPs (rs8192621, rs8192620 and rs8192619) and a promoter SNP (rs60266355) tested for association with SZ in the north Indian cohort were not significant (P>0.05). TAAR1 is a modulator of monoaminergic pathways and interacts with AKT signaling pathways. Substantial animal model based pharmacological and functional data implying its relevance in SZ are also available. However, this is the first report suggestive of the likely contribution of rare variants in this gene to SZ."}, {"Title": "Is the French criminal psychiatric assessment in crisis?", "Abstract": "The criminal psychiatric assessment in France seems to be facing growing criticism related to disagreements between experts and, on the other hand, a lack of interest of psychiatrists for the assessment. We start by explaining the current framework of the criminal psychiatric assessment in France, which differs from the assessment used in English-speaking countries, where Roman law applies. Then, we will describe the disagreements through a literature review and two clinical vignettes. Finally, we will try to understand the causes of discrepancies between experts and the reasons for a supposed lack of interest of the psychiatrists for the expertise. For this, we conducted a survey among the psychiatric experts. We individually questioned experts on the discrepancies and on their awareness of the expertise. We found that 75% of the experts we surveyed had already faced the divergent opinion of a colleague. In addition, the experts were divided on their conclusions related to the fictional scenario we gave them for an a priori assessment (a person with schizophrenia who was accused of murder), particularly in the specific contexts that we submitted to them. The main cause of disagreement between experts was the various schools of thought that influence the psychiatric experts in the forensic discussion and, therefore, the conclusions of a case. Moreover, the experts believed that the decrease in the number of psychiatric experts could be attributed to the adverse financial situation of the assessment, the considerable workload required, and the extensive responsibility that falls on the expert. Calling on a team of forensic experts to perform assessments seems to be the first solution to this crisis. Furthermore, if the experts were better compensated for the assessments, more people would want to undertake this work."}, {"Title": "Economic Utility: Combinatorial Pharmacogenomics and Medication Cost Savings for Mental Health Care in a Primary Care Setting.", "Abstract": "This study was an analysis based on a previously completed prospective study investigating medication costs of patients with mental illness guided by using the GeneSight proprietary combinatorial pharmacogenomic (PGx) test. The primary objective of this study was to determine potential cost savings of combinatorial PGx testing over the course of 1 year in patients with mental illness treated by primary care providers (PCPs) and psychiatrists who had switched or added a new psychiatric medication after patients failed to respond to monotherapy. The current evaluation details cost savings of treatment decisions congruent and incongruent with the combinatorial PGx test recommendations specific to PCPs and psychiatrists.\nThis study was a subanalysis of a 1-year, prospective trial comparing medication costs of 2168 patients undergoing GeneSight testing. Pharmacy claims were provided by a pharmacy benefits manager, comparing medication costs 6 months before combinatorial PGx testing and followed up for 1 year after the testing. This analysis compared congruence and cost savings per patient based on the type of health care provider administering care.\nUsing data from a large pharmacy benefits manager, we found that PCPs treat the majority of mental health patients receiving psychotropic medication prescriptions, including treatment-resistant patients. PCPs congruent with combinatorial PGx testing provided the most medication cost savings for payers and patients at $3988 per member per year (P < 0.001).\nHealth care providers treating patients with mental illness can significantly reduce medication costs by following the combinatorial PGx report recommendations. PCPs, who treat the majority of patients with mental illness, reported a significant reduction in medication costs for both central nervous system and non-central nervous system drugs."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Presentations of C9orf72 Mutation: What Are the Diagnostic Implications for Clinicians?", "Abstract": "The C9orf72 mutation was identified as the most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In light of multiple reports of predominant psychiatric presentations of FTD secondary to C9orf72 mutation, the American Neuropsychiatric Association Committee on Research reviewed all studies on psychiatric aspects of this mutation to identify clinically relevant features for diagnosis. The most common psychiatric presentation is psychosis (21%-56%), with delusions, and/or multimodal hallucinations.

The focus of this report is to describe the pros and cons of incorporating spousal dyads into depression-prevention research.\nIn an intervention development study, the authors administered problem-solving therapy (PST) dyadically to participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their caregivers. Dyads worked with the same interventionist in the same therapy session. The dyadic PST (highlighted in a case example of a husband with MCI and his wife/support person) and the potential feasibility of the program are described.\nThe authors found that the wife of the individual with MCI could be trained as a PST coach to help her husband learn and use problem-solving skills. A decrease in depressive symptom severity was observed for the individual with MCI, which was sustained over 12 months of follow-up. Neither the husband nor wife experienced an incident episode of major depression over the course of the study.\nDyadic interventions need to be further developed in geriatric psychiatry; proven methods such as PST can be modified to include patients' support persons. Recommendations are offered for developing randomized controlled trials that aim to recruit dyads and prevent depression in at-risk older married couples."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetics of antidepressant drugs: State of the art and clinical implementation - recommendations from the French National Network of Pharmacogenetics.", "Abstract": "Tailoring antidepressant drug therapy to each individual patient is a complex process because these drugs have adverse effects leading to discontinuation.

This study extends the literature by examining the relationship between ASD traits, family accommodation, and functional impairment in a sample of youth with OCD across a wide age range (n\u2009=\u200980; aged 7-17 years). Results indicated that autistic traits, as measured by the social responsiveness scale (SRS), were elevated in 32.5% of youth (based on a T-score of 66T and above) relative to typically developing youth, as well as youth with non-autism-related psychiatric disorders (Constantino and Gruber in Social responsiveness scale, Western Psychogical Services, Torrance, 2012). Furthermore, 27.5% of youth scored within a moderate range (66T-75T) and 5% of youth scored within a severe range (76T or higher) on the SRS, typical of children with ASD (Constantino and Gruber in Social responsiveness scale, Western Psychogical Services, Torrance, 2012). Additionally, ASD traits were associated with greater functional impairment above OCD severity.

As new tools and technologies emerge, clinicians and researchers are confronted with an increasing array of options both for clinical assessment, through digital capture of the essential behavioral elements of a condition, and for intervention, through formalized treatments, coaching, and other technology-assisted means of patient communication. And yet, as with any new set of tools for the assessment or treatment of a medical condition, establishing and adhering to reporting guidelines-that is, what works and under what conditions-is an essential component of the translational research process. Here, using the recently published World Health Organization mHealth Evaluation, Reporting and Assessment guidelines for evaluating mobile health applications, we review the methodological strengths and weaknesses of existing studies on smartphones and wearables for schizophrenia. While growing evidence supports the feasibility of using mobile tools in severe mental illness, most studies to date failed to adequately report accessibility, interoperability, costs, scalability, replicability, data security, usability testing, or compliance with national guidelines or regulatory statutes.

The hypothesis of this study is that insurance-specific requirements will be associated with a decreased progression to surgery and increased delay in time to surgery.\nRetrospective data collection was performed for patients undergoing bariatric surgery evaluation from 2010-2015. Patients who underwent surgery (SGY; n = 827; mean body mass index [BMI] 49.1) were compared with those who did not (no-SGY; n = 648; mean BMI: 49.4). Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify specific co-morbidity and insurance specific predictors of surgical dropout and time to surgery.\nA total of 1475 patients using 12 major insurance payors were included. Univariate analysis found insurance requirements associated with surgical drop out included longer median diet duration (no-SGY = 6 mo; SGY = 3 mo; P<.001); primary care physician letter of necessity (P<.0001); laboratory testing (P = .019); and evaluation by cardiology (P<.001), pulmonology (P<.0001), or psychiatry (P = .0003).

One of the fastest-growing and least-regulated approaches to noninvasive therapeutic stimulation involves the application of weak electrical currents. Widespread enthusiasm for low-intensity transcranial electrical current stimulation (tCS) is reflected by the recent surge in direct-to-consumer device marketing, do-it-yourself enthusiasm, and an escalating number of clinical trials. In the wake of this rapid growth, clinicians may lack sufficient information about tCS to inform their clinical practices. Interpretation of tCS clinical trial data is aided by familiarity with basic neurophysiological principles, potential mechanisms of action of tCS, and the complicated regulatory history governing tCS devices. A growing literature includes randomized controlled trials of tCS for major depression, schizophrenia, cognitive disorders, and substance use disorders. The relative ease of use and abundant access to tCS may represent a broad-reaching and important advance for future mental health care. Evidence supports application of one type of tCS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for major depression. However, tDCS devices do not have regulatory approval for treating medical disorders, evidence is largely inconclusive for other therapeutic areas, and their use is associated with some physical and psychiatric risks. One unexpected finding to arise from this review is that the use of cranial electrotherapy stimulation devices-the only category of tCS devices cleared for use in psychiatric disorders-is supported by low-quality evidence."}, {"Title": "Symptoms of swallowing anxiety in panic disorder patients and associated psychopathologic factors.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate symptoms of swallowing difficulty in Panic Disorder (PD) patients and the factors associated with these symptoms.\nIn the pre-phase of the study, 22 PD patients who were treated in psychiatry outpatient clinics and who were found to have swallowing difficulty were evaluated. PD patients were asked to write about their thoughts, feelings and behaviors associated with swallowing difficulty. Later, these texts were examined and 41 expressions were identified in which patients described their swallowing difficulty. These expressions were evaluated by mental health workers in the field and twelve different swallowing difficulty items were defined.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is the main source of serotonergic innervation of forebrain limbic structures disturbed in suicidal behaviour, in which an abnormal microglia reaction seems to play a role. In our present study, the density of microglia immunostained for the HLA-DR antigen was evaluated in the DRN. These analyses were carried out on paraffin-embedded brains from 24 suicidal and 21 non-suicidal patients; among them, 27 depressed (15 major depressive disorder and 12 bipolar disorder) and 18 schizophrenia (9 residual and 9 paranoid) patients and 22 matched controls without mental disorders. Only the non-suicidal depressed subgroup revealed significantly lower microglial reaction, i.e., a decreased density of HLA-DR positive microglia versus both depressed suicide victims and controls. The effect was not related to antidepressant or antipsychotic medication, as the former correlated positively with microglial density in non-suicidal depressed patients, and the latter had no effect. Moreover, the comparison of these results with previously published data from our workgroup in the same cohort (Krzy\u017canowska et al. in Psychiatry Res 241:43-46, 4) suggested a positive impact of microglia on ribosomal DNA transcription in DRN neurons in the non-suicidal depressed subgroup, but not in depressed suicidal cases. Therefore, the interaction between microglia and neurons in the DRN may be potentially involved in opposite ways regarding suicide facilitation and prevention in the tested subgroups of depressed patients."}, {"Title": "Knowledge of childhood: materiality, text, and the history of science - an interdisciplinary round table discussion.", "Abstract": "This round table discussion takes the diversity of discourse and practice shaping modern knowledge about childhood as an opportunity to engage with recent historiographical approaches in the history of science.

Their replication validity was assessed using a comparison with their corresponding meta-analyses.\nAmong the 5029 articles of our database, 156 primary studies (of which 63 were lifestyle studies) and 5 meta-analysis articles were reported in 1561 newspaper articles. The percentage of covered studies and the number of newspaper articles per study strongly increased with the impact factor of the journal that published each scientific study. Newspapers almost equally covered initial (5/39 12.8%) and subsequent (58/600 9.7%) lifestyle studies. In contrast, initial non-lifestyle studies were covered more often (48/366 13.1%) than subsequent ones (45/3718 1.2%). Newspapers never covered initial studies reporting null findings and rarely reported subsequent null observations. Only 48.7% of the 156 studies reported by newspapers were confirmed by the corresponding meta-analyses. Initial non-lifestyle studies were less often confirmed (16/48) than subsequent ones (29/45) and than lifestyle studies (31/63). Psychiatric studies covered by newspapers were less often confirmed (10/38) than the neurological (26/41) or somatic (40/77) ones. This is correlated to an even larger coverage of initial studies in psychiatry. Whereas 234 newspaper articles covered the 35 initial studies that were later disconfirmed, only four press articles covered a subsequent null finding and mentioned the refutation of an initial claim.\nJournalists preferentially cover initial findings although they are often contradicted by meta-analyses and rarely inform the public when they are disconfirmed."}, {"Title": "Parent-child learning interactions: A review of the literature on scaffolding.", "Abstract": "Scaffolding can be observed during learning-based interactions, when interventions by parents are adjusted according to children's observed abilities, with the main goal of enabling the child to work independently (Wood et\u00a0al., 1976, Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, 17, 89). Such contingent instruction behaviours occur from infancy, and are said to be relevant for children's development of executive function, language acquisition, and cognitive and academic abilities. Scaffolding behaviours are considered a product of the family and the wider context, a process affected by parent and child characteristics, and the environment they inhabit. Over 40\u00a0years of scaffolding research has produced an abundance of findings. Early investigations were concerned with the conceptualization of scaffolding, whereas more recent studies build upon the theory, testing its correlates and relevance for child development.\nThis article offers an overview of the literature, focusing on the relevance of scaffolding for child developmental outcomes, and the factors associated with individual differences in the process.\nThe article is structured such that the origins of the theory and its definitions are discussed first, followed by an overview of the correlates of scaffolding.

In these patients, removal of autoantibodies treats the disease and outcomes are closely linked to early intervention. The discovery of these autoantibodies in isolated psychiatric syndromes has raised the possibility that these patients may derive similar benefits from immunotherapy, a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of mental illness. Although open-label case series suggest impressive therapeutic outcomes, the pathological relevance of these autoantibodies outside of canonical presentations is debated. The advent of diagnostic criteria for AE attempts to facilitate its prompt identification but risks prematurely neglecting the potential scientific and clinical significance of isolated syndromes that do not satisfy these criteria. Here, we propose using a syndrome-level taxonomy that has occasional, but not necessary, overlap with AE: synaptic and neuronal autoantibody-associated psychiatric syndromes or \"SNAps\". This will prevent confusion with AE and act heuristically to promote active investigation into this rare example of psychopathology defined on a molecular level. We suggest that this concept would have application in other autoantibody-associated syndromes including seizure, cognitive, and movement disorders, in which similar issues arise. We review putative direct and indirect mechanisms and outline experimentally testable hypotheses that would help to determine prospectively in whom autoantibody detection is relevant, and as important, in whom it is not. We summarize a pragmatic approach to autoantibody testing and management in severe mental illness in order to promptly diagnose AE and advocate a research-orientated experimental medicine paradigm for SNAps, where there is greater equipoise. We conclude that SNAps remains a nascent area of clinical neuroscience with great potential and in ongoing need of psychiatry-led basic and clinical research."}, {"Title": "Parallel contagion phenomenon of concordant mental disorders among married couples: a nationwide cohort study.", "Abstract": "The aggregation of mental disorders in couples, as reported by prior research, indicates the effect of familial environments and warrants attention. However, the concordant categories of mental disorders in couples remain unclear. This study investigated spousal concordance for the category of mental disorders among couples throughout Taiwan by using factors associated with such disorders.\n5643 couples in the 2002-2013 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were analysed and compared with propensity-matched 5643 non-couples. Twelve independent variables, including spouse and shared characteristics, and the category of mental disorders were analysed, mainly by using multinomial logistic regression.\nThe determined prevalence rates for concordant categories of mental disorder were 0.19% for affective disorders, 6.96% for anxiety disorders, and 3.15% of other mental disorders. Multinomial logistic regression results revealed that two spouses were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same category of the aforementioned mental disorders (ORs=2.914, 1.776 and 1.727, respectively). Other associated factors included gender, age, occupation, comorbidity and region. The odds of concordances were significantly higher in couples than in non-couples.\nA category of mental disorder in one spouse is a determinant of that in the other spouse. This study extended the emotional contagion theory to the phenomenon of parallel contagion to reflect the three concordances, suggesting a direction of family-based mental health intervention, particularly prevention for the same category of mental disorders in couples. Policymakers should strengthen the coping strategies of the caring spouse and external support system to psychiatrically vulnerable families."}, {"Title": "Complexity Variability Assessment of Nonlinear Time-Varying Cardiovascular Control.", "Abstract": "The application of complex systems theory to physiology and medicine has provided meaningful information about the nonlinear aspects underlying the dynamics of a wide range of biological processes and their disease-related aberrations. However, no studies have investigated whether meaningful information can be extracted by quantifying second-order moments of time-varying cardiovascular complexity. To this extent, we introduce a novel mathematical framework termed complexity variability, in which the variance of instantaneous Lyapunov spectra estimated over time serves as a reference quantifier. We apply the proposed methodology to four exemplary studies involving disorders which stem from cardiology, neurology and psychiatry: Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Major Depression Disorder (MDD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) patients with insomnia under a yoga training regime. We show that complexity assessments derived from simple time-averaging are not able to discern pathology-related changes in autonomic control, and we demonstrate that between-group differences in measures of complexity variability are consistent across pathologies. Pathological states such as CHF, MDD, and PD are associated with an increased complexity variability when compared to healthy controls, whereas wellbeing derived from yoga in PTSD is associated with lower time-variance of complexity."}, {"Title": "Pattern of inpatient referrals to dermatology at a tertiary care centre of South Rajasthan.", "Abstract": "Dermatologists besides providing service to patients in the outdoors, also play a vital role in the care of inpatients admitted to dermatology unit and other departments.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of referrals sent to the dermatology department by other departments.\nThe study included all inpatients referred to dermatology department of a tertiary care centre of South Rajasthan during a 5-year period from October 2008 to September 2013.\nA total of 1560 consultations with 1603 diagnoses were recorded.

In addition, the survey also evaluated the current level of practice of psychiatry in terms of availability of different investigation facilities, prescription patterns in terms of use of polypharmacy, and competence in carrying out certain nonpharmacological treatments.\nAn online survey was received by 3475 psychiatrist, of whom 608 (17.5%) participants completed the survey.\nAlmost all (93.8%) of the psychiatrists agreed that there should be separate CPGs for Indian setting. In terms of problems with the previous version of the CPGs, this survey shows that the previous version of guidelines was used in making clinical decisions by only one-third (31.25%) of the participating psychiatrists. The major limitations of the previous version of CPGs which were pointed out included the lack of consideration of socio-cultural issues (33.2%), lack of recommendations for many clinical situations that are encountered in clinical practice (43.15) and poor dissemination (35.2%). In terms of expectations, the membership expects the society to come up with guidelines, which are shorter in length (82.2%), has significant proportion of information in the form of tables and flow diagrams (58.7%), besides the evidence base must also take expert opinions into account (84.7%), must be circulated before adopting (88.7%), must be disseminated by displaying the same on the website (72%), and also by sending the same by E-mails (62%). Further, the membership expects the IPS to design online continuing medical education program on CPGs (54.3%). The survey also suggests that it is feasible on the part of more than two-third of the psychiatrists to monitor the metabolic parameters in routine clinical practice and carryout various nonpharmacological treatments. Majority of the psychiatrist opined that polypharmacy is not used in more than 25% of patients with schizophrenia and depression and hence the use of polypharmacy should be recommended judiciously.\nThis survey shows that the membership of the IPS is interested in having own guidelines for the management of various psychiatric disorders in Indian setting.

After a surge in programs and fellows, the numbers appear to have stabilized at about 57 programs and 60-65 trainees per year with fewer than half of the positions filled each year. The majority of graduates seeks and obtains ABPN certification, and the majority of those who were fellowship trained have maintained certification. Despite the unprecedented demand for mental health services for older adults, it must be acknowledged that not enough geriatric psychiatrists can be prepared to meet the needs of an aging U.S.\nStrategies for addressing the shortage are discussed, including undertaking subspecialty training in the fourth year of psychiatry training, increasing the time devoted to the care of older adults in undergraduate and graduate medical education, and developing alternative training pathways such as mini-fellowships.

Cross-cultural comparisons are especially important for ASD, since cultural differences may impact the perception of symptoms. Identifying behaviors that are similarly reported as problematic across cultures as well as identifying behaviors in which there is cultural variation could aid in the development and refinement of more universally effective measures.

Demographic and clinical information was obtained from all patients at baseline. Experts in various fields, including anesthesia, orthopedic surgery, psychiatry, physical therapy, and nursing, were involved in the treatment procedures. All patients were assessed before and after a 6-month treatment period using the following measures: the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); the Pain Disability Assessment Scale (PDAS); and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). All participants were then divided into two groups based on their self-reported pain after treatment: a pain relief group (n\u00a0=\u00a070) and a prolonged pain group (n\u00a0=\u00a024). The exacerbating factors of prolonged pain after treatment in the pain liaison outpatient clinic were analyzed using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis.\nA significant improvement in NRS scores was observed after the 6-month follow-up period. After treatment, 24 (25.5%) of the 94 patients reported having prolonged pain. Significant improvements were seen in the PCS, PDAS, and ODI scores in the pain relief group, and in the HADS depression scores in the prolonged pain group. On univariate and multiple regression analysis, HADS depression scores were identified as a factor related to prolonged pain after treatment.\nThe results of the present study suggest that severe depression at the initial visit to the liaison outpatient clinic was an exacerbating factor for prolonged pain after treatment."}, {"Title": "Psychosis in the ED: A case of NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis.", "Abstract": "Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate antibody receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a newly recognized disease increasing in diagnostic frequency.

This study analyzed DSM-IV-referenced ASD symptom statements from parent and teacher versions of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R. A series of exploratory structural equation\u00a0models was conducted in order to produce interpretable latent factors that account for multivariate covariance.\nResults indicated that ASD symptoms were structured into an interpretable hierarchy across multiple informants. This hierarchy includes five levels; key features of ASD bifurcate into different constructs with increasing specificity.\nThis is the first study to examine an underlying structural hierarchy of ASD symptomatology using the bass-ackwards method. This hierarchy demonstrates how core features of ASD relate at differing levels of resolution, providing a model for conceptualizing ASD heterogeneity and a structure for integrating divergent theories of cognitive processes and behavioral features that define the disorder.

Didactic and clinical training focused on these sex-specific influences should be a vital component of the education of future psychiatrists. The authors sought to determine the current state of and attitudes toward reproductive psychiatry in resident education.\nThe authors administered a web-based survey to psychiatry residency training directors. They assessed the availability of both mandated and optional didactic and clinical training experiences in reproductive psychiatry.\nFifty residency program directors answered the survey, for a response rate of 28%. More than half of residency program directors (59%) reported requiring some training in reproductive psychiatry. Both the breadth and depth of topics covered varied greatly among programs. Lack of time (48%) and lack of qualified faculty (26%) were the most frequently cited barriers to more training. Only 40% of residency directors surveyed agreed that all residents should be competent in reproductive psychiatry.\nThese findings suggest that specific training in reproductive psychiatry is inconsistent in US residency programs, and that training that does exist varies considerably in clinical time and content. Given that women comprise more than 50% of all psychiatric patients and most women will menstruate, give birth, and undergo menopause, future psychiatrists would benefit from more systematic instruction in this area. The authors propose the development of a national, standardized reproductive psychiatry curriculum to address this gap and aid in producing psychiatrists competent to treat women at all stages of life."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacology Prescribing Workshops: A Novel Method for Teaching Psychiatry Residents How to Talk to Patients About Medications.", "Abstract": "Traditional, lecture-based methods of teaching pharmacology may not translate into the skills needed to communicate effectively with patients about medications. In response, the authors developed an interactive course for third-year psychiatry residents to reinforce prescribing skills.\nResidents participate in a facilitated group discussion combined with a role-play exercise where they mock-prescribe medication to their peers. Each session is focused on one medication or class of medications with an emphasis on various aspects of informed consent (such as describing the indication, dosing, expected benefits, potential side effects, and necessary work-up and follow up). In the process of implementing the course at a second site, the original format was modified to include self-assessment measures and video examples of experienced faculty members prescribing to a simulated patient.\nThe course was initially developed at one site and has since been disseminated to a number of other institutions. Between 2010 and 2016, 144 residents participated in the course at the authors' two institutions. Based upon pre/post surveys conducted with a subset of residents, the course significantly improved comfort with various aspects of prescribing. Although residents may also gain comfort in prescribing with experience (as the course coincides with the major outpatient clinical training year), improvement in comfort-level was also noted for medications that residents had relatively little experience initiating. At the end of the year, half of the residents indicated the course was one of their top three preferred methods for learning psychopharmacology in addition to direct clinical experience and supervision (with none listing didactics).\nAn interactive prescribing workshop can improve resident comfort with prescribing and may be preferred over a traditional, lecture-based approach. The course may be particularly helpful for those medications that are less commonly used. Based upon our experience, this approach can be easily implemented across institutions.."}, {"Title": "Student-Run Clinics: A Novel Approach to Integrated Care, Teaching and Recruitment.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the educational impact of incorporating a psychiatry consult service into a medical student-run clinic.

In the 1960s, psychiatric researchers including Uhlenhuth, Rickels and Covi focused on this area, but this research topic needs to be revived in the 21st century. The Health Belief Model may hold potential for doing this. This model was initially developed by 2 health psychologists, Rosenstock and Becker, to explain why patients did not follow medical interventions. The application of this model to study medication adherence in psychiatric outpatients has provided multiple findings including the conclusions that adherence is associated with: (1) the balance between internal and external health control beliefs, (2) psychological reactance, (3) patients' attitudes toward prescribed drug treatment in general and (4) the balance between the necessity of taking medications versus the concerns derived from adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Poor adherence is associated with several cognitive styles of patients, including: (1) high internal and external health control beliefs (patients who feel that their health is controlled both by external factors and their own beliefs), (2) higher psychological reactance, (3) pharmacophobia (present in 1/6 patients) and (4) skepticism about medications (a high concern for ADRs and a low belief in the necessity of taking medications). All of these findings suggest that shared decision-making is particularly important in fostering adherence in psychiatric patients.

Oral administration of NSI-189 in adult Sprague-Dawley rats starting at 6\u2009hr after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and daily thereafter over the next 12 weeks resulted in significant amelioration of stroke-induced motor and neurological deficits, which was maintained up to 24 weeks post-stroke. Histopathological assessment of stroke brains from NSI-189-treated animals revealed significant increments in neurite outgrowth as evidenced by MAP2 immunoreactivity that was prominently detected in the hippocampus and partially in the cortex. These results suggest NSI-189 actively stimulated remodeling of the stroke brain. Parallel in vitro studies further probed this remodeling process and demonstrated that oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) initiated typical cell death processes, which were reversed by NSI-189 treatment characterized by significant attenuation of OGD/R-mediated hippocampal cell death and increased Ki67 and MAP2 expression, coupled with upregulation of neurogenic factors such as BDNF and SCF.

Old people with dementia were admitted to lunatic asylums, workhouses and charitable homes, but were not welcome there.

They were too weak and unresponsive to adhere to the norms of the asylum regime, yet too challenging in their behaviour to conform to that of the workhouse, or the charitable home.

However, it can be challenging to discern what makes beliefs delusional compared with other unusual or erroneous beliefs. We suggest mapping the putative biology to clinical phenomenology with a cognitive psychology of belief, culminating in a teleological approach to beliefs and brain function supported by animal and computational models. We argue that organisms strive to minimize uncertainty about their future states by forming and maintaining a set of beliefs (about the organism and the world) that are robust, but flexible. If uncertainty is generated endogenously, beliefs begin to depart from consensual reality and can manifest into delusions. Central to this scheme is the notion that formal associative learning theory can provide an explanation for the development and persistence of delusions. Beliefs, in animals and humans, may be associations between representations (e.g., of cause and effect) that are formed by minimizing uncertainty via new learning and attentional allocation. Animal research has equipped us with a deep mechanistic basis of these processes, which is now being applied to delusions. This work offers the exciting possibility of completing revolutions of translation, from the bedside to the bench and back again. The more we learn about animal beliefs, the more we may be able to apply to human beliefs and their aberrations, enabling a deeper mechanistic understanding."}, {"Title": "Does accreditation improve pro re nata benzodiazepines administration in psychiatric inpatients?

Patients were not contacted.\nThere was a statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.002) reduction of approximately 22% in the number of administered PRN benzodiazepines. Post-accreditation, the average number of PRN benzodiazepines administrations per patient, was 4.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 compared to 6.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 pre-accreditation. There was no significant difference between the two genders. The highest average quantity of PRN benzodiazepines administered was during the time interval of 18-24\u00a0h.\nAccreditation may have a positive impact on the process of administering PRN benzodiazepine medications in psychiatric inpatients."}, {"Title": "HLA DRB1*03 as a possible common etiology of schizophrenia, Graves' disease, and type 2 diabetes.", "Abstract": "Autoimmune diseases and schizophrenia share many common features. Association studies confirm a shared genetic association in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region between schizophrenia and most autoimmune diseases. To our knowledge, the simultaneous syndromes of Graves' disease (GD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in schizophrenia are rare in Tunisia.\nWe report a case of a 42-year-old woman admitted to the department of psychiatry for an acute relapse of chronic schizophrenia. Her medical history revealed that she was followed for Graves' disease and for a type 2 diabetes mellitus. A low-resolution HLA typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) techniques according to determine the patient's haplotype.\nOur study suggests that the HLA DRB1*03 allele may explain a common etiology underlying the co-morbidity of Graves' disease, type 2 diabetes, and schizophrenia in our patient."}, {"Title": "Preventing involuntary admissions: special needs for distinct patient groups.", "Abstract": "Coercive measures in psychiatry are a controversial topic and raise ethical, legal and clinical issues. Involuntary admission of patients is a long-lasting problem and indicates a problematic pathway to care situations within the community, largely because personal freedom is fundamentally covered by the UN declaration of human rights and the German constitution.\nIn this study, a survey on a large and comprehensive population of psychiatric in-patients in the eastern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, was carried out for the years 2004-2009, including 230.678 treatment cases. The data were collected from the dataset transferred to health insurance automatically, which, since 2004 is available in an electronic form. In addition, a wide variety of information on treatment, sociodemographic and illness-related factors were collected and analysed. Data were collected retrospectively and analyses were calculated using statistical software (IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0<sup>\u00ae</sup>). Quantitative data are presented as mean and standard deviation. Due to the unequal group sizes, group differences were calculated by means of Chi-square tests or independent sample <i>t</i> tests. A Bonferroni correction was applied to control for multiple comparisons.\nWe found an over-representation of involuntary admissions in young men (<21\u00a0years) suffering from schizophrenia and in female patients aged over 60 with a diagnosis of dementia. Most of our results are concordant with the previous literature. Also admission in hours out of regular out-patient services elevated the risk.\nThe main conclusion from these findings is a need for a fortification of ambulatory treatment offers, e.g. sociopsychiatric services or ward round at home for early diagnosis and intervention. Further prospective studyies are needed."}, {"Title": "The needs of older people with mental health problems in a Portuguese psychiatric setting.", "Abstract": "This study aims to identify met and unmet needs, according to the patient, the carer and the staff, and their relationship with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics in elderly people with mental health problems.\nA sample of 306 elderly patients \u226565 years, of both sexes, diagnosed with mental illness (ICD-10 criteria), was recruited from inpatient/outpatient settings in a Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, in northern Portugal. Patients were assessed with the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly/CANE.\nThe majority of diagnoses were depression (33.7%), dementia (24.5%), and schizophrenia (12.7%). The patients' main unmet needs found were psychological distress (15.0%), daytime activities (10.5%), and benefits (6.5%). Patients reported significantly lower unmet and global needs than carers and staff (Z = -8.58, p < 0.001; Z = -11.07, p < 0.001, respectively). A larger number of global needs (met and unmet) were associated with the diagnosis of dementia, followed by schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorder (p < 0.001), with inpatients reporting more needs than outpatients.\nMental disorders were associated with a greater number of needs in elderly patients, which makes this assessment important as it includes the patients' perspective, when they are the focus of intervention, in order to decrease distress and make more beneficial use of services, especially in inpatient settings. These different perspectives are crucial when assessing and planning psychiatric and mental health services."}, {"Title": "Erratum: Resting-state connectivity biomarkers define neurophysiological subtypes of depression.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry, partly because there is a weak correspondence between diagnostic labels and their neurobiological substrates. Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes (\u2018biotypes\u2019) defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82\u201393%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies."}, {"Title": "Integrated collaborative care teams to enhance service delivery to youth with mental health and substance use challenges: protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Among youth, the prevalence of mental health and addiction (MHA) disorders is roughly 20%, yet youth are challenged to access evidence-based services in a timely fashion. To address MHA system gaps, this study tests the benefits of an Integrated Collaborative Care Team (ICCT) model for youth with MHA challenges. A rapid, stepped-care approach geared to need in a youth-friendly environment is expected to result in better youth MHA outcomes. Moreover, the ICCT approach is expected to decrease service wait-times, be more youth-friendly and family-friendly, and be more cost-effective, providing substantial public health benefits.\nIn partnership with four community agencies, four adolescent psychiatry hospital departments, youth and family members with lived experience of MHA service use, and other stakeholders, we have developed an innovative model of collaborative, community-based service provision involving rapid access to needs-based MHA services. A total of 500 youth presenting for hospital-based, outpatient psychiatric service will be randomised to ICCT services or hospital-based treatment as usual, following a pragmatic randomised controlled trial design. The primary outcome variable will be the youth's functioning, assessed at intake, 6\u2005months and 12\u2005months. Secondary outcomes will include clinical change, youth/family satisfaction and perception of care, empowerment, engagement and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

We sought to validate a tool to stratify such risk based on readily available clinical data, including projected medication adverse effects, using state-wide medical claims data.\nSociodemographic and clinical features were drawn from health claims paid in the state of Massachusetts for individuals aged 35-65 with a hospital admission for a period spanning January-December 2012. Previously developed logistic regression models of hospital readmission for fall-related injury were refit in a testing set including a randomly selected 70% of individuals, and examined in a training set comprised of the remaining 30%. Medications at admission were summarised based on reported adverse effect frequencies in published medication labelling.\nThe Massachusetts health system.\nA total of 68\u2005764 hospitalised individuals aged 35-65\u2005years.\nHospital readmission for fall-related injury defined by claims code.\nA total of 2052 individuals (3.0%) were hospitalised for fall-related injury within 90\u2005days of discharge, and 3391 (4.9%) within 180\u2005days. After recalibrating the model in a training data set comprised of 48\u2005136 individuals (70%), model discrimination in the remaining 30% test set yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76). AUCs were similar across age decades (0.71 to 0.78) and sex (0.72 male, 0.76 female), and across most common diagnostic categories other than psychiatry. For individuals in the highest risk quartile, 11.4% experienced fall within 180\u2005days versus 1.2% in the lowest risk quartile; 57.6% of falls occurred in the highest risk quartile.\nThis analysis of state-wide claims data demonstrates the feasibility of predicting fall-related injury requiring hospitalisation using readily available sociodemographic and clinical details.

Here, we used a new genetic rat model with a loss-of-function point mutation in the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene (<i>Slc6a3</i>_N157K) to systematically study the RDoC matrix. First, we examined the impact of the <i>Slc6a3</i>_N157K mutation on monoaminergic signaling. We then performed behavioral tests representing each of the five RDoC domains: negative and positive valence systems, cognitive, social and arousal/regulatory systems. The use of RDoC may be particularly helpful for drug development. We studied the effects of a novel pharmacological approach metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2/3 antagonism, in DAT mutants in a comparative way with standard medications. Loss of DAT functionality in mutant rats not only elevated subcortical extracellular dopamine concentration but also altered the balance of monoaminergic transmission. DAT mutant rats showed deficits in all five RDoC domains. Thus, mutant rats failed to show conditioned fear responses, were anhedonic, were unable to learn stimulus-reward associations, showed impaired cognition and social behavior, and were hyperactive. Hyperactivity in mutant rats was reduced by amphetamine and atomoxetine, which are well-established medications to reduce hyperactivity in humans. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 also normalized hyperactivity in DAT mutant rats without affecting extracellular dopamine levels. We systematically characterized an altered dopamine system within the context of the RDoC matrix and studied mGluR2/3 antagonism as a new pharmacological strategy to treat mental disorders with underlying subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity."}, {"Title": "The benefits, risks and costs of privacy: patient preferences and willingness to pay.", "Abstract": "Multiple surveys show that patients want medical privacy; however, there are costs to maintaining privacy. There are also risks if information is not shared. A review of previous surveys found that most surveys asked questions about patient's privacy concerns and willingness to share their medical information. We found only one study that asked about sharing medical information for better care and no survey that asked patients about the risk, cost or comparison between medical privacy and privacy in other areas. To fill this gap, we designed a survey to: (1) compare medical privacy preferences to privacy preferences in other areas; (2) measure willingness to pay the cost of additional privacy measures; and (3) measure willingness to accept the risks of not sharing information.\nA total of 834 patients attending physician offices at 14 sites completed all or part of an anonymous questionnaire.\nOver 95% of patients were willing to share all their medical information with their treating physicians. There was no difference in willingness to share between primary care and specialty sites including psychiatry and an HIV clinic. In our survey, there was no difference in sharing preference between standard medical information and information with additional legal protections including genetic testing, drug/alcohol treatment and HIV results. Medical privacy was ranked lower than sharing social security and credit card numbers, but was deemed more private than other information including tax returns and handgun purchases. There was no statistical difference for any questions by site except for HIV/AIDS clinic patients ranking privacy of the medical record more important than reducing high medical costs and risk of medical errors (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Most patients were willing to spend a modest amount of additional time for privacy, but few were willing to pay more for additional medical privacy. Most patients were unwilling to take on additional risks to keep medical information hidden.\nPatients were very willing to share medical information with their providers. They were able to see the importance of sharing medical information to provide the best possible care. They were unwilling to hide information from providers if there was increased medical risk.

The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which off-label AP prescribing in a veteran population was potentially appropriate.\nExpert panel and retrospective analysis.\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse.\nA total of 69,823 veterans who had at least one pharmacy record for an AP medication during fiscal years 2005-2012.\nAn expert panel was convened to determine if agreement exists on the appropriateness of AP use in various scenarios. The panel consisted of 10 experts in the field of psychiatry: nine physicians with various specialties, and one pharmacist. We used a modified RAND appropriateness method approach to identify potentially appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate cases of AP use. The use of six second-generation APs was examined individually, and the use of first-generation APs was examined as a class. Based on data previously collected quantifying VHA AP use, the panel was given disease state scenarios for the most commonly occurring off-label diagnoses for AP prescriptions. Disease states were coupled with scenario modifiers that the expert panel considered potentially significant clinical factors. Among the four disease states-anxiety, dementia, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder-29 scenarios were investigated for each AP. None of the scenarios were judged by the expert panel to be appropriate for the use of APs. Of the 203 scenarios for all APs, 60% were judged to be inappropriate by the expert panel, and the remaining 40% were considered uncertain. Of the AP medications, risperidone (72%) and olanzapine (62%) were the most likely to be seen as uncertain, whereas first-generation APs (86%) were the most likely to be considered inappropriate in a given scenario. Widespread off-label use of APs outside of the approved indications of treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, or adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, may not be an appropriate treatment option. According to this expert panel, no examined situations were considered appropriate for the use of APs.\nThe consensus of our expert panel was that off-label AP use is uncertain at best and more likely, even in complicated cases, inappropriate. These findings strengthen the case for stronger control of APs in integrated health care settings such as the VHA, as well as better education and information for practitioners who provide care for patients with anxiety, dementia, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder."}, {"Title": "The cost of topical immunomodulator therapy in Medicare patients varies by prescriber specialty.", "Abstract": "Topical immunomodulators (TI)-including corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin D analogues-are commonly prescribed in multiple specialties, but cost comparisons are lacking.\nTo evaluate differences in costs of TI across specialties and determine associated variables.\nA cross-sectional study was performed using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2008 and 2010 Prescription Drug Public Use Profiles, which contain 100% of drug claims made by Medicare beneficiaries.\nBranded drugs cost an average of $174.02 more than generics per 30-day supply (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

Methods \u2022 The research team performed a prospective case study. Setting \u2022 The study took place at the National Center for Whole Psychiatry in Chevy Chase, MD, USA.\nParticipants were patients who had experienced baseline persistent musculoskeletal pain for at least 4 mo in \u22651 body parts without relief from traditional treatments. Intervention \u2022 Participants were provided with a 14-d supply of the study's medication. Two 350-mg capsules were administered 2 \u00d7/d with food. The participants were instructed not to alter or add any therapies for their pain-associated condition for the 14 d of the study. Outcome Measures \u2022 The primary outcome measure was the change on a subjectively scored visual analogue scale (VAS), similar to the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The VAS was used to assess pain and the impact of motion and mobility at each location with pain. Each patient was administered the VAS rating scale to assess physical function and pain status at baseline and at the end of 14 d or postintervention.

Results \u2022 A total of 13 patients, involving 27 pain sites, qualified for the study, 5 males and 8 females with a median age of 58 y. The primary sites of pain were (1) the knees-5 sites (18.5%), (2) the shoulders-6 sites (16.6%), and (3) the back (sciatica)-5 sites (18.5%), with 11 miscellaneous locations (40.7%) making up the rest of the sites, including the neck, jaw, foot, heel, and coccyx. The mean disease duration was 5.61 y, with a range of 4 mo to 20 y. The average VAS pain subscale score was 58.04 at baseline and 23.33 at follow-up. The mean difference between the 2 scores was 34.71 (confidence interval [CI], 26.16-47.01). A significant reduction in the pain scores had occurred by the follow-up assessment (t = 7.23, P < .05). The average VAS subscale score for functional mobility was 56.67 at baseline and 28.70 at follow-up. The mean difference between the 2 mobility scores was 27.97 (CI, 17.86-38.88).

Specializations emphasizing biological determinants of mental disorders, like psychiatry, might favor pharmacotherapy, while others stressing psychosocial factors, like psychology, could promote psychotherapy. Yet financial conflict of interest (COI) could be a confounding factor as authors with a medical specialization might receive more sponsoring from the pharmaceutical industry.\nWe conducted a meta-analysis with subgroup and meta-regression analysis examining whether the specialization and affiliation of trial authors were associated to outcomes in the direct comparison of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the acute treatment of depression. Meta-regression analysis also included trial risk of bias and author conflict of interest in relationship to the pharmaceutical industry.\nWe included 45 trials. In half, the first author was psychologist. The last author was psychiatrist/MD in half of the trials, and a psychologist or statistician/other technical in the rest. Most lead authors had medical affiliations. Subgroup analysis indicated that studies with last authors statisticians favored pharmacotherapy. Univariate analysis showed a negative relationship between the presence of statisticians and outcomes favoring psychotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that trials including authors with financial COI reported findings more favorable to pharmacotherapy.\nWe report the first detailed overview of the background of authors conducting head to head trials for depression. Trials co-authored by statisticians appear to subtly favor pharmacotherapy. Receiving funding from the industry is more closely related to finding better outcomes for the industry's elective treatment than are factors related to authors' background.\nFor a minority of authors we could not retrieve background information.

Further, there were large effect sizes shown for CaPE versus TAU for medication adherence (MMAS-4: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.81), knowledge and attitudes towards bipolar (BKAQ: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.68), mania (YMRS: ES\u00a0=\u00a01.18), depression (BDI: ES\u00a0=\u00a01.17) and quality of life measures (EQ-5D: ES \u21d2 0.88).\nCulturally adapted psychoeducation intervention is acceptable and feasible, and can be effective in improving mood symptoms and knowledge and attitudes to BPAD when compared with TAU. Larger scale studies are needed to confirm our findings.\nClinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02210390."}, {"Title": "[Differences in access to Internet and Internet-based information seeking according to the type of psychiatric disorder].", "Abstract": "Internet has become a major tool for patients to search for health-related information and to communicate on health. We currently lack data on how patients with psychiatric disorders access and use Internet to search for information on their mental health. This study aimed to assess, in patients followed for a psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, mood and anxiety disorder, substance-related and addictive disorders and eating disorders), prevalence of Internet access and use, and patient expectations and needs regarding the use of Internet to search for mental-health information depending on the psychiatric disorder.\nWe conducted this cross-sectional study between May\u00a02013\u00a0and July\u00a02013\u00a0in 648\u00a0patients receiving psychiatric care in 8\u00a0hospitals from the Region Centre, France. We used multivariate logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, socio-educational level and professional status to compare use, expectations and needs regarding Internet-based information about the patient's psychiatric disorder (65-items self-administered questionnaires) as a function of the psychiatric disorders. We identified patients clusters with multiple correspondence analysis and ascending hierarchical classification.\nAlthough 65.6% of our population accessed Internet at home, prevalence for Internet access varied depending on the type of psychiatric disorder and was much more related to limited access to a computer and low income than to a lack of interest in the Internet. Most of the patients who used Internet were interested in having access to reliable Internet-based information on their health (76.8%), and most used Internet to search for Internet based health-information about their psychiatric disorder (58.8%). We found important differences in terms of expectations and needs depending on the patient's psychiatric disorder (e.g., higher interest in Internet-based information among patients with bipolar disorder, substance-related and addictive disorders and eating disorders). We identified three clusters: younger patients with depressive or anxiety disorders and higher Internet access and Internet use; older patients with low socio-economical status and low Internet access and Internet use; patients receiving long-term care for schizophrenia, with low Internet access and Internet use.\nPatients with psychiatric disorders reported average use, needs and expectations for Internet-based health information comparable to the overall population. However, Internet use, needs and expectations for Internet-based mental health information differed between patients depending on their psychiatric disorder. Internet-based information and communication for mental health should be designed specifically for each psychiatric disorder."}, {"Title": "The EPA guidance on suicide treatment and prevention needs to be adjusted to fight the epidemics of suicide at the North Pole area and other autochthonous communities.", "Abstract": "More and more, youth suicide in the Inuit community is gaining importance, with a frequency in Greenland rising from 14.4 (1960-64) to 110.4 per 100,000 person-years (2010-11).

The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.\nThe analysis resulted in three themes describing the process of handling negative thoughts and emotions by using self-injury or aggression towards others and thereby experiencing satisfaction. Both self-injury and aggression were experienced as strategies for emotional regulation. The forensic psychiatric care was perceived as important for the women in developing less harmful strategies for coping with negative thoughts and emotions instead of injuring themselves or others.\nSelf-injury and aggression are often risk-assessed separately, but results from the present study suggest that these behaviours need a more holistic approach."}, {"Title": "Regaining ownership and restoring belongingness: impact of family group conferences in coercive psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This study examined the impact of family group conferences on coercive treatment in adult psychiatry.\nCoercive treatment in psychiatry infringes the fundamental rights of clients, including the right to control their lives. A promising intervention is the family group conferences, which has the potential to prevent crises through the integration of the expertise of informal and professional networks.\nA responsive evaluation, including qualitative and quantitative methods, was deployed to study the process leading up to the FGC, the proceedings and the impact of the conference.\nFrom 2013-2015, 41 family group conferences were studied in three regions in the Netherlands. The impact of every conference was examined with scales (ranging from 0-10) during interviews with attendees (clients, family members, friends, mental health professionals and family group conferences coordinators) who reflected on three outcome measures: belongingness, ownership and coercion.\nAfter the family group conferences, respondents indicated a slight reduction in their experience of coercive treatment. They also mentioned an increase in ownership and belongingness.\nFamily group conferences seems a promising intervention to reduce coercion in psychiatry. It helps to regain ownership and restores belongingness. If mental health professionals take a more active role in the pursuit of a family group conferences and reinforce the plans with their expertise, they can strengthen the impact even further."}, {"Title": "Effect of Reverse Triage on Creation of Surge Capacity in a Pediatric Hospital.", "Abstract": "The capacity of pediatric hospitals to provide treatment to large numbers of patients during a large-scale disaster remains a concern. Hospitals are expected to function independently for as long as 96 hours. Reverse triage (early discharge), a strategy that creates surge bed capacity while conserving resources, has been modeled for adults but not pediatric patients.\nTo estimate the potential of reverse triage for surge capacity in an academic pediatric hospital.\nIn this retrospective cohort study, a blocked, randomized sampling scheme was used including inpatients from 7 units during 196 mock disaster days distributed across the 1-year period from December 21, 2012, through December 20, 2013. Patients not requiring any critical interventions for 4 successive days were considered to be suitable for low-risk immediate reverse triage. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2014, through November 21, 2016.\nProportionate contribution of reverse triage to the creation of surge capacity measured as a percentage of beds newly available in each unit and in aggregate.\nOf 3996 inpatients, 501 were sampled (268 boys [53.5%] and 233 girls [46.5%]; mean [SD] age, 7.8 [6.6] years), with 10.8% eligible for immediate low-risk reverse triage and 13.2% for discharge by 96 hours. The psychiatry unit had the most patients eligible for immediate reverse triage (72.7%; 95% CI, 59.6%-85.9%), accounting for more than half of the reverse triage effect. The oncology (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.0%-3.9%) and pediatric intensive care (0%) units had the least effect. Gross surge capacity using all strategies (routine patient discharges, full use of staffed and unstaffed licensed beds, and cancellation of elective and transfer admissions) was estimated at 57.7% (95% CI, 38.2%-80.2%) within 24 hours and 84.1% (95% CI, 63.9%-100%) by day 4. Net surge capacity, estimated by adjusting for routine emergency department admissions, was about 50% (range, 49.1%-52.6%) throughout the 96-hour period. By accepting higher-risk patients only (considering only major critical interventions as limiting), reverse triage would increase surge capacity by nearly 50%.\nOur estimates indicate considerable potential pediatric surge capacity by using combined strategic initiatives. Reverse triage adds a meaningful but modest contribution and may depend on psychiatric space. Large volumes of pediatric patients discharged early to the community during disasters could challenge pediatricians owing to the close follow-up likely to be required."}, {"Title": "The Child Behavior Checklist-Obsessive-Compulsive Subscale Detects Severe Psychopathology and Behavioral Problems Among School-Aged Children.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were (1) to assess obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) dimensionally in a school-aged community sample and to correlate them with clinical and demographical variables; (2) to determine a subgroup with significant OCS (\"at-risk for OCD\") using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-OCS) and (3) to compare it with the rest of the sample; (4) To review the CBCL-OCS subscale properties as a screening tool for pediatric OCD.\nData from the Brazilian High Risk Cohort were analyzed. The presence and severity of OCS were assessed through the CBCL-OCS subscale. DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses were obtained by the Developmental and Well-Being Assessment. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Youth Strengths Inventory, and the CBCL internalizing and externalizing behavior subscales.\nA total of 2512 (mean age: 8.86\u2009\u00b1\u20091.84 years; 55.0% male) children were included. Moderate correlations were found between OCS severity and functional impairment (r\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Children with higher levels of OCS had higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity and behavioral problems (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A score of 5 or higher in the CBCL-OCS scale determined an \"at-risk for OCD\" subgroup, comprising 9.7% of the sample (n\u2009=\u2009244), with behavioral patterns and psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., tics [odds ratios, OR\u2009=\u20096.41, p\u2009<\u20090.001]), anxiety disorders grouped [OR\u2009=\u20093.68, p\u2009<\u20090.001] and depressive disorders [OR\u2009=\u20093.0, p\u2009<\u20090.001] very similar to those described in OCD. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CBCL-OCS for OCD diagnosis were, respectively, 48%, 91.5%; 15.1%, and 98.2%.\nThe dimensional approach suggests that the presence of OCS in children is associated with higher rates of comorbidity, behavioral problems, and impairment. The \"at-risk for OCD\" group defined by the CBCL revealed a group of patients phenotypically similar to full blown OCD."}, {"Title": "Management Challenges in a Child with Chronic Hyponatremia: Use of V2 Receptor Antagonist.", "Abstract": "Chronic hyponatremia is very rare in children and is often seen in the setting of congestive heart failure or liver failure in adults. Here, we report an 8-year-old child with hypothalamic glioma who presented with severe hyponatremia. Initial management consisted of fluid restriction. This was very difficult for the child to follow and the child developed bizarre drinking habits requiring intervention from child psychiatry. So therapy was initiated with low dose V2 receptor antagonist under close inpatient monitoring. While initial response was reassuring, her sodium levels tended to drift down with longer duration of treatment requiring us to increase the dose frequently. Her response to therapy and her stable clinical situation off therapy suggest that she may have reset osmostat."}, {"Title": "The European Network on Psychosomatic Medicine (ENPM) - history and future directions.", "Abstract": "Within national and international societies of psychosomatic medicine the idea has emerged of bringing together and coordinating psychosomatic, behavioural, psychological and medical actions with common interests throughout Europe as a way to increase their scientific and political influence.\nIt was felt that there was a strong need and opportunity of a common and unifying forum for scientific exchange.\nIt was considered desirable to exchange scientific thoughts and experiences in an open minded and boundless way, among individuals and societies, between disciplines and across borders.

The present study further explore this link by analyzing the potential association of psychiatry comorbidity with alterations in the concentrations of circulating plasma chemokine in patients of both sexes diagnosed with alcohol use disorders (AUD). To this end, 85 abstinent subjects with AUD from an outpatient setting and 55 healthy subjects were evaluated for substance and mental disorders. Plasma samples were obtained to quantify chemokine concentrations [C-C motif (CC), C-X-C motif (CXC), and C-X<sub>3</sub>-C motif (CX<sub>3</sub>C) chemokines]. Abstinent AUD patients displayed a high prevalence of comorbid mental disorders (72%) and other substance use disorders (45%). Plasma concentrations of chemokines CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1 (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and CX<sub>3</sub>CL1/fractalkine (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) were lower in AUD patients compared to controls, whereas CCL11/eotaxin-1 concentrations were strongly decreased in female AUD patients (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). In the alcohol group, CXCL8 concentrations were increased in patients with liver and pancreas diseases and there was a significant correlation to aspartate transaminase (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009+0.456, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009+0.647, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Focusing on comorbid psychiatric disorders, we distinguish between patients with additional mental disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200961) and other substance use disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200938). Only CCL11 concentrations were found to be altered in AUD patients diagnosed with mental disorders (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) with a strong main effect of sex. Thus, patients with mood disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200942) and/or anxiety (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200916) had lower CCL11 concentrations than non-comorbid patients being more evident in women. The alcohol-induced alterations in circulating chemokines were also explored in preclinical models of alcohol use with male Wistar rats. Rats exposed to repeated ethanol (3\u2009g/kg, gavage) had lower CXCL12 (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) concentrations and higher CCL11 concentrations (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) relative to vehicle-treated rats. Additionally, the increased CCL11 concentrations in rats exposed to ethanol were enhanced by the prior exposure to restraint stress (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Concordantly, acute ethanol exposure induced changes in CXCL12, CX<sub>3</sub>CL1, and CCL11 in the same direction to repeated exposure. These results clearly indicate a contribution of specific chemokines to the phenotype of AUD and a strong effect of sex, revealing a link of CCL11 to alcohol and anxiety/stress."}, {"Title": "Admission experiences of psychiatric patients in tertiary care: An implication toward Mental Health Care Bill, 2013.", "Abstract": "Coercion is not uncommon phenomenon among mental health service users during their admission into psychiatric hospital.

They are considered the highest quality of evidence, and their results help inform decisions concerning drug development and use, preventive therapies, and screening programs. However, the inputs that justify an RCT to be conducted have not been studied.\nWe reviewed the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases across six specialties (Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology (ENT), General Surgery, Psychiatry, Obstetrics-Gynecology (OB-GYN), and Internal Medicine) and randomly chose 25 RCTs from each specialty except for Otorhinolaryngology (20 studies) and Internal Medicine (28 studies). For each RCT, we recorded information relating to the justification for conducting RCTs such as average study size cited, number of studies cited, and types of studies cited. The justification varied widely both within and between specialties.\nFor Ophthalmology and OB-GYN, the average study sizes cited were around 1100 patients, whereas they were around 500 patients for Psychiatry and General Surgery. Between specialties, the average number of studies cited ranged from around 4.5 for ENT to around 10 for Ophthalmology, but the standard deviations were large, indicating that there was even more discrepancy within each specialty. When standardizing by the sample size of the RCT, some of the discrepancies between and within specialties can be explained, but not all. On average, Ophthalmology papers cited review articles the most (2.96 studies per RCT) compared to less than 1.5 studies per RCT for all other specialties.\nThe justifications for RCTs vary widely both within and between specialties, and the justification for conducting RCTs is not standardized."}, {"Title": "A Multimodal Intervention for Children with ADHD Reduces Inequity in Health and Education Outcomes.", "Abstract": "To evaluate whether a multimodal intervention for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) resulted in better long-term health and education outcomes and reduced inequity across the socioeconomic gradient.\nWe analyzed administrative data held in the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository describing recipients of a combined pharmacological/behavioural intervention for ADHD. The study cohort included children aged 5 to 17 years who visited the Manitoba Adolescent Treatment Centre's ADHD intervention service at least 3 times (2007-2012). Controls were matched on age, sex, year of ADHD diagnosis, and income quintile. We compared rates of hospital and emergency department visits, medication use and adherence, contact with child welfare services, and whether children were in their age-appropriate grade. We used concentration curves to estimate differences in outcomes between children from high- and low-income families.\nChildren who received the intervention ( n = 485) had higher rates of medication use (rate ratio [RR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.36) and adherence (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.96) and were more likely to be in their age-appropriate grade (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.63) compared with controls ( n = 1884). The intervention was also associated with reduced inequity in these outcomes across income deciles. There was no difference in the rates of hospital or emergency department visits or contacts with child welfare services.\nA multimodal ADHD intervention was associated with increased medication use and adherence and higher academic achievement.

A recent study on Japanese subjects found a genetic variant within the encoding gene SIGMAR1 (rs1800866A>C) associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to evaluate the same polymorphism in both MDD and bipolar disorder (BD) as well as its relationship to response to treatment with antidepressants and mood stabilizers.\nA total of 238 MDD patients treated for an acute episode of depression, 132 BD patients in treatment with mood stabilizers for a manic or mixed episode, and 324 controls were genotyped for rs1800866. At discharge, response to treatments was evaluated in MDD and BD patients by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and the Young Mania Rating Score (YMRS), respectively.\nIn our Korean sample, allele frequencies were different from those reported in other Asian and non-Asian populations. The CC genotype was associated with BD and, as a trend, with MDD. No significant effect was observed on response to antidepressants in MDD or mood stabilizers in BD, although the CC genotype was more frequent among BD patients experiencing a mixed episode.\nThe present findings are the first to propose the putative role of genetic variants within SIGMAR1 and sigma-1 receptor in BD. Sigma-1 receptor can modulate a number of central neurotransmitter systems as well as some other signaling pathways (e.g., neurotrophin and growth factor signaling) which are seemingly involved in BD and other mood disorders."}, {"Title": "Pulling your hair out in geriatric psychiatry: a case report.", "Abstract": "Trichotillomania is a relatively understudied psychiatric disorder.

A nationally representative survey design and census data were used to calculate hospitalization rates. Multilevel models examined variation in length and cost of stay in relation to individual (age, sex, race-ethnicity, household income, payer source, and illness severity) and hospital (region, urban or rural location, ownership, teaching status, and size) characteristics.\nAdmission rates differed dramatically by region, with higher rates in the Northeast. Compared with white patients, African Americans had higher admission rates but shorter stays and lower costs, and Asians/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans had longer stays. Longer stays were also associated with higher versus lower illness severity and use of Medicaid and Medicare versus private insurance. Length and cost of stays were greater in Northeast hospitals and in public hospitals.\nStrong differences were noted in use of hospitalization to treat psychotic disorders. Higher admission rates and longer stays in the Northeast were striking, as were differences in admission rates and length of stay for African-American patients compared with white patients.

The evaluation in the DS clinic focused on potential medical diagnoses including atlantoaxial joint instability, vitamin deficiency, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and seizures. A comprehensive medical evaluation yielded only a finding of moderate OSA. A reactive depression was considered in association with several psychosocial factors including moving homes, entering puberty/onset of menses, and classroom change from an integrated setting to a self- contained classroom comprising unfamiliar peers with behavior challenges.Urgent referrals for psychological and psychiatric evaluations were initiated. Neuropsychological testing did not suggest true regression in cognitive, language, and academic skills, although decreases in motivation and performance were noted with a reaction to stress and multiple environmental changes as a potential causative factor. Psychiatry consultation supported this finding in that psychosocial stress temporally correlated with Kristen's regression in skills.Working collaboratively, the team determined that Kristen's presentation was consistent with a reactive form of depression (DSM-IV-TR: depressive disorder, not otherwise specified). Kristen's presentation was exacerbated by salient environmental stress and sleep apnea, rather than a cognitive regression associated with a medical cause. Treatment consisted of an antidepressant medication, continuous positive airway pressure for OSA, and increased psychosocial supports. Her school initiated a change in classroom placement.

During a vacation with her family, she went swimming with dolphins. A few days later, Isela awoke at night with laughing spells; during the day, she was pacing, aggressive, and had a decline in self-care and communication skills. Her parents attributed the symptoms to the dolphins. She was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist. The sleep-deprived electroencephalogram, brain magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, and thyroid function tests were normal. A genomic microarray was sent. The neurologist initiated empirical therapy for seizures with lamotrigine, which caused a rash. It was discontinued. She was then treated with oxcarbazepine followed by topiramate for several months without any change in symptoms. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a small deletion at 14q13.1, which includes the NPAS3 gene. Psychiatry was consulted after several months of persistent symptoms. Isela seemed to be laughing in response to internal stimuli. Owing to the decline in communication and her apparent preoccupation with visual and auditory internal stimuli, Isela could not be interviewed adequately to confirm that she was experiencing hallucinations, but her laughter seemed to be in response to hallucinations. Isela was diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia with psychosis. Risperidone was prescribed.A psychology evaluation was completed a few months later. Parents noted significant improvement after starting risperidone with reduced inappropriate laughing spells, reduced pacing, as well as improved eating, sleeping, communication, and self-care.

We aimed to present an adolescent recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (BD) who had LQTS that was treated with ICD, discussing her follow up and treatment along with relevant literature.\nPsychiatric assessment of the case that applied to our child psychiatry unit due to manic symptoms were carried out by using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria. Symptom severity was monitored via Young Mania Rating Scale scores (YMRSS).\nThe case met criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I (BD-I). She had improvement in her mood symptoms with treatment regimen as risperidone 3 mg/day, valproate 1000 mg/day and lorazepam 1 mg/dayi after her 2-week follow up as well as no reported ICD activity, reflecting fine cardiac functions and rhythm.\nLQTS is a serious health issue for children and adolescents diagnosed with BD. This condition should be kept in mind especially in cases where familial risk factors are present and precautions need to be maintained upon required assessments. These cases need to be closely monitored due to risk factors related to both BD and LQTS, in a multidisciplinary fashion, involving both psychiatry and cardiology divisions."}, {"Title": "A Review of Psychopharmacological Interventions Post-Disaster to Prevent Psychiatric Sequelae.", "Abstract": "Disasters are mega-scale catastrophic events which cause trauma and mental health sequelae.

Early psychopharmacological interventions to prevent PTSD provide promising evidence for hydrocortisone in medically ill trauma populations. Less robust benefits were noted for other pharmacological interventions.

A dimensional conceptualization posits that anhedonia severity is related to a transdiagnostic continuum of reward deficits in specific neural networks. Previous functional connectivity studies related to anhedonia have focused on case-control comparisons in specific disorders, using region-specific seed-based analyses. Here, the authors explore the entire functional connectome in relation to reward responsivity across a population of adults with heterogeneous psychopathology.\nIn a sample of 225 adults from five diagnostic groups (major depressive disorder, N=32; bipolar disorder, N=50; schizophrenia, N=51; psychosis risk, N=39; and healthy control subjects, N=53), the authors conducted a connectome-wide analysis examining the relationship between a dimensional measure of reward responsivity (the reward sensitivity subscale of the Behavioral Activation Scale) and resting-state functional connectivity using multivariate distance-based matrix regression.\nThe authors identified foci of dysconnectivity associated with reward responsivity in the nucleus accumbens, the default mode network, and the cingulo-opercular network. Follow-up analyses revealed dysconnectivity among specific large-scale functional networks and their connectivity with the nucleus accumbens. Reward deficits were associated with decreased connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the default mode network and increased connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the cingulo-opercular network. In addition, impaired reward responsivity was associated with default mode network hyperconnectivity and diminished connectivity between the default mode network and the cingulo-opercular network.\nThese results emphasize the centrality of the nucleus accumbens in the pathophysiology of reward deficits and suggest that dissociable patterns of connectivity among large-scale networks are critical to the neurobiology of reward dysfunction across clinical diagnostic categories."}, {"Title": "Navigating through the Competency Based Fellowship Program: two trainees' experience of the 2012 program.", "Abstract": "This article discusses the real-life experience of two senior registrars who are approaching the end of their training under the 2012 Competency Based Fellowship Program.

The Temperament in Memphis Pisa and San Diego (TEMPS) instrument has been widely used in research, yet its psychometric properties and optimal factor structure are unclear.\nThe PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from inception until March 15th, 2016. Validation peer-reviewed studies of different versions of the TEMPS performed in adult samples were considered for inclusion.\nTwenty-seven studies (N=20,787) met inclusion criteria. Several versions of the TEMPS have been validated in 14 languages across 15 countries. The 110-item self-reported version of the TEMPS has been the most studied version. Most studies (50%) supported a five factor solution although few studies performed confirmatory factor analyses. A five-factor solution has consistently been reported for the 39-item version of the TEMPS-A. Overall, evidence indicates that different versions of the TEMPS have adequate internal consistency reliability, while the TEMPS-A-110 version has acceptable test-retest reliability. The methodological quality of included studies varied.\nA meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity of settings and versions of the TEMPS utilized.\nDifferent versions of the TEMPS have been validated across different cultures.

During research on two different qualitative research projects on healthcare prioritisations, we found a striking difference on how hospital executive managers and clinical healthcare professionals talked about and understood prioritisations.\nThe purpose of this study is to explore how healthcare professionals in mental healthcare and somatic medicine prioritise their care, to compare different ways of setting priorities among managers and clinicians and to explore how moral dilemmas are balanced and reconciled. Research design and participants: We conducted qualitative observations, interviews and focus groups with medical doctors, nurses and other clinical members of the interdisciplinary team in both somatic medical and mental health wards in hospitals in Norway. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Ethical considerations: Basic ethical principles for research ethics were followed. The respondents signed an informed consent for participation. They were assured anonymity and confidentiality. The studies were approved by relevant ethics committees in line with the Helsinki Convention.\nOur findings showed a widening gap between the views of clinicians on one hand and managers on the other. Clinicians experienced a threat to their autonomy, to their professional ideals and to their desire to perform their job in a professional way. Prioritisations were a cause of constant concern and problematic decisions. Even though several managers understood and empathised with the clinicians, the ideals of patient flow and keeping budgets balanced were perceived as more important.\nWe discuss our findings in light of the moral challenges of patient-centred individual healthcare versus demands of distributive justice from healthcare management.\nThe clinicians' ideals of autonomy and good medical and nursing care for the individual patients were perceived as endangered."}, {"Title": "Buprenorphine prescribing practice trends and attitudes among New York providers.", "Abstract": "Buprenorphine office-based opioid maintenance is an increasingly common form of treatment for opioid use disorders. However, total prescribing has not kept pace with the current opioid and overdose epidemic and access remains scarce among the underserved. This study sought to assess current provider attitudes and clinical practices among a targeted sample of primarily New York City public sector buprenorphine prescribers. A cross-sectional online survey purposefully sampled buprenorphine prescribers in NYC with a focus on those serving Medicaid and uninsured patient populations. Expert review of local provider networks, snowball referrals, and in-person networking generated an email list, which received a survey link. A brief 25-question instrument queried provider and practice demographics, prescribing practices including induction approaches and attitudes regarding common hot topics (e.g., buprenorphine diversion, prescriber patient limits, insurance issues, ancillary treatments). Of 132 email invitations, N=72 respondents completed (n=64) or partially completed (n=8) the survey between January and April 2016. Most (79%) were Medicaid providers in non-psychiatric specialties (72%), working in a hospital-based or community general practice (51%), and board-certified in addiction medicine or psychiatry (58%). Practice sizes were generally 100 patients or fewer (71%); many providers (64%) individually prescribed buprenorphine <25% of total practice time to a median 23 patients (mean 31, range 0-102). Unobserved (home) induction for new patients was a common practice: 49% predominantly prescribed unobserved induction; 16% mixed unobserved and observed inductions. Adjunctive psychosocial counseling was routinely recommended (46%) or considered on a case-by-case basis (17%) versus mandated (37%). Medication prior authorization requirements were the highest rated barriers to practice, followed by inadequate clinic space, limited clinic time and/or support staff, and inadequate psychiatric services for dual diagnoses. Buprenorphine diversion was not rated as an important practice barrier. In conclusion, this targeted survey of buprenorphine prescribers in NYC treating primarily underserved populations showed a consistent pattern of part-time prescribing to modest volumes of patients, routine use of unobserved buprenorphine induction, and primarily elective referrals to psychosocial counseling. Barriers to prescribing included prior authorization requirements, lack of clinical resources (space, staff) and psychiatric services. Federal and local efforts to reduce such barriers may improve buprenorphine access among the underserved."}, {"Title": "Atmosphere: On the Phenomenology of \"Atmospheric\" Alterations in Schizophrenia - Overall Sense of Reality, Familiarity, Vitality, Meaning, or Relevance (Ancillary Article to EAWE Domain 5).", "Abstract": "\"Atmospheric\" alterations are key aspects of altered subjectivity in mental disorder. Karl Jaspers famously described the \"delusional mood\": a sense of uncanny salience and ominousness that often precedes the onset of schizophrenic psychosis or of delusions. Such experiences, he writes, involve \"a transformation in our total awareness of reality\" that often verges on ineffability. In psychiatry, these experiential alterations are often referred to in terms of \"derealization.\" Though derealization most obviously refers to a decline in the sense of objective presence or felt actuality, it can also refer to other unusual experiences in which things seem unlike normal or standard reality, including altered familiarity, vitality, meaning, or relevance. This paper first describes two complementary ways of approaching these phenomena: the notion of an \"ontological\" dimension (Sass) and that of \"existential feeling\" (Ratcliffe). It then offers a wider-ranging synopsis of work in phenomenological psychopathology that has sought to address atmospheric alterations believed to be especially characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum conditions, focusing on the themes of a diminished sense of reality, altered sense of meaning, disrupted feeling of familiarity, and diminished vitality and relevance."}, {"Title": "Critical incidents and judicial response during medium security treatment.", "Abstract": "This study examined inpatient incidents in three Flemish forensic medium security units and analyzed the subsequent judicial reactions to these incidents.

Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) concentrations were calculated for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. MBSR participants had a significantly greater reduction in ACTH AUC compared to control participants. Similarly, the MBSR group had a greater reduction in inflammatory cytokines' AUC concentrations. We found larger reductions in stress markers for patients with GAD in the MBSR class compared to control; this provides the first combined hormonal and immunological evidence that MBSR may enhance resilience to stress."}, {"Title": "An exploratory study of the heterogeneity of the jealousy phenomenon and its associations with affective temperaments and psychopathological dimensions in a large Brazilian sample.", "Abstract": "Jealousy is a heterogenous emotion on a spectrum from normality to psychopathology.

Confirmatory factor analysis provided a five-factor model for the QUEGE with self-esteem, paranoia, interpersonal sensitivity, fear of being abandoned, and obsessive dimensions. The anxious, irritable, cyclothymic, and depressive temperaments were independently associated with jealousy dimensions, whereas the hyperthymic temperament was associated with lower scores on the self-esteem jealousy dimension (N=2042, P<0.001). Jealousy subtypes were dissimilarly associated with SCL-90R psychopathological dimensions, whereas the 'obsessive' jealousy dimension was not significantly associated with SCL-90R dimension scores. We found no independent influence of gender across any jealousy dimension.\nA convenience web-based sample was employed. Cross-sectional design precludes the establishment of causal inferences.\nOur data indicate that a five-factor solution may provide the best-fit model for the QUEGE. Different jealousy subtypes were independently associated with affective temperaments and psychopathological dimensions.

The aim of the present study was to compare serum cytokine levels between patients with AD, subjects with MCI, and healthy controls, and to assess the correlation between cytokine levels and cognitive performance in these subjects.\nParticipants included 35 patients with AD, 29 subjects with MCI, and 28 healthy controls from the Department of Psychiatry of IIlsan Paik Hospital in South Korea. Demographic and neuropsychological information were obtained, and peripheral cytokine levels, specifically tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels, were measured for all subjects.\nAfter adjustment for age, a significant difference in IL-6 levels (P = 0.045), but not in TNF-\u03b1 (P = 0.082) levels, was observed among the three groups. IL-6 levels were higher in patients with AD than in subjects with MCI and healthy controls. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels negatively and positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination and Global Deterioration Scale scores, respectively. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels were also positively correlated with each other.\nThe present study suggests that serum IL-6 levels of patients with AD might be higher than those of subjects with MCI and healthy controls.

Conventionally this is done by vena puncture. Novel sampling strategies such as dried blood spot (DBS) sampling have been developed for various drugs, including antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood-stabilizers. DBS sampling is typically performed by means of a finger prick. This method allows for remote sampling, which means that patients are not required to travel to a health care facility. The number of DBS assays for drugs used in psychiatry has increased over the last decade and includes antidepressants (tricyclic and serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), mood stabilizers and first- and second-generation antipsychotics. Available assays often comply with analytical validation criteria but are seldom used in routine clinical care. Little attention has been paid to the clinical validation and implementation processes of home sampling. Ideally, not only medicines but also clinical chemistry parameters should be measured within the same sample.

It has been argued that psychiatry as a discipline enjoys low esteem among the public, and a \"crisis\" of psychiatry has been noted. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population studies examining public attitudes towards various aspects of psychiatric care. Our search in PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO and bibliographies yielded 162 papers based on population surveys conducted since 2000 and published no later than 2015. We found that professional help for mental disorders generally enjoys high esteem. While general practitioners are the preferred source of help for depression, mental health professionals are the most trusted helpers for schizophrenia. If respondents have to rank sources of help, they tend to favor mental health professionals, while open questions yield results more favorable to general practitioners. Psychiatrists and psychologists/psychotherapists are equally recommended for the treatment of schizophrenia, while for depression psychologists/psychotherapists are more recommended, at least in Europe and America. Psychotherapy is consistently preferred over medication. Attitudes towards seeking help from psychiatrists or psychologists/psychotherapists as well as towards medication and psychotherapy have markedly improved over the last twenty-five years. Biological concepts of mental illness are associated with stronger approval of psychiatric help, particularly medication. Self-stigma and negative attitudes towards persons with mental illness decrease the likelihood of personally considering psychiatric help. In conclusion, the public readily recommends psychiatric help for the treatment of mental disorders. Psychotherapy is the most popular method of psychiatric treatment. A useful strategy to further improve the public image of psychiatry could be to stress that listening and understanding are at the core of psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "A network theory of mental disorders.", "Abstract": "In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines."}, {"Title": "Side-of-onset of Parkinson's disease in relation to neuropsychological measures.", "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) usually emerges with a unilateral side-of-onset (left-onset: LOPD; right-onset: ROPD; Marinus & van Hilten, 2015) due to an asymmetrical degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons (Donnemiller et\u00a0al., <i>Brain</i>, 135, 2012, 3348).

Various cognitive and neuropsychological measures were used in an attempt to discover if there were indeed any differences between LOPD and ROPD in this cohort.\nFor LOPD, duration of illness was found to be significantly greater than that of ROPD. However, further testing was able to confirm that despite this difference, it was not the cause of the other significant differences found. Furthermore, this increased duration was consistent with a previous study (Munhoz et\u00a0al., <i>Parkinsonism and Related Disorders</i>, 19, 2013, 77). Performance on the Digit Span Backward (DSB) was found to be significantly poorer in LOPD than ROPD, suggesting compromised executive function in LOPD. Additionally, LOPD had significantly greater anxiety on the DASS Anxiety scales than ROPD. However, unlike Foster et\u00a0al (<i>Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology</i>, 23, 2010, 4), this increased anxiety could not account for the poorer performance on the DSB for LOPD.

Among individuals with MD, we explore the impact of genetic-temperamental and child adversity risk factors on individual reported symptoms. Aggregated criteria do not separate insomnia from hypersomnia, weight gain from loss, etc. while disaggregated criteria do.\nIn twins with MD at two different waves, the mean tetrachoric correlations (\u00b1SEM) for aggregated and disaggregated DSM-IV A criteria were, respectively, +0.31 \u00b1 0.06 and +0.34 \u00b1 0.03.

Forty percent of the patients (n\u00a0=\u00a082/204) had at least one UDS and 70% (60/82) had an inappropriate result. Thirty-nine percent (32) were inappropriately negative, showing no prescribed opioids. Forty-nine of the eighty-two were positive for non-prescribed opioids, benzodiazepine, or illicit substance. Eleven of the forty-nine had only cannabis metabolites in their urine. There were no significant differences between appropriate and inappropriate UDS groups regarding pain scores, MEDD or referral to psychology, psychiatry, or substance abuse specialists.\nUDS on the 82 oncology patients at high risk for substance misuse were frequently positive (46%) for non-prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines or potent illicit drugs such as heroin or cocaine, and 39% had inappropriately negative UDS, raising concerns for diversion."}, {"Title": "Attachment Styles of Dermatological Patients in Europe: A Multi-centre Study in 13 Countries.", "Abstract": "Attachment styles of dermatological outpatients and satisfaction with their dermatologists were investigated within the framework of a multicentre study conducted in 13 European countries, organized by the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry. Attachment style was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale. Patient satisfaction with the dermatologist was assessed with an 11-degree scale. A total of 3,635 adult outpatients and 1,359 controls participated in the study. Dermatological outpatients were less able to depend on others, were less comfortable with closeness and intimacy, and experienced similar rates of anxiety in relationships as did the controls. Participants who had secure attachment styles reported stressful life events during the last 6 months significantly less often than those who had insecure attachment styles. Patients with secure attachment styles tended to be more satisfied with their dermatologist than did insecure patients. These results suggest that secure attachment of dermatological outpatients may be a protective factor in the management of stress."}, {"Title": "A systematic review of management strategies for children's mental health care in the emergency department: update on evidence and recommendations for clinical practice and research.", "Abstract": "Children with mental health crises require access to specialised resources and services which are not yet standard in general and paediatric EDs. In 2010, we published a systematic review that provided some evidence to support the use of specialised care models to reduce hospitalisation, return ED visits and length of ED stay. We perform a systematic review to update the evidence base and inform current policy statements.\nTwelve databases and the grey literature were searched up to January 2015. Seven studies were included in the review (four newly identified studies). These studies compared ED-based strategies designed to assess, treat and/or therapeutically support or manage a mental health presentation. The methodological quality of six studies was assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Risk of Bias tool (one interrupted time series study) and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (three retrospective cohort and two before-after studies). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was applied to rate overall evidence quality (high, moderate, low or very low) for individual outcomes from these six studies. An additional study evaluated the psychometric properties of a clinical instrument and was assessed using criteria developed by the Society of Pediatric Psychology Assessment Task Force (well-established, approaching well-established or promising assessment).\nThere is low to very low overall evidence quality that: (1) use of screening laboratory tests to medically clear mental health patients increases length of ED stay and costs, but does not increase the risk of clinical management or disposition change if not conducted; and (2) specialised models of ED care reduce lengths of ED stay, security man-hours and restraint orders. One mental health assessment tool of promising quality, the home, education, activities and peers, drugs and alcohol, suicidality, emotions and behaviour, discharge resources (HEADS-ED), has had good accuracy in predicting admission to inpatient psychiatry.\nLower-quality data suggest benefits to the use of specialised resources and services for paediatric mental health care in general and paediatric EDs. Experimental evaluation of strategies and the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes will improve confidence in these findings. Additional psychometric studies are needed for the HEADS-ED tool to be considered well established."}, {"Title": "One Hundred Years of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins: A Story of Meyer to McHugh.", "Abstract": "This article describes a history of clinical methods and constructs that guide Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Phipps Clinic today. The contributions of Adolf Meyer and Paul McHugh are central and closely connected. Both emphasize the clinical examination as the central practice of psychiatry as a specialty within medicine. Meyer's comprehensive examination of the patient became the centerpiece of his approach and was the standard for psychiatrists in the English-speaking world. McHugh, with Phillip Slavney, developed a pluralistic and practical framework for interpreting that history and examination. Both argued against the uncritical use of the modern disease construct. McHugh argues that the disease construct, although fundamental, is but one of four useful \"perspectives of psychiatry\" and is, thus, an insufficient basis for psychiatric practice. The perspectives could be used as an organizing framework by all physicians who seek a practical and truly personalized approach to the care of patients."}, {"Title": "Trajectories of Substance Use Disorder in Youth After Detention: A 12-Year Longitudinal Study.", "Abstract": "To identify trajectories of substance use disorders (SUDs) in youth during the 12 years after detention and how gender, race/ethnicity, and age at baseline predict trajectories.\nAs part of the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1,829 youth randomly sampled from detention in Chicago, Illinois from 1995 through 1998, participants were reinterviewed in the community or correctional facilities up to 9 times over 12 years. Independent interviewers assessed SUDs using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 2.3 (baseline) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule IV (follow-ups). Primary outcome was a mutually exclusive 5-category typology of disorder: no SUD, alcohol alone, marijuana alone, comorbid alcohol and marijuana, or \"other\" illicit (\"hard\") drug. Trajectories were estimated using growth mixture models with a 3-category ordinal variable derived from the typology.\nDuring the 12-year follow-up, 19.6% of youth did not have an SUD. The remaining 81.4% were in 3 trajectory classes. Class 1 (24.5%), a bell-shaped trajectory, peaked 5 years after baseline when 42.7% had an SUD and 12.5% had comorbid or \"other\" illicit drug disorders.

Design Qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews with trainees and trainers. Setting Postgraduate medical training in London, Kent Surrey and Sussex, Yorkshire and Humber, and Wales in November/December 2015. Part of a larger study about the fairness of postgraduate medical training. Participants Ninety-six trainees and 41 trainers, comprising UK and international medical graduates from Foundation, General Practice, Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Psychiatry, Radiology, and Surgery, at all levels of training. Main outcome measures Trainee and trainer perceptions of the validity of the ARCP as an assessment tool. Results Participants recognised the need for assessment, but were generally dissatisfied with ARCPs, especially UK graduate trainees. Participants criticised the perceived tick-box nature of ARCPs as measuring clerical rather than clinical ability, and which they found detrimental to learning. Trainees described being able to populate their e-portfolios with just positive feedback; they also experienced difficulty getting assessments signed off by supervisors. ARCPs were perceived as poor at identifying struggling trainees and/or as discouraging excellence by focussing on minimal competency. Positive experiences of ARCPs arose when trainees could discuss their progress with interested supervisors. Conclusions Trainee and trainer criticisms of ARCPs can be conceptualised as evidence that ARCPs lack validity as an assessment tool. Ongoing reforms to workplace-based assessments could address negative perceptions of the 'tick-box' elements, encourage constructive input from seniors and allow trainees to demonstrate excellence as well as minimal competency, while keeping patients safe."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and psychiatric patients : A study of the adherence after psychiatric inpatient treatment at the department of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Clinicum Klagenfurt am W\u00f6rthersee.].", "Abstract": "Based on the data of an analysis of costs of psychopharmacological treatment by the Austrian Rechnungshof in 2011, which also revealed remarkable differences between Salzburg and Carinthia (federal states of Austria), a\u00a0panel of experts discussed the potential causes.

Carers underwent a clinical interview based upon the neuropsychiatric inventory. Patients were assessed at ForeFront, the Frontotemporal Dementia Research Group at Neuroscience Research Australia or at the Brain and Mind Centre, between January 2008 and December 2013. An index of psychosis was calculated, taking into account the degree and severity of psychosis in each case. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to explore relationships between the psychosis index and grey matter changes.\nThirty-four percent of frontotemporal dementia patients showed psychotic features. <i>C9orf72</i> expansion cases were more likely to exhibit psychotic symptoms than non-carriers (64% vs. 26%; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.006), which were also more severe (psychotic index 23.1 vs. 8.1; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Delusions comprised persecutory, somatic, jealous and grandiose types and were present in 57% of <i>C9orf72</i> carriers and 19% of non-carriers (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

Increased psychotic symptoms in <i>C9orf72</i> expansion carriers correlated with atrophy in a distributed cortical and subcortical network that included discrete regions of the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, as well as the thalamus, striatum and cerebellum.\nThis study underlines the need to consider and assess for psychotic symptoms in the frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis continuum particularly in those with <i>C9orf72</i> gene expansions. The network of brain regions identified in this study is strikingly similar to that identified in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, which suggests that treatment strategies in psychiatry may be beneficial for the management of psychotic symptoms in frontotemporal dementia."}, {"Title": "Management of psychiatric complications in unrelated donor before unrelated peripheral hematopoietic stem cell collections.", "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can efficiently treat patients with severe hematological diseases.

Many new robustly associated genetic loci have been detected. Furthermore, there is consensus that at least a dozen microdeletions and microduplications contribute to the disease.

Given the marked sex differences observed in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, using both males and females in research studies is an important requirement. Thus the aim of this study was to examine sex differences in psychotomimetic-induced behavioural deficits relevant to psychosis. We therefore compared the acute effect of amphetamine or phencyclidine on locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition in adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. The results of this study were that: (1) amphetamine-induced distance travelled was greater in female rats than in male rats, (2) phencyclidine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in male and female rats; (3) there were no sex differences in amphetamine- or phencyclidine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition; (4) male rats had an increased startle response after amphetamine. These findings suggest that sensitivity to amphetamine, but not phencyclidine, differs between male and female rats, and that this sex difference is selective to locomotor hyperactivity and startle, but not prepulse inhibition. This study used two widely-used, validated preclinical assays relevant to psychosis; the results of this study have implications for psychiatry research, particularly for disorders where marked sex differences in onset and symptomology are observed."}, {"Title": "Quick SOFA Scores Predict Mortality in Adult Emergency Department Patients With and Without Suspected Infection.", "Abstract": "The Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score (composed of respiratory rate \u226522 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure \u2264100 mm Hg, and altered mental status) may identify patients with infection who are at risk of complications.

The subliminal stimulus presentation of sexual stimuli could be a new approach to reduce vulnerability to manipulation. Meaningful images and scrambled images were applied as masks. Recognition performance was low, but interestingly, sexual preference and explicitness modulated stimulus visibility, suggesting interactions between networks of sexual arousal and consciousness. With scrambled masks, higher activations for sexually preferred images and for explicit images were found in areas associated with sexual arousal (Stoleru, Fonteille, Cornelis, Joyal, & Moulier, 2012).

Psychiatry has traditionally defined diagnoses by constellations of co-occurring signs and symptoms that are assigned a categorical label (e.g. schizophrenia). Trial methodology in psychiatry has evaluated interventions targeted at these categorical entities, with diagnoses being equated to disorders. Recent insights into both the nosology and neurobiology of psychiatric disorder reveal that traditional categorical diagnoses cannot be equated with disorders. We argue that current quantitative methodology (1) inherits these categorical assumptions, (2) allows only for the discovery of average treatment response, (3) relies on composite outcome measures and (4) sacrifices valuable predictive information for stratified and personalised treatment in psychiatry.\nTo achieve a truly 'stratified psychiatry' we propose and then operationalise two necessary steps: first, a formal multi-dimensional representation of disorder definition and clinical state, and second, the similar redefinition of outcomes as multidimensional constructs that can expose within- and between-patient differences in response. We use the categorical diagnosis of schizophrenia-conceptualised as a label for heterogeneous disorders-as a means of introducing operational definitions of stratified psychiatry using principles from multivariate analysis. We demonstrate this framework by application to the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness dataset, showing heterogeneity in both patient clinical states and their trajectories after treatment that are lost in the traditional categorical approach with composite outcomes. We then systematically review a decade of registered clinical trials for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia highlighting existing assumptions of categorical diagnoses and aggregate outcomes while identifying a small number of trials that could be reanalysed using our proposal.\nWe describe quantitative methods for the development of a multi-dimensional model of clinical state, disorders and trajectories which practically realises stratified psychiatry. We highlight the potential for recovering existing trial data, the implications for stratified psychiatry in trial design and clinical treatment and finally, describe different kinds of probabilistic reasoning tools necessary to implement stratification."}, {"Title": "Using medical specialty and selection criteria clusters to study specialty selection by Israeli medical students.", "Abstract": "During their final year of medical school, Israeli students must consider which specialty to choose for residency. Based on the vocational counseling literature we presumed that choices are made by selecting from a cluster of related specialties while considering professional and socio-economic issues.\nQuestionnaires distributed to final-year medical students at two Israeli medical schools ascertained inclinations toward various medical specialties and the importance of various selection criteria. Analysis focused on seven specialties where >20% of students reported they had positive inclinations. For each such specialty, the specialty and selection criteria query were compared using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests to determine differences between students with positive inclinations toward the specialty with those not so inclined. These data were placed in tables, with the significant differences highlighted to facilitate visual recognition of cluster patterns.\nCompleted questionnaires were obtained from 317 of 455 students. Students often had positive inclinations toward more than one specialty (specialty clusters) associated with a group of selection criteria (selection criteria clusters). For example, interest in internal medicine was clustered with interest in internal medicine subspecialties, cardiology and research. Furthermore, there was a \"reciprocal\" aspect to some specialty cluster patterns. For example, those interested in internal medicine had little interest in surgical specialties. Selection criteria clusters revealed occupational interests and socio-environmental factors associated with the specialty clusters. For example, family medicine, which clustered with pediatrics and psychiatry, had a sub-cluster of: Bedside specialty with family orientation affording long-term patient care. Another sub-cluster was time for childrearing and family, only daytime work and outpatient care. Clusters also revealed students' perceptions that differed from expected: Cardiology is changing from a cognitive to a procedure-oriented subspecialty, clustering not only with internal medicine and its subspecialties but also with emergency medicine, surgical subspecialties and anesthesiology.\nThe concept that career choice involves selecting from a cluster of related specialties provides information about the specialties students might be considering. Moreover, students are not only looking for individual aspects of a specialty, but for a package including clusters of socio-economic and occupational features. Practically, examining clusters can help in career counseling of medical students and assist residency program directors in marketing their specialties."}, {"Title": "[The Need of a New Integral Approach to the Care of Patient with Severe Mental Disorder Thirty Years after the Psychiatric Reform].", "Abstract": "More than thirty years have passed since the beginning of the psychiatric reform, a period of intense and relevant social, scientific and cultural changes which have directly impacted on mental disorders and their management.

Findings from a national patient registry.", "Abstract": "Cohort studies often report findings on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but may be biased by self-selection. The representativeness of cohort studies needs to be investigated to determine whether their findings can be generalised to the general child population. The aim of the present study was to examine the representativeness of child ADHD in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).\nThe study population was children born between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008 registered with hyperkinetic disorders (hereafter ADHD) in the Norwegian Patient Registry during the years 2008-2013, and two groups of children with ADHD were identified in: 1. MoBa and 2. The general child population. We used the multiaxial International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and compared the proportions of comorbid disorders (axes I-III), abnormal psychosocial situations (axis V) and child global functioning (axis VI) between these two groups. We also compared the relative differences in the multiaxial classifications for boys and girls and for children with/without axis I comorbidity, respectively in these two groups of children with ADHD.\nA total of 11 119 children were registered with ADHD, with significantly fewer in MoBa (1.45%) than the general child population (2.11%), p < 0.0001. The proportions of comorbid axis I, II, and III disorders were low, with no significant group differences. Compared with the general child population with ADHD, children with ADHD in MoBa were registered with fewer abnormal psychosocial situations (axis V: t = 7.63, p < .0001; d = -.18) and better child global functioning (axis VI: t = 7.93, p < 0.0001; d = .17). When analysing relative differences in the two groups, essentially the same patterns were found for boys and girls and for children with/without axis I comorbidity.\nSelf-selection was found to affect the proportions of ADHD, psychosocial adversity and child global functioning in the cohort. However, the differences from the general population were small. This indicates that studies on ADHD and multiaxial classifications in MoBa, as well as other cohort studies with similar self-selection biases, may have reasonable generalisability to the general child population."}, {"Title": "Capacity and consent: Knowledge and practice of legal and healthcare standards.", "Abstract": "Healthcare practitioners have a legal, ethical and professional obligation to obtain patient consent for all healthcare treatments. There is increasing evidence which suggests dissonance and variation in practice in assessment of decision-making capacity and consent processes.\nThis study explores healthcare practitioners' knowledge and practices of assessing decision-making capacity and obtaining patient consent to treatment in the acute generalist setting.\nAn exploratory descriptive cross-sectional survey design, using an online questionnaire, method was employed with all professional groups invited via email to participate. Data were collected over 3 months from July to September 2015. Survey content and format was reviewed by the liaison psychiatry team and subsequently contained five sections (demographics, general knowledge and practice, delirium context, legal aspects and education/training). Descriptive, univariate and bivariate analysis of quantitative data and qualitative content analysis of qualitative data were undertaken.\nThe study was approved by the institutional Human Research and Ethics Committee and informed consent was taken to be provided by participants upon completion and submission of the de-identified survey.\nIn total, 86 participants engaged the survey with n = 24, exiting at the first consent question. Almost two-thirds of respondents indicated that all treatments required patient consent. Knowledge of consent and decision-making capacity as legal constructs was deficient. Decision-making capacity was primarily assessed using professional judgement and perceived predominantly as the responsibility of medical and psychology staff. A range of patient psychological and behavioural symptoms were identified as indicators requiring assessment of decision-making capacity. Despite this, many patients with delirium have their decision-making capacity assessed and documented only sometimes. Uncertain knowledge and inconsistent application of legislative frameworks are evident. Many participants were unsure of the legal mechanisms for obtaining substitute consent in patients with impaired decision-making capacity and refusing treatment.\nThe legal context of decision-making capacity and consent to treatment appears complex for healthcare practitioners. Professional, ethical and legal standards of care in this context can benefit from structured education programmes and supportive governance processes.

In contrast, the odds of follow-up after substance use disorder ED discharges were lower among whites (seven-day follow-up) and among beneficiaries who qualified for Medicaid on the basis of disability rather than income, who were diagnosed as having drug use disorders rather than alcohol use disorders, or who lived in metropolitan versus suburban areas (seven- and 30-day follow-ups).\nState Medicaid programs have an opportunity to improve follow-up after ED visits for mental and substance use disorders, perhaps by focusing on groups of beneficiaries who are less likely to receive follow-up."}, {"Title": "A computational psychiatry approach identifies how alpha-2A noradrenergic agonist Guanfacine affects feature-based reinforcement learning in the macaque.", "Abstract": "Noradrenaline is believed to support cognitive flexibility through the alpha 2A noradrenergic receptor (a2A-NAR) acting in prefrontal cortex. Enhanced flexibility has been inferred from improved working memory with the a2A-NA agonist Guanfacine. But it has been unclear whether Guanfacine improves specific attention and learning mechanisms beyond working memory, and whether the drug effects can be formalized computationally to allow single subject predictions. We tested and confirmed these suggestions in a case study with a healthy nonhuman primate performing a feature-based reversal learning task evaluating performance using Bayesian and Reinforcement learning models. In an initial dose-testing phase we found a Guanfacine dose that increased performance accuracy, decreased distractibility and improved learning. In a second experimental phase using only that dose we examined the faster feature-based reversal learning with Guanfacine with single-subject computational modeling. Parameter estimation suggested that improved learning is not accounted for by varying a single reinforcement learning mechanism, but by changing the set of parameter values to higher learning rates and stronger suppression of non-chosen over chosen feature information. These findings provide an important starting point for developing nonhuman primate models to discern the synaptic mechanisms of attention and learning functions within the context of a computational neuropsychiatry framework."}, {"Title": "Hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity as a translational phenotype for schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Finding novel biological targets in psychiatry has been difficult, partly because current diagnostic categories are not defined by pathophysiology and difficult to model in animals. The study of species-conserved systems-level mechanisms implicated in psychiatric disease could be a promising strategy to address some of these difficulties. Altered hippocampal-prefrontal (HC-PFC) connectivity during working memory (WM) processing is a candidate for such a translational phenotype as it has been repeatedly associated with impaired cognition in schizophrenia patients and animal models for psychiatric risk factors. Specifically, persistent hippocampus-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (HC-DLPFC) coupling during WM is an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia that has been observed in patients, healthy relatives and carriers of two different risk polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies. Rodent studies report reduced coherence between HC and PFC during anesthesia, sleep and task performance in both genetic, environmental and neurodevelopmental models for schizophrenia. We discuss several challenges for translation including differences in anatomy, recording modalities and WM paradigms and suggest that a better understanding of HC-PFC coupling across species can be achieved if translational neuroimaging is used to control for task differences. The evidence for potential neurobiological substrates underlying HC-PFC dysconnectivity is evaluated and research strategies are proposed that aim to bridge the gap between findings from large-scale association studies and disease mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Microglia-derived neuregulin expression in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Several studies have revealed that neuregulins (NRGs) are involved in brain function and psychiatric disorders. While NRGs have been regarded as neuron- or astrocyte-derived molecules, our research has revealed that microglia also express NRGs, levels of which are markedly increased in activated microglia. Previous studies have indicated that microglia are activated in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Therefore, we investigated microglial NRG mRNA expression in multiple lines of mice considered models of ASD. Intriguingly, microglial NRG expression significantly increased in BTBR and socially-isolated mice, while maternal immune activation (MIA) mice exhibited identical NRG expression to controls. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between NRG expression in microglia and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in mice, suggesting that NRG expression in human PBMCs may mirror microglia-derived NRG expression in the human brain. To translate these findings for application in clinical psychiatry, we measured levels of NRG1 splice-variant expression in clinically available PBMCs of patients with ASD. Levels of NRG1 type III expression in PBMCs were positively correlated with impairments in social interaction in children with ASD (as assessed using the Autistic Diagnostic Interview-Revised test: ADI-R).

We calculated the proportion of people who had experienced a hospitalization with a duration of 292\u00a0days or more during the study period. A bivariate analysis was conducted, then ecological data (level of health-care offer, the deprivation index and the size of the municipalities of residence) were included into a multilevel regression model in order to identify the factors significantly related to variability of long-term hospitalization rates.\nAmong hospitalized individuals in psychiatry, 2.6% had had at least one hospitalization of 292\u00a0days or more during the observation period; the number of days in long-term hospitalization represented 22.5% of the total of days of full-time hospitalization in psychiatry. The bivariate analysis revealed that seniority in the psychiatric system was strongly correlated with long hospitalization rates. In the multivariate analysis, the individual indicators the most related to an increased risk of long-term hospitalization were: total lack of autonomy (OR=9.0; 95% CI: 6.7-12.2; P<001); diagnoses of psychological development disorders (OR=9.7; CI95%: 4.5-20.6; P<.001); mental retardation (OR=4.5; CI95%: 2.5-8.2; P<.001): schizophrenia (OR=3.0; CI95%: 1.7-5.2; P<.001); compulsory hospitalization (OR=1.7; CI95%: 1.4-2.1; P<.001); having experienced therapeutic isolation (OR=1.8; CI95%: 1.5-2.1; P<.001).

The only evidence-based treatment for these patients is clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic with relatively weak dopamine antagonism. It is plausible that varying degrees of response to antipsychotics reflect categorically distinct illness subtypes, which would have significant implications for research and clinical practice. If these subtypes could be distinguished at illness onset, this could represent a first step towards personalised medicine in psychiatry. This systematic review investigates whether current evidence supports conceptualising treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive schizophrenoa as categorically distinct subtypes.\nA systematic literature search was conducted, using PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL and OpenGrey databases, to identify all studies which compared treatment-resistant schizophrenia (defined as either a lack of response to two antipsychotic trials or clozapine prescription) to treatment-responsive schizophrenia (defined as known response to non-clozapine antipsychotics).\nNineteen studies of moderate quality met inclusion criteria. The most robust findings indicate that treatment-resistant patients show glutamatergic abnormalities, a lack of dopaminergic abnormalities, and significant decreases in grey matter compared to treatment-responsive patients. Treatment-resistant patients were also reported to have higher familial loading; however, no individual gene-association study reported their findings surviving correction for multiple comparisons.\nTentative evidence supports conceptualising treatment-resistant schizophrenia as a categorically different illness subtype to treatment-responsive schizophrenia.

However, a large range of communicative deficits in this population cannot be adequately explained by linguistic impairment. The review examines prosodic processing performance post-TBI, its relationship with injury severity, brain injury localization, recovery and co-occurring psychiatric or mental health issues post-TBI METHODS: A systematic review using several databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, LLBA (Linguistics and Language Behaviour Abstract) and Web of Science (January 1980 to May 2015), as well as a manual search of the cited references of the selected articles and the search cited features of PubMed was performed. The search was limited to comparative analyses between individuals who had a TBI and non-injured individuals (control). The review included studies assessing prosodic processing outcomes after TBI has been formally diagnosed. Articles that measured communication disorders, prosodic impairments, aphasia, and recognition of various aspects of prosody were included. Methods of summary included study characteristics, sample characteristics, demographics, auditory processing task, age at injury, brain localization of the injury, time elapsed since TBI, reports between TBI and mental health, socialization and employment difficulties. There were no limitations to the population size, age or gender. Results were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Two raters evaluated the quality of the articles in the search, extracted data using data abstraction forms and assessed the external and internal validity of the studies included using STROBE criteria. Agreement between the two raters was very high (Cohen's kappa\u2009=\u2009.89, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Results are reported according to the PRISMA guidelines.\nA systematic review of 5212 records between 1980 and 2015 revealed 206 potentially eligible studies and 8 case-control studies (3 perspective and 5 retrospective) met inclusion and exclusion criteria for content and quality. Performance on prosodic processing tasks was found to be impaired among all participants with a history of TBI (ages ranged from 8 to 70\u00a0years old), compared to those with no history of TBI, in all eight studies examined. Compared with controls, individuals with a history of TBI had statistically significantly slower reaction time in identifying emotions from prosody and impaired processing of prosodic information that is muffled, non-sense, competing, or in conflict (prosody versus semantics). Heterogeneous findings on correlations between specific brain locations and prosodic processing impairment were reported. Psychiatric issues, employment status or social integration post-TBI were scarcely reported but, when reported, they co-occurred with a history of TBI and prosodic impairments.\nThe current review confirms the relationship between impaired prosodic processing and history of TBI. Future studies should collect and report comprehensive details about severity of TBI, location of brain injury and time elapsed since injury, as they could key influence factors to the extent of prosodic processing impairments and recovery from auditory processing impairments post-TBI. The exploration of prosodic processing tasks as a possible neuropsychological marker of TBI diagnosis and recovery is warranted."}, {"Title": "Exploratory trials in mental health: anything to learn from other disciplines?", "Abstract": "Confirmatory randomised controlled trials require solid justifications, especially with regard to whether the experimental intervention is promising. Such evidence is generated in exploratory trials. However, empirical evidence shows that the quality of such trials is still suboptimal. More generally, the development process of healthcare interventions and especially of drugs, remains inefficient. Over the past 10-20\u2005years, a vast amount of methodological work has been published about exploratory trials. This overview introduces some of the concepts and recent developments in the field.\nA narrative approach was taken for this overview. This article focuses on study designs developed outside the mental health field to introduce concepts that might not be familiar to clinical researchers in psychiatry and psychology. Non-randomised and randomised exploratory trial designs are covered. The article ends with a brief discussion on pilot studies and their difference to exploratory studies.\nClassical designs for exploratory trials such as Simon's two-stage design still have a role. However, randomised exploratory trials are probably more suitable for mental health interventions. Newer, more flexible designs such as multistage, multiarm trials or platform trials have the potential to improve the efficiency of exploratory and subsequently confirmatory experiments.\nAlthough often not directly applicable, borrowing (study) design ideas from other medical disciplines has the potential to improve exploratory trials in the mental health field. At the same time, more explicit use of study designs specifically designed for exploratory trials will help to improve the transparency of such trials."}, {"Title": "Space and Objects: On the Phenomenology and Cognitive Neuroscience of Anomalous Perception in Schizophrenia (Ancillary Article to EAWE Domain 1).", "Abstract": "Perception of space and objects is a traditional focus within phenomenology, and disturbances in these aspects of perception among people with schizophrenia have long been discussed within phenomenological psychiatry. Despite this, there has been little empirical work on the causes and effects of most of these perceptual alterations in people with schizophrenia. Progress towards this goal can be accelerated by the use of EAWE (Examination of Anomalous World Experience), an interview-based tool to elicit, categorize, and quantify abnormal perceptual and other experiential phenomena.\nIn this brief paper, we review the main types of disturbances in space and object perception in schizophrenia - as described by phenomenologists, clinicians from other theoretical orientations, and experimental psychopathologists - as a first step in a research agenda to achieve a better integration of the clinical and experimental literatures.\nThis review indicates that in some cases the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms of altered space and object perception in schizophrenia are relatively well understood, while in other cases there exist only plausible hypotheses. In still other cases, however, almost nothing is known. Moreover, a fundamental hypothesis of phenomenological psychiatry - that perceptual changes are related to disturbances in the sense of self - has yet to be investigated actively. From this context, we offer suggestions for future research and suggest general research designs that may be useful for advancing progress in this area."}, {"Title": "Should we recommend exercise to adolescents with depressive symptoms? A meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in the potential role of exercise in the reduction of depressive symptoms. The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine whether exercise reduces depressive symptoms amongst depressed adolescents. The following databases were searched on 30 January 2015: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SPORTDiscuss and PUBMED. Studies were included if they examined exercise interventions amongst adolescents with clinical levels of depressive symptoms, were published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language and contained a control/comparison group. Of 6631 retrieved studies, eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model due to the high level of heterogeneity identified amongst studies ( I <sup>2</sup> = 65.1, P < .005). The analysis revealed a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms post-intervention (Hedge's g = -0.61, P = .007). This analysis provides preliminary evidence that exercise is effective in reducing symptoms of depression among adolescents with clinical levels of depressive symptoms. The present meta-analysis, however, is limited by the generally low quality of included studies, high level of between-study heterogeneity and restriction of inclusion criteria to published studies. Further high-quality trials with depressed adolescents are needed to determine the efficacy of exercise in the reduction of depressive symptoms and the exercise parameters associated with the antidepressant effects of exercise."}, {"Title": "A comparison of two psychiatric service approaches: findings from the Consultation vs. Liaison Psychiatry-Study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric comorbidities are common in somatically ill patients. There is a lack of data that can provide clear insights into substantial comparative advantages of different Consultation/Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) services.\nThe Consultation versus Liaison Psychiatry-Study collected and analyzed data of 890 primarily somatically ill hospital inpatients presenting with psychiatric symptoms in a prospective observational study design. One group was treated via a liaison-model (LM) with regular consultation hours, the other via an on-demand-model (ODM) with individually requested consultations.\nFive hundred forty-five LM and 345 ODM patients were compared. Patients in the LM were, on average, older compared to the patients of the ODM. The vast majority (90.8%) of individuals for whom a psychiatric consultation was requested came from internal medicine. The most common diagnoses were affective disorders (39.3%), organic mental disorders (18.9%), alcohol-induced mental disorders (11.3%) and reactions to severe stress/adjustment disorders (10.4%). Organic mental disorders were significantly more common in patients seen in the LM (24.0% vs. 10.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) while affective disorders were more frequently diagnosed in the ODM (46.6% vs. 34.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Patients seen in the ODM were, on average, more severely affected compared to patients seen in the LM and required more extensive treatment. 16.3% of ODM patients were regarded as potentially suicidal; among these, 3.5% were acutely suicidal and 12.8% latently suicidal. Any form of further treatment was required by 93.0% of ODM patients compared to 77.8% in the LM. Pharmacological treatment with benzodiazepines, usually used as short-term treatment, was more frequently prescribed to patients seen in the ODM while patients seen in the LM were more often started on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, indicative of long-term treatment.\nPatients in need of less acute treatment were considerably less common in the ODM. The data indicate a possible risk of such patients to remain unrecognized.

We undertook a systematic meta-analysis of data from task-fMRI studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control differences on brain activation. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case-control differences derived from 537 task-fMRI studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. The fMRI tasks were classified according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We investigated whether diagnosis, RDoC domain or construct and use of regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the neuroanatomical pattern of results. When considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of RDoC domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole-brain studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or RDoC domain or construct. These results resonate with prior reports of common brain structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and caution against attributing undue specificity to brain functional changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders.

These observations, in combination with other lines of research, suggest that psychosis may be a syndrome of accelerated aging. But do patients with psychosis perform poorly on tasks of processing speed for the same reasons as older adults? Fifty-one patients with psychotic illnesses and 90 controls with similar mean IQ (aged 19-69 years, all African American) completed a computerized processing-speed task, reminiscent of the classic digit-symbol coding task. The data were analyzed using the drift-diffusion model (DDM), and Bayesian inference was used to determine whether psychosis and aging had similar or divergent effects on the DDM parameters. Psychosis and aging were both associated with poor performance, but had divergent effects on the DDM parameters. Patients had lower information-processing efficiency (\"drift rate\") and longer nondecision time than controls, and psychosis per se did not influence response caution. By contrast, the primary effect of aging was to increase response caution, and had inconsistent effects on drift rate and nondecision time across patients and controls. The results reveal that psychosis and aging influenced performance in different ways, suggesting that the processing-speed impairment in psychosis is more than just accelerated aging.

Most research has, however, studied compassion fatigue rather than compassion itself and has concentrated on the role of the physician. The Transactional Model of Physician Compassion suggests that physician, patient, external environment, and clinical factors are all relevant. Because these factors vary both across different specialities and among physicians with differing degrees of experience, barriers to compassion are also likely to vary.\nWe describe barriers to physician compassion as a function of specialization (psychiatry, general practice, surgery, internal medicine, and pediatrics) and physician experience.\nWe used a cross-sectional study using demographic data, specialization, practice parameters, and the Barriers to Physician Compassion Questionnaire. Nonrandom convenience sampling was used to recruit 580 doctors, of whom 444 belonged to the targeted speciality groups.

Participatory bioethics recognizes that research co-produced with stakeholders is more likely to have impact on healthcare practice. These approaches aim to engage multiple stakeholders and interested partners throughout the whole research process, including the framing of ideas and research questions, so that outcomes are tailored to the interests and context, and the type of impact stakeholders envisage. There is an emphasis on realizing social change through the conduct (not merely the results) of the research, and it is believed that the engagement of stakeholders in the research process will promote their intrinsic motivation to change their practice. Another distinctive feature of participatory bioethics research is that its central normative commitment is to reflection and dialogue, not to a particular substantive ethical approach. In reflection and dialogue there is an emphasis on inclusion and the co-production of knowledge. Furthermore, empirical and normative research are combined, and there is a deliberate attempt to give voice to otherwise marginalized positions. This provides a model of social impact which is relevant not only for bioethics research, but also for other areas of health care research.

In the present report, the consistency of treatment effect across three geographic regions (Europe, United States/Canada [US/Can], and Latin America [Latin Am]) was explored. Data were analyzed from a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, maintenance-of-response (randomized withdrawal) trial of atomoxetine versus placebo in adults with ADHD. Patients were randomized to atomoxetine (N\u00a0=\u00a0266) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0258) for 25\u00a0weeks. Consistency assessments included the interaction test, pairwise t tests, noninferiority, and the criteria from Basic Principles on Global Clinical Trials (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan 2007). Atomoxetine-treated patients maintained the improved ADHD symptoms relative to placebo-treated patients on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Investigator-Rated: Screening Version 18-Item (CAARS-Inv:SV) total score in all three regions (atomoxetine-placebo mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0-4.55, -3.18, and -0.07 for Europe, US/Can, and Latin Am, respectively). For the Latin Am region, the mean change in total score (0.41) was notably smaller for the placebo group than for Europe (5.87) and US/Can (4.39). Similar results were observed for the CAARS-Inv:SV hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention subscale scores. Overall, patients maintained the response with atomoxetine treatment compared to placebo; however, the magnitude of treatment effect differed among the regions studied, being numerically higher in the EU and US/Can than Latin Am.

Evidence supporting the value added to a recovery-oriented mental health facility is lacking.\nThe goal of this project was to implement and customize a fully integrated EMR system in a specialized, recovery-oriented mental health care facility. This evaluation examined the outcomes of quality improvement initiatives driven by the EMR to determine the value that the EMR brought to the organization.\nThe setting was a tertiary-level mental health facility in Ontario, Canada. Clinical informatics and decision support worked closely with point-of-care staff to develop workflows and documentation tools in the EMR. The primary initiatives were implementation of modules for closed loop medication administration, collaborative plan of care, clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia, restraint minimization, the infection prevention and control surveillance status board, drug of abuse screening, and business intelligence.\nMedication and patient scan rates have been greater than 95% since April 2014, mitigating the adverse effects of medication errors. Specifically, between April 2014 and March 2015, only 1 moderately severe and 0 severe adverse drug events occurred. The number of restraint incidents decreased 19.7%, which resulted in cost savings of more than Can $1.4 million (US $1.0 million) over 2 years. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia increased adherence to evidence-based practices, standardizing care across the facility. Improved infection prevention and control surveillance reduced the number of outbreak days from 47 in the year preceding implementation of the status board to 7 days in the year following. Decision support to encourage preferential use of the cost-effective drug of abuse screen when clinically indicated resulted in organizational cost savings.\nEMR implementation allowed Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences to use data analytics to identify and select appropriate quality improvement initiatives, supporting patient-centered, recovery-oriented practices and providing value at the clinical, organizational, and societal levels."}, {"Title": "Unraveling the Neurobiology of Sleep and Sleep Disorders Using Drosophila.", "Abstract": "Sleep disorders in humans are increasingly appreciated to be not only widespread but also detrimental to multiple facets of physical and mental health. Recent work has begun to shed light on the mechanistic basis of sleep disorders like insomnia, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy, and a host of others, but a more detailed genetic and molecular understanding of how sleep goes awry is lacking. Over the past 15 years, studies in Drosophila have yielded new insights into basic questions regarding sleep function and regulation. More recently, powerful genetic approaches in the fly have been applied toward studying primary human sleep disorders and other disease states associated with dysregulated sleep. In this review, we discuss the contribution of Drosophila to the landscape of sleep biology, examining not only fundamental advances in sleep neurobiology but also how flies have begun to inform pathological sleep states in humans."}, {"Title": "Secondary psychotic features in refugees diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder: a retrospective cohort study.", "Abstract": "A substantial amount of refugees (10-30%) suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In Denmark there are different facilities specialised in psychiatric treatment of trauma-affected refugees. A previously published case report from such a facility in Denmark shows that some patients suffer from secondary psychotic symptoms alongside their PTSD. The aim of this study was to illustrate the characteristics and estimate the prevalence of psychotic features in a clinical population of trauma-affected refugees with PTSD.\nPsychiatric records from 220 consecutive patients at Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP) were examined, and all the PTSD patients were divided into two groups; one group with secondary psychotic features (PTSD-SP group) and one without (PTSD group). A categorisation and description of the secondary psychotic features was undertaken.\nOne hundred eighty-one patients were diagnosed with PTSD among which psychotic symptoms were identified in 74 (40.9, 95% CI 33.7-48.1%). The majority of symptoms identified were auditory hallucinations (66.2%) and persecutory delusions (50.0%). There were significantly more patients diagnosed with enduring personality change after catastrophic experience in the PTSD-SP group than in the PTSD group (P\u2009=\u20090.009). Furthermore the PTSD-SP group included significantly more patients exposed to torture (P\u2009=\u20090.001) and imprisonment (P\u2009=\u20090.005).\nThis study provides an estimation of PTSD-SP prevalence in a clinical refugee population with PTSD. The study points to the difficulties distinguishing psychotic features from flashbacks and the authors call for attention to psychotic features in PTSD patients in order to improve documentation and understanding of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Varieties of Voice-Hearing: Psychics and the Psychosis Continuum.", "Abstract": "Hearing voices that are not present is a prominent symptom of serious mental illness. However, these experiences may be common in the non-help-seeking population, leading some to propose the existence of a continuum of psychosis from health to disease. Thus far, research on this continuum has focused on what is impaired in help-seeking groups. Here we focus on protective factors in non-help-seeking voice-hearers. We introduce a new study population: clairaudient psychics who receive daily auditory messages. We conducted phenomenological interviews with these subjects, as well as with patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who hear voices, people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder who do not hear voices, and matched control subjects (without voices or a diagnosis). We found the hallucinatory experiences of psychic voice-hearers to be very similar to those of patients who were diagnosed. We employed techniques from forensic psychiatry to conclude that the psychics were not malingering. Critically, we found that this sample of non-help-seeking voice hearers were able to control the onset and offset of their voices, that they were less distressed by their voice-hearing experiences and that, the first time they admitted to voice-hearing, the reception by others was much more likely to be positive. Patients had much more negative voice-hearing experiences, were more likely to receive a negative reaction when sharing their voices with others for the first time, and this was subsequently more disruptive to their social relationships. We predict that this sub-population of healthy voice-hearers may have much to teach us about the neurobiology, cognitive psychology and ultimately the treatment of voices that are distressing."}, {"Title": "Reassessing biopsychosocial psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry uncomfortably spans biological and psychosocial perspectives on mental illness, an idea central to Engel's biopsychosocial paradigm.

The study of idioms of distress arose out of work done in India (Nichter in Cult Med Psychiatry 5(4):379-408, 1981), but ironically, little subsequent work has systematically explored idioms of distress in this part of the world. This ethnographic study focused on the term tension (ten\u015ban) and its relation to a cultural syndrome among women in urban North India. This syndrome appears to involve rapid-onset anger, irritation, rumination, and sleeplessness as key symptoms. It is often linked to specific circumstances such as domestic conflict and is associated with the stresses of modern urban life. People who report more symptoms of tension had consistently higher scores on the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 for depression and anxiety. In this cultural context where psychiatric care is highly stigmatized, the language of tension can aid providers of mental healthcare (many of whom, in India, are not psychiatrists or psychologists) to identify and communicate effectively with potential patients whose mental healthcare needs might otherwise go unaddressed."}, {"Title": "Abnormal brain oscillations persist after recovery from bipolar depression.", "Abstract": "When directly perturbed in healthy subjects, premotor cortical areas generate electrical oscillations in the beta range (20-40Hz). In schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (BD), these oscillations are markedly reduced, in terms of amplitude and frequency. However, it still remains unclear whether these abnormalities can be modulated over time, or if they can be still observed after treatment. Here, we employed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with EEG to assess the frontal oscillatory activity in eighteen BD patients before/after antidepressant treatments (sleep deprivation and light therapy), relative to nine healthy controls. In order to detect dominant frequencies, event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were computed for each TMS/EEG session in all participants, using wavelet decomposition. The natural frequency at which the cortical circuit oscillates was calculated as the frequency value with the largest power across 300ms post-stimulus time interval. Severity of depression markedly decreased after treatment with 12\u00a0patients achieving response and nine patients achieving remission. TMS/EEG resulted in a significant activation of the beta/gamma band response (21-50Hz) in healthy controls. In patients, the main frequencies of premotor EEG responses to TMS did not significantly change before/after treatment and were always significantly lower than those of controls (11-27Hz) and comparable in patients achieving remission and in those not responding to treatment. These results suggest that the reduction of natural frequencies is a trait marker of BD, independent from the clinical status of the patients. The present findings shed light on the neurobiological underpinning of severe psychiatric disorders and demonstrate that TMS/EEG represents a unique tool to develop biomarkers in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Can video interventions be used to effectively destigmatize mental illness among young people? A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Video is considered to be an effective, easy to use tool employed in anti-stigma interventions among young people. Mass media has been shown to be effective for reducing stigma; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine the destigmatization effects of videos specifically. This article systematically reviews the effectiveness of video intervention in reducing stigma among young people between 13 and 25 years. We searched 13 electronic databases including randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized controlled trials, and controlled before and after studies. Of the 1426 abstracts identified, 23 studies (reported in 22 papers) met the inclusion criteria. Video interventions led to improvements in stigmatising attitudes. Video was found to be more effective than other interventions, such as classical face-to-face educational sessions or simulation of hallucinations. According to results of two studies, social contact delivered via video achieved similar destigmatization effect to that delivered via a live intervention. Although the quality of studies as well as the form of video interventions varied, the findings suggest that video is a promising destigmatization tool among young people; however, more studies in this area are needed. There was a lack of evidence for interventions outside of school environments, in low- and middle-income countries, and studies, which looked at long-term outcomes or measured impact on actual behaviour and implicit attitudes. The review generates recommendations for video interventions targeted at young people."}, {"Title": "[Geriatric psychiatry and dementia].", "Abstract": "Behavioural disorders linked to dementia are common.

After determining the proportion of participants with and without MDD (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), the authors compared groups on demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics, including the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS). Logistic regression was used to test the association of these characteristics with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD.\nMost (57%) participants did not have MDD. This group was older (69.4 versus 64.7, p<.001), had a larger proportion of white participants (82% versus 56%, p<.001), and reported better physical (PCS, 43.4 versus 39.9, p=.03) and emotional (MCS, 40.2 versus 30.5, p<.001) well-being compared with the group with MDD. In the final regression model, white race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.11, p=.03) and better emotional well-being (AOR=1.16, p<.001) were associated with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD.\nOlder adults prescribed antidepressants in the absence of MDD did not report similar distress levels compared with their counterparts with MDD.

A queuing simulation was used to predict the potential benefits of additional clinical personnel on patient flow through a psychiatric emergency service (PES).\nA discrete-event simulation model was calibrated on the basis of two months of data collected in a PES. This model examined the effects of adding between .5 (half-time) and three additional providers to the 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift.\nThe model showed that an addition of a half-time clinician produced the biggest change in patient flow metrics. Average length of stay was predicted to drop from 38.1 hours to 33.2 hours for patients who were awaiting hospitalization and from 13.7 to 9.0 hours for patients who were eventually discharged. The number of patients waiting to see a provider decreased by two-thirds between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., and it decreased by one-half during the rest of the day, even though the number of clinical staff remained the same. Adding more providers failed to reduce these numbers much further. Adding more than a half-time provider also failed to significantly reduce boarding (remaining in the PES while awaiting hospitalization).\nQueuing simulation predicted a dramatic benefit to patient flow with a fairly small addition in clinician time, a benefit that persisted beyond the time during which the additional staff was on duty, especially when this staff was added during a period of high demand."}, {"Title": "Mavoglurant Augmentation in OCD Patients Resistant to Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: A Proof-of-Concept, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 2 Study.", "Abstract": "To determine if mavoglurant (modified release) as an augmentation therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) could have beneficial effects reducing Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resistant to SSRI treatment.\nThis was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study.

The study provides an overview of the current situation using a systematic literature review of published studies from the European and the outer European regions between 2005 and 2015. In summary only twelve publications addressed the topic, differentiated in four studies from inner and eight studies from outer European countries. In the studies from Europe, girls in their late adolescence experienced coercive measures more often, whereas the outer European studies identified more boys in early school age. Regarding the diagnoses of the respective patients, no distinct trend could be identified, as coercive measures were applied with a range of different diagnoses. In the European studies, coercive measures were more often used with children and adolescents fitting in the ICD-10-category F9. Results point to a lack of empirical studies concerning coercive measures in the context of child and adolescent psychiatry. Besides, clinical practice between the countries varies tremendously, resulting in difficulties comparing the findings. One possibility to address these issues might be a central register for every kind of coercive measure, as it was introduced in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg lately and is currently in development for North Rhine-Westphalia."}, {"Title": "[Institutionalized and Individual Crisis Intervention Between Youth Welfare and Adolescent Psychiatry, Specified for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees].", "Abstract": "Institutionalized and Individual Crisis Intervention Between Youth Welfare and Adolescent Psychiatry, Specified for Unaccompanied Minor Refugees Minor refugees put a challenge to the intercultural openness, including an abdication from diagnostic schemes.

To address this question, I use the perspective of regulation theory to offer a model of the deeper psychoneurobiological mechanisms that underlie the vulnerability of the developing male. The central thesis of this work dictates that significant gender differences are seen between male and female social and emotional functions in the earliest stages of development, and that these result from not only differences in sex hormones and social experiences but also in rates of male and female brain maturation, specifically in the early developing right brain. I present interdisciplinary research which indicates that the stress-regulating circuits of the male brain mature more slowly than those of the female in the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal critical periods, and that this differential structural maturation is reflected in normal gender differences in right-brain attachment functions. Due to this maturational delay, developing males also are more vulnerable over a longer period of time to stressors in the social environment (attachment trauma) and toxins in the physical environment (endocrine disruptors) that negatively impact right-brain development. In terms of differences in gender-related psychopathology, I describe the early developmental neuroendocrinological and neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in the increased vulnerability of males to autism, early onset schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorders as well as the epigenetic mechanisms that can account for the recent widespread increase of these disorders in U.S. culture. I also offer a clinical formulation of early assessments of boys at risk, discuss the impact of early childcare on male psychopathogenesis, and end with a neurobiological model of optimal adult male socioemotional functions."}, {"Title": "Neurofeedback: One of today's techniques in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Neurofeedback is a technique that aims to teach a subject to regulate a brain parameter measured by a technical interface to modulate his/her related brain and cognitive activities.

It evaluates how civil commitment criteria, functional status, institutional constraints, social bias, and procedural justice indicators are likely to impact denial of care decisions, and considers 12 month outcomes.\nPES evaluations of 583 patients in 9 California county general hospitals were examined via logit modeling to determine those factors contributing to the decision to deny access to inpatient care. Differences in the importance of influences on the decision making process and outcomes at 12 months are examined in two contrasts: first, admitted and released patients seeking care, then, the latter group versus all other patients. Outcome measures include numbers of deaths, violent crimes, and involuntary readmissions to the PES.\nOf the patients evaluated, 8.4 % were denied access to inpatient care despite their avowed wish to be hospitalized. When compared to admitted patients seeking hospitalization or to all other patients, analyses show that clinicians relied on civil commitment admission criteria and the availability of a less restrictive alternative to the hospital in making decisions on patient retention. When compared with all other patients, the probability of unwanted release was greater for individuals evaluated in difficult circumstances, for those without insurance, and for those with higher functional status. Fewer deaths were observed in the group denied admission, though no other significant outcome differences were observed.\nDangerousness and mental disorder in the absence of a less restrictive alternative to hospitalization, along with an overall assessment of the patient's functional status, are effectively employed as triage criteria in determining who is denied access to inpatient care following PES evaluation. While some higher functioning individuals are subjected to a variant standard of access to inpatient care because of a lack of insurance, and endure the misfortune of being evaluated under difficult clinical circumstances, outcomes seem contingent on clinicians' ability to distinguish between groups on the aforementioned triage criteria."}, {"Title": "The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guideline on the Use of Antipsychotics to Treat Agitation or Psychosis in Patients With Dementia.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted with permission from <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2016; 173:543-546)."}, {"Title": "VITAMIN D STATUS IN PATIENTS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF SINGLE COHORT FROM ROUTINE PRACTICE.", "Abstract": "Clinical research suggests that vitamin D deficiency correlates with mental illnesses.\nThe aim was to prove that the patients from the psychiatric health care service in Serbia had higher vitamin D deficiency than patients from general practice.\nThe study had a cross-sectional design.\nThe study included 47 patients aged 19 - 76 of both sexes with different mental disorders.

In order to achieve this, it is important to promote close cooperation between occupational physicians and psychiatrists. The aim of the stress check system in Japan is the primary prevention of mental disor- ders.

This might have a strong negative effect on their emotional and social functioning as well as on their school lives. Physical inter- vention should be considered for such adolescents ; however, gender identity can also fluctuate during that period. Therefore, it is difficult to use cross-sex hormone therapy as a way to mas- culinize or feminize the body for early adolescents, because such hormones have partially irre- versible effects. Worldwide, puberty suppression therapy is recommended for such pubescent children, as it is recognized as reversible physical intervention. For puberty suppression, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa), which stop luteinizing hormone secretion, are used. This consequently stops the secretion of testosterone in genetically male patients and production of estrogens and progesterone in genetically female patients ; as a result, the physi- cal changes of puberty are delayed. When GnRHa is stopped, the progress of puberty restarts. This therapy is also mentioned in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Guidelines for Patients with Gender Identity Disorder (The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurol- ogy). According to those guidelines, we can use this therapy for early adolescents after they have reached Tanner Stage 2. Although this intervention is new to Japan, there is some evi- dence from other countries supporting such applications. Furthermore, in Japan, pediatric endocrinologists have used GnRHa for young patients with precocious puberty for a long period of time, and this has proved the safety of this treatment for children. More experience and data in this area are needed. Furthermore, we have to establish closer cooperation with child mental health specialists, such as pediatric psychiatrists, school counselors, and teachers, so that proper treatment may begin at the right time for more patients. Psychotherapy or psy- chosocial support, on its own, is sometimes not enough to reduce the physical dysphoria of transgender patients, and the innate sex steroids also have irreversible effects on gender dys- phoric children. When we decide not to intervene in cases of gender dysphoric children with hormonal treatments including puberty suppression, we are actually deciding to intervene by leaving them with their inherent hormones. We have to be conscious of the fact that\"withhold- ing puberty suppression and subsequent feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy is not a neutral option for adolescents (Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People, Version 7).\""}, {"Title": "[Gender Dysphoria in Children in Clinical Practice of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender. Clinical pictures of GD in children show marked diversity. Because of their limited ability to express themselves verbally, children with GD might not be able to describe their discomfort or distress about this incongruence. In contrast to GD in adulthood, GD in children could be alleviated in the natural course. Thus, the clinical diagnosis of GD in children should be made carefully. Distortion of gender identity is equal to prominent confusion of identity, and has a huge psychological burden on children with GD. In addition to the distress due to dysphoria about gender, children with GD could suffer from bullying at school, loneliness among school peers or even in their family, and feelings of disgust about their physical appearance that could cause decreased self-esteem and a sense of worthlessness. In 2015, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan encouraged all school teachers to provide appropriate support at school to sexual minor- ity students, including students with GD. Furthermore, MEXT published a manual for school teachers to promote necessary interventions for such students at school. There are several papers reporting child cases of GD and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Among them, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the common comorbidities. Reflecting these conditions, recent review articles discuss possible associations between GD and ASD. In this paper, based on the first author's clinical experience, we describe the clinical symp- toms and diagnosis of GD in children, the relationship between GD and ASD, gender-related manifestations observed in ASD, and practical support for children with GD entering primary school."}, {"Title": "[A Questionnaire-based Study of Child Psychiatrists and Clinical Psychologists Regarding and Support for Children with Gender Identity Disorder and Sexual Problems].", "Abstract": "In 2010, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in Japan strongly recommended that students with gender identity disorder (GID) who had behavioral health concerns should consult a professional in their schools. Furthermore, in 2015, MEXT subsequently announced that it is important for sexual minority students, including students with GID, to receive more support from professionals through cooperation with medical institutions. However, there has been no nationwide clinical research done on sexual minority youth, so little is known about how to optimally care for them in medical practice. This study assessed the current status of medical care for children and adolescents with GID and other atypical sexual development. The authors surveyed certifying physicians and councilors (315 people in total) of The Japanese Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The question obtained basic demographic and practice information and allowed for free responses on topics such as opinion on consultation and medical care for GID and atypical sex- ual development in childhood and adolescence. One hundred twenty-seven, or 40.3%, of those surveyed responded. The average number of years of total clinical experience was 23.9, and the average number of years of child psychiatric clinical experience was 18.8 years. The number of child psychiatrists who provided con- sultation for GID and other sexual development including transvestism and gender dysphoria were 88 (68.5%) and 105 (81.9%), respectively. The consultants' most frequent clients, in descending order, were: individuals, parents, and school officials. Seventy-four (57.5%) child psychiatrists provide medical care for patients with GID. In the preschool and elementary school age groups, consultants served many more (assignment) males than (assignment) females with GID, whereas in the higher elementary school and later ages, consultants served more females than males with GID equally often. In junior high school and later ages, consultants served more females than males with GID. Eighty-seven (67.7%) of the child psychiatrists provided medical care for patients with other sexual development. Before and during the mid- dle elementary school ages and in the high school ages, consultants served more males than females with other typical development, whereas in higher grade elementary and junior high school ages, consultants served more females than males with other typical development. The free response sections revealed a diversity of opinions, clinical course, and cooperation with other institutions. At present, among child psychiatrists, there are many different perspectives on clinical care for GID and other sexual development. Therefore, it will be necessary to systematically examine current scientific evidence and to establish consensus on best practices for clinical management."}, {"Title": "[The Impact of NICE Guidance on UK Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is a non-departmental public body accountable to the Department of Health. NICE was established in 1999 in an attempt to reduce variability in the availability and quality of medical services in NHS to end the so-called postcode lottery. Since its establishment NICE has acquired an international reputation for the development of high quality, evidence-based clinical guidelines. NICE also makes cost-benefit assessments of certain technologies on the basis of effectiveness and cost effectiveness. In order to develop a NICE guideline related to psychiatry, the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health establishes a Guideline Development Group that consists of technical experts, health and/or social care professionals, and lay representatives. The group searches for and evaluates the available evidence and formulates a series of clinical recommen- dations following which stakeholders are consulted and revisions occur. As well as providing treatment recommendations for healthcare professionals, the guidelines are also intended to inform patients, helping them make decisions and improving communication between patients and healthcare staff, and also to direct the focus of research. To date, NICE has published guidance on antenatal and postnatal mental health, antisocial personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, dementia, depression, depression in children and young people, drug misuse (opioid detoxification and psychological interventions), eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, schizophrenia, and the management of self-harm. We describe how, both directly through education and effects on clinical pathways, and indirectly through effects on health providers and patient behavior, NICE guidance has had an impact on psychiatrists working in UK."}, {"Title": "[Medical Professionalism: A Thread of Guidance for Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "It is considered that professionalism is a virtue as a personal attribute, competency is an observable behavior, and professional identity formation is a form of socialization. Social accountability is believed to be an important attribute of medical professionalism. A true professional struggles with complicated and/or ambiguous clinical problems of our modern society, and he/she grows up in the course of managing such difficult cases with iterative reflection. A reflective practitioner is someone who can practice in such a way. A reflective practitioner dealing with social problems is a true professional. Significant Event Analysis (SEA) is one of most valuable learning strategies to become a reflective practitioner."}, {"Title": "[The International Study of Burnout Syndrome among Psychiatric Trainees (BoSS International) : Findings from Statistical Analysis of the Japanese Data (BoSS Japan)].", "Abstract": "Burnout is a psychological condition that may occur after being exposed to excessive and prolonged work-related stresses. Previous studies have demonstrated that the rate of burnout among physicians may be higher compared to other occupations ; and espe- cially psychiatric trainees would have a higher risk of burnout because of limited clinical expe- rience, the burden of heavy duties and longer work-hours etc. In this study, we report the findings from Japanese data obtained as part of the international study of burnout syndrome among psychiatric trainees (BoSS International).\nThis study was initiated by members of the European Federation of Psychiatric Trainees (EFPT) and the European Psychiatric Association-European Early Career Psychia- trists (EPA-EECP). The total number of participating nations was 22 countries. A national coordinator recruited study collaborators all over Japan and psychiatric trainees working at their medical institutes were invited to participate in BoSS International by e-mail. The sub- jects were requested to answer the on-line questionnaire anonymously. Consent was obtained when making a list of potential participants at each institute and reconfirmed on the first page of the on-line questionnaire. Answering the questionnaire was deemed to constitute consent.\nTotal number of participants to BoSS International was 7,525 from 22 countries and regions. Of them, 1,980 psychiatric trainees fully completed answering the questionnaire (response rate (RR) 26.0%) including 95 Japanese trainees (RR 41.5%). The mean age of 95 Japanese psychiatric trainees (male rate 67.4%) enrolled in BoSS International was 31.8?4.8 year-old. Their mean clinical experience was 2.9 ?4.4 years. The mean weekly working hours were 72.3?27.1, which was the longest of the 22 participating countries/regions ; while weekly clinical supervision by a mentor was only 3.8?9.0 hours. Regarding the severity of burnout, assessed by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) consisting of three factors (emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and low sense of professional efficacy): 41 Japanese psychiatric trainees (42.0%) meet the criteria of severe burnout syndrome in this study ; with emotional exhaustion scores of 2.20 and higher, and cynicism of 2.00 and higher. Signifi- cant differences were found on the PHQ-9 score and mean length of supervision between those participants with presence and absence of severe burnout syndrome by using Student's t-test.\nStatistical analyses of the whole data (n=1,980) revealed that the risk of burnout was higher for trainees who were younger, without children, and had not opted for psychiatry as a first career choice. Further analyses after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and country difference still demonstrated severe burnout was associated with long working hours, less supervision, and not having regular rest. The analyses of Japanese data showed similar tendencies, although statistical significance was not observed. Burnout among psychiatry trainees may be linked to drop-out from the training program and malprac- tice in clinical settings. We should be aware of the higher risk of burnout in residents and the importance of regular and sufficient supervision to prevent burnout."}, {"Title": "Between the Mind Twist and the Brain Spot. The Material Dimensions of Psychopathology in the Work of Elmer Ernest Southard .", "Abstract": "This paper explores the material and visual practices that defined studies of psychopathology in early twentieth-century American medicine, through a close look at the work of neuropathologist Elmer E. Southard (1876\u20131920). As a discipline sitting at the intersection between laboratory and clinical practice, neuropathology has received little attention from historians of the brain sciences. Unlike the neurologist, who was interested in treating patients and saving lives, the neuropathologist often encountered patients following death, and studied the brain for signs of pathology during autopsy. Trained in a German tradition of laboratory pathology, Southard has been cast as a somaticist with respect to psychopathology. By examining Southard\u2019s medical and philosophical writings, I present a more nuanced analysis of the role of brain pathology in Southard\u2019s vision of disease etiology, his views on the foundations of psychiatry, as well as a more vivid picture of the sorts of material practices that defined the work of the neuropathologist."}, {"Title": "Pediatric residents' attitudes and practice patterns regarding transition to adult-oriented care.", "Abstract": "Most youth with chronic illness will survive into adulthood. The complexity of the medical history and care in these patients necessitates a well-planned and coordinated transition over several years as they move from pediatric to adult-oriented health care.\nWe assessed pediatric residents' practice patterns and attitudes regarding transition communication by administering a survey about transition to pediatric, combined internal medicine-pediatrics, pediatric neurology, and combined psychiatry-child psychiatry-pediatric residents.\nAmong 110 residents who were contacted, 66 completed the survey, for a response rate of 61%. Surveyed residents report discussing transition with their patients when their patients are age 18 or older, when guidelines suggest a discussion should begin around age 12. Most residents felt that transition should be initially addressed one year prior to transfer. Residents also reported barriers such as lack of experience with transition and lack of role modeling by supervisors as barriers to providing transitional care.\nThe practice patterns and attitudes of pediatric residents in this study do not reflect the recommendations that have been published regarding transitional care services to prepare patients and families for transfer from pediatric to adult-oriented care. In particular, most residents report that they start transition discussions when a patient is near the age of 18, rather than the age of 12 as guidelines suggest and as families would prefer. Pediatric residents need further education regarding transition, with particular emphasis on the need for early and frequent discussions with patients and families regarding transition."}, {"Title": "Animal roles and traces in the history of medicine, <i>c.</i>1880-1980.", "Abstract": "This paper argues for the need to create a more animal-centred history of medicine, in which animals are considered not simply as the backdrop for human history, but as medical subjects important in and of themselves. Drawing on the tools and approaches of animal and human-animal studies, it seeks to demonstrate, via four short historical vignettes, how investigations into the ways that animals shaped and were shaped by medicine enables us to reach new historical understandings of both animals and medicine, and of the relationships between them. This is achieved by turning away from the much-studied fields of experimental medicine and public health, to address four historically neglected contexts in which diseased animals played important roles: zoology/pathology, parasitology/epidemiology, ethology/psychiatry, and wildlife/veterinary medicine. Focusing, in turn, on species that rarely feature in the history of medicine - big cats, tapeworms, marsupials and mustelids - which were studied, respectively, within the zoo, the psychiatric hospital, human-animal communities and the countryside, we reconstruct the histories of these animals using the traces that they left on the medical-historical record."}, {"Title": "Update Psychopharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "Despite unmet meeds regarding efficacy, tolerability and time of onset and the high importance of mental disorders very few new psychotropics have been introduced in Germany recently. Lurasidon and the new multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine demonstrating clinical efficacy in the improvement of cognition have been withdrawn from the German market due to economic reasons based on an official committee judgement \u201emissing additional benefit\u201c. Among new substances introduced are the selective opioid modulator nalmefene for reduction of alcohol consumption, the selective alpha-2-receptor agonist guanfacine for ADHS treatment in child and youth psychiatry, the older antidepressant milnacipran and the glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor agonist liraglutide for treatment of adipositas. In the USA the atypical antipsychotics cariprazine and brexpiprazole have been released. The introduction of the long acting depot antipsychotics aripiprazole (1 month) and paliperidone (3 months) can be seen as major progress in the treatment of schizophrenia. Loxapine is available as inhalative antipsychotic for rapid treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and mania. Atypical antipsychotics like quetiapine are recommended now as add-on treatment for therapy-resistant depressions. Ketamine and botulinum toxin are in experimental use as antidepressants. The development of psychotropics is long lasting and costly and made even more difficult by negative medial attitudes additionally. Constructive resolving attempts are needed urgently to avoid a standstill in the development of psychotropic drugs."}, {"Title": "Opportunities and Challenges for Psychiatry in the Connectomic Era.", "Abstract": "Most major psychiatric disorders arise from disturbances of anatomically distributed neural systems rather than isolated dysfunction of circumscribed brain regions. The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in our capacity to measure, map, and model neural connectivity in diverse species and at different resolution scales, from the level of individual neurons and synapses to large-scale systems spanning the entire brain. In this review, we consider how these techniques, when grounded in the theory and methods of network science, can contribute to a biological understanding of mental illness. We focus in particular on attempts to accurately map brain network disturbances in clinical populations and to model the mechanistic causes of these changes. This work suggests that pathology within highly connected hub regions is a consistent finding across a broad array of phenotypically diverse disorders, and that disparate changes in brain network organization can sometimes be explained by a surprisingly small and simple set of mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Strategies for Advancing Disease Definition Using Biomarkers and Genetics: The Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes.", "Abstract": "It is critical for psychiatry as a field to develop approaches to define the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of its brain diseases, especially for serious mental illnesses, and then to use these definitions to generate biologically based disease categories, as well as to explore disease mechanisms and illness etiologies. Our current reliance on phenomenology is inadequate to support exploration of molecular treatment targets and disease formulations, and the leap directly from phenomenology to disease biology has been limiting because of broad heterogeneity within conventional diagnoses. The questions addressed in this review are formulated around how we can use brain biomarkers to achieve disease categories that are biologically based. We have grouped together a series of vignettes as examples of early approaches, all using the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) biomarker database and collaborators, starting off with describing the foundational statistical methods for these goals. We use primarily criterion-free statistics to identify pertinent groups of involved genes related to psychosis as well as symptoms, and finally, to create new biologically based disease cohorts within the psychopathological dimension of psychosis. Although we do not put these results forward as final formulations, they represent a novel effort to rely minimally on phenomenology as a diagnostic tool and to fully embrace brain characteristics of structure, as well as molecular and cellular characteristics and function, to support disease definition in psychosis."}, {"Title": "The effect of neurobiological changes in the brain of children with schizophrenia, ultra high-risk for psychosis and epilepsy: clinical correlations with EEG and neuroimagistic abnormalities.", "Abstract": "Relatively little research has been conducted on quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) activity in patients with psychosis\u00f7schizophrenia, especially in populations at-risk for the illness. Further studies are needed, in order to offer a possible endophenotypic marker of the cerebral functioning, associated with psychosis\u00f7schizophrenia, in correlation with the neuroimaging, the neurocognitive, biochemical, molecular genetic tests, clinical aspects and the EEG activity from the same subjects. The aim was to investigate the role the QEEG abnormalities play in the etiology of psychosis\u00f7schizophrenia, whether it can provide an endophenotype for psychosis and to make some correlations with the results obtained through magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, for proper early detection and intervention. The prospective research was performed in the University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Timisoara, Romania, involving 55 children with schizophrenia or ultra high-risk (UHR) for psychosis (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4) and 55 children as healthy controls (group 5). Groups 1 and 2 (28 children) are diagnosed with schizophrenia, groups 3 and 4 are UHR for psychosis (27 children), and group 5 represents healthy controls. Groups 1 and 3 had convulsive seizures in their personal history. We noticed: through the QEEG, numerous patterns of theta and delta activity, the diminished amplitude of the alpha band waves and the diminished alpha activity; also, the onset of psychosis was earlier at those presenting convulsive seizures in their personal history (groups 1 and 3); also, specific neuroimagistic abnormalities and modifications. The cerebral lesions, appearing during the development, raise the liability for schizophrenia. The high-risk for schizophrenia is correlated with the personal history of epilepsy, as well as with the family risk for psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Clinical knowledge as anthropological knowledge: Reflections on the care pact].", "Abstract": "A discomfort pervades current Psychiatry: striving to be linked and identifed with Neurology, it cannot however ignore the subjectivity of patients. Moreover, the practice of Psychiatry as a Know-How, should also be subject to a political and ethical dimension. It must rely on justice and politics to the extent that it receives social demands, articulating the attention to vulnerable people with fair institutions (Ricoeur), but also it has to include them in society through their abilities. In this ethical dimension, it should seek to reform assistance institutions so that patients are protected and their rights respected. In this sense, it is necessary to consider the concept of therapeutic alliance (Paul Ricoeur), alliance that is only possible if it takes the form of a mutual promise, from both the therapist and the patient. It is a pact of care, even in situations where the skills and abilities are disproportionate. Clinical knowledge is somehow an anthropological knowledge about man as subject of disease, as homo patiens, but also about he who wants to accompany him in his suffering."}, {"Title": "Predictors of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, consists of applying series of magnetic impulses to the cerebral cortex so as to modulate neurone activity in a target zone. This technique, still experimental, could prove promising in the field of psychiatry, in particular for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It is important for the clinician to be able to assess the response potential of a given patient to rTMS, and this among other things requires relevant predictive factors to be available. This review of the literature aims to determine and analyse reported predictive factors for therapeutic response to rTMS treatment in major depressive disorder. Different parameters are studied, in particular age, the severity of the depressive episode, psychological dimensions, genetic factors, cerebral blood flows via cerebral imagery, and neuronavigation. The factors found to be associated with better therapeutic response were young age, low level of severity of the depressive episode, motor threshold intensity over 100%, more than 1000 stimulations per session, more than 10 days treatment, L/L genotype on the 5-HTTLPR transporter gene, C/C homozygosity on the promotor regions of the 5-HT1A receptor gene, Val/Val homozygosity on the BDNF gene, cordance analyses by EEG, and finally the accurate localisation provided by neuronavigation.

Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted.\nTwenty-four eligible studies were identified including 2901 people with MDD (78.4% female, mean age=54 years; range: 21-77 years). People with MDD spent 126.0min (95%CI=91.9-160.1) per day engaging in all types of PA and spent 8.5hours (95%CI=7.51-9.62) during their waking day being sedentary.

In psychiatry, low vitamin D levels have been associated with schizophrenia, depression, psychotic symptoms, and, more recently, alcohol use disorders. Alcohol use disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the association between alcohol use and vitamin D serum levels. The PubMed, SCIELO, and Lilacs databases were searched for this systematic review. We assessed all articles published from 1976 to December 2015, and we examined the associated reference lists to retrieve articles that appeared to fulfill our criteria. Of 932 articles, 49 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the papers (71.4%) were cross-sectional studies. Alcohol intake was found to be positively associated with vitamin D status in 15 articles and negatively associated with vitamin D in 18 articles; no association was found in 16 articles. Heterogeneous results were found in our review, with a similar number of papers indicating a positive association, a negative association or the absence of any association between alcohol use and vitamin D levels. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the studies in which a positive association was found were more recent papers that involved considerably larger sample sizes than those in other studies. The older studies compared vitamin D levels in alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients, in contrast to more recent studies, which focused on more specific populations. In addition, most of the selected papers were from high latitude countries, where exposure to sunlight tends to be lower than in tropical countries. The data concerning vitamin D levels in patients with alcohol use disorders remain controversial. Additional research using a standardized methodology is necessary to demonstrate the real impact of alcohol consumption on vitamin D serum levels as well as on the health status of alcohol users."}, {"Title": "Computational neuroscience approach to biomarkers and treatments for mental disorders.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry research has long experienced a stagnation stemming from a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of phenomenologically defined mental disorders. Recently, the application of computational neuroscience to psychiatry research has shown great promise in establishing a link between phenomenological and pathophysiological aspects of mental disorders, thereby recasting current nosology in more biologically meaningful dimensions. In this review, we highlight recent investigations into computational neuroscience that have undertaken either theory- or data-driven approaches to quantitatively delineate the mechanisms of mental disorders. The theory-driven approach, including reinforcement learning models, plays an integrative role in this process by enabling correspondence between behavior and disorder-specific alterations at multiple levels of brain organization, ranging from molecules to cells to circuits. Previous studies have explicated a plethora of defining symptoms of mental disorders, including anhedonia, inattention, and poor executive function. The data-driven approach, on the other hand, is an emerging field in computational neuroscience seeking to identify disorder-specific features among high-dimensional big data. Remarkably, various machine-learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data, and the extracted disorder-specific features have been used for automatic case-control classification. For many disorders, the reported accuracies have reached 90% or more. However, we note that rigorous tests on independent cohorts are critically required to translate this research into clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the utility of the disorder-specific features found by the data-driven approach to psychiatric therapies, including neurofeedback. Such developments will allow simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders using neuroimaging, thereby establishing 'theranostics' for the first time in clinical psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Perinatal suicidal ideation and behaviour: psychiatry and adversity.", "Abstract": "Pregnant women are at increased risk for suicidal ideation and behaviours (SIB) compared to the general population. To date, studies have focused on the psychiatric correlates of SIB with lesser attention given to the associated contextual risk factors, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We investigated the prevalence and associated psychiatric and socio-economic contextual factors for SIB among pregnant women living in low resource communities in South Africa. Three hundred seventy-six pregnant women were evaluated using a range of tools to collect data on socio-economic and demographic factors, social support, life events, interpersonal violence and mental health diagnoses. We examined the significant risk factors for SIB using univariate, bivariate and logistic regression analyses (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The 1-month prevalence of SIB was 18%. SIB was associated with psychiatric illness, notably major depressive episode (MDE) and any anxiety disorder. However, 67% of pregnant women with SIB had no MDE diagnosis, and 65% had no anxiety disorder, while 54% had neither MDE nor anxiety disorder diagnoses. Factors associated with SIB included lower socio-economic status, food insecurity, interpersonal violence, multiparousity, and lifetime suicide attempt. These findings focus attention on the importance of socio-economic and contextual factors in the aetiology of SIB and lend support to the idea that suicide risk should be assessed independently of depression and anxiety among pregnant women."}, {"Title": "Intrinsic functional connectivity of fronto-temporal networks in adolescents with early psychosis.", "Abstract": "Adults with psychotic disorders have abnormal connectivity of fronto-temporal networks.

Following motion correction, data were available for 44 participants with a psychosis risk syndrome, 34 patients with a first episode psychosis (FEP) and 35 healthy controls. Independent component analysis was performed to assess functional networks showing a fronto-temporal scope; this identified a language and a salience network. Mean fractional anisotropy was measured in clusters showing between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). For the language network, there was a group effect within the right middle/inferior frontal gyrus, explained by reduced iFC in patients with an FEP relative to healthy controls, while in participants with a psychosis risk syndrome values of iFC were intermediate. In this region, values of iFC were positively correlated with mean fractional anisotropy in patients with an FEP. No group differences were observed in the salience network. Reduced iFC of the language network, in association with disrupted white matter microstructure, may characterize FEP during adolescence."}, {"Title": "Psychological and Psychiatric Traits in Post-bariatric Patients Asking for Body-Contouring Surgery.", "Abstract": "Obese patients, mainly females, feel uncomfortable and unsatisfied with their physical appearance; they have a wrong perception of their image and consequently diminish their self-esteem, sometimes showing difficulties in functional areas such as work, relationship, social activity.

To identify factors promoting or impeding the use of the Exergames.\nAssessments of BMI, blood pressure, physical fitness, SF36, GAF and social interactions were studied at baseline and 10 months. An integrated methods design using content analysis of focus group interviews was integrated with a statistical analysis. Forty-three persons were randomized to the intervention and 30 to the control group. The qualitative interviews included 18 users, 11 staffs and one technical assistant.\nThere were no significant between-group changes in physical activity behaviours or somatic health parameters after 10 months. Only 5% of the intervention group made systematic use of the intervention. Technological difficulties and staff attitudes were found to be barriers. The Exergames were perceived as technically complicated. The staff did not see playing TV games as important and negative attitudes were found.\nExergames was not a successful intervention to increase physical activity behaviours in persons with severe mental illness in the community. Exergames and motivation for physical activity in this group is problematic. Implications for rehabilitation There are difficulties to change passive physical activity habits for persons with severe mental illness, living in sheltered housing conditions in the community due to negative symptoms with depression, low motivation and bad self -confidence.

Nineteen respondents (28 %) met criteria for burnout as measured by the MBI. Residents with burnout scored higher on self-report measures assessing perceived stress (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.97; p\u2009=\u20090.004), fatigue (d\u2009=\u20090.79; p\u2009=\u20090.018), worry (d\u2009=\u20090.88; p\u2009=\u20090.0009), and depression symptoms (d\u2009=\u20090.84; p\u2009=\u20090.035) and scored lower on questionnaires assessing mindfulness (d\u2009=\u2009-0.63; p\u2009=\u20090.029) and coping ability (d\u2009=\u2009-0.79; p\u2009=\u20090.003).\nIn a cross-sectional assessment using self-report measures, we found that nearly a third of first year residents prior to starting their internships experience burnout. They exhibit lower levels of mindfulness and coping skills and higher levels of depression symptoms, fatigue, worry, and stress. These preliminary findings should encourage programs to initiate and study curricula that combine mindfulness and self-awareness coping strategies to enhance or protect against burnout as well as cognitive behavioral coaching strategies to offset symptoms of burnout when present."}, {"Title": "Sexual homicide: Brief review of the literature and case report involving rape, genital mutilation and human arson.", "Abstract": "The objective of the current paper is to report a new case of sexual murder involving human arson and summarize the literature on the phenomenon of sexual homicide. The present case study is unprecedented in Greece and a rarity in international literature due to the fact that the victim suffered genital mutilation and incineration while still alive. The evaluation consisted of 176 articles; 53 were reviewed by the authors. The results revealed sparse, but significant, research findings. The authors discuss the limitations regarding research, incidence of the phenomenon, crime-scene patterns, offender characteristics (killing methods, motive inferences, sociodemographic data, classifications, psychopathology, modus operandi), and victim selection. The incidence of the phenomenon is unclear (1-4%) due to non-standardized criteria. It is an expression of displaced anger or sexual sadism and/or a way to elude detection (ancillary benefit). Most offenders (in their first kill) and victims were in their late 20s to early 30s and belong to Caucasian populations. Personal weapons were commonly used against women, strangulation is the prevalent killing method against children, and firearms against men. Most of the sexual homicide perpetrators are non-psychotic at the time of the attack, but experience personality pathology, primitive defenses, pathological object relations, and withdrawal into fantasy in order to deal with social isolation."}, {"Title": "Clinical Validation of Reduced Alcohol Consumption After Treatment for Alcohol Dependence Using the World Health Organization Risk Drinking Levels.", "Abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent public health problem associated with considerable individual and societal costs. Abstinence from alcohol is the most widely accepted target of treatment for AUD, but it severely limits treatment options and could deter individuals who prefer to reduce their drinking from seeking treatment. Clinical validation of reduced alcohol consumption as the primary outcome of alcohol clinical trials is critical for expanding treatment options. One potentially useful measure of alcohol treatment outcome is a reduction in the World Health Organization (WHO, International Guide for Monitoring Alcohol Consumption and Related Harm. Geneva, Switzerland, 2000) risk levels of alcohol use (very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, and low risk). For example, a 2-shift reduction in WHO risk levels (e.g., high risk to low risk) has been used by the European Medicines Agency (2010, Guideline on the Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Alcohol Dependence. UK) to evaluate nalmefene as a treatment for alcohol dependence (AD; Mann et\u00a0al. 2013, Biol Psychiatry 73, 706-13).\nThe current study was a secondary data analysis of the COMBINE study (n\u00a0=\u00a01,383; Anton et\u00a0al., ) to examine the association between reductions in WHO risk levels and reductions in alcohol-related consequences and mental health symptoms during and following treatment in patients with AD.\nAny reduction in WHO risk drinking level during treatment was associated with significantly fewer alcohol-related consequences and improved mental health at the end of treatment and for up to 1\u00a0year posttreatment. A greater reduction in WHO risk drinking level predicted a greater reduction in consequences and greater improvements in mental health.\nChanges in WHO risk levels appear to be a valid end point for alcohol clinical trials. Based on the current findings, reductions in WHO risk drinking levels during treatment reflect meaningful reductions in alcohol-related consequences and improved functioning."}, {"Title": "Toward a better understanding on the role of prediction error on memory processes: From bench to clinic.", "Abstract": "Experimental psychology defines Prediction Error (PE) as a mismatch between expected and current events. It represents a unifier concept within the memory field, as it is the driving force of memory acquisition and updating. Prediction error induces updating of consolidated memories in strength or content by memory reconsolidation. This process has two different neurobiological phases, which involves the destabilization (labilization) of a consolidated memory followed by its restabilization.

Considering the role of stress as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, it is not surprising that cortisol stress reactivity has frequently been investigated in patients versus healthy individuals. However, the large heterogeneity in measures of the cortisol stress response has hampered a systematic evaluation of the evidence. We here report of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress across psychiatric disorders. Original data from authors were obtained to construct standardized cortisol outcomes (the areas under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi) and ground (AUCg)) and to examine the influence of sex and symptomatic state on cortisol stress reactivity. Fourteen studies on major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=1129), 9 on anxiety disorders (n=732, including social anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and mixed samples of anxiety disorders) and 4 on schizophrenia (n=180) were included that used the Trier Social Stress Test or an equivalent psychosocial stress task. Sex-dependent changes in stress reactivity were apparent in MDD and anxiety disorders. Specifically, women with current MDD or an anxiety disorder exhibited a blunted cortisol stress response, whereas men with current MDD or SAD showed an increased cortisol response to psychosocial stress. In individuals with remitted MDD, altered cortisol stress reactivity was less pronounced in women and absent in men. For schizophrenia, cortisol stress reactivity was blunted in both men and women, but the number of studies was limited and showed evidence for publication bias. These findings illustrate that sharing individual data to disentangle the effects of sex, symptom levels and other factors is essential for further understanding of the alterations in cortisol stress reactivity across psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Smartphone application for multi-phasic interventional trials in psychiatry: Technical design of a smart server.", "Abstract": "Smartphones and their accompanying applications are currently widely utilized in various healthcare interventions.

There remains a paucity of research evaluating different forms of interventions using a single smartphone application. In the field of nutrition, there has been recent pioneering research demonstrating how a multi-phasic randomized controlled trial could be conducted using a single smartphone application. Despite the innovativeness of the previous smartphone conceptualization, there remains a paucity of technical information underlying the conceptualization that would support a multi-phasic interventional trial.

The aim of this retrospective observational study was to quantify and describe ADRs reported via the ADEM in 2014.\nAll ADR reports handled by the ADEM in 2014 were recorded anonymously and analysed descriptively.\nA total of 484 ADRs were reported through the ADEM in 2014 (the median number of reports per month was 37; range: 17-78). The majority of the reports came from departments of internal medicine (61%), psychiatry (14%) and dermatology, ophthalmology or otorhinolaryngology (11%). The drugs most frequently reported were lisdexamphetamine (n = 40), rivaroxaban (n = 16) and warfarin (n = 15) (vaccines excluded).

Clinical descriptions of paranoia appearing in 10 textbooks, published 1899 to 1970, revealed 11 prominent symptoms and signs reported by 5 or more authors. Three symptoms (systematized delusions, minimal hallucinations, and prominent ideas of reference) and 2 signs (chronic course and minimal affective deterioration) were reported by 8 or 9 of the authors. Four textbook authors rejected the Kraepelinian concept of paranoia. A weak relationship was seen between the frequency with which the clinical features were reported and the likelihood of their inclusion in modern DSM manuals. Indeed, the diagnostic criteria for paranoia/delusional disorder shifted substantially from DSM-III to DSM-5. The modern operationalized criteria for paranoia/delusional disorder do not well reflect the symptoms and signs frequently reported by historical experts. In contrast to results of similar reviews for depression, schizophrenia and mania, the clinical construct of paranoia/delusional disorder has been somewhat unstable in Western Psychiatry since the turn of the 20th century as reflected in both textbooks and the DSM editions."}, {"Title": "'Electroshock Therapy' in the Third Reich.", "Abstract": "The history of 'electroshock therapy' (now known as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)) in Europe in the Third Reich is still a neglected chapter in medical history. Since Thomas Szasz's 'From the Slaughterhouse to the Madhouse', prejudices have hindered a thorough historical analysis of the introduction and early application of electroshock therapy during the period of National Socialism and the Second World War. Contrary to the assumption of a 'dialectics of healing and killing', the introduction of electroshock therapy in the German Reich and occupied territories was neither especially swift nor radical. Electroshock therapy, much like the preceding 'shock therapies', insulin coma therapy and cardiazol convulsive therapy, contradicted the genetic dogma of schizophrenia, in which only one 'treatment' was permissible: primary prevention by sterilisation. However, industrial companies such as Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG (SRW) embraced the new development in medical technology. Moreover, they knew how to use existing patents on the electrical anaesthesia used for slaughtering to maintain a leading position in the new electroshock therapy market. Only after the end of the official 'euthanasia' murder operation in August 1941, entitled T4, did the psychiatric elite begin to promote electroshock therapy as a modern 'unspecific' treatment in order to reframe psychiatry as an 'honorable' medical discipline. War-related shortages hindered even the then politically supported production of electroshock devices. Research into electroshock therapy remained minimal and was mainly concerned with internationally shared safety concerns regarding its clinical application. However, within the Third Reich, electroshock therapy was not only introduced in psychiatric hospitals, asylums, and in the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to get patients back to work, it was also modified for 'euthanasia' murder."}, {"Title": "Investigating the current methods of assessing behavioral and psychological symptoms in residential aged care facilities in a metropolitan city.", "Abstract": "Up to 90% of people with dementia living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) display behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and these are associated with poorer quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality.

A cross-sectional convenience sample of 21 clinicians were identified and administered a questionnaire. Old age psychiatrists, aged psychiatry clinicians, behavior management teams and RACF staff completed the questionnaires. Clinicians reported that objective consistent information about BPSD were important for recommending and implementing pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for BPSD; however, the use of validated BPSD assessments in RACFs was not a usual part of clinical practice. RACF staff stated the major barrier to assessment of BPSD was lack of time. Alternate methods of assessing BPSD which consider preferences from clinicians and RACF staff should be further investigated.

Psychiatric examination, self-report questionnaires, legal documents, and witness reports have been reviewed in evaluation of the case. Evidence pointed to total denial of pregnancy, that is, until delivery. The diagnoses of an acute dissociative reaction to stress (remitted) and a subsequent PTSD were established in a follow-up examination conducted 7\u00a0months after the delivery. Notwithstanding the inherently dissociative nature of total denial of pregnancy, no other evidence has been found about pre-existing psychopathology. For causing the newborn's death, the patient faced charges for \"aggravated murder,\" which were later on reduced into \"involuntary manslaughter.\" Given the physical incapacity to perform voluntary acts due to the loss of control over her actions during the delivery, and the presence of an acute dissociative reaction to unexpected delivery, the legal case represents an intricate overlap between \"insanity\" and \"incapacitation\" defenses. The rather broad severity spectrum of acute dissociative conditions requires evaluation of the limits and conditions of appropriate legal defenses by mental health experts and lawyers. Denial of pregnancy as a source of potential stress has attracted little interest in psychiatric literature although solid research exists which documented that it is not infrequent. Arguments are presented to introduce this condition as a diagnostic category of female reproductive psychiatry with a more neutral label: \"unperceived pregnancy.\""}, {"Title": "Exposure to violence, a risk for suicide in youths and young adults.

To describe the process by which this paradigm shift has occurred and illustrate its implications for treatment and research of late-life brain disorders, late-life depression is discussed as a prototype case. Prior phases of geriatric psychiatry research were focused on achieving depressive symptom relief, outlining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences between older and younger adults, and identifying moderators of treatment response. Building on this work, current geriatric psychiatry researchers have begun to disentangle the etiologic complexity in late-life depression by focusing on the causative aging-related processes involved, identifying both neurobiological and behavioral intermediates, and finally delineating depression subtypes that are distinguishable by their underlying biology and the treatment approach required. In this review, we discuss several age-related processes that are critical to the development of late-life mood disorders, outline implications of these processes for the clinical evaluation and management of later-life psychiatric disorders, and finally put forth suggestions for better integrating aging and developmental processes into the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria."}, {"Title": "Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of adults with ADHD: a meta-review.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by a persistent and impairing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity and it is one of the most common neuropsychiatric conditions. Evidence about interventions of adults with ADHD is growing rapidly and clinicians need a reliable summary of all the best available information in order to better inform their daily practice. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases until 31 May 2016 for systematic reviews about pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in adults with ADHD and carried out a meta-review to address clinically relevant questions. We identified a total of 40 papers. Psychostimulants-such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts and lisdexamfetamine-and non-psychostimulants-such as atomoxetine-were the most studied agents. Overall, pharmacological treatments were significantly more efficacious than placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.52), albeit less well accepted (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36) and tolerated (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.97 to 2.66). The effects of pharmacological treatment for individuals with co-occurring ADHD and substance use disorder are still uncertain. The evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD in adults, as well as the combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, is only preliminary. In conclusion, while available evidence addressed mainly the efficacy and tolerability of psychostimulants and non-psychostimulants for ADHD core symptoms in the short term, we still need further empirical support for the non-pharmacological and multimodal treatments.

Clinical descriptions of mania appearing in 18 textbooks published between 1899 and 1956 were reviewed and compared to the criteria for mania from six modern operationalized diagnostic systems. Twenty-two prominent symptoms and signs were reported by five or more authors. Two symptoms (elevated mood and grandiosity) and four signs (hyperactivity, pressured speech, irritability, and new activities with painful consequences) were reported by every author. A strong relationship was seen between the frequency with which the clinical features were reported and the likelihood of their inclusion in modern diagnostic systems. However, many symptoms and signs including impulsivity, hypersexuality, mood lability, altered moral standards, increased humor, hypergraphia, and a vigorous physical appearance were not included in any modern criteria. Indeed, DSM-5 contains only eight of the historically noted clinical features. We conclude that modern operationalized criteria for mania well reflect symptoms and signs frequently reported by historical experts. This suggests that the clinical construct of mania has been relatively stable in western Psychiatry since the turn of the 20th century. However, many useful clinical features of mania described in these textbooks are missing from these criteria thereby illustrating the limitations of clinical evaluations restricted to the assessment of only current diagnostic criteria. The disorders we study and treat are considerably richer clinically than is reflected in the DSM criteria which we use to diagnose them."}, {"Title": "Recent Developments in Molecular Brain Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Molecular imaging with PET or SPECT has been an important research tool in psychiatry for as long as these modalities have been available.

We discuss the use of pharmacologic probes to induce changes in levels of neurotransmitters that can be inferred through their effects on outcome measures of imaging experiments, from their historical origins focusing on dopamine transmission through recent developments involving serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Next, we examine imaging of neuroinflammation in the context of psychiatry. Imaging markers of neuroinflammation have been studied extensively in other areas of brain research, but they have more recently attracted interest in psychiatry research, based on accumulating evidence that there may be an inflammatory component to some psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, new probes are under development that would allow unprecedented insights into cellular processes.

Researchers have called for investigation into service use with respect to clinically recommended interventions.\nTo examine intervention recommendations for children with FASD/PAE and subsequent access to these recommended interventions.\nIntervention recommendations following FASD assessment were examined for children (1-17 years). Recommendations were compared according to diagnostic status and demographic and environmental variables. Subsequent access to several interventions was examined for 45 participants.\nA variety of recommendations were given. Children with FASD received more recommendations overall and received more education, anticipatory guidance, family support, and safety recommendations than undiagnosed children with PAE. Undiagnosed children received more mental health and reassessment recommendations. Older children received fewer family support and developmental therapy recommendations but more mental health recommendations than younger age groups. Many families accessed modified school programming, developmental therapy, psychiatry, child counseling, and parent support as recommended.\nChildren with FASD and PAE have extensive needs and should receive individualized recommendations. An assessment is valuable even without an FASD diagnosis. Areas of high/low service access may provide insight into accessibility and perceived importance of interventions.\nThis study responds to important research questions regarding the intervention needs of individuals with FASD.

We excluded patients under 18 years of age and those with primary psychiatry, obstetric, or rehabilitation diagnoses, and weighted estimates to the US population.\nProlonged hospitalizations represented only 2% of hospitalizations, but approximately 14% of hospital days and incurred estimated charges of over $20 billion dollars annually. Over time, patients with prolonged hospitalizations were increasingly younger, male, and of minority status, and these hospitalizations occurred more frequently in urban, academic hospitals. In-hospital mortality for patients with prolonged stays progressively decreased over the 10-year period from 14.5% to 11.6% (P <.001 for trend in grouped years), even accounting for changes in demographics and comorbidity.\nThe profile of patients with prolonged hospitalizations in the US has changed, although their impact remains large, as they continue to represent 1 of every 7 hospital days.

In recent years, computational approaches to psychiatry have attracted growing attention. Negative symptoms have shown some overlap with general cognitive impairments and were also linked to impaired motivational processing in brain circuits implementing reward prediction. In this review, we outline how computational approaches may help to provide a better understanding of negative symptoms in terms of the potentially underlying behavioural and biological mechanisms. First, we describe the idea that negative symptoms could arise from a failure to represent reward expectations to enable flexible behavioural adaptation. It has been proposed that these impairments arise from a failure to use prediction errors to update expectations. Important previous studies focused on processing of so-called model-free prediction errors where learning is determined by past rewards only. However, learning and decision-making arise from multiple cognitive mechanisms functioning simultaneously, and dissecting them via well-designed tasks in conjunction with computational modelling is a promising avenue. Second, we move on to a proof-of-concept example on how generative models of functional imaging data from a cognitive task enable the identification of subgroups of patients mapping on different levels of negative symptoms. Combining the latter approach with behavioural studies regarding learning and decision-making may allow the identification of key behavioural and biological parameters distinctive for different dimensions of negative symptoms versus a general cognitive impairment. We conclude with an outlook on how this computational framework could, at some point, enrich future clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Reducing Restraint With Clozapine in Involuntarily Admitted Patients With Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In the entire world, restraint and seclusion are common interventions in psychiatric inpatient settings because of aggressive behavior.\nOur objective was to test for the immediate antiaggressive property of clozapine compared with other antipsychotic treatments in an enriched cohort with high rates of restraint during early hospitalization.\nWe present a retrospective chart review in all involuntary admissions with schizophrenia during 2011-2014 in Psychiatry and Neurology Hospital, Brasov, Romania. Timing and number of restraints in addition to clinical, demographic, and treatment characteristics were extracted. Based on our earlier observation of clinical efficacy of early, fast titration of clozapine, we tested the hypothesis that clozapine treatment was associated with reduced use of restraint and with longer restraint-free periods.\nIn 115 consecutive patients with schizophrenia (age = 39.7 \u00b1 11.1 years; male = 59%) involuntarily admitted because of externalized (74.7%) or self-directed violence (25.2%), restraint was used in 89.6%; with a median duration of 3 hours until restraint past admission.

Comparison of restraint characteristics favored immediate clozapine use with highly reduced rates of restraint (23% vs. 95.6%; P < 0.001) and significantly extended hours until restraint [(118, 24, 426 hours) vs. (3, 0.25, 48 hours); median; 25th, 75th percentile; P < 0.001] relative to the remaining cohort. These effects remained highly significant after controlling for potential moderators of restraint use in multivariate models.\nThese retrospective data suggest an early antiaggressive effect of clozapine during the immediate use of clozapine in highly problematic patients."}, {"Title": "Relative Impact of Risk Factors, Thwarted Belongingness, and Perceived Burdensomeness on Suicidal Ideation in Veteran Service Members.", "Abstract": "We tested the associations between individualized risk factors, empirically validated constructs specific to suicide risk (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, and two methods for conceptualizing suicidal ideation based on Suicide Index Score (SIS) and overall severity score of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation [BSS]).\nThe current study included a sample of 134 suicidal Veterans who were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

We used ordinary least squares regression with bootstrapping to conduct analyses due to the skewed distributions observed in the suicidal ideation outcomes.\nThwarted belongingness was the only statistically significant correlate of the SIS, indicating a stronger desire to be dead than alive as Veterans perceived themselves as being increasingly disconnected and isolated from others (B = 0.36, standard error [SE] = 0.01, p = 0.005). In contrast, greater overall severity scores on the BSS were associated with higher ratings on the PCL-M (B = 0.21, SE = 0.07, p = 0.02) and for thwarted belongingness (B = 0.27, SE = 0.09, p = 0.04).

Hobart Mowrer.", "Abstract": "O. Hobart Mowrer had one of the most productive and curious careers of any psychologist in the 20th century, despite struggling with severe mental illness and anxiety about his sexuality. Early in his career, he was one of the country's leading experimental psychologists. During the mid-1940s, he became interested in religion and argued that anxiety was caused by repressed guilt that came from real wrongdoing. By the late 1950s, he had abandoned mainstream psychology, arguing that religion had been corrupted by its embrace of psychology and psychiatry. He claimed that sin was responsible for nearly all psychological problems and that ethical living and confession of wrongdoing could prevent mental illness. During his religious period, Mowrer received an astonishing amount of fawning press attention and was embraced by a public desirous of a path to mental health that did not require jettisoning traditional conceptions of sin, guilt, and human nature. This article examines Mowrer's life and career and situates him among other mid-century skeptics of psychology and psychiatry. Other historians have argued that by the 1950s, the conflict between religion and psychiatry/psychology in the United States had largely abated, with both sides adapting to each other. Mowrer's life and the reception of his work demonstrate that this narrative is overly simplistic; widespread conservative and religious distrust of psychology persisted even into the 1960s.

Community-based primary care settings are often the first contact between patients and the health system and thus could serve as important settings for assessing and treating mental disorders. However, no formal assessment has been undertaken regarding the feasibility of implementing these services in Mexico. Before tools are developed to undertake such an assessment, a more nuanced understanding of the microprocesses affecting mental health service delivery must be acquired.\nA qualitative study used semistructured interviews to gather information from 25 staff in 19 community-based primary care clinics in Mexico City. Semistructured interviews were analyzed by using the meaning categorization method. In a second phase of coding, emerging themes were compared with an established typology of barriers to health care access.\nPrimary care staff reported a number of significant barriers to implementing mental health services in primary care clinics, an already fragile and underfunded system. Barriers included the following broad thematic categories: service issues, language and cultural issues, care recipient characteristics, and issues with lack of knowledge.\nResults indicate that the implementation of mental health services in primary care clinics in Mexico will be difficult.

Traditionally drugs acting on CNS receptors have been classified as either agonists or antagonists. Recently a new class of ligand, the inverse agonist, has been identified in some receptor systems. Inverse agonists have opposite actions to those of agonists but the effects of both of these can be blocked by antagonists. Pimavanserin is a new 5-HT2A receptor acting drug that has been given market authorization for psychosis in Parkinson\u05f3s disease. The FDA have termed it an inverse agonist, but this conclusion is based on in-vitro data. In this paper we discuss the evidence for such a claim being made for pimavanserin in the human brain and conclude that this is not currently sufficient. It is therefore premature to conclude that the actions of pimavanserin in humans are due to inverse agonism, and we are of the opinion that it should be called a 5-HT2A antagonist until better evidence emerges."}, {"Title": "Knowledge and Attitude Towards Pharmacological Management of Acute Agitation: A Survey of Psychiatrists, Psychiatry Residents, and Psychiatric Nurses.", "Abstract": "The authors compared the current knowledge and attitude of psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, and psychiatric nurses towards the pharmacological management of acute agitation.\nQuestionnaires were electronically distributed to all attending psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, and psychiatric nurses who were either employed by the University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences or were staff at a 250-bed affiliated Psychiatric Hospital.

We here report the development of such assessment toolkits.\nWe developed the LBD assessment toolkits in three stages. First, we conducted a systematic search for brief validated assessments for key symptoms and combined these into draft instruments. Second, we obtained feedback on acceptability and feasibility through two rounds of interviews with our patient and public involvement group. This led to modification of the toolkits. Finally, we piloted the toolkits in a feasibility study in routine dementia and Parkinson's disease services to produce final instruments suitable for routine clinical practice.\nEleven clinicians, working in both dementia/memory assessment and Parkinson's disease/movement disorder services, consented to pilot the assessment toolkits and provide feedback on their feasibility. Clinicians worked in routine health service (not academic) settings and piloted the draft toolkits by integrating them into their regular clinical assessments. Feedback obtained informally, by written comments and through qualitative interviews led to modifications and production of final acceptable versions.\nWe were able to address an important need, the under-diagnosis of LBD, by developing toolkits for improving the recognition and diagnosis of the LBD, which were acceptable to clinicians working in routine dementia and Parkinson's disease services. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Four additional analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of this finding, and they found that the intervention group had a probability of 84% to 98% that cumulative QALYs were higher and a probability of 91% to 99% that costs were lower than in the control group. Conclusion SC is highly likely to be cost-effective; the number of QALYs was higher and cumulative costs were lower for SC compared with CAU."}, {"Title": "Resting-state connectivity biomarkers define neurophysiological subtypes of depression.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry, partly because there is a weak correspondence between diagnostic labels and their neurobiological substrates. Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes ('biotypes') defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82-93%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies."}, {"Title": "Prison break: Karl Menninger's The Crime of Punishment and its reception in U.S. psychology.", "Abstract": "In 1968, Karl Menninger, a highly visible and vocal U.S. psychiatrist, published a call to action on prison reform, The Crime of Punishment (Menninger, 1966/1968). This widely circulated book's central idea is that punishment as practiced in penal settings is an injustice amounting to a crime. At the outset, The Crime of Punishment quickly achieved national attention. Within mainstream psychology, its antipunishment message encountered a changed climate in which punishment, thought ineffective during the period 1930 through 1960, was redefined as an effective component in learning. It also met competition from the contemporaneous Stanford Prison Experiment (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973), which quickly rose to equivalent media presence and superior disciplinary prominence. Both the Stanford Prison Experiment and The Crime of Punishment survived in the antireform era of hyperincarceration after 1974 as parallel examples of reform activism, one secular and one religious in character, illustrating some convergences of aim between psychology and psychiatry outside of specifically clinical issues.

In keeping with this view, the targeting of interleukin-6 with the human monoclonal antibody sirukumab may represent a possible treatment and disease modification approach, for adults with brain-based disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder). A PubMed/Medline database search was performed using the following search terms: sirukumab; anti-IL-6; IL-6; major depressive disorder; inflammation. A systematic review was conducted of both preclinical and clinical trials reporting on the pharmacology of sirukumab or investigating the efficacy of targeting IL-6 signaling. Overall, sirukumab has been reported to be a safe and well-tolerated agent, capable of modulating the immune response in healthy populations as well as in subjects with inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Sirukumab's effects on cytokine networks as part of the innate immune system provide a coherent rationale for possible application in neuropsychiatric disorders with possible benefits across several domains of the biobehavioral Research Domain Criteria matrix (e.g., general cognitive processes, positive valence systems). Amongst individuals with complex brain-based disorders (e.g., mood disorders), the dimensions/domains most likely to benefit with sirukumab are negative valence disturbances (e.g., anxiety, depression, rumination), positive valence disturbances (e.g., anhedonia) as well as general cognitive processes. We suggest that sirukumab represents a prototype and possibly a proof-of-concept that agents that engage IL-6 targets have salutary effects in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Smartphone applications for immersive virtual reality therapy for internet addiction and internet gaming disorder.", "Abstract": "There have been rapid advances in technologies over the past decade and virtual reality technology is an area which is increasingly utilized as a healthcare intervention in many disciplines including that of Medicine, Surgery and Psychiatry. In Psychiatry, most of the current interventions involving the usage of virtual reality technology is limited to its application for anxiety disorders. With the advances in technology, Internet addiction and Internet gaming disorders are increasingly prevalent. To date, these disorders are still being treated using conventional psychotherapy methods such as cognitive behavioural therapy. However, there is an increasing number of research combining various other therapies alongside with cognitive behavioural therapy, as an attempt possibly to reduce the drop-out rates and to make such interventions more relevant to the targeted group of addicts, who are mostly adolescents. To date, there has been a prior study done in Korea that has demonstrated the comparable efficacy of virtual reality therapy with that of cognitive behavioural therapy. However, the intervention requires the usage of specialized screens and devices. It is thus the objective of the current article to highlight how smartphone applications could be designed and be utilized for immersive virtual reality treatment, alongside low cost wearables."}, {"Title": "Effects of Short-Term Exercise Interventions on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Patients with Dementia: A\u00a0Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Observational and interventional studies indicate a\u00a0direct link between the patients' physical activity and the extent of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).

Squalor frequently is associated with hoarding behaviour. We compared the neuropsychological profile of people living in squalor associated with hoarding to those presenting with squalor only.\nThis study is a retrospective case series of hospital inpatient and community healthcare services of 69 people living in squalor (49 from aged care, 16 from aged psychiatry, 3 from acute medical and 1 from a memory clinic). Forty per cent had co-morbid hoarding behaviours. The main outcomes were neuropsychologists' opinions of domain-specific cognitive impairment.\nThe squalor-hoarding group (M age 75.8, SD\u2009=\u20096.9,) was significantly older (p\u2009<\u20090.05) than the squalor-only group (M age 69.9\u2009years, SD\u2009=\u200913.1), significantly more likely to have vascular or Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and significantly less likely to have alcohol-related impairment (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Chi-square analyses revealed significantly greater rates of impairment for the squalor-only group (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in visuospatial reasoning, abstraction, planning, organisation, problem solving and mental flexibility, compared with the squalor-hoarding group. Logistic regression analysis indicated that impaired mental flexibility was a significant predictor and strongly indicated squalor only (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.07; 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.82).\nPreliminary evidence suggests that squalor associated with hoarding may have distinct neuropsychological features compared against squalor only. Future work should be conducted using a larger sample and a common neuropsychological battery to better understand the deficits associated with hoarding-related squalor.

Two most recent meta-analyses reported insignificant findings with regards to the treatment effect of add-on ketamine anesthesia in ECT in depressive patients. The aim of this study is to update the current evidence and investigate the role of add-on ketamine anesthesia in ECT in depressive patients via a systematic review and meta-analysis. We performed a thorough literature search of the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases, and extracted all relevant clinical variables to compare the antidepressive outcomes between add-on ketamine anesthesia and other anesthetics in ECT. Total 16 articles with 346 patients receiving add-on ketamine anesthesia in ECT and 329 controls were recruited. We found that the antidepressive treatment effect of add-on ketamine anesthesia in ECT in depressive patients was significantly higher than that of other anesthetics (p<0.001). This significance persisted in both short-term (1-2 weeks) and moderate-term (3-4 weeks) treatment courses (all p<0.05). However, the side effect profiles and recovery time profiles were significantly worse in add-on ketamine anesthesia group than in control group. Our meta-analysis highlights the significantly higher antidepressive treatment effect of add-on ketamine in depressive patients receiving ECT compared to other anesthetics. However, clinicians need to take undesirable side effects into consideration when using add-on ketamine anesthesia in ECT in depressive patients."}, {"Title": "Parent Burden in Accessing Outpatient Psychiatric Services for Adolescent Depression in a Large State System.", "Abstract": "This study examined barriers facing parents who seek outpatient psychiatric care in a large state system for adolescents with depression.\nA total of 264 outpatient facilities licensed to treat youths in New York were contacted by using a mystery shopper methodology.

Formal guidelines for the care and management of dementia in the UK state that antipsychotics should only be prescribed where fully justified. This is because inappropriate use, particularly problematic in care-home settings, can produce severe side effects including death. The aim of this study was to explore the use of fallacious arguments in professionals' deliberations about antipsychotic prescribing in dementia in care-home settings. Fallacious arguments have the potential to become unremarkable discourses that construct and validate practices which are counter to guidelines.\nThis qualitative study involved interviews with 28 care-home managers and health professionals involved in caring for patients with dementia. Potentially fallacious arguments were identified using qualitative content analysis and a coding framework constructed from existing explanatory models of fallacious reasoning.\nFallacious arguments were identified in a range of explanations and reasons that participants gave for in answer to questions about initiating, reducing doses of and stopping antipsychotics in dementia. The dominant fallacy was false dichotomy. Appeal to popularity, tradition, consequence, emotion, or fear, and the slippery slope argument was also identified.\nFallacious arguments were often formulated to present convincing cases whereby prescribing antipsychotics or maintaining existing doses (versus not starting medication or reducing the dose, for example) appeared as the only acceptable decision but this is not always the case. The findings could help health professionals to recognise and mitigate the effect of logic-based errors in decisions about the prescribing of antipsychotics in dementia."}, {"Title": "Prescription preferences in antipsychotics and attitude towards the pharmaceutical industry in Belgium.", "Abstract": "The number of antipsychotic prescriptions are increasing rapidly worldwide, a trend which is mainly driven by the steep rise in second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) prescriptions. However, the success of SGA, compared with the older first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), cannot be explained by evidence. Several studies concluded on equal efficacy of FGA and SGA on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Next to that, the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on prescription behaviour has drawn considerable interest. Therefore, the relationship between antipsychotic prescription patterns and exposure to information directly provided by pharmaceutical companies was studied.\nA cross-sectional online survey, addressing psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs) and trainees in Flanders, was carried out. Respondents were questioned about their prescription behaviour, opinion about efficacy of SGA versus FGA and the nature and frequency of their contact with the pharmaceutical industry. Using Spearman's rank correlations and \u03c7<sup>2</sup> tests, the relationship between different variables and group differences were examined.\nPsychiatrists, GPs and trainees in Flanders clearly favour olanzapine and risperidone, followed by quetiapine and aripiprazole above all other agents. This behaviour is supported by the conviction that SGAs have superior efficacy and a more benign side effect profile, compared with FGA. Frequent contact with drug representatives is correlated with a preference of SGA over FGA. 41% of the respondents acknowledge to be influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, which is more than that previously reported."}, {"Title": "Depression in cancer: The many biobehavioral pathways driving tumor progression.", "Abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common among cancer patients, with prevalence rates up to four-times higher than the general population. Depression confers worse outcomes, including non-adherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting. Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, psychosocial stressors in cancer promote: (1) inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress; (2) a decreased immunosurveillance; and (3) a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis. Consequently, the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue and sleep disturbances, is a public health priority. Moreover, behavioral strategies aiming at reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms, including addressing unhealthy diet and life-style choices, as well as physical inactivity and sleep dysfunction, may represent important strategies not only to treat depression, but also to improve wider cancer-related outcomes.

Genetic variants in the closely related CSMD1 and CSMD2 genes, which are implicated in complement regulation, are associated with schizophrenia. Since patients with schizophrenia often show cognitive impairments, we tested whether variants in CSMD1 and CSMD2 are also associated with cognitive functions per se. We took a discovery-replication approach, using well-characterized Scandinavian cohorts. A total of 1637 SNPs in CSMD1 and 206 SNPs in CSMD2 were tested for association with cognitive functions in the NCNG sample (Norwegian Cognitive NeuroGenetics; n=670). Replication testing of SNPs with p-value<0.001 (7 in CSMD1 and 3 in CSMD2) was carried out in the TOP sample (Thematically Organized Psychosis; n=1025) and the BETULA sample (Betula Longitudinal Study on aging, memory and dementia; n=1742). Finally, we conducted a meta-analysis of these SNPs using all three samples. The previously identified schizophrenia marker in CSMD1 (SNP rs10503253) was also included.

According to the WHO, the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008. In 2008, over 50% of both men and women in the WHO European Region were overweight, and approximately 23% of women and 20% of men were obese. Comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches should include nutritional treatment to favor the best metabolic and nutritional outcome, as well as to induce potential disease-specific benefits from selected nutritional regimens. Obesity is usually accompanied by an increased muscle mass. This might explain why obesity, under particular circumstances such as cancer or high age, might have protective effects, a phenomenon named the 'obesity paradox'. However, loss of muscle mass or function can also occur, which is associated with poor prognosis and termed 'sarcopenic obesity'. Therefore, treatment recommendations may need to be individualized and adapted to co-morbidities.

Recent research in psychiatry and neuroscience have led to better comprehension of the disease's mechanisms and helped to improve its treatment. However, a large proportion of patients have refractory symptoms, including for traditional cognitive and behavioral therapy by exposure and response prevention (ERP), leading clinicians to look for new treatments. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are a new type of approach, initially based on Buddhist meditation, which aims to provide better consciousness of the present moment. It has been successfully developed in some psychiatric diseases and other general medical conditions such as chronic pain. The two main programs using mindfulness meditation, Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), have shown effectiveness for the reduction of depressive and anxiety symptoms and relapses of depressive episodes in unipolar depression. It has no side effects and is well tolerated by patients. Its action relies on the specific correction of cognitive deficits in attention, emotion regulation and executive functions which are shared by OCD, GAD and depression. For OCD, we make the hypothesis that Mindfulness-Based Interventions could reduce the cognitive bias specifically existing in this pathology, such as dysfunctional beliefs, and therefore improve the symptoms. This article first reviews the existing literature on clinical trials involving Mindfulness-Based Interventions in OCD which comprises a small number of clinical studies based on very different types of protocols. At this time, and due to the lack of gold-standard studies with a large number of patients, no proof of the efficiency of mindfulness-based interventions in OCD has been shown. In a second section, following our hypothesis on the mechanisms of specific and non-specific action of this therapy in OCD, we propose a cognitive model of mindfulness-based therapy action in OCD involving the correction of OCD's cognitive bias. In this model, mindfulness-based therapy is supposed to treat specifically the cognitive aspects of the disease, while ERP is focused on its behavioral part. Then we present a clinical study aiming to prove the feasibility and the interest of the use of mindfulness in OCD, carried out in two different clinical centers. One of them used MBCT while the second used MBSR. Its results show the feasibility of mindfulness-based therapy in OCD patients and tend to prove that it could be more effective in young patients suffering from less severe forms of OCD. In parallel, attention tests and fMRI scans were done at the beginning and at the end of the therapy. Their results will be published separately. We also discuss the putative role of a specific form of MBCT adapted for OCD, specifically for its benefits in psychoeducation, which could reduce the dysfunctional beliefs present in OCD patients. Finally, we propose a therapeutic strategy in which the MBCT could complement the classical ERP therapy, as a \"maintenance\" treatment, aiming to extend the relapse of OCD symptoms. This article is a step further in the use of mindfulness-based therapy for OCD which could be added to the existing treatments reducing the patient's symptoms and improving their quality of life."}, {"Title": "Handling clinical comorbidity in randomized clinical trials in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to a) outline the importance of including patients with clinical comorbidities in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) of psychiatric treatments; and b) to propose a specific approach for best handling, analyzing and interpreting the data on clinical comorbidities in terms of their impact on treatment outcomes.

Studies applying simulation in undergraduate psychiatric education were reviewed. The depth of learner engagement was assessed using Kolb's four-stage learning cycle.\nOf 371 publications identified, 63 met all the inclusion criteria: 48 used standardized patients and 16 used online or virtual learning case modules. Only one study used high fidelity mannequins. Three studies satisfied multiple stages in Kolb's Learning Cycle, including a single study that addressed all four domains.\nDespite the varied uses of simulation across other health disciplines, there were few novel or innovative uses of simulation in undergraduate psychiatric education since the last review in 2008. Expanding on the use of simulation to improve communication, build empathy, and decrease stigma in psychiatry is essential given the relevance to all facets of medical practice.

All participants owned a smartphone or tablet with 84.9% using Apple iOS, followed by 12.8% using Android platform. Students reported using the fewest number of apps during surgery, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology clerkships. The largest number of apps were used during the internal medicine rotation (70.3%). The three most popular apps were Epocrates, UpToDate, and UWorld. The most common uses for these apps were as references during the clerkship, followed by improving knowledge, and test taking.

From March 2008 to March 2012, we performed a retrospective study on 296 knees of 265 patients who were treated with TKA. They were divided into two groups: 216 patients without delirium and 49 patients diagnosed with delirium by psychiatry. We analyzed the risk factors into three categories: First, the preoperative factors including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), clinical and functional knee joint score (Knee Society Knee Score and Knee Society Function Score) and the number of underlying diseases and associations with each disease; Second, the operative factors including the anesthesia method, amount of blood loss, operating time, laboratory factors, and transfusion count; Third, the postoperative factors such as start time of walking and duration of hospital stay were analyzed. There were significant statistical difference between two groups just in age, history of dementia, cerebrovascular disease, difference of hemoglobin and albumin, start time of walking, and duration of hospital stay. The delirium after TKA delays the postoperative ambulation and extends the hospital stay, which causes functional and socioeconomic loss of patients.

Per domain, the FQL item that correlated most highly with the mean domain score and Overall QoL was selected. Internal consistency was investigated by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity was examined by investigating the relationship with the WHOQOL-Bref and EssenCES.\nThe original division into 15 QoL domains was retained, while the number of items per domain was reduced to one or two. The amount of subjective items was shortened from 114 items to 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.79). Content validity was assured because the FQL-SV is based on the items of the original FQL that was derived from LFPC patient's and staff's opinions. Construct validity was demonstrated.\nThis study has shown that the FQL-SV is a psychometrically valid abbreviation of the FQL and can therefore be used to monitor or assess QoL in forensic psychiatric care. However, when certain domains should be targeted in treatment, the FQL (full version) can assist both the patient and the clinician to get a more complete view of the individualized targets they should be aiming at in order to improve QoL."}, {"Title": "Assessing needs for psychiatric treatment in prisoners: 2.

In the current report, we evaluate how this morbidity translates into specific needs for treatment and the consequent implications for services. Mental health treatment needs and the extent to which they had been met were assessed in a representative sample of prisoners in a male and a female prison in London (Pentonville and Holloway).\nPrisoners were sampled at random in a sequential procedure based on the Local Inmate Data System. We targeted equal numbers of male remand, male sentenced, female remand, and female sentenced prisoners. Following structured assessment of psychosis, common mental disorders, PTSD, personality disorders and disorders of abuse, we used the MRC Needs for Care Assessment (NFCAS) to establish whether potential needs for care in ten areas of mental health functioning were met, unmet, or incapable of being met by services.\nData on treatment experience were provided by 360 inmates. Eighty percent of females and 70% of males had at least one need for treatment. Over half (53.7%) of the needs of female prisoners were met, but only one third (36.5%) in males. Needs for medication were unmet in 32% of cases, while those for psychological treatment were unmet in 51%.\nUnmet needs for mental health treatment and care were common in the two prisons.

In the majority of the cases, the presence of a psychiatric disorder is cited as the reason that an individual was not fully aware of his behavior. However, other conditions, such as seizure disorders or hypoglycemia, have also been linked to an inability to understand the nature and consequences of one's actions. On occasion, these situations can be explained by a state of automatism that may be described as insane or noninsane. In this article, we describe the case of a 77-year-old man, suffering from Parkinson's disease, where the issue of criminal responsibility associated with incapacity of the mind secondary to medication misuse was raised. We elaborate on the thinking behind this opinion and the implications according to Canadian law. Although the legal outcome of this case is specific to our jurisdiction, the clinical implication may be common to any patient suffering from a similar condition and may inform physicians, families, and lawyers."}, {"Title": "Bipolar At-Risk Criteria: An Examination of Which Clinical Features Have Optimal Utility for Identifying Youth at Risk of Early Transition From Depression to Bipolar Disorders.", "Abstract": "A clinical and research challenge is to identify which depressed youth are at risk of \"early transition to bipolar disorders (ET-BD).\" This 2-part study (1) examines the clinical utility of previously reported BD at-risk (BAR) criteria in differentiating ET-BD cases from unipolar depression (UP) controls; and (2) estimates the Number Needed to Screen (NNS) for research and general psychiatry settings.\nFifty cases with reliably ascertained, ET-BD I and II cases were matched for gender and birth year with 50 UP controls who did not develop BD over 2 years. We estimated the clinical utility for finding true cases and screening out non-cases for selected risk factors and their NNS. Using a convenience sample (N = 80), we estimated the NNS when adjustments were made to account for data missing from clinical case notes.\nSub-threshold mania, cyclothymia, family history of BD, atypical depression symptoms and probable antidepressant-emergent elation, occurred significantly more frequently in ET-BD youth. Each of these \"BAR-Depression\" criteria demonstrated clinical utility for screening out non-cases. Only cyclothymia demonstrated good utility for case finding in research settings; sub-threshold mania showed moderate utility. In the convenience sample, the NNS for each criterion ranged from ~4 to 7.\nCyclothymia showed the optimum profile for case finding, screening and NNS in research settings.

The treatment of HCV has been revolutionized with the recent development of direct-acting antiviral medications. These new treatments are substantially better tolerated and more efficacious than previously used interferon-based therapies. Despite these innovations, sustained virologic response has remained low, hovering at approximately 9% of all infected persons. The reasons for this failure include lack of screening, low rates of linkage to care, cost of direct-acting antivirals, and barriers in access to care for patients. Psychiatrists work with patients at a disproportionately high risk for HCV infection yet many do not currently assume an active role in the HCV epidemic.\nThe purpose of this clinical review is to familiarize psychiatrists with currently available hepatitis C treatments and discuss the remaining treatment challenges, including the high cost of treatment.\nThe authors used information from the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration on the most current estimates of HCV epidemiology, risk factors, and approved interferon-free treatments. PUBMED was searched for examples of HCV treatment in community psychiatry settings.\nThe mental health community is well-positioned to take on a more active role in HCV treatment and engage patients\u05f3 trust in the treatment process.

In adolescents, psychotropic medications may have different efficacy and tolerance profiles compared to those at other stages of the lifespan. Mood stabilizers are a complex pharmacological category including lithium, some anticonvulsants, and some second generation antipsychotics. Focusing on this class of pharmacological agents, we aim to answer the following questions: in which indications and according to which modalities should mood stabilizers be prescribed during adolescence?\nInformation was sought from the websites of the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) and Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 (ANSM), the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) were also reviewed. Additional articles were found using PubMed and Google Scholar. We assumed that guidelines published by a national institute were the most relevant, second information from medical academies, then literature reviews, and finally single studies. Practical prescription data were also sought from the French Vidal Drug Dictionary.\nFor bipolar disorder in adolescents, lithium has been the first drug licensed in France (from the age of 16) and in the USA (from the age of 12), with indications for acute mania and preventive treatment. Benefits for impulsive and self-aggressive behaviour disorders (especially relevant in case of borderline personality disorder) have also been documented, although lithium has not been licensed in any country for those indications. Extended-release tablets are usually used, at doses targeting for a lithiemia between 0.8 and 1.2mEq/L 12hours after last intake. Because of a narrow therapeutic window and potential side effects (especially nephrotoxicity), lithium prescription requires regular blood tests and good treatment compliance. None of the anticonvulsants has been licensed by a national drug administration as a mood stabilizer in adolescents. However, the AACAP recommends valproate as a first line treatment for mania, even though the NICE and the ANSM caution that valproate should not be used by women of child bearing age. Besides its teratogenic and endocrine side effects, valproate exposes one to the risk of hepatic toxicity. That is why regular liver function tests should be prescribed when valproate is chosen. According to the AACAP, carbamazepine (which is licensed for the treatment of mania in adults) is not a first line treatment for adolescents. Indeed, no clinical study has demonstrated its efficacy on manic episodes in adolescents. Moreover, carbamazepine exposes one to the risk of agranulocytosis. Lamotrigine has not been approved for adolescents, but some studies suggest its efficacy for bipolar depression (often a treatment-resistant phase) in this age group. Major side effects are the risk of Lyell or Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (which usually occur within the first eight weeks of treatment). There is no need for biological tests, just clinical monitoring. Pharmacological interactions between lamotrigine and oral contraceptives require caution. Finally, the use of some second generation antipsychotics for bipolar disorder in adolescents has been approved by national drug administrations. In France, only aripiprazole is licensed for acute mania (from the age of 13). In the USA, aripiprazole is licensed from the age of 10 for acute mania and preventive treatment, while risperidone and quetiapine are licensed from the age of 10 for acute mania, and olanzapine is licensed from the age of 13 for acute mania. The AACAP recommends second generation antipsychotics as a first line treatment for bipolar disorder. Moreover, the AACAP and the NICE recommend second generation antipsychotics for behavioural disorders in adolescents. Recommended doses are usually lower and titration slower than for adults. As in adults, adverse effects are metabolic, motor and cognitive disorders. Moreover, hyperprolactinemia, sedation and weight gain are more frequent than in adults.\nEpidemiologic data for prescription of mood stabilizers in adolescents only partially concord with recommendations from drug administrations and scientific societies. On the one hand, there is a trend toward preferential prescription of second generation antipsychotics, on the other hand lithium is hardly prescribed to adolescents, less often than anticonvulsants. Thus, without approval from any drug administration, the anticonvulsants are often preferred to lithium (because of lithium's potential risks due to noncompliance or voluntary poisoning) and to second generation antipsychotics (because of their tolerance profile). Nevertheless, for prescribers it is a complex matter to compare side effects: the frequency and intensity of adverse effects is quite variable from one mood stabilizer to another, and such a thing as an expected value is therefore hard to define. Regardless of the medication chosen, compliance and therapeutic alliance are major issues. Compliance is especially low during adolescence (less than 40% according to a study on bipolar disorder). This lack of compliance has multiple determinants: poor acceptance or misunderstanding of the psychiatric disorder, indirect effects of bad relationships with parents and more generally adults, but also reckless behaviour or death wishes. Improving therapeutic alliance appears as a major challenge for health practitioners dealing with youth. One interesting path of research could be the therapeutic education programs using humanistic communication techniques (addressing both adolescents and their parents) which have already produced encouraging results."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal monitoring of heartbeat dynamics predicts mood changes in bipolar patients: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "Recent research indicates that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is affected in Bipolar Disorders (BD) patients. To determine whether such alterations are a mere expression of the current mood state or rather contain longitudinal information on BD course, we examined the potential influence of states adjacent in time upon HRV features measured in a target mood state.\nLongitudinal evaluation of HRV was obtained in eight BD patients by using a wearable monitoring system developed within the PSYCHE project. We extracted time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear HRV-features and trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify HRV-features according to mood state. To evaluate the influence of adjacent mood states, we trained SVM with different HRV-feature sets: 1) belonging to each mood state considered alone; 2) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from the preceding mood state; 3) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from the preceding and subsequent mood states; 4) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from two randomly chosen states.\nSVM classification accuracy within a target state was significantly greater when HRV-features from the previous and subsequent mood states were considered.\nAlthough preliminary and in need of replications our results suggest for the first time that psychophysiological states in BD contain information related to the subsequent ones. Such characteristic may be used to improve clinical management and to develop algorithms to predict clinical course and mood switches in individual patients."}, {"Title": "Nonverbal behaviors are associated with increased vagal activity in major depressive disorder: Implications for the polyvagal theory.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in nonverbal behaviors (NVBs) and vagal activity. The polyvagal theory proposes that vagal activity regulates heart rate and NVBs by modulating a common anatomically and neurophysiologically discrete social engagement system. However, the association between these putative endophenotypes has not yet been explored. We hypothesize that in MDD, NVBs indicating positive affects and social interest and those indicating negative feelings and social disinterest could be associated with different patterns of vagal activity.\nFor this cross-sectional study we recruited 50 antidepressant-free participants with moderate-to-severe MDD. Vagal activity was indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) measures, and positive and negative nonverbal behaviors (NVBs) by a validated ethogram. Associations between NVBs and HRV were explored by bivariate analyses and multivariable models were adjusted by age, gender, depression severity, and self-reported positive and negative affects.\nHRV measures indicative of higher vagal activity were positively correlated with positive NVBs exhibited during the clinical interview. Conversely, NVBs related to negative affects, low energy and social disinterest were not associated with HRV.\nAbsence of a control group.\nThe findings highlight that the examined depression endophenotypes (nonverbal behaviors and vagal activity) are related, shedding light on MDD pathophysiology in the context of the polyvagal theory."}, {"Title": "Dry Eye Disease in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric conditions and not just the treatments themselves might be involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease (DED).

All met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria for depression. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to measure depression severity and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Stai1, Stai2) for concomitant anxiety symptoms. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Visual Functioning Questionnaires (VFQ25) were completed and used to confirm diagnosis of DED in conjunction with the tear break up time (TBUT), ocular surface vital dye staining, and Schirmer's test.\nThe comparison of depressive and control groups revealed significantly lower Schirmer (20.3 \u00b1 9.9 vs. 25.7 \u00b1 9.3 mm) and TBUT (7.8 \u00b1 5.7 vs. 12.5 \u00b1 7.8 s) scores with a consistently higher Oxford score (1.8 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 0.2 \u00b1 0.4) in the depressive group.

In both groups, the three psychological test scores (Stai1-2 and BDI) were correlated to each other but none of these tests were correlated to OSDI, VRQL, Schirmer, TBUT, and Oxford staining scores.\nOur study shows a definite association between depression and DED.

A cumulative meta-analysis was conducted for each and trial sequential analysis applied to determine when in the course of evidence accrual evidence was found sufficient to reach a reliable conclusion. Trials published afterward were considered potentially unnecessary. Sensitivity analysis is performed, for example, to determine if findings could be explained by a delayed perception of published findings when planning new trials.\nIn 8/13 cases, potentially unnecessary research was detected to an extent of between 12% and 89% of all participants in trials that might not have been needed. In three of these cases with high proportions (69-89%) of potentially unnecessary research, this finding was found basically unchanged in sensitivity analysis, when only trials published 3 or 5\u00a0years after sufficient evidence had already been published were considered potentially wasteful.\nThe reasonableness of claims to relevance of additional trials needs to be much more carefully evaluated in the future.

Physicians often do not address SA with patients, although SA survivors describe a desire to talk to physicians to obtain additional help. Little information exists on how providers perceive their roles regarding caring for women SA survivors and what barriers they face in providing this care.\nWe performed a qualitative study using semistructured one-on-one interviews with 16 faculty physicians from five specialties: obstetrics and gynecology (n = 4), internal medicine (n = 4), family medicine (n = 1), emergency medicine (n = 3), and psychiatry (n = 4). Interviews were conducted between July 2011 and July 2012, transcribed verbatim, and coded using a constant comparative approach. Once a final coding scheme was applied to all transcripts, we identified patterns and themes related to perceived roles and barriers to caring for SA survivors.\nPhysicians described two main categories of roles: clinical tasks (e.g., testing and treating for sexually transmitted infections, managing associated mental health sequelae) and interpersonal roles (e.g., providing support, acting as patient advocate). Physician barriers fell into three main categories: 1) internal barriers (e.g., discomfort with the topic of SA), 2) physician-patient communication, and 3) system obstacles (e.g., competing priorities for time).\nAlthough physicians describe key roles in caring for SA survivors, several barriers hinder their ability to fulfill these roles.

The two posit different areas of atypical brain function, different pathogenic models of disability, and different possible treatments. Evidence for and against each hypothesis is mixed but has thus far focused on older children and adults. The authors evaluated both mechanistic hypotheses in two sets of experiments at the time of initial diagnosis.\nEye-tracking data were collected in 86 2-year-olds: 26 with autism, tested at initial diagnosis; 38 matched typically developing children; and 22 matched developmentally delayed children. In two experiments, the authors measured response to direct and implicit cueing to look at the eyes.\nWhen directly cued to look at the eyes, 2-year-olds with autism did not look away faster than did typically developing children; their latency varied neither categorically nor dimensionally by degree of eye cueing. Moreover, direct cueing had a stronger sustained effect on their amount of eye-looking than on that of typically developing children. When presented with implicit social cues for eye-looking, 2-year-olds with autism neither shifted their gaze away nor more subtly averted their gaze to peripheral locations.\nThe results falsify the gaze aversion hypothesis; instead, at the time of initial diagnosis, diminished eye-looking in autism is consistent with passive insensitivity to the social signals in others' eyes."}, {"Title": "Subjective anger and overt aggression in psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "The attention given to anger and aggression in psychiatric patients pales in comparison to the attention given to depression and anxiety.

Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12-week period. Three measures-the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory-were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures-the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale-were collected at baseline and 12 weeks.\nVHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29-4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08-5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB.\nThe VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment-an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care."}, {"Title": "The Use of an Interpreter During a Forensic Interview: Challenges and Considerations.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this Open Forum is to detail the unique considerations present when using an interpreter in a forensic interview, including whether it is appropriate to take the case, the practical aspects of working with an interpreter, and whether the use of standardized instruments is indicated. While working with the interpreter, a forensic psychiatrist can enhance the interview by discussing the purpose of the interview with the interpreter before it takes place, encouraging accurate translation of information, reviewing incorrect or unusual responses to questions, and considering the evaluee's cultural beliefs. Standardized instruments, which can be very helpful in an English language interview, may be less useful when an interpreter is used."}, {"Title": "Lost Keys: Understanding Service Providers' Impressions of Frequent Visitors to Psychiatric Emergency Services in Singapore.", "Abstract": "This study used administrative data to identify characteristics of frequent users of Singapore's largest specialized psychiatric emergency department (ED). Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand staff opinions of frequent visitors.\nData were from administrative records of all adult visits to the ED (N=16,123 visits of 10,108 individual users) in 2014. Random-effects logistic regressions were used to identify demographic and diagnostic characteristics of frequent visitors. To facilitate interpretation of administrative data in a convergent mixed-methods study design, interviews were conducted with 26 service providers who worked in the ED.\nFrequent use was defined as five or more visits in 2014. This cutoff distinguished the top 3% of users (N=331), and this group accounted for 16% of service use. Frequent users were more likely to have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, personality disorder, or alcohol use disorder. Service provider groups (for example, physicians, nurses, and assistants) described similar groups of frequent users and noted that frequent use was related to lack of social supports outside the hospital and feelings of belonging within it. The most frequently cited challenges were managing intoxicated service seekers, managing expectations for admission, and dealing with threats of self-harm.\nThe profiles of frequent ED users in Singapore resembled those reported in other large urban centers. The opinions of service providers and their reactions to difficult situations were similar to those of providers in nonpsychiatric settings. The service providers' perspectives highlight how societal pressures influence the way in which individuals with mental illnesses use services."}, {"Title": "Mental Health and Social Networks After Disaster.", "Abstract": "Although disasters are a major cause of mental health problems and typically affect large numbers of people and communities, little is known about how social structures affect mental health after a disaster. The authors assessed the extent to which mental health outcomes after disaster are associated with social network structures.\nIn a community-based cohort study of survivors of a major bushfire disaster, participants (N=558) were assessed for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression. Social networks were assessed by asking participants to nominate people with whom they felt personally close. These nominations were used to construct a social network map that showed each participant's ties to other participants they nominated and also to other participants who nominated them. This map was then analyzed for prevailing patterns of mental health outcomes.\nDepression risk was higher for participants who reported fewer social connections, were connected to other depressed people, or were connected to people who had left their community. PTSD risk was higher if fewer people reported being connected with the participant, if those who felt close to the participant had higher levels of property loss, or if the participant was linked to others who were themselves not interconnected. Interestingly, being connected to other people who in turn were reciprocally close to each other was associated with a lower risk of PTSD.\nThese findings provide the first evidence of disorder-specific patterns in relation to one's social connections after disaster. Depression appears to co-occur in linked individuals, whereas PTSD risk is increased with social fragmentation. These patterns underscore the need to adopt a sociocentric perspective of postdisaster mental health in order to better understand the potential for societal interventions in the wake of disaster."}, {"Title": "Fetal Origins of Mental Health: The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis.", "Abstract": "The quality of fetal growth and development predicts the risk for a range of noncommunicable, chronic illnesses. These observations form the basis of the \"developmental origins of health and disease\" hypothesis, which suggests that the intrauterine signals that compromise fetal growth also act to \"program\" tissue differentiation in a manner that predisposes to later illness. Fetal growth also predicts the risk for later psychopathology. These findings parallel studies showing that antenatal maternal emotional well-being likewise predicts the risk for later psychopathology. Taken together, these findings form the basis for integrative models of fetal neurodevelopment, which propose that antenatal maternal adversity operates through the biological pathways associated with fetal growth to program neurodevelopment. The authors review the literature and find little support for such integrated models. Maternal anxiety, depression, and stress all influence neurodevelopment but show modest, weak, or no associations with known stress mediators (e.g., glucocorticoids) or with fetal growth. Rather, compromised fetal development appears to establish a \"meta-plastic\" state that increases sensitivity to postnatal influences. There also remain serious concerns that observational studies associating either fetal growth or maternal mental health with neurodevelopmental outcomes fail to account for underlying genetic factors. Finally, while the observed relation between fetal growth and adult health has garnered considerable attention, the clinical relevance of these associations remains to be determined. There are both considerable promise and important challenges for future studies of the fetal origins of mental health."}, {"Title": "Teaching Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Twenty-First Century: A Reflection on the Role of Technology in Education.", "Abstract": "Technology has become an integral part of everyday life and is starting to shape the landscape of graduate medical education.

As neurons differentiate and the neuronal circuitry is established, several mRNAs undergo alternative splicing and other posttranscriptional changes that expand the variety of protein isoforms produced. Recent advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate isoform switching during neurogenesis and the role played by specific RNA binding proteins in this process. Neurogenesis and neuronal wiring were recently shown to also be regulated by RNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay. An additional layer of regulatory complexity in these biological processes is the interplay between alternative splicing and long noncoding RNAs. Dysregulation of posttranscriptional regulation results in defective neuronal differentiation and/or synaptic connections that lead to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Evolutionary Considerations on the Emerging Subculture of the E-psychonauts and the Novel Psychoactive Substances: A Comeback to the Shamanism?", "Abstract": "Evolutionary research on drug abuse has hitherto been restricted to proximate studies, considering aetiology, mechanism, and ontogeny.

A major shift in psychiatry, embodied in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative of National Institute of Mental Health, recognizes the pitfalls of categorizing mental illnesses using diagnostic criteria. Instead, RDoC encourages researchers to use a dimensional approach, focusing on narrower domains of psychopathology to characterize brain-behavior relationships. Our aim in this multidisciplinary pilot study was to use computer vision tools to record OCD behaviors and to cross-validate these behavioral markers with standard clinical measures.\nEighteen youths with OCD and 21 healthy controls completed tasks in an innovation laboratory (free arrangement of objects, hand washing, arrangement of objects on contrasting carpets). Tasks were video-recorded. Videos were coded by blind raters for OCD-related behaviors. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and other scales were administered. We compared video-recorded measures of behavior in OCD versus healthy controls and correlated video measures and clinical measures of OCD.\nBehavioral measures on the videos were significantly correlated with specific CY-BOCS dimension scores. During the free arrangement task, more time spent ordering objects and more moves of objects were both significantly associated with higher CY-BOCS ordering/repeating dimension scores. Longer duration of hand washing was significantly correlated with higher scores on CY-BOCS ordering/repeating and forbidden thoughts dimensions. During arrangement of objects on contrasting carpets, more moves and more adjustment of objects were significantly associated with higher CY-BOCS ordering/repeating dimension scores.\nPreliminary data suggest that measurement of behavior using video recording is a valid approach for quantifying OCD psychopathology. This methodology could serve as a new tool for investigating OCD using an RDoC approach. This objective, novel behavioral measurement technique may benefit both researchers and clinicians in assessing pediatric OCD and in identifying new behavioral markers of OCD.

Patients were classified into schizophrenia (n=70) and mood disorders (n=26) by psychiatric diagnoses with DSM-IV-TR criteria.\nThe incidence of brain damage [symptomatic and silent brain infarctions (SBIs) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)] was correlated more with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. It has been previously shown that the concentrations of protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in plasma of brain infarction patients together with C-reactive protein (CRP). The concentration of PC-Acro was significantly higher in patients with mood disorders than in those with schizophrenia. The concentration of IL-6 in both groups was nearly equal to that in the control group, but that of CRP in both groups, especially in mood disorders, was higher than that in the control group. Accordingly, the relative risk value for brain infarction was higher in patients with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. Medication with atypical antipsychotics reduced PC-Acro significantly in all psychiatric patients and reduced IL-6 in mood disorder patients.\nMeasurement of 3 biomarkers (CRP, PC-Acro and IL-6) are probably useful for judgement of severity of brain damage and effectiveness of medication in psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Forward psychiatry\u00a0-\u00a0early intervention for mental health problems among UK armed forces in Afghanistan.", "Abstract": "This observational study examined return to duty (RTD) rates following receipt of early mental health interventions delivered by deployed mental health practitioners.\nIn-depth clinical interviews were conducted among 975 UK military personnel referred for mental health assessment whilst deployed in Afghanistan.

Many influences, including the persuasive report of Abraham Flexner in 1910, acted to reorganize medical education in the early twentieth century [1, 2]. In his report, Flexner called on American medical schools to enact higher graduation standards and to stringently adhere to the protocols of mainstream science in their teaching. Prior to this report, UGME had changed little over the previous century but over the last several decades, reform within medical education has become routine. This increasing rate of change has been challenging for those within the realm of undergraduate medical education and can be frustrating to those outside this sphere. Today, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) are typically the driving forces behind such changes, along with acceleration of advances in medical care and technology.

Indeed, many investigators have compared the blood cytokine levels in psychiatric patients with those of healthy controls or monitored their levels in patients during disease progression to identify biomarkers. Nevertheless, very few studies have confirmed that such cytokines remain stable in healthy individuals through periods of weeks and months. This is an important issue to consider before using blood cytokine levels as biomarkers of disease traits, disease state, or treatment response. Although multiplex assay technology represents an advance in identifying biomarkers because it allows simultaneous examination of large panels of analytes from a small volume of sample, it is necessary to verify whether these assays yield enough sensitivity and reproducibility when applied to the blood from neuropsychiatric patients. Therefore, we compared two multiplex immunoassays, the bead-based Luminex<sup>\u00ae</sup> (Bio-Rad) and the electro-chemiluminescence-based V-plex<sup>\u00ae</sup> (MesoScaleDiscovery), for the detection and quantification of 31 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in both the sera and plasma of patients with major depressive episodes (MDE) and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects during a 30-week period. Although both platforms exhibited low coefficients of variability (CV) between the duplicates in the calibration curves, the linearity was better in general for the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. However, neither platform was able to detect the absolute values for all of the tested analytes. Among the 16 analytes that were detected by both assays, the intra-assay reproducibility was in general better with the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. Although it is not a general rule that the results from sera and plasma will be correlated, consistent results were more frequent with the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. Furthermore, the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> results were more consistent with the gold standard ELISA simplex assay for IL-6 in both sera and plasma. The intra-individual variability of the measurements, among the sera and plasma for the 4 samples harvested from each healthy individual, was low for Eotaxin, G-CSF, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-15, MIP-1\u03b2, PDGF-BB, TNF, TNF-\u03b2 and VEGF, but intermediate or high for IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IP10.

The aim of this research was to use a large epidemiological study to identify and characterise depression clusters through \"Graphing lifestyle-environs using machine-learning methods\" (GLUMM).\nTwo ML algorithms were implemented: unsupervised Self-organised mapping (SOM) to create GLUMM clusters and a supervised boosted regression algorithm to describe clusters. Ninety-six \"lifestyle-environ\" variables were used from the National health and nutrition examination study (2009-2010). Multivariate logistic regression validated clusters and controlled for possible sociodemographic confounders.\nThe SOM identified two GLUMM cluster solutions. These solutions contained one dominant depressed cluster (GLUMM5-1, GLUMM7-1). Equal proportions of members in each cluster rated as highly depressed (17%). Alcohol consumption and demographics validated clusters. Boosted regression identified GLUMM5-1 as more informative than GLUMM7-1.

For inclusion in the study, articles had to assess the older population (60\u2009years or older), assess both depressive and resilience symptoms, and investigate the association between these two variables. Articles not employing validated resilience and depression scales or assessing populations younger than 60\u2009years were excluded. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.\nA total of 1094 articles were retrieved from the three databases, 367 of which were duplicates and therefore excluded, giving 727 articles for analysis. Of these articles, seven met the eligibility criteria. All of the included articles were observational and cross-sectional, found an inverse relationship between depression and resilience, and were conducted in three countries: the USA, China, and Belgium. A moderate inverse correlation was found on the meta-analysis (r\u2009=\u2009-0.35, 95% confidence interval: -0.41 to -0.28).\nFew studies were found on this subject in the older population. An association between greater resilience and less depressive symptomatology was identified, albeit based on cross-sectional studies. These results highlight the need for further studies in the area and the importance of fostering the use of interventions to promote resilience in older adults as a means of preventing and managing depressive symptoms in this population.

Rodger's contribution has been largely neglected within the history of Scottish psychiatry. This paper amends this neglect through situating Rodger's eclecticism in relation to both the biopsychosocial approach of his mentors, Adolf Meyer and David Henderson, and psychiatry's de-institutionalization in the 1950s and 1960s. It is posited that Rodger's eclecticism was a considered response to the pressures of this transitional phase to balance physical, psychological and social approaches, and a critical acknowledgement of the instability of contemporary psychiatric therapeutics. More psychodynamic than his predecessors, the importance of social relations for Rodger led him to acknowledge psychiatry's limitations."}, {"Title": "Physical activity and anxiety: A perspective from the World Health Survey.", "Abstract": "Despite the known benefits of physical activity (PA) among people with anxiety, little is known about PA levels in people with anxiety at the population level. This study explored the global prevalence of anxiety and its association with PA.\nCross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Survey was analyzed. Prevalence of anxiety was estimated for 237,964 individuals (47 countries). PA was categorized as low, moderate, and high based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form). The association between PA and anxiety was assessed by multivariable logistic regression.\nThe overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4% (47 countries). Across 38 countries with available data on PA, 62.5%, 20.2%, and 17.3% of the sample engaged in high, moderate, and low levels of PA respectively. The prevalence of low physical activity in those with and without anxiety was 22.9% vs. 16.6% (p<0.001) (38 countries, n=184,920). In the pooled model adjusted for socio-demographics, depression, and country, individuals engaging in low PA (vs. high PA) had 1.32 (95% CI=1.17-1.47) times higher odds for anxiety than those with high PA. Female sex, older age, lower education and wealth, and depression were also associated with low PA. At the individual country level, there was a significant positive association between low PA and anxiety in 17 of the 38 countries.\nLow PA levels are associated with increased prevalence of anxiety.

There is increasing interest in the use of NAC in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders. The rationale for the administration of NAC in psychiatric conditions is based on its role as a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, and its action as a modulating agent of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways. Areas covered: This study reviews the available data regarding the use of NAC in different psychiatric disorders including substance use disorders, autism, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder. Promising results were found in trials testing the use of NAC, mainly as an add-on treatment, in cannabis use disorder in young people, depression in bipolar disorder, negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Despite initial optimism, recent findings regarding NAC efficacy in autism have been disappointing. Expert opinion: These preliminary positive results require further confirmation in larger samples and with longer follow-ups. Given its high tolerability and wide availability, NAC represents an important target to investigate in the field of new adjunctive treatments for psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "Characteristics associated with synthetic cannabinoid use among patients treated in a public psychiatric emergency setting.", "Abstract": "Growing evidence of adverse outcomes following synthetic cannabinoid use has engendered interest into populations at risk. The existing literature reports that synthetic cannabinoid use is predominant among young, white males. However, reports from local Departments of Health have found contrary evidence, showing that synthetic cannabinoid use is prevalent in populations other than those of young, white men.\nThis study sought to examine sociodemographic characteristics associated with self-reported synthetic cannabinoid use among a clinical psychiatric population within a public hospital in New York City.\nA cross-sectional medical record review was conducted on synthetic cannabinoid users and non-users in an emergency psychiatric setting. A total of 948 patients who presented at the emergency psychiatric setting in 2014 were included in this sample, 110 (11.6%) of whom were synthetic cannabinoid users. Logistic regressions were used to determine the sociodemographic correlates of synthetic cannabinoid use.\nThe most prominent correlate of synthetic cannabinoid use was homelessness/residing in a shelter during time of treatment (AOR = 17.77, 95% CI = 9.74-32.5). Male (AOR = 5.37, 95% CI = 2.04-14.1), non-white (AOR = 2.74, 95% CI = 1.36-5.54), and younger age (AOR = .961, 95% CI = .940-.980) were also significant correlates of synthetic cannabinoid use.\nSynthetic cannabinoid use among the homeless and mentally ill is a growing public health concern, representing a population with unique clinical and social needs.

An additional layer of complexity is added when discussing professionalism in the context of digital technology, the internet and social media - the digital world. Current physicians-in-training (residents and fellows) are digital natives having been raised in a digital, media saturated world. Consequently, their use of digital technology and social media has been unconstrained - a reflection of it being integral to their social construct and identity. Cultivating the professional identity and therefore professionalism is the charge of residency training programs. Residents have shown negative and hostile attitudes to formalized professionalism curricula in training. Approaches to these curricula need to consider the learning style of Millennials and incorporate more active learning techniques that utilize technology.

A multidisciplinary team used a grounded theory approach to identify patterns of PDMP use and how PDMP profiles influence clinical decisions.\nPDMP use varied from consistent monitoring to checking the PDMP only on suspicion of misuse, with inconsistent use reported particularly among short-term prescribers. Primary care clinicians reported less routine use with existing pain patients than with new patients. In response to worrisome PDMP profiles with new patients, participants reported declining to prescribe, except in the case of acute, verifiable conditions. Long-term prescribers reported sometimes continuing prescriptions for existing patients depending on perceived patient intent, honesty, and opioid misuse risk. Some long-term prescribers reported discharging patients from their practices due to worrisome PDMP profiles; others expressed strong ethical grounds for retaining patients but discontinuing controlled substances.\nGreater consistency is needed in use of PDMP in monitoring existing patients and in conformity to guidelines against discharging patients from practice.

However, it remains unclear whether people with FES and comorbid depression, compared to those without comorbid depression, have overall poorer emotion recognition, or instead, a different pattern of emotion recognition deficits. The aim of this study was to compare facial and prosody emotion recognition performance between those with and without comorbid depression in FES.\nThis study involved secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of vocational intervention for young people with first-episode psychosis (N=82; age range: 15-25 years).\nThose with comorbid depression (n=24) had more accurate recognition of sadness in faces compared to those without comorbid depression. Severity of depressive symptoms was also associated with more accurate recognition of sadness in faces. Such results did not recur for prosody emotion recognition.\nIn addition to the cross-sectional design, limitations of this study include the absence of facial and prosodic recognition of neutral emotions.\nFindings indicate a mood congruent negative bias in facial emotion recognition in those with comorbid depression and FES, and provide support for cognitive theories of depression that emphasise the role of such biases in the development and maintenance of depression. Longitudinal research is needed to determine whether mood-congruent negative biases are implicated in the development and maintenance of depression in FES, or whether such biases are simply markers of depressed state."}, {"Title": "Henderson and Meyer in correspondence: a transatlantic history of dynamic psychiatry, 1908-29.", "Abstract": "Charting a transatlantic movement of so-called 'dynamic psychiatry' during the early twentieth century, this paper reads against the grain of established historiographies.

One potential path forward is a \"Computational Psychiatry\" approach that leverages computational models of neural circuits to make predictions for the dynamical impact dynamical impact on specific thalamic disruptions hypothesized to occur in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here we review biophysically-based computational models of neural circuit dynamics for large-scale resting-state networks which have been applied to schizophrenia, and for thalamic oscillations. As a key aspect of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is its regional specificity, it is important to consider potential sources of intrinsic heterogeneity of cellular and circuit properties across cortical and thalamic structures."}, {"Title": "Educational Scholarship and Technology: Resources for a Changing Undergraduate Medical Education Curriculum.", "Abstract": "Returning to the original emphasis of higher education, universities have increasingly recognized the value and scholarship of teaching, and medical schools have been part of this educational scholarship movement.

It is indeed admitted that between a third and half of patients with this condition, especially in early-onset forms, receive an initial diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and are then referred to a psychiatric ward. BvFTD can thus be considered a neurological disorder with a psychiatric presentation. Among psychiatric symptoms reported in this disease, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, especially of persecution), which have long been underestimated in bvFTD and are not part of the current diagnostic criteria, are present in about 20% of cases and may be inaugural. They are particularly common in the genetic forms related to a mutation in the C9orf72 gene (up to 50%), and to a lesser extent in the GRN gene (up to 25%). C9orf72 gene mutation is often associated with a family history of dementia or motor neuron disease but also of psychiatric disorders. It has also been described in sporadic presentation forms. Sometimes, the moderate degree of brain atrophy on MRI described in patients carrying this mutation may complicate the differential diagnosis with late-onset psychiatric diseases. In the present article, we underline the importance of considering that psychiatric -\u00a0especially psychotic\u00a0- symptoms are not rare in bvFTD, which should lead to a revision of the diagnostic criteria of this disease by taking greater account of this fact. We also propose a diagnostic chart, based on concerted evaluation by neurologists and psychiatrists for cases of atypical psychiatric symptoms (late-onset or pharmacoresistant troubles) leading to consider the possibility of a neurological disorder, in order to shed a new light on these difficult clinical situations. In the field of research, bvFTD may constitute a model to explore the neural basis of certain psychiatric disorders, and a possible molecular link between bvFTD and psychoses, which could eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches, has been recently suggested. Thus, bvFTD illustrates how the links between neurology and psychiatry are close and tend to evolve with the progress of scientific knowledge.

(KS)].", "Abstract": "The Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic condition characterized by an X\u00a0supernumerary sex chromosome in males. The syndrome is frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Indeed, the different areas of the executive sphere can be affected such as inhibition, cognitive flexibility but also attentional and visual-spatial domain. Social cognition disorders, predominantly on emotional recognition processes, have also been documented. In addition, the syndrome may be associated with psychiatric symptoms.\nOur study aims to characterize of the various components of social cognition in the SK: facial emotional recognition, theory of mind and attributional style. For this two groups (SK group versus control group) of participants (n=16) matched for age and sociocultural level were recruited. Participants with intellectual disabilities, psychiatric or neurological disorders were excluded. Three social cognition tests were available: the TREF, the MASC, the AIHQ. Neurocognitive functions were assessed by the fNart, the subtest \"logical memory\" of the MEM-III, the subtests of the two VOSP battery, the d2, the TMT and the Stroop test.\nThe SK group had specific social cognition disorders in comparison to the control group. Two emotions in particular were less well recognized: fear and contempt. In addition, the SK group had significantly lower results in theory of mind. Regarding the hostile attribution bias, no significant difference was found. Finally, the results showed correlations between specific attentional disorders and facial emotional recognition.\nOur study emphasizes social cognition disorders in SK. These disorders could be considered as a phenotypic trait in the syndrome. The interest of better characterizing the cognitive phenotype of genetic disorders that can affect the neurodevelopment is to offer specific cognitive remediation strategies."}, {"Title": "Self-Reported Training Adequacy, Experience, and Comfort Level in Performing Schizophrenia-Related Clinical Skills among Psychiatry Residents and Fellows.", "Abstract": "In the context of an educational program on schizophrenia for psychiatry trainees, this survey study analyzed associations between self-reported training adequacy, experience in providing patient care, and comfort level in performing schizophrenia-related clinical skills. The influence of the education on comfort level was also assessed for each skill.\nSurvey respondents were psychiatry residents and fellows who participated in a schizophrenia education program at an in-person workshop or through online videos recorded at the workshop. In a pre-program survey, participants reported their experience in providing schizophrenia patient care and rated their training adequacy and comfort level for performing seven clinical skills involved in diagnosing and treating schizophrenia. The post-program survey included items for reassessing comfort level in performing the skills.\nAcross the seven clinical skills, the proportion of respondents (n\u2009=\u200979) who agreed or strongly agreed that their training was adequate ranged from 29 to 88\u00a0%. The proportion of high ratings for comfort level in skill performance ranged from 45 to 83\u00a0%. Comfort level was significantly associated with training adequacy for all seven clinical skills and with experience in providing patient care for four skills. For all skills, comfort level ratings were significantly higher after versus before the educational workshop. Commonly indicated needs for further training included education on new therapies, exposure to a broader range of patients, and opportunities for longitudinal patient management.\nPsychiatry trainees' self-reported, disease-specific training adequacy, experiences, and comfort level have unique applications for developing and evaluating graduate medical curriculum."}, {"Title": "A randomized controlled trial comparing self-referral to inpatient treatment and treatment as usual in patients with severe mental disorders.", "Abstract": "There has been a call for increased patient autonomy and participation in psychiatry. Some Community Mental Health Centres (CMHC) have implemented services called 'self-referral to inpatient treatment' (SRIT) for patients with severe mental disorders.\nTo investigate whether SRIT could yield better outcomes after 12 months in use of mental health services for people with severe mental disorders than Treatment As Usual (TAU).\nThis was a randomized controlled trial at a CMHC in Norway comparing SRIT and TAU in 12 months. Fifty-four patients with severe mental disorders were included. The patients in the SRIT group could admit themselves as inpatients for up to 5 days for each admission with at least a 2 weeks pause between the admittances.\nTwenty out of 26 participants (77%) in the SRIT group used the SRIT for a median of 1.5 admissions and 5 inpatient days. With the exception of a somewhat larger number of admissions at the CMHC in the SRIT group, no significant differences were found between the two groups in days as inpatients, admissions, outpatient contacts or coercion. Both groups reduced their inpatients days by 40%.\nBoth the SRIT and the TAU groups reduced their use of services during the 12 months intervention period. Giving patients with severe mental disorders the possibility to self-refer did not change the use of services.\nSelf-referral to inpatient treatment for patients with severe mental disorders might increase patient autonomy, but does not seem to save use of inpatient services."}, {"Title": "Cost-effectiveness of donepezil and memantine in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (the DOMINO-AD trial).", "Abstract": "Most investigations of pharmacotherapy for treating Alzheimer's disease focus on patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, with little evidence to guide clinical decisions when symptoms become severe. We examined whether continuing donepezil, or commencing memantine, is cost-effective for community-dwelling, moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients.\nCost-effectiveness analysis was based on a 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial. A total of 295 community-dwelling patients with moderate/severe Alzheimer's disease, already treated with donepezil, were randomised to: (i) continue donepezil; (ii) discontinue donepezil; (iii) discontinue donepezil and start memantine; or (iv) continue donepezil and start memantine.\nContinuing donepezil for 52\u2009weeks was more cost-effective than discontinuation, considering cognition, activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. Starting memantine was more cost-effective than donepezil discontinuation. Donepezil-memantine combined is not more cost-effective than donepezil alone.\nRobust evidence is now available to inform clinical decisions and commissioning strategies so as to improve patients' lives whilst making efficient use of available resources. Clinical guidelines for treating moderate/severe Alzheimer's disease, such as those issued by NICE in England and Wales, should be revisited. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

While the ED is known to be a high-pressure environment, the specific organisational stressors which affect ED staff have not been established.\nWe conducted a systematic review of literature examining the sources of organisational stress in the ED, their link to adverse health outcomes and interventions designed to address them. A narrative review of contextual factors that may contribute to occupational stress was also performed. All articles written in English, French or Spanish were eligible for conclusion. Study quality was graded using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.\nTwenty-five full-text articles were eligible for inclusion in our systematic review. Most were of moderate quality, with two low-quality and two high-quality studies, respectively. While high demand and low job control were commonly featured, other studies demonstrated the role of insufficient support at work, effort-reward imbalance and organisational injustice in the development of adverse health and occupational outcomes. We found only one intervention in a peer-reviewed journal evaluating a stress reduction programme in ED staff.\nOur review provides a guide to developing interventions that target the origins of stress in the ED. It suggests that those which reduce demand and increase workers' control over their job, improve managerial support, establish better working relationships and make workers' feel more valued for their efforts could be beneficial.

Within the penological context, cases such as Washington v. Harper, Riggins v. Nevada, and Sell v. United States established the framework for determining when antipsychotic medication may be forcibly administered. Medication decisions under the Sell and Riggins cases are to be approved at judicial hearings; whereas, administrative hearings are sufficient for Harper cases. Forensic psychiatrists are also given responsibility in making the legal decision of whether or not to forcibly treat a patient with psychotropic medication against his will. In making this critical decision, a significant factor that is often minimized is the cultural background of the patient. The purpose of this paper is to present cultural factors to be considered in forced medication. Focusing on the culture defense argument, a review of how the legal system has dealt with cultural implications of a case will be presented. This paper will then discuss cultural issues embedded in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric patients by forensic psychiatrists who are called upon to make the decision of whether or not to force medicate a patient against his will. Lastly, recommendations and a framework for providing a culturally sensitive assessment during the decision to forcibly medicate a patient with psychotropic medication will be offered."}, {"Title": "Relation of Psychiatric Symptoms with Epilepsy, Asthma, and Allergy in Youth with ASD vs. Psychiatry Referrals.", "Abstract": "The present study aimed to characterize the association of psychopathology with the clinical correlates of epilepsy, asthma, and allergy within and between neurobehavioral syndromes. Participants were consecutively evaluated youth (6-18\u00a0years, 75\u00a0% male) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n\u00a0=\u00a0589) and non-ASD outpatient psychiatry referrals (n\u00a0=\u00a0653). Informants completed a background questionnaire (parents) and a psychiatric symptom severity rating scale (parents, teachers). Youth with ASD had higher rates of epilepsy and allergy but not asthma than psychiatry referrals, even when analyses were limited to youth with IQ\u00a0\u2265\u00a070. Somatic conditions evidenced variable associations with medical services utilization, educational interventions, family income, and maternal education. Youth with ASD with versus without epilepsy had more severe ASD social deficits (parents' ratings) and less severe ASD repetitive behaviors (teachers' ratings). Epilepsy was associated with more severe depression, mania, and schizophrenia symptoms in youth with ASD. Youth with allergy (psychiatry referrals only) had more severe anxiety and depression symptoms (parents' ratings) but less severe aggression (teachers' ratings) thus providing evidence of both context- and diagnostic-specificity. Youth with ASD versus non-ASD psychiatry referrals evidence a variable pattern of relations between somatic conditions and a range of clinical correlates, which suggests that the biologic substrates and psychosocial concomitants of neurodevelopmental disorders and their co-occurring somatic conditions may interact to produce unique clinical phenotypes."}, {"Title": "Interrogating the mouse thalamus to correct human neurodevelopmental disorders.", "Abstract": "While localizing sensory and motor deficits is one of the cornerstones of clinical neurology, behavioral and cognitive deficits in psychiatry remain impervious to this approach. In psychiatry, major challenges include the relative subtlety by which neural circuits are perturbed, and the limited understanding of how basic circuit functions relate to thought and behavior. Neurodevelopmental disorders offer a window to addressing the first challenge given their strong genetic underpinnings, which can be linked to biological mechanisms. Such links have benefited from genetic modeling in the mouse, and in this review we highlight how this small mammal is now allowing us to crack neural circuits as well. We review recent studies of mouse thalamus, discussing how they revealed general principles that may underlie human perception and attention. Controlling the magnitude (gain) of thalamic sensory responses is a mechanism of attention, and the mouse has enabled its functional dissection at an unprecedented resolution. Further, modeling human genetic neurodevelopmental disease in the mouse has shown how diminished thalamic gain control can lead to attention deficits. This breaks new ground in how we untangle the complexity of psychiatric diseases; by making thalamic circuits accessible to mechanistic dissection; the mouse has not only taught us how they fundamentally work, but also how their dysfunction can be precisely mapped onto behavioral and cognitive deficits. Future studies promise even more progress, with the hope that principled targeting of identified thalamic circuits can be uniquely therapeutic."}, {"Title": "Spontaneous neural activity in the right superior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus is associated with insight level in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Insight into illness is an important issue for psychiatry disorder. Although the existence of a poor insight subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was recognized in the DSM-IV, and the insight level in OCD was specified further in DSM-V, the neural underpinnings of insight in OCD have been rarely explored. The present study was designed to bridge this research gap by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\nSpontaneous neural activity were examined in 19 OCD patients with good insight (OCD-GI), 18 OCD patients with poor insight (OCD-PI), and 25 healthy controls (HC) by analyzing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the resting state. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between regional ALFFs and insight levels among OCD patients.\nOCD-GI and OCD-PI demonstrated overlapping and distinct brain alterations. Notably, compared with OCD-GI, tOCD-PI had reduced ALFF in left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and right superior temporal gyrus (STG), as well as increased ALFF in right middle occipital gyrus. Further analysis revealed that ALFF values for the left MTG and right STG were correlated negatively with insight level in patients with OCD.\nRelatively small sample size and not all patients were un-medicated are our major limitations.\nSpontaneous brain activity in left MTG and right STG may be neural underpinnings of insight in OCD. Our results suggest the great role of human temporal brain regions in understanding insight, and further underscore the importance of considering insight presentation in understanding the clinical heterogeneity of OCD."}, {"Title": "How do we enhance undergraduate healthcare education in dementia?

Responses include longitudinal integrated clerkships and senior mentor programmes allowing students' longer placements, continuity of contact and opportunities to learn about chronic illness and patient experience. We review their development and delivery in dementia and present the Time for Dementia (TFD) Programme, a novel 2-year interdisciplinary educational programme.\nThe study design involves a scoping review of enhanced placements in dementia for healthcare professionals in training including longitudinal integrated clerkships and senior mentor programmes and a case study of the development of TFD and its evaluation.\nEight enhanced programmes in dementia were identified and seven in the USA. None were compulsory and all lasted 12\u2009months. All reported positive impact from case study designs but data quality was weak.

A qualitative-phenomenological approach was adopted. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 social workers, mental health professionals, who are in contact with ultra-Orthodox Jewish clients. Three major themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Exclusion vs. grace and compassion. (2) Mental health: A professional or cultural arena? (3) Mental health help-seeking changing processes. This study shows that the attitude in the Haredi community toward mental health therapy undergoes a process of change.

Expression profiles of 43 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ risk genes were extracted from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and their average profile across the cortex was correlated to the pattern of cortical disconnectivity as derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of patients with SCZ (n = 48) and matched healthy controls (n = 43).\nThe expression profile of SCZ risk genes across cortical regions was significantly correlated with the regional macroscale disconnectivity (r = .588; p = .017). In addition, effects were found to be potentially specific to SCZ, with transcriptional profiles not related to cortical disconnectivity in patients with bipolar I disorder (diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data; 216 patients, 144 controls). Further examination of correlations across all 20,737 genes present in the Allen Human Brain Atlas showed the set of top 100 strongest correlating genes to display significant enrichment for the disorder, potentially identifying new genes involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ.\nOur results suggest that under disease conditions, cortical areas with pronounced expression of risk genes implicated in SCZ form central areas for white matter disconnectivity."}, {"Title": "Independent or Integrated?

This approach can reconcile psychiatry's perspective with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities. Coercive treatment can be justified only when a patient's capacity to consent is substantially impaired and severe danger to health or life cannot be prevented by less intrusive means. In this case, withholding treatment can violate the principle of justice. In the case of danger to others, social exclusion and loss of freedom can be seen as harming psychosocial health, which can justify coercive treatment. Considerable efforts are required to support patients' informed decisions and avoid allowing others to make substitute decisions. Mental disorder alone without impaired capacity does not justify involuntary treatment, which can be considered a misuse of psychiatry.

Causality of olanzapine-induced blepharospasm as per WHO-UMC scale was probable.\nOlanzapine (atypical antipsychotics) should also be kept in the list of suspected drugs causing blepharospasm in psychotic patients on treatment although further similar evidences from observational studies and/or reports are needed to establish the causal relationship."}, {"Title": "Models of neuromodulation for computational psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry faces fundamental challenges: based on a syndrome-based nosology, it presently lacks clinical tests to infer on disease processes that cause symptoms of individual patients and must resort to trial-and-error treatment strategies. These challenges have fueled the recent emergence of a novel field-computational psychiatry-that strives for mathematical models of disease processes at physiological and computational (information processing) levels. This review is motivated by one particular goal of computational psychiatry: the development of 'computational assays' that can be applied to behavioral or neuroimaging data from individual patients and support differential diagnosis and guiding patient-specific treatment. Because the majority of available pharmacotherapeutic approaches in psychiatry target neuromodulatory transmitters, models that infer (patho)physiological and (patho)computational actions of different neuromodulatory transmitters are of central interest for computational psychiatry. This article reviews the (many) outstanding questions on the computational roles of neuromodulators (dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline), outlines available evidence, and discusses promises and pitfalls in translating these findings to clinical applications.

Data were obtained through a literature review, investigation of DSM archival material housed at the American Psychiatric Association (APA), and interviews with key Task Force members of DSM-III and DSM-III-R. Such data indicate that Task Force votes played a central role in the making of DSM-III, from establishing diagnostic criteria and diagnostic definitions to settling questions about the inclusion or removal of diagnostic categories. The paper concludes that while the APA represented DSM-III, and the return to descriptive psychiatry it inaugurated, as a triumph of empirically based decision-making, the evidence presented here fails to support that view. Since the DSM is a cumulative project, and as DSM-III lives on through subsequent editions, this paper calls for a more socio-historically informed understanding of DSM's construction to be deployed in how the DSM is taught and implemented in training and clinical settings."}, {"Title": "[Description of current hypnosis practice in French university hospitals].", "Abstract": "Hypnosis is very fashionable as an entertainment through TV shows searching for new sensational experiences. What about its practice in the medical world? The aim of this article is to answer to this question. Therefore, we contacted every French University Hospital of each region to find out if hypnosis was practiced for the care of pain (hypnoanalgesia), for chirurgical procedures (hypnosedation) and in adult psychiatry care units (hypnotherapy). For this last practice, we also questioned the type of indications. All 30 of the French University Hospitals had replied by November 2015. Hypnoanalgesia is practiced by all and two-thirds offer hypnosedation. Hypnotherapy is practiced by 40\u00a0% of the University Hospitals, 91,7\u00a0% for anxiety disorders, 66,7\u00a0% for psychotraumatic care and 25\u00a0% for mood disorders.

It is also involved in the synthesis of several neurotransmitters. Nutritional iron deficiency is one of the most widespread worldwide; it poses a great health challenge due to the consequences it entails.\nThe aim of this research study is to explore the percentage of psychiatric patients who have a deficiency in iron. In addition, the study investigates the efficacy of iron administered by oral treatment on psychiatric symptomatology among iron deficient patients. The research study utilized the martial biological results, which involved the observation of the level of iron deficiency among the outpatients of a local psychiatrist and assessor from the period of January 2012 until December 2013.\nOut of 412 patients, 295 were women and 117 men. The age of the participants ranged from 16 to 89years, with an average age of 45years. The only exclusion criterion was a patient's refusal or inability to take the prescribed iron assessment test. We considered a transferrin saturation coefficient (TSC)<30% and/or a serum ferritin level\u226450ng/mL to be \"indicative\" of obvious iron deficiency, and a ferritin level between 51 and 100ng/mL to be \"suggestive\" of iron deficiency. A plasma ferritin assay was performed at least once on all of the participants prior to any proposed iron treatment. A calculation of the TSC in 138 patients was requested due to suspected iron deficiency despite a blood ferritin level of>100ng/ml. A single method was utilized in the various laboratories to analyse the blood samples to determine whether there was a deficiency in iron. Only those patients with blood ferritin levels \u2264100ng/mL and/or a TSC of<30% (335 patients) were subsequently given exclusively an oral iron treatment prescribed on its own or as a supplement or simultaneously with psychotropic treatment. The daily administered dose of elemental iron varied between 50 and 200mg a day.\nAbout half of the women\u00a0-\u00a0145 (35.19% of the subjects)\u00a0-\u00a0and 15 men (3.64% of the subjects) certainly had a deficiency in iron (blood ferritin level\u226450ng/mL). Ninety women and 24 men (27.6% of the subjects) had blood ferritin levels between 51 and 100ng/mL indicating iron deficiency, and 28 women and 33 men (14.8% of the subjects) had a TSC of<30% despite a blood ferritin level of>100ng/mL. Overall, 335 patients (81.3% of the subjects) showed an iron deficiency based on the criteria we set. In the remaining 77 patients (18.7% of the subjects), all of them had blood ferritin levels>100ng/mL and some had TSC\u226430%, while the remaining patients' TSC was unknown because it was not measured. The results indicated that there is an iron deficiency in 198 out of 240 patients suffering mostly from mood and behavioural disorders, in 101 out of 126 patients suffering mostly from anxiety disorders, in 18 out of 27 patients suffering mostly from sleep disorders, in 14 out of 15 patients suffering mostly from delusions of persecution, and in the 4 patients suffering mostly from burn out. There was evidence of regression/remission of psychiatric symptoms in 193 responsive patients whereas the remaining 142 patients were considered non-responsive. In the responsive patient category, 37 participants were treated with just iron, 52 received iron supplemented to the initial psychotropic treatment which was not fully effective, and 104 patients were treated with iron and prescribed psychotropic drugs simultaneously. The iron treatment seems to bring about a reduction\u00a0-\u00a0particularly through its mono-aminergic neurotransmitter synthesis-promoting action\u00a0-\u00a0in hyperemotivity, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, sadness, anhedonia, apathy, asthenia, sleep disorders, dysautonomia symptoms, eating disorders, restless-leg syndrome, cognitive performance and the likelihood of resorting to psychiatric admission. A daily elemental iron dose intake between 50 and 200mg/day by deficient patients appears to likely enhance the effects of the psychotropic drugs and even to act as an actual antidepressant. Many patients who received a prescription for iron and antidepressants showed few side effects related to antidepressants and a small number required psychiatric hospitalization. Patients considered unresponsive to iron therapy were those who left the study, were not assessed because the study's timeframe ended, still had an iron deficiency because they did not continuously take the medication, or suffered from somatic diseases which explains their resistance to treat the low iron level (nutritional imbalance, digestive or urinary or gynecological or iatrogenic diseases, sleep apnea).\nOur clinical observation of two years in a local psychiatrist's clinic revealed that over 80% of patients had iron deficiency. Although the low iron level cannot explain all physical and psychiatric symptoms in patients, it is useful to note that more than half of the iron deficient patients responded favorably after an oral treatment of iron. This result leads to further investigation of the level of iron in psychiatric patients and to reconsider the iron range placed by the laboratories. In addition, it is crucial not to eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency in psychiatric patients. Further research studies are needed to set more specific and detailed criteria to determine the range of iron deficiency in order to support the findings of this study and optimize the care given to patients suffering from various disorders and psychiatric syndromes."}, {"Title": "Teaching Medical Ethics in Graduate and Undergraduate Medical Education: A Systematic Review of Effectiveness.", "Abstract": "One objective was to identify and review studies on teaching medical ethics to psychiatry residents.

Search terms included ethics, bioethics, medical ethics, medical students, residents/registrars, teaching, education, outcomes, and controlled trials.\nNine studies were found that met inclusion criteria, including five randomized controlled trails and four controlled non-randomized trials. Subjects included medical students (5 studies), surgical residents (2 studies), internal medicine house officers (1 study), and family medicine preceptors and their medical students (1 study). Teaching methods, course content, and outcome measures varied considerably across studies. Common methodological issues included a lack of concealment of allocation, a lack of blinding, and generally low numbers of subjects as learners. One randomized controlled trial which taught surgical residents using a standardized patient was judged to be especially methodologically rigorous.\nNone of the trials incorporated psychiatry residents.

Violence committed by a person with ADHD seems to be against other persons rather than property offences. Reactive-impulsive violence seems to be more prevalent than pro-active instrumental violence. The existence of ADHD does not appear as a risk factor of recidivism. The violence risk may be increased by the occurrence of comorbidities as conduct disorders and mental deficiency. There may exist a preferential association between ADHD and antisocial personality disorder or substance abuse which both increase the risk of violence.\nTo put in perspective forensic psychiatry and ADHD allowed us to identify typology of violence, epidemiological aspect of ADHD in a prison environment and comorbidities involved in the risk of violence.

Child attachment was assessed with the gold standard separation-reunion procedure for preschoolers. Parents completed the sensory profile, which assesses the presence of child hypersensitivity (sensitivity and avoidant scale) and hyposensitivity (sensory seeking and registration scale).\nData showed that 57% of the children were presented with clinical symptoms of sensory regulation. In addition, 53% of the children were classified insecure behaviorally disorganized or insecure disorganized controlling.

Non-verbal intelligence was measured at 5 years ( n=5001) and children were tested with a neuropsychological battery at 7 years ( n=1194). Prenatal SSRI exposure was not related to maternal reported executive function at 4 years, nor was it related with observed non-verbal intelligence at age 5 or neuropsychological function at 7 years. Exposure to untreated maternal depressive symptoms was related to maternal reported shifting problems and emotional control problems at 4 years.

This may be partially due to limited statistical power from relatively small samples and clinical heterogeneity related to variation in illness profile and developmental stage. To address these limitations, the authors conducted meta- and mega-analyses of data from OCD sites worldwide.\nT<sub>1</sub> images from 1,830 OCD patients and 1,759 control subjects were analyzed, using coordinated and standardized processing, to identify subcortical brain volumes that differ between OCD patients and healthy subjects. The authors performed a meta-analysis on the mean of the left and right hemisphere measures of each subcortical structure, and they performed a mega-analysis by pooling these volumetric measurements from each site. The authors additionally examined potential modulating effects of clinical characteristics on morphological differences in OCD patients.\nThe meta-analysis indicated that adult patients had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes (Cohen's d=-0.13; % difference=-2.80) and larger pallidum volumes (d=0.16; % difference=3.16) compared with adult controls. Both effects were stronger in medicated patients compared with controls (d=-0.29, % difference=-4.18, and d=0.29, % difference=4.38, respectively). Unmedicated pediatric patients had significantly larger thalamic volumes (d=0.38, % difference=3.08) compared with pediatric controls. None of these findings were mediated by sample characteristics, such as mean age or scanning field strength. The mega-analysis yielded similar results.\nThe results indicate different patterns of subcortical abnormalities in pediatric and adult OCD patients. The pallidum and hippocampus seem to be of importance in adult OCD, whereas the thalamus seems to be key in pediatric OCD. These findings highlight the potential importance of neurodevelopmental alterations in OCD and suggest that further research on neuroplasticity in OCD may be useful."}, {"Title": "Emergency psychiatry: a product of circumstance or a growing sub-speciality field?", "Abstract": "This article reviews recent trends in the provision of psychiatric services to the emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in Australia, involving the establishment of specialised in-reach or liaison services as well as various forms of short stay unit attached to emergency departments.

As yet, however, there is a dearth of data examining these relationships. Our study examined the contributions of grief and a sense of injustice to a model of PTSD symptoms that included the established determinants of trauma events, ongoing adversity and severe psychological distress. The study involved a large population sample (n = 2964, response rate: 82.4%) surveyed in post-conflict Timor-Leste.\nThe survey sites included an urban administrative area (suco) in Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste and a rural village located an hour's drive away. Culturally adapted measures were applied to assess conflict related traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, persisting preoccupations with injustice, symptoms of grief, psychological distress (including depressive symptoms) and PTSD symptoms.\nWe tested a series of structural equation models, the final comprehensive model, which included indices of grief symptoms and injustice, producing a good fit. Locating grief symptoms as the endpoint of the model produced a non-converging model. In the final model, strong associations were evident between grief and injustice (\u03b2 = 0.34, s.e. = 0.02, p < 0.01) and grief and PTSD symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.14, s.e. = 0.02, p < 0.01).

Correlations were generated between key survey responses and the average number of care management contacts, patient depression, blood pressure and glycosylated hemoglobin outcomes.\nPatients of care managers who reported spending more time on COMPASS-related tasks had higher rates of depression improvement (r=0.34; P=.002) and remission (r=0.27; P=.02) as well as higher rates of blood pressure control (r=0.29; P=.03).\nTo improve the effectiveness of care management in collaborative care models, particularly for patients with comorbid conditions and complex nonmedical needs, care managers need the support of social work and administrative support staff. Care managers for this patient population would also benefit from more intensive training in nonpharmacological depression treatment, such as motivational interviewing and behavioral activation. Additionally, systems support is needed such as education for primary care teams and psychiatry on the value of collaborative care models and integration of population management tools into electronic medical records."}, {"Title": "[The proportion of unaccompanied refugee minors suffering from psychiatric disorders in Germany].", "Abstract": "This article is the first investigation into the proportion of unaccompanied refugee minors suffering from psychiatric disorders in Germany. Method: In a retrospective study done between 2013 and 2015, any refugees showing symptoms of a psychiatric disorder during their stay in a residential refugee center were referred to an Outpatient Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for diagnostic assessment. To this end, special consultation hours were arranged. Besides the diagnoses, the number of emergency consultations occurring before and after the implementation of the special consultation hours was recorded.\nOf the 75 refugee minors (75 %) referred, 56 were suffering from a psychiatric disorder, with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression being the most common diagnoses. Following implementation of the consultation hours, the number of refugee patients initially admitted in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry on an emergency basis fell.\nUnaccompanied refugee minors are a highly vulnerable group that poses great challenges to clinical care. The implementation of special consultation hours is a constructive option for meeting these challenges.

The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether lower hippocampal volume in late-life depression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nOf 108 subjects who participated, complete, good-quality data sets were available for 100: 48 currently depressed older adults and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy comparison subjects who underwent structural MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography imaging, apolipoprotein E genotyping, and neuropsychological assessment. Hippocampal volumes were defined manually and normalized for total intracranial volume. Amyloid binding was quantified using the standardized uptake value ratio in one cortical composite volume of interest. The authors investigated group differences in hippocampal volume (both including and excluding amyloid-positive participants), group differences in amyloid uptake and in the proportion of positive amyloid scans, and the association between hippocampal volume and cortical amyloid uptake.\nA significant difference was observed in mean normalized total hippocampal volume between patients and comparison subjects, but there were no group differences in cortical amyloid uptake or proportion of amyloid-positive subjects. The difference in hippocampal volume remained significant after the amyloid-positive subjects were excluded. There was no association between hippocampal volume and amyloid uptake in either patients or comparison subjects.\nLower hippocampal volume was not related to amyloid pathology in this sample of patients with late-life depression.

His theories, however, did not arise de novo, being strongly influenced by Karl Kahlbaum and Ewald Hecker. From the 1860-1880s, they articulated a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of psychiatric diagnosis, from symptom-based syndromes, popular since the late 18th century, to proto-disease entities. This effort was influenced by parallel developments in general medicine, especially the rise of bacterial theories of disease where different syndromes had distinctive symptoms, courses, and etiologies. Their thinking was particularly shaped by the increasing understanding of general paresis of the insane. Indeed, this disorder, with its distinct course and characteristic symptoms, was paradigmatic for them. Their hope was that a similar progression of medical understanding would evolve for the other major psychiatric syndromes. Their thinking and its connection with Kraepelin's nosology are illustrated through a close reading of their essays on hebephrenia, catatonia, and cyclic insanity. Kahlbaum, Hecker, and Kraepelin shared both a commitment to a clinical research agenda for psychiatry (to utilize methods of clinical assessment and follow-up to help define disease forms) and a skepticism for the brain-based neuropathological paradigm of psychiatric research then dominant in most European centers. Understanding the historical origins of our key diagnostic concepts can help us to evaluate their strengths and limitations. It remains to be determined whether this \"Kahlbaum-Hecker-Kraepelin paradigm\"-defining disorders based on distinctive symptoms and course-will produce psychiatric syndromes of sufficient homogeneity to yield their etiologic secrets."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: Analysis based on the multicentre DPV registry.", "Abstract": "The interaction between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents has been studied rarely.

It also explored the factors related to delayed discharge and the likelihood of patients admitted from home returning there.\nData were collected on the sociodemographic, clinical and service receipt characteristics of a 6-month series of admissions to seven wards in England in 2010/2011. The cohort was followed for a 9- to 11-month period. The relationship between patients' status on admission and the specified outcome variables was explored.\nInformation was collected on 216 admissions, of whom 165 were discharged in the study period. Mean length of stay was 64\u2009days. Female gender, higher dependency, greater challenging behaviour and locality predicted extended stay. Forty per cent of cases experienced delayed discharge. Better physical health, more cognitive impairment, receipt of social care and locality were associated with delayed discharge. The vast majority of patients admitted from home returned there. Younger patients and patients with less dependency, cognitive impairment and challenging behaviour had a higher likelihood of returning home. Patients receiving social care or admitted because of carer stress, a risk of self-neglect, accidental self-harm or abuse/exploitation were less likely to return home.\nThe study provides a useful starting point for identifying cases on which future efforts to improve inpatient outcomes might centre and suggests local rather than national responses may be needed.

With increasing recognition that kynurenine and its metabolites can affect and even control a variety of classic neurotransmitter systems directly and indirectly, interest is expanding rapidly. Moreover, kynurenine pathway metabolism itself is modulated in conditions such as infection and stress, which are known to induce major changes in well-being and behaviour, so that kynurenines may be instrumental in the etiology of psychiatric and neurological disorders. It is therefore likely that the near future will not only witness the discovery of additional physiological and pathological roles for brain kynurenines, but also ever-increasing interest in drug development based on these roles. In particular, targeting the kynurenine pathway with new specific agents may make it possible to prevent disease by appropriate pharmacological or genetic manipulations. The following overview focuses on areas of kynurenine research which are either controversial, of major potential therapeutic interest, or just beginning to receive the degree of attention which will clarify their relevance to neurobiology and medicine. It also highlights technical issues so that investigators entering the field, and new research initiatives, are not misdirected by inappropriate experimental approaches or incorrect interpretations at this time of skyrocketing interest in the subject matter.

This gap arises from several beliefs: (1) psychiatric nomenclature does not allow the diagnosis of PD in adolescence; (2) certain features of PD are normative and not particularly symptomatic of personality disturbance; (3) the symptoms of PD are better explained by other psychiatric syndromes; (4) adolescents' personalities are still developing and therefore too unstable to warrant a PD diagnosis; and (5) because PD is long-lasting, treatment-resistant and unpopular to treat, it would be stigmatising to label an adolescent with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In this paper, the empirical evidence challenging each of these beliefs is evaluated in the hope of providing a balanced review of the validity of adolescent PD with a specific focus on BPD. The paper concludes with recommendations on how routine clinical care can integrate a PD focus."}, {"Title": "[Social psychiatry and neurobiology : A long overdue convergence exemplified by schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "The proliferation of biological psychiatry has greatly increased over the last two decades.

The article presents the options for a biosocial approach in social psychiatry and gives an overview of the currently available literature.\nThere is an abundance of neurobiological research approaches, which are closely associated with sociopsychiatric topics, such as social cognition.

Four semi-structured focus groups were conducted in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland. A total of 28 service users' narratives were examined using the inductive thematic analysis approach. Five main recovery themes emerged from the combined users accounts, listed in order of frequency: psychological dimension of recovery, relationships with others, wellness strategies, clinical understanding of recovery and support systems. Service user recommendations referred to the above identified recovery themes as well as indications that the intervention should be flexible, individualized, and facilitative of personal growth. The findings indicate that for service users with lived experience of schizophrenia in Poland it is culturally feasible to embrace the person-oriented approach to practice and develop a recovery-oriented psychosocial intervention emphasizing psychological domains of recovery such as positive identity, personal strengths, or meaning and purpose in life alongside the other relevant recovery dimensions.

Using insights from computational reinforcement-learning models and basic-science studies of the dopamine system, we show that each of these two disturbances contributes to a specific symptom domain and explains a large set of experimental findings associated with that domain. Reduced phasic responses for relevant stimuli help to explain negative symptoms and provide a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with negative symptoms: reduced learning from rewards; blunted activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for rewards and positive prediction errors; blunted activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation; blunted autonomic responding for relevant stimuli; blunted neural activation for aversive outcomes and aversive prediction errors; reduced willingness to expend effort for rewards; and psychomotor slowing. Increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release helps to explain positive symptoms and provides a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with positive symptoms: aberrant learning for neutral cues (assessed with behavioral and autonomic responses), and aberrant, increased activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for neutral cues, neutral outcomes, and neutral prediction errors. Taken together, then, these two disturbances explain many findings in schizophrenia. We review evidence supporting their co-occurrence and consider their differential implications for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms."}, {"Title": "Vive La France: Three Delusional Disorders Originally Reported in the French Medical Literature.", "Abstract": "Delusions as a feature of psychosis have long captured the fascination of both psychiatry and the public at large.

Legal decisions concerning the sentencing, management and disposition of offenders often rely on the advice of such testimony. The burgeoning use of violence risk instruments in these settings undoubtedly injects a level of scientific rigour into forensic evaluations for courts and tribunals. Yet scrutiny of the inherent limitations of both risk instruments and the inferences and formulations drawn from them are often veiled by the discipline's endorsement for such approaches. Misconceptions about the validity and dependability of present-day risk assessments and expert infallibility persist. The furtive influences that shape both the (mis)interpretation and miscommunication of risk instruments in legal settings necessitate discussion."}, {"Title": "Australian Psychiatrists' Support for Psychiatric Advance Directives: Responses to a Hypothetical Vignette.", "Abstract": "This study examines whether Australian psychiatrists would support requests in a psychiatric advance directive (PAD) and the reasons underlying their decisions in response to a hypothetical vignette. An online survey was completed by 143 psychiatrists. Fewer than 3 out of 10 psychiatrists supported the patient to create a PAD which requested cessation of pharmacotherapy (27%) or remaining out of hospital and not being subject to an involuntary treatment order (24%) should their depression condition deteriorate. A thematic analysis showed that patient autonomy was the strongest theme among those who supported the patient to create a PAD, whereas the clinical profile of and risk to the patient and the professional or ethical imperative of the psychiatrist were strongest among those who were unsure about supporting the patient or who did not support the patient. These findings provide a challenge about how to fulfil obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006)."}, {"Title": "Does Diet Matter? The Use of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) and Other Dietary Supplements in Inflammation-Associated Depression.", "Abstract": "An increasingly pertinent issue in psychiatry in recent years is that of the limitations of conventional antidepressants, which are not effective in a large number of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Coupled with emerging hypotheses about the role of inflammation in depression, it would appear that it is time to look for alternative treatments for these symptoms.This review will examine an emerging area in psychiatry, that of dietary supplements and the diet in general to treat depressive symptoms, and inflammation in depression. In particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), probiotics and folic acid are three supplements that demonstrate the ability to target inflammation and other underlying systems in depression. While there is a definite need for more research in all these supplements to determine true efficacy, dosage and target populations, they can be used as mono- or adjunctive therapies to good effect, and show superior safety profiles when compared with more traditional alternatives."}, {"Title": "Observing Electroconvulsive Therapy Changes Students' Attitudes: A Survey of Croatian Medical Students.", "Abstract": "To assess the impact of education and direct observation of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on medical students' attitudes toward ECT in particular and psychiatric treatment in general in Croatia.\nTwo self-administered questionnaires were completed by year 4 medical students twice, at the beginning and the end of the psychiatry clerkship. Students were divided into 2 groups: those who observed an ECT session (47.9%) and those who did not (52.1%).\nThe survey was completed by 190 students yielding a response rate of 79.8%. Students' attitudes toward ECT and other methods of psychiatric treatment and psychiatry in general changed in positive direction after the clerkship in both groups. However, the attitudes toward ECT of students who observed a live ECT session became more positive than those who did not. Likewise, students who observed ECT were more likely to agree to receive ECT and had better knowledge about ECT compared with the other group.\nHaving watched a live ECT session had a positive effect on students' attitudes toward ECT and other types of psychiatric treatment. Watching live ECT sessions should be mandatory during the psychiatric clerkship."}, {"Title": "Multi-center MRI prediction models: Predicting sex and illness course in first episode psychosis patients.", "Abstract": "Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have attempted to use brain measures obtained at the first-episode of psychosis to predict subsequent outcome, with inconsistent results. Thus, there is a real need to validate the utility of brain measures in the prediction of outcome using large datasets, from independent samples, obtained with different protocols and from different MRI scanners. This study had three main aims: 1) to investigate whether structural MRI data from multiple centers can be combined to create a machine-learning model able to predict a strong biological variable like sex; 2) to replicate our previous finding that an MRI scan obtained at first episode significantly predicts subsequent illness course in other independent datasets; and finally, 3) to test whether these datasets can be combined to generate multicenter models with better accuracy in the prediction of illness course. The multi-center sample included brain structural MRI scans from 256 males and 133 females patients with first episode psychosis, acquired in five centers: University Medical Center Utrecht (The Netherlands) (n=67); Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London (United Kingdom) (n=97); University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) (n=64); University of Cantabria, Santander (Spain) (n=107); and University of Melbourne (Australia) (n=54). All images were acquired on 1.5-Tesla scanners and all centers provided information on illness course during a follow-up period ranging 3 to 7years. We only included in the analyses of outcome prediction patients for whom illness course was categorized as either \"continuous\" (n=94) or \"remitting\" (n=118). Using structural brain scans from all centers, sex was predicted with significant accuracy (89%; p<0.001). In the single- or multi-center models, illness course could not be predicted with significant accuracy. However, when reducing heterogeneity by restricting the analyses to male patients only, classification accuracy improved in some samples. This study provides proof of concept that combining multi-center MRI data to create a well performing classification model is possible. However, to create complex multi-center models that perform accurately, each center should contribute a sample either large or homogeneous enough to first allow accurate classification within the single-center."}, {"Title": "Biological markers for anxiety disorders, OCD and PTSD: A consensus statement.

More research is needed into the meaning of recovery and what strengthens the desire to live. The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of recovery in a context of nursing care as experienced by persons at risk of suicide. In line with a reflective lifeworld research approach, 14 patients from a psychiatric clinic in Sweden participated in phenomenon-oriented interviews. Data were analyzed to describe the essence of the phenomenon. The results reveal that the phenomenon of recovery means 'reconnecting with oneself while struggling between life and death'. Three meaning constituents emerged: being in an expressive space and giving voice to oneself, regaining dignity through nurturing connectedness, and finding a balance in the tension between life and death. In conclusion, the meaning of recovery is to experience the ability to manage one's own life. Professional caregivers need to acknowledge patients' lifeworlds, in a way that enable patients to experience themselves as capable of managing their own lives. Professional caregivers should also facilitate the involvement of supportive relatives."}, {"Title": "Lifetime rates and correlates of crime victimisation in young people with mental ill-health.", "Abstract": "Research on crime victimisation in the mentally ill has focused on middle aged cohorts with long-standing illness and functional disability. The rates and correlates of victimisation in young cohorts is largely unknown.\nParticipants ( n=776) were aged 12-25 years attending headspace centres in Australia, who consented to a clinical interview and provided self-reported data regarding lifetime victimisation.\nA quarter of the sample (24.5%) reported crime victimisation, including 18.5% who experienced violent victimisation (mainly physical or sexual assault) and 14.1% non-violent crime. Both forms of victimisation were associated with illicit substance use, sexual orientation, and young adult age, while male gender was specifically associated with non-violent victimisation. Participants who reported violent victimisation were significantly more impaired both functionally and clinically than those reporting non-violent victimisation or no victimisation.\nYoung people with mental ill-health are vulnerable to criminal victimisation, particularly violent assaults, although the lifetime rates of victimisation are substantially lower than those observed in older cohorts with serious mental illness.

We investigated the frequency of physical aggression by patients between 2008 and 2015 in two hospitals for psychiatry and psychotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> Aggressive and violent events were routinely assessed (spontaneous reports) and were analyzed in a differentiated way. <b>Results:</b> The frequency of aggressive behavior of patients towards others showed a slightly, but significantly increase since 2008, although at a low level. This increase was almost entirely caused by an increase of aggressive assaults against nursing staff. <b>Conclusions:</b> The relative frequency of aggressive behavior by patients (4/1000 cases) was on average rather low. The increase of assaults particularly against nursing personnel gives nonetheless reason to scrutinize and continuously optimize measures for prevention and therapy of patients' aggressive behavior."}, {"Title": "[Coercive Interventions in Psychiatry: Prevention and Patients' Preferences].", "Abstract": "<b>Objective</b> This study explores patients' preferences and measures of prevention of coercive methods in psychiatric treatment. <b>Methods</b> Structured interviews of 90 patients with psychotic disorders were undertaken, most of whom had previously experienced coercive methods. <b>Results</b> Participants saw preventive potential in a wider availability of individual non-pharmacological therapy, improvement of staff professional competence and communication skills, high staff-to-patient ratios and retreat facilities. The majority of participants preferred forced medication and manual restraint in case of self-endangerment, and forced medication and mechanical restraint in the event of endangerment of others. <b>Conclusion</b> Patients' suggestions relating to prevention of coercion are in line with most expert's opinions.

Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that opening psychiatric wards can reduce the number of aggressive assaults and of coercive treatment without increasing absconding rates. <b>Methods</b> Numbers of absconding, coercive medication, fixation and special security actions were collected retrospectively and compared between phases of closed (N total\u200a=\u200a409; N legally committed\u200a=\u200a64) and 90\u200a% of daytime opened (N total\u200a=\u200a571; N legally committed\u200a=\u200a99) doors in an acute psychiatric ward. <b>Results</b> During the phase of opened doors we observed significantly reduced aggressive assaults (p\u200a<\u200a0,001) and coercive medication (p\u200a=\u200a0,006) compared to the closed setting, while the absconding rate did not change (p\u200a=\u200a0,20). <b>Limitation</b> Given the retrospective non-experimental design, no causal interpretations can be drawn. <b>Conclusion</b> The results suggest that open door is associated with reduction of aggressive assaults and coercive medication without increasing absconding rates. This speaks for a stronger implementation of open door policies in acute wards in order to preserve human rights in psychiatry.

Little is known about the occurrence of HA symptoms in a child and adolescent psychiatric setting, and there are no age-appropriate diagnostic criteria and only limited number of assessment tools. It is therefore likely that HA is seen as part of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to construct overlap and the diagnostic uncertainty of HA in this age group. In the present study, the extent of HA symptoms was investigated in 94 children and adolescents with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis of OCD. Self-reported HA symptoms were assessed using the Childhood Illness Attitude Scales. Clinician-rated OCD symptoms and severity were measured using the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Information on socio-demographics was obtained from the child's/adolescent's medical record. The distribution of HA symptoms resembled a normal curve shifted to the right compared with a normal population of Danish children, and 30\u00a0% presented with high HA symptoms. Chi-squared tests were used to examine the proportion of children and adolescents with high HA symptoms in relation to various clinical characteristics. Clinician-rated illness worries and comorbid anxiety disorder were associated with high self-reported HA symptoms. The results contribute to the understanding of how HA and OCD overlap conceptually in young patients and bring attention to the need for improved recognition of OCD patients dominated by illness worries. Further research in the description of childhood HA is important in order to understand whether HA is a distinct disorder early in life."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant use and violent crimes among young people: a longitudinal examination of the Finnish 1987 birth cohort.", "Abstract": "The use of antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been questioned due to poor efficacy and safety.

Data on psychotropic drug use came from a register of reimbursed drugs and data on crimes from a register on court convictions (after the age of 14\u2005years). Participants were followed until the age of 18\u2005years, and for some analyses until the end of the follow-up (mean 21\u2005years). To adjust for differences in background characteristics, regression analyses for antidepressant use were made, using the no-conviction group as the reference.\nProportions of young people convicted by the age of 18\u2005years were: 5% of boys (1.7% for violent crimes) and 1% (0.5%) of girls. Antidepressant use (both overall and for SSRIs) prior to violent crime was more common among those convicted than among those without convictions. Among boys with repeated violent crimes, it was also more common than among boys with non-violent crimes. Adjustment for differences in background characteristics decreased the associations between antidepressant use and violent crime, but did not eliminate them.\nThe results add further evidence for caution in prescribing antidepressants among young persons.

A Philosophical Matter to Consider.", "Abstract": "The potential for artificial intelligences and robotics in achieving the capacity of consciousness, sentience and rationality offers the prospect that these agents have minds. If so, then there may be a potential for these minds to become dysfunctional, or for artificial intelligences and robots to suffer from mental illness. The existence of artificially intelligent psychopathology can be interpreted through the philosophical perspectives of mental illness. This offers new insights into what it means to have either robot or human mental disorders, but may also offer a platform on which to examine the mechanisms of biological or artificially intelligent psychiatric disease. The possibility of mental illnesses occurring in artificially intelligent individuals necessitates the consideration that at some level, they may have achieved a mental capability of consciousness, sentience and rationality such that they can subsequently become dysfunctional. The deeper philosophical understanding of these conditions in mankind and artificial intelligences might therefore offer reciprocal insights into mental health and mechanisms that may lead to the prevention of mental dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Computational neuroimaging strategies for single patient predictions.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging increasingly exploits machine learning techniques in an attempt to achieve clinically relevant single-subject predictions. An alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is the deployment of computational models for inferring on the (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference, focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches - Bayesian model selection and generative embedding - which can link computational models to individual predictions, we review how these methods accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data, and establish a link between a mechanistic, model-based approach and the statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning."}, {"Title": "Risk Prediction Models in Psychiatry: Toward a New Frontier for the Prevention of Mental Illnesses.", "Abstract": "We conducted a systematic, qualitative review of risk prediction models designed and tested for depression, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychotic disorders.

Search terms included risk prediction, predictive model, or prediction model combined with depression, bipolar, manic depressive, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic, PTSD, schizophrenia, or psychosis.\nWe identified 268 articles based on the search terms and 3 criteria: published in English, provided empirical data (as opposed to review articles), and presented results pertaining to developing or validating a risk prediction model in which the outcome was the diagnosis of 1 of the 5 aforementioned mental illnesses. We selected 43 original research reports as a final set of articles to be qualitatively reviewed.\nThe 2 independent reviewers abstracted 3 types of data (sample characteristics, variables included in the model, and reported model statistics) and reached consensus regarding any discrepant abstracted information.\nTwelve reports described models developed for prediction of major depressive disorder, 1 for bipolar disorder, 2 for generalized anxiety disorder, 4 for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 24 for psychotic disorders. Most studies reported on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the (receiver operating characteristic) curve.\nRecent studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing risk prediction models for psychiatric disorders (especially psychotic disorders). The field must now advance by (1) conducting more large-scale, longitudinal studies pertaining to depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric illnesses; (2) replicating and carrying out external validations of proposed models; (3) further testing potential selective and indicated preventive interventions; and (4) evaluating effectiveness of such interventions in the context of risk stratification using risk prediction models."}, {"Title": "Mental disorders of known aetiology and precision medicine in psychiatry: a promising but neglected alliance.", "Abstract": "Personalized or precision medicine is predicated on the assumption that the average response to treatment is not necessarily representative of the response of each individual. A commitment to personalized medicine demands an effort to bring evidence-based medicine and personalized medicine closer together. The use of relatively homogeneous groups, defined using a priori criteria, may constitute a promising initial step for developing more accurate risk-prediction models with which to advance the development of personalized evidence-based medicine approaches to heterogeneous syndromes such as schizophrenia. However, this can lead to a paradoxical situation in the field of psychiatry. Since there has been a tendency to loosely define psychiatric disorders as ones without a known aetiology, the discovery of an aetiology for psychiatric syndromes (e.g. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in some cases of schizophrenia), while offering a path toward more precise treatments, may also lead to their reclassification away from psychiatry. We contend that psychiatric disorders with a known aetiology should not be removed from the field of psychiatry. This knowledge should be used instead to guide treatment, inasmuch as psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and other treatments can all be valid approaches to mental disorders. The translation of the personalized clinical approach inherent to psychiatry into evidence-based precision medicine can lead to the development of novel treatment options for mental disorders and improve outcomes."}, {"Title": "[Level of training in autistic spectrum disorders among hospital paediatricians].", "Abstract": "Training in autistic spectrum disorders is crucial in order to achieve an early diagnosis.

They are examples of body-focused repetitive behaviors in which there is an irresistible urge or impulse to perform a certain behavior. The behavior is reinforced as it results in some degree of relief and pleasure. Nail tic disorders are common, yet poorly studied and understood. The literature on nail tic disorders is relatively scarce. Common nail tics include nail biting or onychophagia, onychotillomania and the habit tic deformity. Some uncommon and rare nail tic disorders are onychoteiromania, onychotemnomania, onychodaknomania and bidet nails. Onychophagia is chronic nail biting behavior which usually starts during childhood. It is often regarded as a tension reducing measure. Onychotillomania is recurrent picking and manicuring of the fingernails and/or toenails. In severe cases, it may lead to onychoatrophy due to irreversible scarring of the nail matrix. Very often, they occur in psychologically normal children but may sometimes be associated with anxiety. In severe cases, onychotillomania may be an expression of obsessive-compulsive disorders. Management of nail tic disorders is challenging. Frequent applications of distasteful topical preparations on the nail and periungual skin can discourage patients from biting and chewing their fingernails. Habit-tic deformity can be helped by bandaging the digit daily with permeable adhesive tape. Fluoxetine in high doses can be helpful in interrupting these compulsive disorders in adults.

The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of organisms and a sophisticated genomic structure. Bacteria within the gut are estimated to weigh in excess of 1\u2009kg in the adult human and the microbes within not only produce antimicrobial peptides, short chain fatty acids, and vitamins, but also most of the common neurotransmitters found in the human brain. That the microbial content of the gut plays a key role in immune development is now beyond doubt. Early disruption of the host-microbe interplay can have lifelong consequences, not just in terms of intestinal function but in distal organs including the brain. It is clear that the immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication in order to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain about the effect of the gut microbiota in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. However, studies using germ-free animals, infective models, prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics have increased our understanding of the interplay. Early life stress can have a lifelong impact on the microbial content of the intestine and permanently alter immune functioning. That early life stress can also impact adult psychopathology has long been appreciated in psychiatry. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the gut microbiota, immune, and central nervous systems in a network of communication that impacts behavior patterns and psychopathology, to eventually translate these findings to the human situation both in health and disease. Even at this juncture, there is evidence to pinpoint key sites of communication where gut microbial interventions either with drugs or diet or perhaps fecal microbiota transplantation may positively impact mental health."}, {"Title": "What's in a \"face file\"? Feature binding with facial identity, emotion, and gaze direction.", "Abstract": "A series of four experiments investigated the binding of facial (i.e., facial identity, emotion, and gaze direction) and non-facial (i.e., spatial location and response location) attributes. Evidence for the creation and retrieval of temporary memory face structures across perception and action has been adduced. These episodic structures-dubbed herein \"face files\"-consisted of both visuo-visuo and visuo-motor bindings. Feature binding was indicated by partial-repetition costs. That is repeating a combination of facial features or altering them altogether, led to faster responses than repeating or alternating only one of the features.

BED patients suffer from a lack of behavioral control during recurrent binge eating episodes and thus fail to adapt their behavior in the face of negative consequences, eg, high risk for obesity. To examine impairments in flexible reward-based decision-making, we exposed BED patients (n=22) and matched healthy individuals (n=22) to a reward-guided decision-making task during functional resonance imaging (fMRI). Performing fMRI analysis informed via computational modeling of choice behavior, we were able to identify specific signatures of altered decision-making in BED. On the behavioral level, we observed impaired behavioral adaptation in BED, which was due to enhanced switching behavior, a putative deficit in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation appropriately. This was accompanied by diminished activation related to exploratory decisions in the anterior insula/ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, although so-called model-free reward prediction errors remained intact, representation of ventro-medial prefrontal learning signatures, incorporating inference on unchosen options, was reduced in BED, which was associated with successful decision-making in the task. On the basis of a computational psychiatry account, the presented findings contribute to defining a neurocognitive phenotype of BED."}, {"Title": "Predictive accuracy of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20 for violence in forensic psychiatric wards in Japan.", "Abstract": "Most structured assessment tools for assessing risk of violence were developed in Western countries, and evidence for their effectiveness is not well established in Asian countries.\nOur aim was to examine the predictive accuracy of the Historical-Clinical-Risk Management-20 (HCR-20) for violence in forensic mental health inpatient units in Japan.\nA retrospective record study was conducted with a complete 2008-2013 cohort of forensic psychiatric inpatients at the National Center Hospital of Neurology and Psychiatry, Tokyo. Forensic psychiatrists were trained in use of the HCR-20 and asked to complete it as part of their admission assessment. The completed forms were then retained by the researchers and not used in clinical practice; for this, clinicians relied solely on national legally required guidelines. Violent outcomes were determined at 3 and 6\u2009months after the assessment. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to calculate the predictive accuracy of the HCR-20 for violence.\nArea under the curve analyses suggested that the HCR-20 total score is a good predictor of violence in this cohort, with the clinical and risk sub-scales showing good predictive accuracy, but the historical sub-scale not doing so. Area under the curve figures were similar at 3\u2009months and at 6\u2009months.\nOur results are consistent with studies previously conducted in Western countries. This suggests that the HCR-20 is an effective tool for supporting risk of violence assessment in Japanese forensic psychiatric wards. Its widespread use in clinical practice could enhance safety and would certainly promote transparency in risk-related decision-making.

Assessing the four pillars expands on the information provided by a semi-structured DSM-5-style interview in psychiatry. The four pillars are the foundation of a person's personality; temperament, cognition (learning abilities or weaknesses), cognitive flexibility (theory of mind) and internal working models of attachment, within the backdrop of the family and of the social and cultural environment in which they have lived. The importance of the study of four pillars is based on the understanding that human behavior and psychopathology as a complex and multifaceted process that includes the level of social-emotional maturity and cognitive abilities (In Delgado et al.

So, the current study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms of cytotoxic effects of in vitro and in vivo citalopram treatment on liver and the following cytolethal events. For in vitro experiments, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were exposed to citalopram along with/without various agents. To do in vivo studies liver function enzyme assays and histological examination were performed. In the in vitro experiments, citalopram (500\u00a0\u00b5M) exposure demonstrated cell death, a marked elevation in ROS formation, mitochondrial potential collapse, lysosomal membrane leakiness, glutathione (GSH) depletion and lipid peroxidation. In vivo biochemistry panel assays for liver enzymes function (AST, ALT and GGTP) and histological examination confirmed citalopram (20\u00a0mg/kg)-induced damage. citalopram-induced oxidative stress cytotoxicity markers were significantly prevented by antioxidants, ROS scavengers, MPT pore sealing agents, endocytosis inhibitors, ATP generators and CYP inhibitors. Either enzyme induction or GSH depletion were concomitant with augmented citalopram-induced damage both in vivo and in vitro which were considerably ameliorated with antioxidants and CYP inhibitors. In conclusion, it is suggested that citalopram hepatotoxicity might be a result of oxidative hazard leading to mitochondrial/lysosomal toxic connection and disorders in biochemical markers which were supported by histomorphological studies."}, {"Title": "The evolution of genomic stability to a mechanism in reproduction and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There are two forms of immune defense, the specific or adaptive immune defense and the unspecific innate immune defense. Vaccination is utilized against specific bacteria via the adaptive immune system. The innate immunity DNA stress defense is a non-toxic mechanism developed in yeasts and conserved in mammals and in plants. Although the steroidal hormone cascade has overtaken the stress response and allows superfast response via non-genomic receptors, the old innate immunity response is still mediated via the steroidal hormones cascade. The classical drug/receptor model has provided for many solutions, however, in antibiotics, cancer, and in severe mental diseases this model reaches to certain limits. The NIH/Department of Mental Health has developed a new model that shows severe mental diseases may be immune diseases that can be treated by replacing old diseased nerve cells by new healthy nerve cells, where the old innate immunity may be exploited. This means that severe mental diseases are physical diseases. A newly developed model, where modifications of the steroidal hormone cascade help to understand bipolarity, schizophrenia, and PTSD in men and women can be transferred to gynecological hormone modifications in women, where innate immunity is mediated via the same steroidal hormone cascade. Treatment via immune response via the DNA cascade should be developed in cancer, infections and severe mental disease, because foreign cells or diseased cells may be removed by the unspecific innate immunity."}, {"Title": "Reporting of Randomized Controlled Trials With Statistically Nonsignificant Primary Outcomes Published in High-impact Surgical Journals.", "Abstract": "To determine the nature and frequency of distorted presentation or \"spin\" (ie, specific reporting strategies which highlight that the experimental treatment is beneficial, despite a statistically nonsignificant difference for the primary outcome, or distract the reader from statistically nonsignificant results) in published reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with statistically nonsignificant results for primary outcomes in surgical journals.\nMultiple reports have suggested that interpretation of RCT results in medical journals can be distorted by authors of published reports.\nUsing a defined search strategy, RCTs with clearly nonsignificant results for the primary outcome (P > 0.05) form 10 high-impact factor surgical journals (Annals of Surgery, Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, American Journal of Transplantation, British Journal of Surgery, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Journal of the American College of Surgeons, Endoscopy, Archives of Surgery, and Liver transplantation), published between July 2013 to July 2015, were identified.

Since clinical heterogeneity and complexity of schizophrenia is high, considerable effort has been made to relate genetic variants to underlying neurobiological aspects of schizophrenia (endophenotypes). Given the polygenic nature of schizophrenia, our goal was to form a measure of additive genetic risk and explore its relationship to cortical morphology. Utilizing the data from a recent genome-wide association study that included nearly 37 000 cases of schizophrenia, we computed a polygenic risk score (PGRS) for each subject in 2 independent and healthy general populations. We then investigated the effect of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification calculated from 3.0T structural imaging data in the discovery dataset (N = 315) and replication dataset (N = 357). We found a consistent effect of the polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification in the inferior parietal lobules in 2 independent general-population samples. A higher PGRS was significantly associated with a lower local gyrification index in the bilateral inferior parietal lobles, where case-control differences have been reported in previous studies on schizophrenia. Our findings strongly support the effectiveness of both PGRSs and endophenotypes in establishing the genetic architecture of psychiatry.

The most common requests from referring physicians were for assessment of testamentary capacity (15 assessed, 53.33\u00a0% lacking capacity), financial management capacity (14 assessed, 50\u00a0% lacking capacity), and capacity to consent to treatment (9 assessed, 22.22\u00a0% lacking capacity). Delirium, rather than dementia or other mental disorders, was associated with mental incapacity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and being more dependent during the admission (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). There were no significant differences for mean age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.257) or Thai Mental State Examination score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.206). The main request from referring clinicians was to assess testamentary capacity.

Since its implementation in 2008, the Academic Administrator, Clinician Educator (AACE) track at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic - UPMC has grown in popularity with reports of participants achieving post-graduate academic success; however, there has been no prior assessment of outcomes.\nIn 2015 all graduates of the track were surveyed using an anonymous, web-based survey. Twenty-nine total graduates were surveyed RESULTS: Twenty-four graduates responded to the survey (83% response rate). The graduates are very active in academic psychiatry with 23 (96%) holding an academic appointment with different administrative roles, medical director (50%) and training director (17%) being the most frequent.

To learn more about the relevance of day centres in this respect, this study aimed to examine the experiences of young people with psychiatric disabilities. A particular focus was on the perceptions of meaningful occupation when visiting day centres, their reasons for not choosing this option when given it and what they desired instead. A qualitative design based on individual interviews was used. Twelve women and eight men between 18 and 35 years, with a need for organized daily occupations, participated as informants. Qualitative content analysis revealed three categories: 'Being in a context', 'Balancing between developing and stagnating', and 'Longing for something more'. The findings indicated that the occupations were inherently age neutral, as were the possibilities for socializing. There was a desire for more activities in the community and more support for engaging in occupations that other young people did. A major issue in the accomplishment of this was the need to earn money, and the lack of opportunities for doing that in the day centre context was a considerable drawback. The findings highlight the importance of identifying young people's views when designing day centres."}, {"Title": "Common Factors in Pediatric Psychiatry: A Review of Essential and Adjunctive Mechanisms of Treatment Outcome.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to review the literature on hypothesized behavioral correlates of pharmacotherapy treatment response. A particular focus is placed on what have been referred to as \"common factors\" across mental health treatments, including medication adherence, therapeutic alliance, motivation for behavior change, and expectancies for positive treatment outcomes. These understudied factors may provide unique explanations for mechanisms of symptom change, patient risk as a result of protocol deviation, and attenuated treatment outcomes.\nA literature search was conducted to evaluate the relationship between treatment processes in pediatric psychiatry and medication adherence, therapeutic alliance, motivation for behavior change, and expectancies for positive treatment outcomes.\nSubstantial variability and room for improvement was identified for each common factor. Behavioral protocols have already been developed to address many aspects of common factors in pediatric psychiatric treatment, but are not yet a part of many practice parameters.\nInterventions to improve common factors can be used immediately in tandem with psychopharmacological interventions to provide increased symptom relief and reduce patient risk. Furthermore, incorporating instruction in common factors interventions can positively affect training of future providers and enhance understanding of the mechanisms of effect of medications. An increased focus on common factors, with a particular emphasis on quantifying the magnitude and mechanisms of their effects on psychopharmacological interventions stand to benefit child patients, their families, treatment providers, training facilities, and pharmaceutical manufacturers."}, {"Title": "Validation of the Resilience Scale for Adolescents (READ) in Ireland: a multi-group analysis.", "Abstract": "Resilience is a process reflecting positive adaptation in the face of adversity.

We analysed retrospectively over a period of two years the medical records of psychiatric unit in-patients with abnormal results for at least one of the following hepatic markers: aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin.\nIn total, 188\u00a0liver test results were abnormal, with an average of 1.7\u00a0per patient. The abnormal test results were in decreasing order: elevation in GGT (80\u00a0% of patients), elevation in transaminases (65.5\u00a0% for each), elevation in ALP (19.1\u00a0%) and elevation in bilirubin (7.27\u00a0%). Abnormal transaminase levels were lower than 10N, with a peak between 1N and 3N for ALT and a peak between 1N and 5N for AST. The elevation in GGT was between 1N and 34N, although 71.6\u00a0% of these values were below 5N. ALP was below 3N. The medical history was traced in 93.6\u00a0% of the records. A somatic clinical examination was only reported in 39\u00a0records (35.5\u00a0%) and was carried out by a hepato-gastroenterologist (HGE) in 30.8\u00a0% of cases, the establishment's emergency physician in 25.7\u00a0% of cases and the psychiatrists in 12.9\u00a0% of cases. Patients with abnormal liver function test results frequently underwent other biological and morphological examinations. A discharge letter was found in almost all cases. Abnormal liver function test results were indicated in less than 45\u00a0% of these discharge letters, whilst over half reported the establishment of a future treatment coordinated by the GP, in close collaboration with the gastroenterologist in at least half the cases.\nOur study was carried out in an open psychiatric unit in the heart of a general hospital that mainly receives patients suffering from thymus and anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, somatoform disorders, personality disorders and psycho-organic disorders. Patients suffering from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders comprised less than 10\u00a0% of admissions. Our retrospective study of over 750\u00a0hospital admissions over a period of two years found only 62.93\u00a0% of patients underwent liver function tests, which proved to be pathological in nearly 30\u00a0% of cases. Following a well-defined anamnesis, just over a third of patients underwent a physical examination whilst in hospital, more often a while after admission and not in the psychiatric unit. The consultation of fellow hospital physicians was limited even if the gastroenterologist was called upon in 30\u00a0% of cases. It was sometimes the treatment pathway or the fortuitous presence of co-morbidities that enabled the anaesthetist or emergency physician to carry out this clinical examination. However, when this physical examination was scheduled, clinical hepatobiliary signs were discovered in 30\u00a0% of patients.\nAn accurate, formalised reference database detailing the principles of the somatic treatment of psychiatric unit in-patients should be established.

However, to our knowledge, no studies have determined whether this is an effective means of teaching residents to manage acutely agitated patients. This study aimed to determine whether simulation-based training in the management of acute agitation improves resident knowledge and performance, as compared to didactic-based instruction.\nFollowing a standard lecture on the management of agitated patients, first-year psychiatry residents were randomized (in clusters of three to four residents) to either the intervention (n\u2009=\u200915) or control arm (n\u2009=\u200911). Residents in the intervention arm then received simulation-based training on the management of acute agitation using a scenario with an agitated standardized patient. Those in the control arm received simulation-based training on a clinical topic unrelated to the management of agitation using a scenario with a non-agitated standardized patient who had suffered a fall. Baseline confidence and knowledge were assessed using pre-intervention self-assessment questionnaires and open-ended clinical case vignettes. Efficacy of the intervention as a teaching tool was assessed with post-intervention open-ended clinical case vignettes and videotaped simulation-based assessment, using a different scenario of an agitated standardized patient.\nResidents who received the agitation simulation-based training showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge (intervention\u2009=\u20093.0 vs. control\u2009=\u20090.3, p\u2009=\u20090.007, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.2) and performance (intervention\u2009=\u200939.6 vs control\u2009=\u200932.5, p\u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.6).

The lay literature has popularized and polarized this debate, offering on one hand claims of dangers, and on the other, of benefits - both physical and psychological - associated with bed-sharing. To address the scientific evidence behind such claims, we systematically reviewed 659 published papers (peer-reviewed, editorial pieces, and commentaries) on the topic of parent-child bed-sharing. Our review offers a narrative walkthrough of the many subdomains of bed-sharing research, including its many correlates (e.g., socioeconomic and cultural factors) and purported risks or outcomes (e.g., sudden infant death syndrome, sleep problems). We found general design limitations and a lack of convincing evidence in the literature, which preclude making strong generalizations. A heat-map based on 98 eligible studies aids the reader to visualize world-wide prevalence in bed-sharing and highlights the need for further research in societies where bed-sharing is the norm. We urge for multiple subfields - anthropology, psychology/psychiatry, and pediatrics - to come together with the aim of understanding infant sleep and how nightly proximity to the parents influences children's social, emotional, and physical development."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and severity of mental disorders in military personnel: a standardised comparison with civilians.", "Abstract": "Provision and need for mental health services among military personnel are a major concern across nations. Two recent comparisons suggest higher rates of mental disorders in US and UK military personnel compared with civilians. However, these findings may not apply to other nations. Previous studies have focused on the overall effects of military service rather than the separate effects of military service and deployment. This study compared German military personnel with and without a history of deployment to sociodemographically matched civilians regarding prevalence and severity of 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders.\n1439 deployed soldiers (DS), 779 never deployed soldiers (NS) and 1023 civilians were assessed with an adapted version of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic interview across the same timeframe. Data were weighted using propensity score methodology to assure comparability of the three samples.\nCompared with adjusted civilians, the prevalence of any 12-month disorder was lower in NS (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-0.99) and did not differ in DS. Significant differences between military personnel and civilians regarding prevalence and severity of individual diagnoses were only apparent for alcohol (DS: OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6; NS: OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and nicotine dependence (DS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6; NS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7) with lower values in both military samples. Elevated rates of panic/agoraphobia (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.3) and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-8.0) were observed in DS with high combat exposure compared with civilians.\nRates and severity of mental disorders in the German military are comparable with civilians for internalising and lower for substance use disorders. A higher risk of some disorders is reduced to DS with high combat exposure. This finding has implications for mental health service provision and the need for targeted interventions. Differences to previous US and UK studies that suggest an overall higher prevalence in military personnel might result from divergent study methods, deployment characteristics, military structures and occupational factors. Some of these factors might yield valuable targets to improve military mental health."}, {"Title": "[Recommendations for psychotherapy in psychiatric inpatient treatment : Results of the PAKT Study Part\u00a0I].", "Abstract": "In the S3\u00a0treatment guidelines psychotherapy is recommended in all psychological disorders.

For this purpose, we analyzed data of the basic documentation in the four participating hospitals.\nOverall, 9.6\u2009% of the patients received a\u00a0recommendation of psychotherapeutic treatment. In the psychiatric university hospital a\u00a0subsequent psychotherapeutic treatment was recommended somewhat more often. Differences between hospitals were present but marginal. Over all participating hospitals, psychotherapy was recommended markedly less frequently in patients with an\u00a0F2 diagnosis in comparison with patients with F3 or F4 diagnoses.\nPsychotherapeutic treatment after psychiatric inpatient stay is recommended cautiously.

The objectives of this study are to examine baseline characteristics and the timing of symptom onset, help-seeking, or transition to psychosis over a 2-year period in China.\nThe presence of CHR was determined with the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) at the participants' first visit to the mental health services. A total of 86 (of 117) CHR participants completed the clinical follow-up of at least 2 years (73.5%). Conversion was determined using the criteria of presence of psychotic symptoms (in SIPS). Analyses examined baseline demographic and clinical predictors of psychosis and trajectory of symptoms over time. Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) methods along with Log-rank tests were performed to illustrate the relationship of baseline data to either conversion or non-conversion over time. Cox regression was performed to identify baseline predictors of conversion by the 2-year follow-up.\nIn total 25 (29.1%) of 86 completers transitioned to a psychotic disorder over the course of follow-up. Among the CHR sample, the mean time between attenuated symptom onset and professional help-seeking was about 4 months on average, and converters developed fully psychotic symptoms about 12 months after symptom onset. Compared with those CHR participants whose risk syndromes remitted over the course of the study, converters had significantly longer delays (p = 0.029) for their first visit to a professional in search of help. At baseline assessment, the conversion subgroup was younger, had poorer functioning, higher total SIPS positive symptom scores, longer duration of untreated prodromal symptoms, and were more often given psychosis-related diagnoses and subsequently prescribed antipsychotics in the clinic.\nChinese CHR identified primarily by a novel clinical screening approach had a 2-year transition rate comparable with those of specialised help-seeking samples world-wide.

The average number of appointments offered was 37.88 (SD\u2009=\u200927.27), and the average number of no-shows was 6.53 (SD\u2009=\u20095.99) per patient. Multivariate linear regressions showed a 10-fold likelihood of later no-shows if the first appointment was missed; not showing up after the intake procedure was also associated with higher rates of later no-show. None of the disorder-specific characteristics contributed to the problem.\nNo-show is of particular concern in forensic mental health settings. In the current study, no-show was primarily associated with features related to the time of initial consultation.

Moral Dimensions of Informal Caregiving in a Neoliberal Society.", "Abstract": "Within the current Dutch policy context the role of informal care is revalued. Formal care activities are reduced and family and friends are expected to fill this gap. Yet, there is little research on the moral ambivalences that informal care for loved ones who have severe and ongoing mental health problems entails, especially against the backdrop of neoliberal policies. Giving priority to one's own life project or caring for a loved one with severe problems is not reconciled easily. Using a case study we illustrate the moral ambivalences that persons may experience when they try to shape their involvement and commitment when a relative is in need. The case comes from a research project which explores whether it is possible to reduce coercive measures in psychiatry by organizing a Family Group Conference. The purpose of the article is to explore what theoretical concepts such as 'communities of fate', 'communities of choice' and 'personal communities' add in understanding how persons shape their involvement and commitment when a family member experiences recurrent psychiatric crises."}, {"Title": "A proposal for a psychopharmacology-pharmacotherapy catalogue of learning objectives and a curriculum in Europe.", "Abstract": "Objectives Post-graduate training for specialisation in psychiatry and psychotherapy is part of a 4-6-year programme. This paper aims to inform on the general situation of teaching and training of psychopharmacology-psychopharmacotherapy in Europe. It presents the need for a psychopharmacotherapy education in psychiatric training programmes. Arguments as well as a proposal for a catalogue of learning objectives and an outline of a psychopharmacology curriculum are presented. Methods Based on their experience and on an analysis of the literature, the authors, experts in psychopharmacology-pharmacotherapy teaching, critically analyse the present situation and propose the development of a curriculum at the European level. Results Teaching programmes vary widely between European countries and, generally, teaching of psychopharmacology and pharmacotherapy does not exceed two-dozen hours. This is insufficient if one considers the central importance of psychopharmacology. A psychopharmacology-psychopharmacotherapy curriculum for the professional training of specialists in psychiatry and psychotherapy is proposed. Conclusions As the number of hours of theoretical teaching and practical training is insufficient, a catalogue of learning objectives should be established, which would then be part of a comprehensive curriculum at the European level.

Neuroimaging studies of the functional architecture of the brain suggest common neural substrates underlying MDD and SUDs. Intrinsic brain activity is organized into a set of functional networks, of which two are particularly relevant to psychiatry. The salience network (SN) is crucial for cognitive control and response inhibition, and deficits in SN function are implicated across a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including MDD and SUDs. The ventromedial network (VMN) corresponds to the classic reward circuit, and pathological VMN activity for drug cues/negative stimuli is seen in SUDs/MDD. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including rTMS and tDCS, have been used to enhance cortico-striatal-thalamic activity through the core SN nodes in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Improvements in both MDD and SUD symptoms ensue, including in comorbid cases, via enhanced cognitive control. Inhibition of the VMN also appears promising in preclinical studies for quenching the pathological incentive salience underlying SUDs and MDD. Evolving techniques may further enhance the efficacy of NIBS for MDD and SUD cases that are unresponsive to conventional treatments."}, {"Title": "[Patients with ICD-10 disorders F3 and F4 in psychiatric and psychosomatic in-patient units - who is treated where? : Allocation features from the PfAD study].", "Abstract": "In Germany, in-patient treatment of patients with depressive, neurotic, anxiety, and somatoform disorders (ICD-10 F3, F4) is carried out in different settings in psychiatry and psychosomatics.

According to his contributions medicine is a practical science aiming at establishing rational action. Central to this model is a diagnosis, which helps to subsume individual cases under general principles from which essential therapeutic options can be derived. Hence, psychiatry and psychotherapy become a medical subspecialty by adopting the basic model of medical reasoning and action as described by Wieland. Nevertheless, the limits of such an approach must be taken into consideration. Especially in a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic context it is of particular importance that even when being guided by general principles the responsibility for the personality of each individual patient should be adequately met. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the limits of the subspecialty of psychiatry and psychotherapy as a medical discipline, which also requires a critical analysis of the concept of psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "[Architectural modernization of psychiatric hospitals influences the use of coercive measures].", "Abstract": "Coercive measures are widely applied in psychiatric hospitals as a last resort to prevent patients seriously harming themselves or others, with negative psychological and somatic consequences for those affected.\nIn a naturalistic observational study it was investigated whether relocation of the structural milieu of a psychiatric hospital to an architectonically improved new building influenced the application of coercive measures.\nThe frequency and duration of coercive measures (e.g. fixation, coercive medication and preventive restraints) were routinely documented and compared in the periods before and after the relocation.\nAfter the relocation the utilization of coercive measures was significantly reduced by 48-84\u2009%.\nDespite the limitations of the study design the results suggest that the architectural improvements reduced the application of coercive measures.

While prediction schemes based on symptom clustering and biomarkers have so far not yielded results of sufficient strength to inform clinical decision-making, prediction schemes based on big data predictive analytic models might be more practically useful.\nWe review evidence suggesting that prediction equations based on symptoms and other easily-assessed clinical features found in previous research to predict MDD treatment outcomes might provide a foundation for developing predictive analytic clinical decision support models that could help clinicians select optimal (personalised) MDD treatments. These methods could also be useful in targeting patient subsamples for more expensive biomarker assessments.\nApproximately two dozen baseline variables obtained from medical records or patient reports have been found repeatedly in MDD treatment trials to predict overall treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention v. control) or differential treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention A v. intervention B). Similar evidence has been found in observational studies of MDD persistence-severity. However, no treatment studies have yet attempted to develop treatment outcome equations using the full set of these predictors. Promising preliminary empirical results coupled with recent developments in statistical methodology suggest that models could be developed to provide useful clinical decision support in personalised treatment selection. These tools could also provide a strong foundation to increase statistical power in focused studies of biomarkers and MDD heterogeneity of treatment response in subsequent controlled trials.\nCoordinated efforts are needed to develop a protocol for systematically collecting information about established predictors of heterogeneity of MDD treatment response in large observational treatment studies, applying and refining these models in subsequent pragmatic trials, carrying out pooled secondary analyses to extract the maximum amount of information from these coordinated studies, and using this information to focus future discovery efforts in the segment of the patient population in which continued uncertainty about treatment response exists."}, {"Title": "The Association Between a Sense of Calling and Physician Well-Being: A National Study of Primary Care Physicians and Psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "This study assesses the association between calling and physician well-being, clinical commitment, and burnout.\nIn 2009-2010, a survey was mailed to 1504 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 512 psychiatrists drawn from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. The primary independent variable was a single-item measure that assessed physicians' level of calling. Main outcomes were markers of physician well-being (career satisfaction and morale), clinical commitment (intentions to reduce time spent in direct patient care, leave practice in a few years), and experiences of burnout.\nAdjusted response rates were 63\u00a0% (896/1427) for PCPs and 64\u00a0% (312/487) for psychiatrists. Forty-two percent of US PCPs and psychiatrists agree strongly that their practice of medicine is a calling. Physicians with a high sense of calling were less likely than those with low to report regret in choosing medicine as a career (18 vs. 38\u00a0%; odds ratio 0.3; 95\u00a0% confidence interval, 0.2-0.5), wanting to go into a different clinical specialty (28 vs. 49\u00a0%; OR 0.4; 95\u00a0% CI, 0.2-0.6), or wanting to leave the practice of medicine in the next few years (14 vs. 25\u00a0%, OR 0.4; 95\u00a0% CI 0.2-0.7).

Population-based studies show that many psychopathology scales are (partially) Measurement Invariance (MI) with respect to gender, i.e. are unbiased. It is, however, unclear whether these studies generalize towards clinical samples. In a psychiatric outpatient sample, we tested whether the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL) is unbiased with respect to gender. We compared mean scores across gender of all syndrome scales of the CBCL in 3271 patients (63.3% boys) aged 6-18. Second, we tested for MI on both the syndrome scale and the item-level using a stepwise modeling procedure. Six of the eight CBCL syndrome scales included one or more gender-biased items (12.6% of all items), resulting in slight over- or under-estimation of the absolute gender difference in mean scores. Two scales, Somatic Complaints and Rule-breaking Behavior, contained no biased items. The CBCL is a valid instrument to measure gender differences in problem behavior in children and adolescents from a clinical sample; while various gender-biased items were identified, the resulting bias was generally clinically irrelevant, and sufficient items per subscale remained after exclusion of biased items.

Little is known about the patients of these networks with regard to utilisation of physicians and associated factors. We interviewed 560 caregivers of people with dementia in 13 different DNs in Germany in 2013 and assessed socio-demographics, clinical data and physician utilisation. Networks were categorised in predominantly medical DNs and community-oriented DNs. Descriptive and multivariate statistical models were used to identify associated factors between DNs and users' data. Overall, the users of networks received high rates of physician care; 93% of the sample stated at least one contact with a primary care physician within the last 6\u00a0months, and 74% had been treated by a specialist (neurology/psychiatry physician). Only 5% of the sample had no contact with a physician in the 6\u00a0months preceding the interview. Females showed a lower odds for physician specialist consultations (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.641).

In addition, the relationship between lifestyle and health factors and higher ratings of depressive symptoms was also examined to determine if there were culturally consistent risk factors associated with higher depressive symptom scores.\nA total of 444 community based women aged between 65 and 77 years completed a depressive symptom measure (GDS-15) and provided information on common lifestyle factors. The Australian sample (n = 222) were drawn from the Women's Healthy Ageing Project and the age-matched, Japanese sample from the Kumamoto Ageing Study of Mental Health (n = 222). The GDS was chosen to; (1) reduce the impact of physical symptoms associated with old age and, (2) reduce the inflation in scores that may result from the Japanese tendency to endorse somatic items more often than Western adults.\nMean GDS total scores were significantly higher for the Japanese population 3.97 \u00b1 3.69 compared with 1.73 \u00b1 2.7 for Australian women. The percentages of women scoring in the normal; mild and moderate ranges for depression were 91, 7 and 2% for Australia and 67, 24 and 9% for Japan. Scores remained significantly higher for the Japanese cohort when controlling for lifestyle and health factors associated with depression. The analysis of lifestyle and health characteristics showed that the greatest difference between cohorts was in the area of living status, with more Australian women living with their partner and more than three times as many Japanese women living with their children. When the data for the countries was considered independently employment status affected the likelihood of higher depression scores in the Australian sample while heart disease and poor sleep impacted the risk for the Japanese population.\nSignificantly more Japanese women scored within the mild and moderate ranges on the GDS compared with their Australian peers, even when controlling for possible confounding factors. Of the lifestyle and health factors assessed in this analysis no single variable was a common risk factor for higher depressive scores for both countries.

Sarcosine, a glycine transporter I (GlyT-1) inhibitor, and sodium benzoate, a d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) inhibitor, can both enhance NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. We proposed simultaneously inhibiting DAAO and GlyT-1 may be more effective than inhibition of either in improving the cognitive and global functioning of schizophrenia patients. Methods This study compared add-on sarcosine (2\u2009g/day) plus benzoate (1\u2009g/day) vs. sarcosine (2\u2009g/day) for the clinical symptoms, as well as the cognitive and global functioning, of chronic schizophrenia patients in a 12-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale every 3 weeks. Seven cognitive domains, recommended by the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Committee, were measured at weeks 0 and 12. Results Adjunctive sarcosine plus benzoate, but not sarcosine alone, improved the cognitive and global functioning of patients with schizophrenia, even when their clinical symptoms had not improved.

In the etiology and course of those diseases inflammatory processes are regarded to be an increasingly important factor. They are also a frequently discussed element of the pathology of sleep. In this literature review reports on correlations between poor sleep and inflammatory responses in various psychiatric conditions are discussed. The link between schizophrenia, affective disorders and inflammatory cytokines is a complex phenomenon, which has been already confirmed in a number of studies. However, the presence of sleep deficits in those conditions, being a common symptom of depression and psychoses, can be an additional factor having a considerable impact on the immunological processes in mental illnesses. In the analyzed data, a number of studies are presented describing the role of inflammatory markers in sleep disturbances and psychopathological symptoms of affective, psychotic, neurogenerative and other disorders.

Proteomics is a Big Data technology and a next generation biomarker, supporting novel system diagnostics and therapeutics in psychiatry. Proteomics technology is, in fact, much older than genomics and dates to the 1970s, well before the launch of the international Human Genome Project. While the genome has long been framed as the master or \"elite\" executive molecule in cell biology, the proteome by contrast is humble. Yet the proteome is critical for life-it ensures the daily functioning of cells and whole organisms. In short, proteins are the blue-collar workers of biology, the down-to-earth molecules that we cannot live without. Since 2010, proteomics has found renewed meaning and international attention with the launch of the Human Proteome Project and the growing interest in Big Data technologies such as proteomics. This article presents an interdisciplinary technology foresight analysis and conceptualizes the terms \"environtome\" and \"social proteome\". We define \"environtome\" as the entire complement of elements external to the human host, from microbiome, ambient temperature and weather conditions to government innovation policies, stock market dynamics, human values, political power and social norms that collectively shape the human host spatially and temporally. The \"social proteome\" is the subset of the environtome that influences the transition of proteomics technology to innovative applications in society. The social proteome encompasses, for example, new reimbursement schemes and business innovation models for proteomics diagnostics that depart from the \"once-a-life-time\" genotypic tests and the anticipated hype attendant to context and time sensitive proteomics tests. Building on the \"nesting principle\" for governance of complex systems as discussed by Elinor Ostrom, we propose here a 3-tiered organizational architecture for Big Data science such as proteomics. The proposed nested governance structure is comprised of (a) scientists, (b) ethicists, and (c) scholars in the nascent field of \"ethics-of-ethics\", and aims to cultivate a robust social proteome for personalized medicine. Ostrom often noted that such nested governance designs offer assurance that political power embedded in innovation processes is distributed evenly and is not concentrated disproportionately in a single overbearing stakeholder or person. We agree with this assessment and conclude by underscoring the synergistic value of social and biological proteomes to realize the full potentials of proteomics science for personalized medicine in psychiatry in the present era of Big Data."}, {"Title": "The Wesselhoefts: A medical dynasty from the age of Goethe to the era of nuclear medicine.", "Abstract": "For six generations, members of the Wesselhoeft family have practiced medicine in Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada and/or the USA.

Telomeres shorten at each cell division, and as such telomere length is a marker of cellular age. Accelerated telomere shortening and cell senescence have been associated with a number of chronic medical conditions, including psychiatric disorders, where increased prevalence of age-related disorders and shorter telomere length have been reported. Shorter telomeres in psychiatric patients are thought to be the consequence of allostatic load, consisting in the overactivation of allostatic systems due to chronic exposure to severe medical conditions and failure to adapt to chronic stressful stimuli. Most of the studies on telomere length in psychiatry have focused on major depressive disorder, but recent findings have shown shorter leukocyte telomere length in bipolar disorder patients and suggested that lithium may counteract telomeres shortening. These findings provided new insights into the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the mechanism of action of lithium. In this review we will present findings from the literature on telomere length in bipolar disorder, with a specific focus on lithium.

The vast majority of respondents said that they would recommend this service to others or would themselves take advantage of the services again. <b>Conclusion:</b> A collaboration of service providers from psychiatry and child and youth welfare department resulting in continuous availability of counseling with a common family medical perspective represents a forward-looking model for families with a mentally ill parent."}, {"Title": "Sleep-dependent memory consolidation and its implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Both sleep disturbance and memory impairment are very common in psychiatric disorders. Since sleep has been shown to play a role in the process of transferring newly acquired information into long-term memory, i.e., consolidation, it is important to highlight this link in the context of psychiatric disorders. Along these lines, after providing a brief overview of healthy human sleep, current neurobiological models on sleep-dependent memory consolidation and resultant opportunities to manipulate the memory consolidation process, recent findings on sleep disturbances and sleep-dependent memory consolidation in patients with insomnia, major depression, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder are systematically reviewed. Furthermore, possible underlying neuropathologies and their implications on therapeutic strategies are discussed. This review aims at sensitizing the reader for recognizing sleep disturbances as a potential contributor to cognitive deficits in several disorders, a fact which is often overlooked up to date."}, {"Title": "[Establishment of an Animal Based Therapy at a University Hospital for Psychiatry: Results of a Preliminary Study and Future Prospects].", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> Dogs have been integrated in human society over centuries. This process has selected unique social and communicative skills. Dogs are thus able to represent social substitutes for human counterparts in cases of social withdrawal. Furthermore, dogs act as \"social catalysts\" in promoting interhuman encounters. Thus, the integration of dogs in psychotherapeutic concepts addressing social and interpersonal deficits may be of special interest. <b>Methods:</b> The present investigation reports the results of a pilot study to establish animal-assisted therapy (dogs) at a psychiatric department. The animal-assisted intervention straddled the following areas: (1) contact making, communication and orientation to needs, (2) recreation and play, (3) outward orientation, (4) release and farewell. The sample comprised 22 subjects. <b>Results:</b> The results demonstrated in particular that the animal-assisted intervention significantly promoted unspecific aspects of positive affectivity and wellbeing. Evaluation of the overall acceptance of the dog on the psychiatric ward revealed very positive feedback. <b>Conclusions:</b> We conclude that animal-assisted therapies represent a significant enchrichment of the therapeutic context, that may be used to enhance the patients' openness and adherence to conventional therapies."}, {"Title": "The role of sleep problems and circadian clock genes in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and mood disorders during childhood and adolescence: an update.", "Abstract": "A more recent branch of research describes the importance of sleep problems in the development and treatment of mental disorders in children and adolescents, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mood disorders (MD). Research about clock genes has continued since 2012 with a focus on metabolic processes within all parts of the mammalian body, but particularly within different cerebral regions. Research has focused on complex regulatory circuits involving clock genes themselves and their influence on circadian rhythms of diverse body functions. Current publications on basic research in human and animal models indicate directions for the treatment of mental disorders targeting circadian rhythms and mechanisms. The most significant lines of research are described in this paper."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the Responsiveness to Therapeutic Change with Routine Outcome Monitoring: A Comparison of the Symptom Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48) with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45).", "Abstract": "Assessment of psychological distress is important, because it may help to monitor treatment effects and predict treatment outcomes. We previously developed the 48-item Symptom Questionnaire (SQ-48) as a public domain self-report psychological distress instrument and showed good internal consistency as well as good convergent and divergent validity among clinical and non-clinical samples. The present study, conducted among psychiatric outpatients in a routine clinical setting, describes additional psychometric properties of the SQ-48. The primary focus is on responsiveness to therapeutic change, which to date has been rarely examined within psychiatry or clinical psychology. Since a questionnaire should also be stable when no clinically important change occurs, we also examined test-retest reliability within a test-retest design before treatment (n\u2009=\u200943). A pre-treatment/post-treatment design was used for responsiveness to therapeutic change, comparing the SQ-48 with two internationally widely used instruments: the Brief Symptom Inventory (n\u2009=\u200997) and the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (n\u2009=\u2009109). The results showed that the SQ-48 has excellent test-retest reliability and good responsiveness to therapeutic change, without significant differences between the questionnaires in terms of responsiveness. In sum, the SQ-48 is a psychometrically sound public domain self-report instrument that can be used for routine outcome monitoring, as a benchmark tool or for research purposes. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Key Practitioner Message The SQ-48 is developed as a public domain self-report questionnaire, in line with growing efforts to develop clinical instruments that are free of charge. The SQ-48 has excellent test-retest reliability and good responsiveness to therapeutic change or patient progress. There were no significant differences in terms of responsiveness between the SQ-48 and BSI or OQ-45. The SQ-48 can be used as a routine evaluation outcome measure for quality assurance in clinical practice. Providing feedback on patient progress via outcome measures could contribute to the enhancement of treatment outcomes."}, {"Title": "Determinants of Pediatric Psychiatry Length of Stay in 2 Urban Emergency Departments.", "Abstract": "Pediatric mental illness poses a significant burden with an overall prevalence of approximately 10%. Increasingly, children with mental disorders seek care in the emergency department (ED). However, the ED is not an ideal setting. Pediatric mental health patients receive limited treatment and experience significantly longer length of stay (LOS) than other patients seen in the ED. This study examines patient and hospital factors associated with LOS and prolonged LOS (PLOS).\nThis is a retrospective chart review of patients between the ages of 3 and 17 presenting at 2 participating urban EDs with a psychiatric diagnosis from May 2010 to May 2012.\nThis study includes 939 patients with an average age of 14.1 years and a median LOS of 295 minutes. The diagnosis was the strongest predictor of LOS and PLOS. Patients with a psychotic disorder or suicide attempt or ideation experienced a longer LOS, 35% and 55% increases, respectively, and an increased odds of PLOS (odds ratio, 3.07 and 8.36, respectively). Patient sex, previous history of self-harm, and the daily census were associated with both a longer LOS and PLOS. Ethnicity, site of admission, and year of admission were only associated with LOS.\nDiagnosis-specific management factors are the primary determinant of LOS. However, some patient characteristics and hospital operational factors are also associated with LOS. Organizational reforms and an evaluation of the required human and material resources are necessary to improve access to and availability of pediatric mental health care."}, {"Title": "Dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a common, chronic condition that imposes a substantial burden of disability globally. As current treatments are estimated to address only one-third of the disease burden of depressive disorders, there is a need for new approaches to prevent depression or to delay its progression. While in its early stages, converging evidence from laboratory, population research, and clinical trials now suggests that dietary patterns and specific dietary factors may influence the risk for depression. However, largely as a result of the recency of the nutritional psychiatry field, there are currently no dietary recommendations for depression.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a set of practical dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression, based on the best available current evidence, in order to inform public health and clinical recommendations.\nFive key dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression emerged from current published evidence. These comprise: (1) follow 'traditional' dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean, Norwegian, or Japanese diet; (2) increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, wholegrain cereals, nuts, and seeds; (3) include a high consumption of foods rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; (4) replace unhealthy foods with wholesome nutritious foods; (5) limit your intake of processed-foods, 'fast' foods, commercial bakery goods, and sweets.\nAlthough there are a number of gaps in the scientific literature to date, existing evidence suggests that a combination of healthful dietary practices may reduce the risk of developing depression. It is imperative to remain mindful of any protective effects that are likely to come from the cumulative and synergic effect of nutrients that comprise the whole-diet, rather than from the effects of individual nutrients or single foods. As the body of evidence grows from controlled intervention studies on dietary patterns and depression, these recommendations should be modified accordingly."}, {"Title": "Prevalence and Correlates of Aggression and Hostility in Hospitalized Schizophrenic Patients.", "Abstract": "This study is aimed at identifying the incidence as well as clinical and socio-demographic correlates of aggression in hospitalized schizophrenic patients. We prospectively recruited participants with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) diagnosis of schizophrenia presenting to the Clinic for Psychiatry during a 2-year period. We used the Modified Overt Aggression Scale to assess the aggression and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to assess the clinical characteristics of participants. One out of three patients with schizophrenia (31%) was aggressive and hostile at the time of presentation. Socio-demographic variables (such as gender, age, duration of illness, and number of hospitalizations) were poor predictors of aggression for schizophrenic patients. The level of aggression was not associated with the clinical characteristics in aggressive and hostile hospitalized schizophrenic patients. However, there was a weak negative association between the level of aggression and the PANSS Negative Scale ( p < .01). In conclusion, socio-demographic variables and clinical characteristics seem to be not such good predictors of aggressive behavior in hospitalized schizophrenic patients. Nevertheless, the results of our study contribute to the understanding of the prediction and treatment of aggression in a well-defined cohort of schizophrenic patients."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of the Incredible Years Parenting Program for Families with Socioeconomically Disadvantaged and Ethnic Minority Backgrounds.", "Abstract": "Families with socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority backgrounds are often hard to reach for the prevention and treatment of disruptive child behavior problems. We examined whether the Incredible Years parenting intervention can successfully reach and benefit families with socioeconomic disadvantaged and ethnic minority backgrounds in the Netherlands. One hundred fifty-four families from a wide range of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds were recruited in an outpatient clinic for child and adolescent psychiatry and in elementary schools serving deprived neighborhoods. Families were randomly assigned to the BASIC Incredible Years parenting intervention or a waiting list control condition. Children were 3-8 years old (M\u00a0=\u00a05.59, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.35; 62% boys, 66% ethnic minorities) and 65% of the children met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and/or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Incredible Years reduced parent-reported disruptive child behavior and teacher-reported hyperactive and inattentive child behavior and increased parent-reported use of praise and incentives and reduced harsh and inconsistent discipline. Incredible Years did not affect parent-reported hyperactive and inattentive child behavior; teacher-reported child conduct problems; and parent-reported use of appropriate discipline techniques, clear expectations, physical punishment, and parenting stress. Of importance, the effectiveness of Incredible Years did not differ across families with different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. Effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. This study shows that socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority families in disadvantaged neighborhoods can be engaged in and benefit from parenting interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior."}, {"Title": "Symptom Profile of ADHD in Youth With High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Comparative Study in Psychiatrically Referred Populations.", "Abstract": "To compare the clinical presentation of ADHD between youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD and a sample of youth with ADHD only.\nA psychiatrically referred sample of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) youth with ADHD attending a specialized ambulatory program for ASD ( n = 107) and a sample of youth with ADHD attending a general child psychiatry ambulatory clinic ( n = 74) were compared.\nSeventy-six percent of youth with ASD met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. The clinical presentation of ADHD in youth with ASD was predominantly similar to its typical presentation including age at onset (3.5 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 4.0 \u00b1 1.9; p = .12), distribution of diagnostic subtypes, the qualitative and quantitative symptom profile, and symptom severity. Combined subtype was the most frequent presentation of ADHD in ASD youth.\nDespite the robust presentation of ADHD, a significant majority of ASD youth with ADHD failed to receive appropriate ADHD treatment (41% vs. 24%; p = .02). A high rate of comorbidity with ADHD was observed in psychiatrically referred youth with ASD, with a clinical presentation typical of the disorder."}, {"Title": "Addressing Patient Safety in Rapid Response Activations for Nonhospitalized Persons.", "Abstract": "Rapid response teams (RRTs) have been widely accepted as useful adjuncts to the care of inpatients with unanticipated emergencies. One study suggested that leadership of such teams could be assigned to midlevel providers, especially when nonhospitalized person (NHP)-related emergencies occur. However, in our tertiary medical center, a critical care medicine (CCM) physician always leads all RRT events including those related to NHPs.\nIn this study, we postulate reasons in favor of a single structured RRT led by an intensivist for both inpatients and NHPs.\nAn observational study conducted at an academic medical center. Demographic and clinical characteristics of NHP-related RRT events were evaluated over a 9-month period.\nRapid response teams were activated 1,952 times, of which, 154 events were NHP related. Only 42 RRT activations occurred for employees and visitors. Most of the NHP activations (112 events) occurred in response to events involving persons who were on the premises because of preexisting illnesses, either visiting physician offices (46 events), undergoing ambulatory diagnostic procedures (30 events), in transit to the emergency department (13 events), or undergoing emergency psychiatry evaluation (11 events). Most patients (83 NHPs) required admission to the hospital including 22 NHPs to intensive care units (ICUs) either directly from the event location or subsequently from the emergency department. The physician team leader admitted 20 NHPs directly from the scene, of which, 13 were admitted directly to ICUs.\nNonhospitalized patients requiring RRT activation often have complex pre-existent illnesses. A standardized team composition for both inpatients and NHPs in crisis is an appropriate administrative structure enhancing patient safety in hospitals where ambulatory and inpatient facilities are combined."}]
