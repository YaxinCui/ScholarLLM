[{"Title": "Intensive psychotherapy training in korean psychiatric residency programs.", "Abstract": "The authors investigated the current practice of intensive psychotherapy by residents in the department of psychiatry.\nWe mailed a questionnaire to 126 fourth-year psychiatry residents in order to obtain data on their clients' sociodemographic characteristics, the settings in which psychotherapy is being conducted, the effects of psychotherapy, the difficulties associated with psychotherapy, the state of supervision and the level of clients' satisfaction.\nApproximately 51.5% of the residents completed the questionnaires. The average number of clients was 4.9+/-3.8, the average number of psychotherapy sessions was 26.2+/-20.1, and 69.4% of the residents had performed insight-oriented psychotherapy. Approximately 69.8% of the fourth-year residents had received some form of supervision, and 58.7% agreed to increase the frequency of supervision. Approximately 74.2% of the cases were supervised. The average number of supervisions per case was 9.2+/-10.5.\nThe setting in which psychotherapy is conducted, number of clients, and type of supervision varied greatly among the training institutes surveyed. Based on these findings, we expect to create better psychotherapy training programs for psychiatric residents."}, {"Title": "[Perception and use of an electronic medical record system by professionals of a public psychiatric hospital].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the interest taken by the health care providers in the electronic medical file and its use within the quality improvement process.\nOur institution is a 204-bed psychiatric hospital, employing 328 professionals and comprising three sectors: six units of complete hospitalisation (102 beds), one unit of week hospitalisation (15 beds), one unit of emergency (7 beds) and one unit of night hospitalisation (15 beds). Three extrahospital structures include the day hospitalisation (65 places), the medicopsychological centers (CMP) and the part-time therapeutic reception centers (CATTP) of the three sectors.\nWe conducted face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with health care providers of a public psychiatric hospital. All the solicited people agreed to answer the investigation. The interviews were conducted until no new ideas emerged in the content analysis performed in real time, comprising 60 care providers: 10 psychiatrists, 42 nurses and eight paramedical professionals. Content analysis was performed by two members of the steering committee who were skilled in textual analysis. A descriptive analysis was also performed. The variables were described by proportions and means. The proportions were compared using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test where appropriate. A two-tailed P-value of greater than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 13.0.\nNinety-six percent of the interviewed subjects used the electronic medical file. The average number of daily use was seven (S.D.=5). Sixty-seven percent had a favorable opinion of the electronic medical file. Physicians had more frequent favorable opinions than nurses who considered that electronic medical files cannot capture real nursing activity. Health care providers considered that electronic medical file could be associated with improved quality of care, but two points should be taken into account: the increased documentation time (slow system response, multiple screens, the lack of computer knowledge, the absence of bedside documentation technology...) and dysfunctions in the information processing system. This could have an impact on documentation completeness, and quality and could also lead to a reduction of time devoted to care.\nThis study proposes tracks of improvement in the use of the DPIP. In spite of this, a true debate must be initiated on these new information systems in psychiatry since their real objectives can be perceived as ambiguous, so that programs of clarification, education and reinsurance can be set-up."}, {"Title": "[Heart rate variability. Applications in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The autonomic nervous system sends messages through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the cardioaccelerating center of the heart, the lungs (increased ventilatory rhythm and dilatation of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery contraction). It releases adrenaline and noradrenaline. As opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, it innervates the cardiomoderator center of the heart, the lungs (slower ventilatory rhythm and contraction of the bronchi) and the non-striated muscles (artery dilatation). It uses acetylcholine (ACh) as its neurotransmitter. Sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions function antagonistically to preserve a dynamic modulation of vital functions. These systems act on the heart respectively through the stellar ganglion and the vagus nerve. The interaction of these messages towards the sinoauricular node is responsible for normal cardiac variability, which can be measured by monitoring heart rate variability (HRV). Heart rate is primarily controlled by vagal activity. Sensorial data coming from the heart are fed back to the central nervous system. HRV is an indicator of both how the central nervous system regulates the autonomic nervous system, and of how peripheral neurons feed information back to the central level. HRV measures are derived by estimating the variation among a set of temporally ordered interbeat intervals. The state of perfect symmetry, which, in medical parlance, is called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), can be described as a state of cardiac coherence. Obtaining a series of interbeat intervals requires a continuous measure of heart rate, typically electrocardiography (ECG). Commercially available software is then used to define the interbeat intervals within an ECG recording.\nThe autonomic nervous system is highly adaptable and allows the organism to maintain its balance when experiencing strain or stress. Conversely, a lack of flexibility and a rigid system can lead to somatic and psychological pathologies. Several studies have shown a link between reduced HRV in postmyocardial infarction patients and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Recently, studies indicate that patients with depression and anxiety disorders exhibit abnormally low HRV compared with non-psychiatric controls. Reduced HRV seems indicate decreased cardiac vagal tone and elevated sympathetic activity in anxious and depressive patients and would reflect deficit in flexibility of emotional physiological mechanisms. A few studies have also revealed that biofeedback using respiratory control, relaxation and meditation techniques can increase HRV. For now, there is insufficient data to determine if paced respiration or subjective relaxation is necessary or sufficient for the efficacy of HRV biofeedback. Although the literature is modest, this review suggests that the use of biofeedback with relaxation and meditation approaches may result in increased HRV and parasympathetic activity. Limitations of the review literature have also been considered to identify areas for future research."}, {"Title": "[The medicalization of feminine suffering: premenstrual dysphoric disorder].", "Abstract": "In this paper we'll try to show some of the tensions existing in our field related to gender issue, focusing on the premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

We will display two different approximations. First of all, the official PMDD story will be narrated, the one told by medical journals, that basing on a positivist side of the scientific knowledge evolution, avoids gender issues. Then we'll describe a critical perspective, which far from denying the medical model it tries to complement it with social sciences contributions , so female suffering can be appreciated in its own singularity and extension. This only can be possible by including gender perspective in Psychiatry practice.

Once patients had listed and defined their medical needs, prescriptions were analysed to assess whether clinical characteristics had an impact. Thus, the analysis of treatments was carried out for the 57 patients (14% of the hospital population) and compared to other investigations conducted on the population commonly hospitalised in Psychiatry. The evaluation of the treatments was obtained through a questionnaire which enabled us to target the therapeutical goals and to obtain additional clinical information. The drugs with a high rate of prescription were compared between the autistic group and the multi-handicapped group. The important comorbidity and the multi-symptomatology of autism often involves the polymedication of these patients (8+/-0.8 drugs per patient).\nFifty per cent of the treatments are referred to as somatic treatments. The average length of stay (22.3 years) and the high average age are aggravating factors for polymedication. The average number of psychotropic molecules also appears higher than in the populations studied in the literature. The heterogeneity of clinical forms of autism and polyhandicap encourages prescribers to multidrug therapy. The prescriptions usually remain stable (17.5% of psychiatric treatment is adapted and only 7% of somatic treatment). Epilepsy and constipation are the main treated somatic disorders. In psychiatry, the oral route is the privileged route of administration (81% of treatments) with, more specifically, the use of drinkable solutions for the psychiatric treatment. Neuroleptic drugs are the basic treatment of these patients (82% of prescriptions). The aim of the prescription of neuroleptics is essentially to obtain behavioural or antipsychotic sedation. Cyamemazin is the most prescribed drug (46% of neuroleptic prescriptions), mainly for its anxiolytic effects. Co-prescription is frequent (55.3%) and corresponds to 53% of co-prescriptions of an association of phenothiazine and butyrophenone. Doses are high, which implies the prescription of treatments against the neuroleptics side-effects (86% of patients have such a prescription). The rate of prescriptions of the other psychotropic drugs (hypnotics, anxiolytics, etc.) is approximately equivalent between our population and the \"classical\" hospitalised psychiatric population, except for antidepressants (7% of prescriptions) because the differential diagnosis is difficult in these patients. Nearly 60% of patients have prescriptions of hypnotic drugs. However, this figure is tempered by prescriptions of drugs \"if necessary\" in two-thirds of the cases. Finally, only 30% of patients have systematic hypnotic prescriptions.\nAlthough autistics are clinically different from multi-handicapped patients, no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in their prescriptions, which implies a similar pharmacological management. It is difficult to clearly distinguish these two populations only according to the type of drugs used and the doses prescribed."}, {"Title": "Managing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the emergency department.", "Abstract": "ADHD, often misdiagnosed or unrecognized, can lead to serious personal and family disruption.

Most of the research into the genetic underpinnings of major mental disorders as described in the categorical taxonomies, however, did reveal linkage with a variety of chromosomes. This heterogeneity of results is most probably due to the assumption that the nosological categories as used in these studies are disease entities with clear boundaries. If the reverse way of looking, the so-called bottom-up approach, is applied, it becomes clear that genetic abnormalities are in most cases not associated with a single psychiatric disorder but with a certain probability to develop a variety of aspecific psychiatric symptoms. The adequacy of the categorical taxonomy, the so-called top-down approach, seems to be inversely related to the amount of empirical etiological data. This is illustrated by four rather prevalent genetic syndromes, fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 22q11 deletion syndrome, and Noonan syndrome, as well as by some cases with rare chromosomal abnormalities. From these examples, it becomes clear that psychotic symptoms as well as mood, anxiety, and autistic features can be found in a great variety of different genetic syndromes.

The BMJ is the most prominent general medical journal in terms of readership and importance but a dominant specialty or sub-specialty journal was usually more important for most groups. The Lancet is less widely read and less important, although more academics than non-academics consider it important.\nOverall, key general medical journals play an important role. Journal availability and cost, particularly in relation to membership for UK clinicians, and the position of academics and non-academics have to be considered in any analysis.

However, if patients report experiencing a lower level of pleasure than controls, they report experiencing as much pleasure as controls with online measurements of emotion.\nThe Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) measures pleasure experienced in the moment and in anticipation of future activities. The TEPS is an 18-item self-report measurement of anticipatory (10 items) and consummatory (eight items) pleasure. The goal of this paper is to assess the psychometric characteristics of the French translation of this scale.\nA control sample was composed of 60 women and 22 men, with a mean age of 38.1 years (S.D.: 10.8). Thirty-six were without qualification and 46 with qualified professional diploma. A sample of 21 patients meeting DSM IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia was recruited among the community psychiatry service of the department of psychiatry in Lausanne. They were five women and 16 men; mean age was of 34.1 years (S.D.: 7.5). Ten obtained a professional qualification and 11 were without qualification. None worked in competitive employment. Their mean dose of chlorpromazine equivalent was 431 mg (S.D.: 259). All patients were on atypical antipsychotics. The control sample fulfilled the TEPS and the Physical Anhedonia Scale (PAS). The patient sample fulfilled the TEPS and was independently rated on the Calgary Depression Scale and the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms. For comparison with controls, patients were matched on age, sex and professional qualification. This required the supplementary recruitment of two control subjects.\nResults with the control sample indicate that the TEPS presents an acceptable internal validity with Crombach alphas of 0.84 for the total scale, 0.74 for the anticipatory pleasure scale and 0.79 for the consummatory pleasure scale. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model is well adapted to our data (chi(2)/dl=1.333; df=134; p<0.0006; root mean square residual, RMSEA=0.064). External validity measured with the PAS showed R=-0.27 (p<0.05) for the consummatory scale and R=-0.26 for the total score. Comparisons between patients and matched controls indicated that patients were significantly lower than control on anticipatory pleasure (t=2.7, df(40), 2-tailed p=0.01; cohen's d=0.83) and on total score of the TEPS (t=2.8, df (40), 2-tailed p=0.01; cohen's d=0.87). The two samples did not differ on consummatory pleasure. The anticipatory pleasure factor and the total TEPS showed significant negative correlation with the SANS anhedonia, respectively R=-0.78 (p<0.01) for the anticipatory factor and R=-0.61 (p<0.01) for the total TEPS. There was also a negative correlation between the anticipatory factor and the SANS avolition of R=-0.50 (p<0.05). These correlations were maintained, with partial correlations controlling for depression and chlorpromazine equivalents.\nThe results of this validation show that the French version of the TEPS has psychometric characteristics similar to the original version. These results highlight the discrepancy between results of direct or indirect report of experienced pleasure in patients with schizophrenia. Patients may have difficulties in anticipating the pleasure of future enjoyable activities, but not in experiencing pleasure once in an enjoyable activity. Medication and depression do not seems to modify our results, but this should be better controlled in a longitudinal study. The anticipatory versus consummatory pleasure distinction appears to be useful for the development of new psychosocial interventions, tailored to improve desire in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Major limitations of the study are the small size of patient sample and the under representation of men in the control sample."}, {"Title": "Experiencing stigma: Nepalese perspectives.", "Abstract": "Experiencing stigma by patients with mental illness in their day to day lives has substantial importance in treatment, compliance and quality of life.

Patients were assessed using self-report questionnaire which focused on beliefs about discrimination against mental illness, rejection experiences, and ways of coping with stigma. Patient's socio demographic profiles were also assessed.\nFifty three patients completed questionnaire concerning various constructs of stigma. There were 29 male patients and 24 female patients. Majority (N=45; 84.9%) were of Hindu religion but there were mixed numbers regarding caste. Most of the patients were aware of the stigma associated with mental illness. There were experiences of rejection by family members and colleagues (N=23; 43.4%) and health care professional (N=16; 30.2%). There were strong perceptions of stigmatization felt by patients in different social circumstances.

NPY enhances the release of glutaminiane, which results in the anticonvulsing effect as well as in a neuroprotective one. The role of NPY in the stress mechanism, pathogenesis of depression, response to antidepressive treatment and the antianxiety profile of NPY in the brain structure has also been discussed. Taking into account its antidepressive and anticonvulsive profile, as well as neuroprotective properties, the searching for agonists and antagonists of its receptors seems to be interesting, as a possible way of influencing separate receptors and eventually controlling the physiological processes."}, {"Title": "[Shock therapy in psychiatry--historical feature].", "Abstract": "2008 brings the 70th anniversary of the first electroconvulsive treatment, which was applied in a Psychiatric Clinic of Rome and introduced a new physical therapy to the clinical practice.

The results show that the costs are independent of the pathology, but they correlate to the level of medical-social dependence and to the existence (or not) of family and social support structures. The most expensive care per year is that of patients diagnosed with dementia, intellectual deficiencies, or problems of schizophrenia. If the sociological variables of sex, age and professional category are highly significant in the redistribution of cost, these are independent of the quality and provision of care, measured by a comprehensive, overall operational scale (EGF). 10% of patients consume 75% of the available resources but only 50% of the ambulatory care. The definitive costs are ultimately influenced by hospitalization. The increase in the number of patients actively seeking treatment and the increase in ambulatory care provided levels out year after year for which there is a noted decrease in full time hospitalization. Regardless of the diagnosis, full time hospital care carries the same cost. Therefore, the 10% of patients for whom care is most expensive are those who have been diagnosed with CIM 10, schizophrenic patients representing less than half of them."}, {"Title": "Creative nonfiction: narrative and revelation.", "Abstract": "Creative nonfiction and the illness narrative are recently identified approaches to literary expression.

Also in Italy the first innovations to the technique, notably the transorbital variation, were introduced. Moreover, all these activities took place without any sign of the protest seen elsewhere.

They impact several cognitive abilities but most importantly attention, memory and executive functions, consequently leading to great difficulties in everyday life. Most schizophrenia patients need assurance and require assistance and help from care workers, family members and friends. Family members taking care of a patient have additional daily work burden, and suffer psychological anguish and anxiety. Therefore, improving cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients is essential for the well-being of patients and their relatives. Reducing these deficits may decrease the economic burden to the health care system through lower numbers of hospital admissions and shorter hospitalisation periods, for example. Cognitive rehabilitation was developed to address the limited benefits of conventional treatments on cognitive deficits through the use of assistive technology as a means of enhancing memory and executive skills in schizophrenia patients.\nTo provide clinicians with comprehensive knowledge on cognitive trainings, programs of remediation, and cognitive assistive technologies.\nLiterature review. A search in the electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Index Medicus) for recent articles in the last 10 years related to cognitive remediation published in any language using the words: cognitive and remediation or rehabilitation and schizophrenia, and a search for chapters in psychiatry and rehabilitation textbooks.\nWe found 392 articles and 112 review paper mainly in English. First, we identified cognitive remediation programs that were beneficial to schizophrenia patients. Programs available in French (IPT, RECOS, and RehaCom) and others (CET, NET, CRT, NEAR, APT and CAT) were identified. In addition, since memory and executive function impairments could be present in people without schizophrenia, we reviewed inventories of cognitive assistive technologies proven to enhance cognitive skills in other populations. Finally, we present a review of recent studies testing innovative devices developed to assist schizophrenia patients.\nFirst, we found several cognitive programs proven to be effective with schizophrenia patients, but only three were validated in French. It could be useful to adapt other programs for French-speaking populations. Unfortunately, we found that very few of the existing cognitive assistive technologies are proposed to be used with schizophrenia patients. In fact, most of the available cognitive orthoses were tested primarily in people with neurological injuries (for example, various memory impairments caused by traumas), and in elderly illnesses (like Alzheimer disease). Devices for patients with mental deficits (e.g., mental retardation) were developed later, and only very recently explored for use in schizophrenia. As a result of an international collaboration between France and Canada, currently a tool called MOBUS is being tested. This technology aims at improving the autonomy of schizophrenia patients, by helping them plan and remember their daily activities. Furthermore, it encourages patient-caregiver communication, and permits monitoring patients' subjective reports of their symptoms. The use of cognitive assistive technologies is not meant to isolate patients by replacing the human element of relatives and caregivers by a machine. On the contrary, they offer a sense of security and they improve interpersonal relationships by permitting enhanced autonomy and greater self-confidence. Finally, a literature review of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia emphasizes the importance of a structured application of the technique in order for it to succeed. First, it is crucial to detect the impairments that will be targeted in each patient presenting a specific pattern of impairments. For this purpose, validated and customised neuropsychological tests are required. Then, cognitive remediation programs must be customised to each patient's needs in order to motivate the patient to participate. Finally, long-term effects must be assessed in order to verify whether reinforcement is needed. Following these steps, most of the studies show an improvement in the well-being of patients with schizophrenia. These recommendations are also suitable for the cognitive remediation programs, as for treatments with cognitive assistive devices. An important hurdle facing the advance of cognitive assistive technology programs is that different research groups work individually without a coordinated effort to improve and validate the existing programs.\nSchizophrenia treatments must take into account not only patients' symptoms, but also the associated cognitive deficits which constitute an important factor in their social problems. It has been shown that several cognitive remediation programs are efficient in schizophrenia. New technologies complement the benefits of such programs, and support pharmacological treatments and psychotherapies."}, {"Title": "[Prescribing patterns of antipsychotics in 13 French psychiatric hospitals].", "Abstract": "The commercial introduction of atypical antipsychotics, called second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), a few years ago, has led to a world-wide reappraisal of the established treatment strategies for people with psychotic or bipolar disorders. They permitted improvements in the pharmacologic management of psychiatric diseases. As compared to conventional neuroleptics or first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), they promised better efficacy especially on negative symptoms and cognitive impairments of psychiatric diseases and, at the same time, better tolerance on neurological side effects. Now, they have shown other side effects and they have a higher acquisition cost than FGAs.\nThe aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the prescribing practices of antipsychotic drugs in French psychiatric hospitals for adult inpatients and to compare them with other surveys and guidelines. In June 2004, we conducted a one-day, cross-sectional, observational and naturalistic study in 13 hospitals, members of the PIC network.\nTwo thousand one hundred and ninety-two prescriptions with antipsychotic treatment were collected. One thousand one hundred and fifty-four prescriptions (52.6%) included a SGA, but the FGAs were the most prescribed (65.8%; n=2259), principally cyamemazine (24.7%). There was one antipsychotic in 50.7% of prescriptions, two antipsychotics in 42.2%, but the second neuroleptic used was a sedative (82.6%), principally cyamemazine. Multiple antipsychotics were present in 1081 prescriptions (49.3%), with an average number of 1.57 antipsychotics. A mood stabiliser, an antidepressant, an anxiolytic and a hypnotic were coprescribed in respectively 37, 30.5, 65.1 and 41.6%. There were 2.48 psychotropic drugs associated with the principal antipsychotic; in total, with correctors of side-effects of the antipsychotics, there were 3.38 drugs per prescription. The SGAs aimed more often for psychotic (F20-F29) patients (61.9% versus 43.3% with FGAs), who were males (61.4% versus 68%), younger (42.6 years versus 44.1 years; p<0.02), with higher average daily doses, more associated with other neuroleptics (p<0.0004) and less associated with anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents (p<10(-4)) than FGAs. Compared to other surveys, these results showed that the SGAs have become the first-line treatment for psychiatric disorders. The highest average daily doses corresponded to treatments of psychotic patients and, hence, the values might largely exceed the authorized maximum doses. Furthermore, in more than half of the cases, an FGA, generally a sedative, was associated with an SGA that did not comply with the principle of monotherapy established by the national and international guidelines; that also annulled the expected benefit of the SGAs on the awakening, cognition and the neurological tolerability of the treatment. The coprescriptions of the other psychotropic drugs to neuroleptics also remained the rule in psychiatry, showing all the complexity of pharmacological psychiatric medications. Prescriptions also included treatments for side effects of antipsychotics; even on the prescriptions including the SGAs, there was the coprescription of anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs, the deleterious character of which one knows on cognition. This resulted in a difficulty of understanding the prescription for the patient, associated with reduced compliance and increased risks of pharmacological side effects. The heterogeneity of the situations of crisis in psychiatric hospitals could make the strict application of guidelines' recommendations difficult. Nevertheless, the educational interventions in psychopharmacology for patients and the training campaigns for psychiatrists and nurses are necessary to improve the therapeutic management of the patient and ensure him/her optimal quality of life.\nThis kind of survey, far too rare, was very important because it showed the routine clinical settings in which these new drugs were really used. The results showed that SGAs appeared to take the place of the FGAs used in the treatment of psychoses, particularly schizophrenia, but also in the treatment of mood disorders and they reflected actual clinical practices. Other surveys must be conducted to see whether our study confirms the general trend concerning the use of these drugs and, therefore, to reassess these prescribing practices."}, {"Title": "[Two Nobel prizes for psychiatry].", "Abstract": "It was pointed out that both Nobel prizes for medicine in the field of psychiatry have lost their importance in contemporary medicine.

With continuing improvements in the precision of MRI-based perfusion techniques, it is increasingly feasible to use this tool in the study of the subtle brain perfusion changes occurring in psychiatric illnesses. This article aims to review the existing literature on applications of perfusion MRI in psychiatric disorder and substance abuse research. The article also provides a brief introductory overview of dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and arterial spin labeling techniques. An outlook of necessary steps to bring perfusion MRI into the realm of clinical psychiatry as a diagnostic tool is brought forth. Opportunities for research in unexplored disorders and with higher field strengths are briefly examined.\nPubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge & Scopus were used to search the literature and cross reference several neuropsychiatric disorders with a search term construct, including \"magnetic resonance imaging,\" \"dynamic susceptibility contrast,\" \"arterial spin labeling,\" perfusion or \"cerebral blood flow\" or \"cerebral blood volume\" or \"mean transit time.\" The list of disorders used in the search included schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, autism, Asperger disease, attention deficit, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Huntington's disease, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, and substance abuse. For each disorder for which perfusion MRI studies were found, a brief overview of the disorder symptoms, treatment, prevalence, and existing models is provided, and previous findings from nuclear medicine-based perfusion imaging are overviewed. Findings of perfusion MRI studies are then summarized, and overlap of findings are discussed. Overarching conclusions are made, or an outlook for future work in the area is offered, where appropriate.\nDespite the now fairly broad availability of perfusion MRI, only a limited number of studies were found using this technology. The search produced 13 studies of schizophrenia, 7 studies in major depression, 12 studies in Alzheimer's disease, and 2 studies in Parkinson's disease. Drug abuse and other disorders have mainly been studied with nuclear medicine-based perfusion imaging. The literature concerning the use of perfusion imaging in psychiatry has not been reviewed in the last 5 years or more. The use of MRI for perfusion measurements in psychiatry has not been reviewed in 10 years.\nAlthough MRI-based perfusion imaging in psychiatry has mainly been used as a research tool, a path is progressively being cleared for its application in clinical diagnostic and treatment monitoring. The precision of perfusion MRI methods now rivals that of nuclear medicine-based perfusion imaging techniques. Because of their noninvasive nature, arterial spin labeling methods have gained popularity in studies of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. Perfusion imaging measurements have yet to be included within the diagnostic criteria of neuropsychiatric disorders despite having shown to have great discriminant power in specific disorders. As this young methodology continues to improve and research studies demonstrate the correlation of measured perfusion abnormalities to microcirculatory abnormalities and neuropsychiatric symptomatology, the idea of including such a test within diagnostic criteria for certain mental illnesses becomes increasingly plausible."}, {"Title": "Functional magnetic resonance in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging is a powerful tool for the study of the neurobiological changes in psychiatric disorders.

Cooperating with experts, especially the psychiatrist Karl August von Solbrig, they provided for new asylums to be established throughout Bavaria in a surprisingly short period of time. It was, however, only at personal intervention of King Max II. that the administrative and financial difficulties which had existed since the beginning of the 19th century could be overcome. The planning of asylums done by each administrative district of Bavaria vividly reflects rivalry as well as cooperation between all governmental and professional agencies involved. Modernization of psychiatry was publicly justified by referring to scientism, the need for a more progressive restructuring of administration, and the paternalistic care of the monarchy, whereas, from an administrative point of view, aspects of psychiatric treatment, like what kind of asylum would be best, were rather insignificant. The structures established by means of the alliance between state administration and psychiatric care under the rule of King Max II. had a lasting effect on the further development of Bavaria."}, {"Title": "Quality improvement in psychiatry: why measures matter.", "Abstract": "Increasing attention has been directed in healthcare today to the importance of performance measurement, (i.e., the implementation of measurable methods to demonstrate that practitioners are engaged in high-quality, evidence-based medicine).

First and longer part of this period belongs to the Modern era. The second part beginning in the sixties of the last century is the Postmodern era, the one we live in today. We have pointed out that the recent crisis has not come by accident but as one of the several changes characterising our transition into the era labelled \"Postmodern\".\nThe crisis of psychiatry was analysed in respect of the development of science and in social context. We focused on psychiatry and science and their interconnectedness in their historical articulations. A way out of the crisis of the current era can be found also with the use of historical methods.\nScience is changing both in respect of its quality and its role in our age. Taking into consideration normal and post-normal science, we differentiated two additional generations of science, pro-normal science and perato-scientia, in the most recent history. On the one hand, psychiatry serves as a paradigm for the conceptualisation of contemporary science. On the other hand, as an up-to-date science re-conceptualised partly according to its own paradigm it may find a way out of its own crisis. The many facets of the current crisis were demonstrated by analysing recent developments of the Hungarian health politics. Concerning this topic we adopted the term \"economicity\" elaborated by us earlier. We found that psychiatry operated by the hegemony of the rules of economicity might become a relay station for selecting patients to be thrown away as human garbage.\nThis catastrophic outcome may occur if a political system is organized purely by economicity rules without either historical responsibility or local solidarity. However, up-to-date trends of scientificity as shown by pro-normal science and perato-scientia guarantee a radically different course for psychiatry.

Retrospective medical chart review was performed, mainly focusing on the prevalence rate of bipolar depression, including the rate of diagnostic change during admission. We also investigated the characteristic symptoms of depressive episodes that could predict bipolar disorder.\nAt admission, in only 24.4% of the patients (N = 11) was bipolar disorder diagnosed. However, on the basis of diagnosis at discharge, a bipolar disorder prevalence rate of 73.3% (N = 33) was found. Of the patients with major depressive disorder at admission, 64.7% (N = 22) were subsequently reclassified as having bipolar disorder based on newly observed hypomanic or manic episodes during the admission period. The significant (p < .05) depressive symptoms at the time of filicide that could predict bipolar depression were the presence of postpartum-onset depression (95% CI = 1.45 to 160.88), psychotic symptoms (95% CI = 1.94 to 215.81), and nonaltruistic motivation for filicide (95% CI = 1.68 to 133.36).\nOur results suggest that mental health professionals should consider the possibility of bipolarity when they examine filicidal depressive mothers with postpartum-onset depression, psychotic symptoms, and nonaltruistic motivation for filicide."}, {"Title": "The history and current state of antidepressant clinical trial design: a call to action for proof-of-concept studies.", "Abstract": "The development of new antidepressant drugs has reached a plateau. There is an unmet need for faster, better, and safer medications, but as placebo-response rates rise, effect sizes shrink, and more studies fail or are negative, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly reluctant to invest in new drug development because of the risk of failure. In the absence of an identifiable human pathophysiology that can be modeled in preclinical studies, the principal point of leverage to move beyond the present dilemma may be improving the information gleaned from well-designed proof-of-concept (POC) studies of new antidepressant drugs with novel central nervous system effects. With this in mind, a group of experts was convened under the auspices of the University of Arizona Department of Psychiatry and Best Practice Project Management, Inc.\nForty-five experts in the study of antidepressant drugs from academia, government (U.S. Food and Drug Administration and National Institute of Mental Health), and industry participated. EVIDENCE/CONSENSUS PROCESS: In order to define the state of clinical trials methodology in the antidepressant area, and to chart a way forward, a 2-day consensus conference was held June 21-22, 2007, in Bethesda, Md., at which careful reviews of the literature were presented for discussion. Following the presentations, participants were divided into 3 workgroups and asked to address a series of separate questions related to methodology in POC studies. The goals were to review the history of antidepressant drug trials, discuss ways to improve study design and data analysis, and plan more informative POC studies.\nThe participants concluded that the federal government, academic centers, and the pharmaceutical industry need to collaborate on establishing a network of sites at which small, POC studies can be conducted and resulting data can be shared. New technologies to analyze and measure the major affective, cognitive, and behavioral components of depression in relationship to potential biomarkers of response should be incorporated. Standard assessment instruments should be employed across studies to allow for future meta-analyses, but new instruments should be developed to differentiate subtypes and symptom clusters within the disorder that might respond differently to treatment. Better early-stage POC studies are needed and should be able to amplify the signal strength of drug efficacy and enhance the quality of information in clinical trials of new medications with novel pharmacologic profiles."}, {"Title": "[Gerontopsychiatric Consultation-Liaison Service--pioneers wait for imitators].", "Abstract": "The treatment and care of individuals with dementia, who are admitted to general hospitals due to somatic diseases, often leads to crisis situations which not only compromise the therapeutic benefit, but also can be followed by avoidable institutionalization in nursing homes or psychiatric hospitals.

A multiprofessional team consisting of a medical specialist, nurses specialized in psychiatry and an occupational therapist supports the health personnel by giving assistance and advice. It also provides contact persons for patients and their families. The effectiveness analysis proved that the work of this service has positive effects on both patient care and costs.

Among psychiatry training directors, 85% responded that psychiatry training in their primary care programs was minimal to suboptimal, while 68% of family practice training directors responded that their psychiatry training was optimal to extensive. Among psychiatry training directors, 89% were dissatisfied with the psychiatry training in their primary care programs, and only 8% were satisfied. In contrast, almost half of primary care training directors were satisfied. However, within the primary care programs, there was a marked difference between family practice (majority satisfied) and the rest (internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, mostly unsatisfied). All primary care and psychiatry training directors agreed that most basic psychiatric skills and diagnoses were taught in the primary care programs. For all skills and syndromes examined, psychiatry training directors consistently and significantly rated the training to be less adequate than did primary care training directors. There was general agreement that primary care physicians should be able to treat most uncomplicated cases in patients with psychiatric disorders, and some but not other psychiatric conditions.\nPsychiatry and primary care training directors, except in family practice, generally agree that psychiatry training in primary care programs is inadequate and should be significantly enhanced.

In PGY-2, interview scores differentiated between the top quartile of performance and the other three quartiles, while letters of reference differentiated performance in the top and bottom quartiles from the middle quartiles. Numerical differences among groups were not great enough to be practically useful, and no variables predicted which residents would leave the program before completing it.\nAs they are currently conducted, application interviews do not have sufficient power to predict performance during residency. Letters of reference may be useful to the extent that they reflect personal experience with the applicant, but differences in ratings of these letters are not great enough to base admission decisions on them.

The goal of this pilot study was to develop and evaluate the promise of a method of \"hands-on\" instruction in evidence-based medicine done in real clinical time.\nA modularized curriculum to promote decisionmaking strategies using evidence-based medicine during the course of actual patient care was delivered by an attending physician mentoring a small team on the inpatient and consultation-liaison psychiatry services at Stanford. A staggered cohort of 24 consecutive trainees was followed between August and January 2007. Measures of trainees' skills in evidence-based medicine were assessed before and after mentoring. A blinded grader scored each inventory according to an explicit, predefined rubric. Demonstrated proficiency in delivery in each of the core skills of evidence-based medicine was assessed as a secondary outcome measure via the attending physician's unblinded subjective evaluation of trainee performance. Subjective descriptions of the experience were obtained via review of trainees' evaluations.\nPostmeasures of knowledge and skills in evidence-based medicine increased significantly relative to baseline.

While the description of symptoms and signs of the disorder has remained mainly unchanged over the years, the way in which the authors have articulated the varied phenomenological manifestations has been different across periods. Great strides that have been made in recent years have brought about a convergence on a definition of the illness as well as methods of assessment that are acceptable to workers from research centres across the world. The structured interviews brought an organizational focus to the traditional psychiatric interview that provided a strict format and directions to the interviewer, which enables systematic assessment of all the criteria necessary for a diagnosis according to the given diagnostic system. Having a consensually shared set of diagnostic criteria as well as structured assessment devices helped to ensure a more common unit of analysis in research across the world. Though most workers would hail the operationalization of diagnostic criteria as an advance in psychiatry, there remain concerns about the impact that the quest for increased diagnostic reliability might have on validity. Given that the ultimate goal of any diagnostic system is to provide insights into the aetiology, pathophysiology and treatment of the disorder, examining various alternative diagnostic constructs and their validity is still an important area of schizophrenia research."}, {"Title": "Five personality dimensions in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.", "Abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract has been related to psychological factors.

Debates about whether we should continue to depend upon a categorical nosology still continue, but we argue that, despite the absence of clear dividing lines between psychiatric disorders and normality and ubiquity of diagnostic comorbidity, the current official approach to nosology has served child and adolescent psychiatric research surprisingly well. In particular we point to the utility of non-developmental diagnostic criteria as tools for discovering developmental effects on psychopathology. We also maintain that the search for sharper boundaries between disorders is fundamentally mistaken. However, official nosologies have tended to privilege information collected in diagnostic interviews and to sideline observational and other methods that cannot easily be made to conform to the format of their criteria. We suggest that it is time to remedy this situation. The ICD-10 and DSM-IV are useless for children under the age of about two, while alternatives, such as the DC:0-3, suffer from a profound lack of empirical support.

Biochemical and biophysical measurements demonstrated the presence of elevated levels of neurotoxic copper zinc and iron in the brains of AD patients. Intracellular levels of APP holoprotein were shown to be modulated by iron by a mechanism that is similar to the translation control of the ferritin L- and H mRNAs by iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loops in their 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs). More recently a putative IRE-like sequence was hypothesized present in the Parkinsons's alpha synuclein (ASYN) transcript (see [A.L. Friedlich, R.E. Tanzi, J.T.

This approach supplies an answer in issues such as when, how much, how we give information and what words we use. We can address these questions more fully, if we combine the approach and use of the denial degree of each patient along with personality traits. Therefore, it is obvious that there is a relationship between characteristics and the expression of the denial mechanism, hence denial per se. It is worth stressing on how family and relatives react to the bad news. In fact, in some cases not only preserve but also exacerbate denial in their patient, whereas many times they press the physician not to disclose the patient's illness. The hardest difficulty in understanding the denial mechanism by therapists is to establish to which extent these denial-induced reactions are conscious or not. As much as this defense mechanism is simple to put down in words, it is difficult to understand it completely and assess how deeply rooted it is. Therefore, the concepts of the denial mechanism should be the subject of training. The best way to understand the denial mechanism is through Consulting-Liaison Psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Nurturance of children during inpatient psychiatric treatment of their parents].", "Abstract": "About a third of all inpatients in psychiatric hospitals are parents of children aged below 18 years. The mental illness of a parent and especially the need of inpatient treatment burdens families. This study was contributed to assess parental stress, behavioural and emotional problems of the children and the needs of psychiatric inpatients for support. Barriers and hindrances as well as positive experience with support for their children were assessed. All psychiatric hospitals in a county with about 1.5 million inhabitants in South-West Germany participated in this study. From 643 inpatients after drop-out 83 (54 female, 29 male) patients with non full aged children were questioned with inventories as the SDQ, the PSS and further assessments. Diagnoses and biographic data were assessed by the documentation of the German Association of psychiatry and psychotherapy. Parents reported about an increased level of stress by parenthood (PSS mean 41.9, SD 9.4). Psychopathology of the children influenced the stress of the mentally ill parents. 40% of the patients are dissatisfied with the care of their children during their inpatient treatment, but 51% have strong resentments against the youth welfare custodies and do not ask for support. Our results prove the high negative attitude of mentally ill parents against youth welfare service which must be reduced by active information policy and offers in collaboration with the treating psychiatrist of the parents."}, {"Title": "[Psychopharmacological drugs and ethiopathogenic theories in psychiatry. From discovery context to epistemological obstacle].", "Abstract": "This work postulates the thesis that the development of the contemporary psychopharmacology, which began with the chemical changes imposed to molecules with antihistaminergic properties, modelled the current ethiopatogenic theories of mental diseases. The development of chlorpromazine and imipramine was coincident with the beginning of the research about neurotransmission. This coincidence contributed for the construction of the dopaminergic theory of schizophrenia and in the monoaminergic theory of depression. Limitations of the effectivity of current drugs, as observed in the trials CATIE and STAR-D may justify a change of perspective in the search for new molecular targets for the treatment of both diseases. Historical data are provided to illustrate the above mentioned thesis, in the perspective of two epistemological concepts: the context of discovery proposed by Hans Reichenbach and the epistemological obstacle, proposed by Gaston Bachelard."}, {"Title": "[Category and dimension in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The present paper discusses the concepts of category and dimension in the field of Psychiatry.

The classical descriptions of psychiatric entities, of categorial linneage, have had and still have unquestionable weight in clinical practice and even in the construction of Psychiatry as a medical speciality. Its limitations, especially since the most recent versions of the DSM appeared, have given lieu both to objections and to new proposals, themselves not extent of conflict and limitations of their own.

Study aim was to find a 'prediction rule' for facilitating the diagnosis of past hypomania.\nIn an outpatient psychiatry private practice (non-tertiary care), a consecutive sample of 275 bipolar II disorder (BP-II) remitted patients, and consecutive, independent, sample of 138 major depressive disorder (MDD) remitted patients, had been interviewed for different study goals during follow-up visits by a senior bipolar-trained psychiatrist. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, modified and validated by Benazzi and Akiskal [Benazzi F (2007). Lancet 369: 935-945] to improve the probing for past hypomania, patients had been questioned about the most common symptoms and duration of recent threshold and subthreshold hypomanic episodes. The sample was retrospective in nature. A prediction rule was tested. This is a score resulting from the sum of the weighted scores of each hypomanic symptom which was an independent predictor of hypomania. Its cutoff score for discriminating hypomania was based on the highest figure of correctly classified hypomanias and on the most balanced combination of sensitivity and specificity. A second, independent sample of 138 BP-II and 71 MDD remitted outpatients was tested to replicate the findings.\nBy univariate logistic regression, hypomanic symptoms distinguishing BP-II and MDD included 'increase in goal-directed activity' (overactivity) (OR=28.3), 'elevated mood' (OR=14.9), 'increased talkativeness' (OR=9.2), 'inflated self-esteem', 'decreased need for sleep', 'excessive risky activities', and 'irritable mood'. By multivariable logistic regression, the independent predictors of hypomania resulted 'increase in goal-directed activity' (OR=14.9, weighted score=15), 'elevated mood' (OR=7.5, weighted score=7), 'increased talkativeness' (OR=3.6, weighted score=4); 'irritable mood', 'inflated self-esteem', 'decreased need for sleep', and 'excessive risky activities' had ORs between 2.04 and 2.39, with a weighted score=2. The prediction rule showed that the cutpoint score > or = 21 had the highest figure of correctly classified hypomanias (88%, ROC area=0.94), showing the most balanced combination of sensitivity (87%) and specificity (89%). This prediction rule, tested on the second sample, found that the same cutoff score > or =21 correctly classified the highest figure of hypomanias (94%, ROC area=0.97), showing the most balanced combination of sensitivity (93%) and specificity (95%). To cross this cutoff score, overactivity was always required (as the sum of the scores of elevated mood and of the other symptoms did not reach this cutoff). However, scores 10 to 20 correctly classified only slightly lower figures of hypomanias.\nA prediction rule for hypomania was tested. The scores of overactivity plus at least some hypomanic symptom (among elevated mood, irritability, inflated self-esteem, less sleep, talkativeness, excessive risky activities) correctly classified 88% of hypomanias. Instead, elevated mood without overactivity, plus even all the other symptoms, did not reach the best figure of correctly classified. However, lower cutoff scores, up to 10, classified slightly lower figures of hypomanias, but with less balanced combinations of sensitivity and specificity. These findings may have diagnostic utility, because BP-II versus MDD is likely to be a more severe disorder. This prediction rule, if replicated and fine-tuned in different settings, may help clinicians better probing past hypomania, thus reducing the common misdiagnosis of BP-II as MDD."}, {"Title": "Domestic homicide cases related to schizophrenic offenders.", "Abstract": "The goal of this study was identification of highly specific patterns of schizophrenia related domestic homicides by comparing schizophrenic homicide offenders with related domestic homicide group of offenders diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders.

This study showed some specific characteristics in the cases of schizophrenic offenders; they are more often commit parricides and siblicides, the victims are often males with their own physical strength. Furthermore, schizophrenic offenders were indifferent upon killing their victim; they were less often provoked by a victim itself and were sober tempore criminis.

Agnosias wipe off the definite functions from the brain's activity precisely and completely, allowing the consciousness to be investigated in itself. Thorough investigations of confabulatory manifestations disclose the rationale for the development of pathological functions and point out that there is a remedial (reconstructive) sense behind the senselessness of a mental state. Pathology seems to be accompanied by involuntary reparation on the part of the brain. Investigations of the conscious activity in agnosias show a separate, passive and real brain system of consciousness without pathology and genetic regulations. Neurological symbolic agnosias represent a cerebral and notional character and therefore constitute a link between neurological and psychiatric agnosias, which proves the existence of the same mechanism of development underlying agnosic syndromes, both in psychiatry and neurology.

Critics have questioned why such standards and policies fail to move from rhetoric to reality, this particularly being applicable to carer involvement within acute psychiatric settings. As there is only limited UK research on this topic, this interpretive phenomenological study was undertaken to explore the perceived level of involvement from the perspective of carers of service users who were admitted to acute inpatient settings within the previous 2 years. Interviews were conducted with four individuals who cared for a loved one with a mental illness. The interview analysis was influenced by Van Manen, whose interpretive approach seeks to generate a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under study. Four main themes emerged: powerlessness, feeling isolated, needing to be recognized and valued, and a desire for partnership. The findings reflect the views expressed by carers in other studies, identifying that while carers seek to work in partnership with health-care professionals, at a clinical level they often feel excluded.

This relaxed attitude with regard to AD methods may be changing now with Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) evidence that carefully standardized protocols are needed to validate biomarkers for use in AD diagnosis, drug development, and patient care. In the fields of psychiatry and AD, recent studies have detected serious inaccuracies, imprecision, biases and compromises of study protocols able to invalidate CT outcome data and conclusions drawn from these data. This limited but troubling evidence reinforces ADNI calls for more detailed methodological protocols. Based on the limits to precision and accuracy associated with rated outcomes in CTs and patient care, we call for priority to be given to the qualification and use of biomarkers as outcome variables in AD drug development and patient care and, to insure effective uses of biomarkers, to development of protocol guided practices being modeled in ADNI research.

Finally, Cajal studied the histophysiological mechanisms of the higher mentalfunctions (thought, intelligence, memory, perception, etc.). He proposed that the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex, which he called 'psychic cells', formed the substrate of these functions; he proposed the law of 'avalanche conduction', and he speculated on the possibility of a phenomenon of neuronal plasticity in relation to learning processes.

Genes and the environment influence each other via complex processes. Psychopathology apparently develops as a result of a person's genetic make-up which can influence behaviour only in the context of specific environmental factors. Or, you can turn the argument around: environmental factors only lead to psychopathology if someone has a specific genetic make-up. Genes and the environment are therefore dependent on each other and interact on a daily basis. People, just like plants and animals, are finely tuned so that adaptation can occur. The quality of early relationships plays a decisive role in this tuning.

In this article, we will discuss whether the neurosciences and new psychopharmacological solutions really support patients who suffer from mental illnesses. To answer this question, we will focus on the perspective of patients and their experiences with psychiatric (coercive) treatments. The analysis of one person's story shows that other issues besides appropriate medication are important for recovery from a mental illness. In daily life, issues such as coping, rehabilitation and social support are of major importance for a patient suffering from psychiatric disease. Thus, although progress in the neurosciences is a positive development for clinical practice, it does not mean that (coercive) medication alone will carry a patient into recovery. A patient's recovery is dependent, not only upon the process of finding the appropriate medication and trust between the psychiatrist and the patient, but also upon relational aspects, such as being recognised as a person, belonging, accepting responsibilities, developing friendships and trusting others. These findings lead to the conclusion that dealing with psychiatric diseases is more complex than what the biomedical model of neuroscience suggests and that one should include the social context of the patient in the recovery process."}, {"Title": "The concept of spirituality in relation to addiction recovery and general psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This chapter is directed at defining the nature of spirituality and its relationship to empirical research and clinical practice.

Financial conflict of interest has been reported to be frequent in clinical trials in general medicine. It is estimated that 89%-98% of comparative drug treatment studies are funded by pharmaceutical companies. It was reported that favorable outcomes for the firms conducting these studies were significantly more common in industry-funded studies than in non-industry funded ones. These biased outcomes were due to conscious or unconscious decisions about the design, data analysis, and publishing of the studies.

Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most commonly prescribed treatment for children with ADHD. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of MPH on visual selective attention, sustained attention, and visual spatial attention in children with ADHD.\nThe study sample included 43 children (32 boys, 11 girls: age range: 7-12 years) that met the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD and consecutively referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Psychiatry Department of G\u00fclhane Military Medical School. ADHD was evaluated with the Child and Adolescent Behavior Disorders Screening and Rating Scale, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Intervention (MINI) was administered to exclude comorbid diagnoses. Visual selective attention and sustained attention were measured by verbal and non-verbal Cancellation Tests, while visual spatial attention was measured with the Line Orientation Test (LOT).\nMPH administration increased the number of correct target detections and decreased the number of omission and commission errors, and shortened the time required for completion on the verbal and non-verbal Cancellation Tests, and also produced a more systematic pattern on the organized letters and figures subtests. MPH administration also improved LOT performance.\nThe findings show that MPH medication was associated with improved visual selective attention, sustained attention, and visual spatial attention in children with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Prayer as therapeutic process toward aliveness within a spiritual direction relationship.", "Abstract": "This article underscores the potential benefit of a specific form of Christian prayer that creates space within a spiritual direction relationship for the creation of inner images that reveal a person's unconscious relational longings and co-created representations of God. In this specific type of prayer that can be facilitated by mental health professionals and pastoral counselors, imagery of God's presence is created in the space between a Christian spiritual director and a Christian directee while they are open to inner experiences that reveal God's presence interacting with infantile processes toward aliveness. Aliveness is understood using Winnicottian notions in dialog with theories proposed by Allan N. Schore, affective neuropsychologist and Clinical Faculty at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, Ann Belford Ulanov, Jungian Analyst and Professor of Psychiatry and Religion at Union Theological Seminary and W.R.D. Fairbairn, [added] British psychoanalyst in the Objects Relations School. Ideas of transitional space, good enough mother, holding environment, aggression, creativity, and play are set alongside theories of affect regulation, the developing brain, co-created objective God images, the relational nature of God and being received as good while illuminating three prayer experiences during one 30-year-old Asian American woman's 16-month therapeutic process toward aliveness."}, {"Title": "J. Robert Oppenheimer: a faith development portrait.", "Abstract": "J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world.

To meet this mission the ACGME has firmly established a competency based focus for resident education. The current manuscript describes the six general ACGME competencies of Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice-based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, Professionalism and Systems-based Practice. Then, a brief description of efforts by the institution of the authors to create best practice models for competency based curriculums and outcomes is provided. Specific focus is on strategies used within the psychiatry residency and ways a Graduate Psychology Education grant fostered interdisciplinary training between psychology and family medicine that enhanced the development of competencies for both disciplines. The paper also comments on the training experiences and attitudes that can prepare psychologists to assist physician colleagues in meeting competencies."}, {"Title": "Polypharmacy prevalence rates in the treatment of unipolar depression in an outpatient clinic.", "Abstract": "Unipolar depression is a complex illness with an ever increasing number of pharmacological treatments available. As the number of available medication options increases, so does the potential for polypharmacy, a practice with possible complications. Such complications include a greater number of side effects with the initiation of additional medications and the consequences of drug-drug interactions. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of polypharmacy on efficacy of treatment as well as whether polypharmacy is instituted after appropriate initial monotherapy trials. This study attempts to answer these questions.\nPatient names for this investigation were provided by residents in the UMass Medical School Psychiatry Residency program. The charts of these patients were analyzed to collect data regarding demographics, clinical data about the illness, medication names, types, duration of use and to access efficacy using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI).\nOf 160 reviewed charts, 135 subjects were included in the final analyses (others excluded due to incomplete data or no depression diagnosis). Patients were on average on 2.0 medications (SD=0.5) with 2.1 past trials. A greater number of current antidepressant medications did not correlate with a greater improvement in CGI, implying that polypharmacy did not necessarily lead to greater efficacy. The impact of illness severity, as measured by comorbidities, substance abuse, and trauma history, were included in the analysis, and did not significantly change this outcome. Additionally, prescription patterns themselves were examined, including reasons for termination of medication trials, the impact of side-effects, and the number of patients that had complete monotherapy trials before transitioning to polypharmacy.\nSmall sample size, retrospective review, one CGI rater.\nFirst, many patients did not receive an adequate monotherapy trial, as defined by dose and duration, before progressing to polypharmacy. Secondly, the use of two or more medications concurrently did not appear to increase efficacy as measured by CGI. Due to study limitations, direct comparison of the efficacy of one and two medications was not significant; however the study did demonstrate a general correlation between polypharmacy and greater depressive symptomatology. This suggests the need for optimizing monotherapy regimens before initiating polypharmacy that may not lead to improvement in symptoms."}, {"Title": "Foucault on methadone: beyond biopower.", "Abstract": "This essay reviews four texts which critically analyse methadone maintenance therapy using Foucault as a key theoretical framework: [Friedman, J., & Alicea, M.

While all four view MMT as a regulatory technology which aims to create productive and obedient subjects, their understandings of the power relations of the clinic are quite distinct. The first two texts emphasise the social control of drug users, the third, issues of governmentality and liberal political practice, while the fourth engages with ontological questions about substances themselves. Thus while Foucauldian analysis has become familiar in social studies of drugs and alcohol, new uses for its conceptual tools continue to emerge."}, {"Title": "Paradoxical depression in renal transplant recipients.", "Abstract": "Paradoxical depression occurs despite a completely successful transplantation without tissue rejection or other medical complications. In this study, the occurrence of paradoxical depression was retrospectively investigated among 1,139 Japanese successful renal transplant recipients January 1997 through September 2006. Among the 1,139 recipients, 103 visited the Department of Psychiatry after renal transplantation, including 40 with depressive symptoms and 15 with a physical problem considered to have nonparadoxical depression. The other 25 recipients were considered to have paradoxical depression; that is, more than half of the 40 recipients with depressive symptoms had paradoxical depression. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics, including average age at the time of renal transplantation, rate of living-donor transplantation, rate of ABO incompatibility, method of dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), duration of dialysis, and time interval between the renal transplantation and the initial visit to the Department of Psychiatry among the 2 groups. These results suggested that there was another risk factor or interactions between factors. Of the 25 recipients, 6 had relationship problems, 6 had social-rehabilitation problems, and 13 had mentioned no clear psychological problems. These psychological factors might in fact be related to the loss of an imagined past. Additional consecutive prospective studies are needed-a challenging prospect for consultation liaison psychiatrists in the field of transplantation."}, {"Title": "Insurance coverage and the treatment of mental illness: effect on medication and provider use.", "Abstract": "Canada's public health insurance system fully covers medically necessary hospital and physician services, but does not cover community-based non-physician mental health provider services or prescription drugs. Almost 2/3 of Canadians have private supplemental insurance for extended health benefits, typically through their employer, so its distribution is skewed to higher-income, employed Canadians, and typically features substantial cost-sharing and coverage limits. A recent national survey suggests only one-third of Canadians with selected mental disorders talked to a health professional during the previous 12 months and only a minority (19.3%) receive drug treatment. Financial barriers to care constitute a potentially important contributor to this under-use of mental health treatments.\nThe objective is to understand how private supplemental insurance status affects the utilization of prescription medication and four types of community-based providers for mental health problems in Canada.\nThe data derive from a special mental health supplement to the nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey. Utilization of five types of prescribed medications (sleep, anxiety, mood stabilizers, anti-depressants and anti-psychotics) is measured dichotomously as use/no-use in the previous 12 months. Utilization of community-based provider services (family physician, psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker) is measured as (i) use/no-use and (ii) conditional on use, number of contacts in the previous 12 months. We employ multivariate regression methods appropriate to the binary and count nature of the dependent variable to measure the impact of supplemental private insurance status on utilization, controlling for health, demographic and socio-economic characteristics. We test for endogeneity of insurance status using instrumental variable techniques.\nHaving private supplemental insurance significantly increases the odds of using medications for mental illness, with particularly large increases for anti-psychotic and mood-stabilizer medications. Private supplemental insurance coverage does not increase use of provider services. We find little evidence of endogeneity of private insurance.\nLack of supplemental insurance for prescription medication is a potentially important financial barrier to mental health treatment in Canada. The estimated effect is likely understated because the utilization measure does not capture quantity of medication use. It is not surprising that no significant relationship between private insurance status and utilization of provider services is found for publicly-covered family physician and psychiatry services, where the link between supplemental insurance and use is indirect, through the need to visit a physician to obtain a prescription. The result is surprising for psychologists and social workers, and may reflect limits to private coverage which are not fully captured here.\nInsurance coverage has an important relative impact on the likelihood of drug use for mental illness.\nA program that offers insurance coverage for anti-psychotic and mood-stabilizing medication could reduce the high personal and societal burden associated with serious mental illness, without a large overall budgetary impact.\nFuture research should incorporate insurance measures which capture details of coverage among all survey respondents. Linking survey to utilization data will help to overcome issues of recall bias."}, {"Title": "William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience revisited.", "Abstract": "This essay addresses the familial, religious, and cultural context for the writing and presentation of William James' classic work The Varieties of Religious Experience.

Blanchard (J Sex Marital Ther 17:235-251, 1991) suggested that these paraphilic sexual interests, along with fetishism, represented erotic target location errors, i.e., developmental errors in locating erotic targets in the environment. Because the desire to impersonate or become a facsimile of the kind of person to whom one is attracted can have significant implications for identity, Freund and Blanchard (Br J Psychiatry 162:558-563, 1993) coined the term erotic target identity inversion to describe this type of erotic target location error. The best-known examples of erotic target identity inversions occur in men who are sexually attracted to women and who are also sexually aroused by the idea of impersonating or becoming women; these paraphilic interests manifest as transvestic fetishism and as one type of male-to-female transsexualism. Analogous erotic target identity inversions have been described in men who are sexually attracted to children and to female amputees. In theory, erotic target identity inversions should also occur in men who are sexually attracted to men. There have been no unambiguous descriptions, however, of men who are sexually attracted to men and also sexually aroused by the idea of changing their bodies to become more sexually attractive men. This report describes such a man, whose paraphilic interest would appropriately be called anatomic autoandrophilia. The demonstration that anatomic autoandrophilia exists in men is consistent with the theory that erotic target location errors constitute an independent paraphilic dimension."}, {"Title": "Commentary: on walking and talking.", "Abstract": "I welcome Dr. Kapoor's reflections on psychotherapy with offender patients.

The CHESS method involves identifying a Claim or preliminary opinion; developing a Hierarchy of supporting evidence; examining the evidence for weaknesses or areas of Exposure; Studying and revising the claim and supporting evidence; and Synthesizing a revised opinion. Case examples illustrate how the CHESS method may help experts reduce bias while strengthening opinions. The method also helps experts prepare for court by reminding them to anticipate questions that may be asked during cross-examination. The CHESS method provides a framework for formulating, revising, and identifying limitations of opinions, which allows experts to incorporate neutrality into forensic opinions."}, {"Title": "Generalized deficit in all core components of empathy in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Empathy is a multidimensional construct composed of several components such as emotion recognition, emotional perspective taking and affective responsiveness. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in several domains of emotion processing and perspective taking, thus suggesting a dysfunctional emotional competence. We assessed empathic abilities via three paradigms measuring emotion recognition, perspective taking and affective responsiveness as well as self-report empathy questionnaires in 24 (12 females, 12 males) schizophrenia patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy volunteers. Patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, RWTH Aachen University and healthy volunteers were recruited via advertisement. Groups were matched for age, gender and parental education. Data analysis indicates a significant empathic deficit in patients, reflected in worse performance in all three domains. This deficit was only partly reflected in the self-report empathy questionnaires. Comparing the different tasks, emotional perspective taking was the most difficult task for all subjects and symptomatology worsened affective responsiveness. Schizophrenia patients not only struggle to correctly identify emotions, but also have difficulties in spontaneously simulating another person's subjective world (perspective taking) and might not be able to respond adequately in terms of their own emotional experience (affective responsiveness), which are not caused by emotion perception deficits. The results suggest that all domains of empathy are affected in schizophrenia and have to be addressed independently in behavioral therapies, thereby offering a possibility to improve socio-occupational life."}, {"Title": "[Criminal recidivism among sexual offenders].", "Abstract": "No previous reports have been published on the rate, frequency and nature of long-term sexual recidivism for a large cohort of Danish sexual offenders who have been through a forensic psychiatric evaluation.\nA retrospective follow-up study of all male sexual offenders evaluated between 1st January 1978 and 31st December 1992 at the Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Aarhus University Hospital, or at the Clinic of Forensic Psychiatry, Ministry of Justice, Copenhagen (n = 441).\nOf the followed cohort (n = 342) 30% were sentenced for a new sexual criminal offence (including severe sexual acts), 17% for severe sexual acts, 32% for nonsexual violence and 61% for general crime during follow-up (average 16.5 years). There was a low rate of repeated sexual recidivism (12%) and severe sexual recidivism (6%). Extra-familial child molesters and exhibitionists had the highest risk of sexual recidivism and repeated sexual offences. Rapists had the highest risk of severe sexual recidivism and re-offended more rapidly than the other offender subgroups. Intra-familial child molesters had a low recidivism rate. Young offenders had a higher recidivism risk than older offenders. Severely mentally ill or retarded had a statistically lower rate of sexual recidivism than less disturbed offenders.\nThe sexual recidivism rate varies across sexual offender types.

Included for review were scientifically valid articles that described controlled studies, comparing TMH with a non-TMH alternative, and uncontrolled studies that had no fewer than 20 participants. Quality of the evidence was assessed with an approach that considers both study performance and study design. Judgments were made on whether further data were needed to establish each TMH application as suitable for routine clinical use.\nIncluded in the review were 72 papers that described 65 clinical studies; 32 (49%) studies were of high or good quality. Quality of evidence was higher for Internet- and telephone-based interventions than for video conferencing approaches. There was evidence of success with TMH in the areas of child psychiatry, depression, dementia, schizophrenia, suicide prevention, posttraumatic stress, panic disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, and smoking prevention. Evidence of success for general TMH programs and in the management of obsessive-compulsive disorder were less convincing. Further study was judged to be necessary or desirable in 53 (82%) of the studies.\nEvidence of benefit from TMH applications is encouraging, though still limited. There is a need for more good-quality studies on the use of TMH in routine care.

GSs are defined as the difference between residents' perceived current and desired level of knowledge or skill in selected physician-manager domains. Residents' educational preferences were also elicited in the questionnaire.\nAmong the 494 psychiatry residents who were sent the survey, 237 residents (48%) responded. Residents reported the greatest GSk in Program Planning and the greatest GSs in Personal and Professional Self-Care. Predictors of greater total GSks included a lack of previous administrative education during medical school, higher training level, and female sex. Only sex was a significant predictor of total GSss. More than 50% of residents preferred workshops, small groups, mentoring, and didactic learning methods for furthering their knowledge and skills.\nResidents report significant gaps in specific physician-manager training areas, specifically Program Planning, and Personal and Professional Self-Care.

Further, psychiatrists may find exciting work within the relatively new field of palliative care, which is devoted to the prevention and relief of all suffering. Increasingly, individuals are living longer with multiple issues that cause suffering, interfere with their lives, and often lead to psychosocial sequelae. To ensure state-of-the-art care for patients and families throughout an illness and any ensuing bereavement period, many experienced psychiatrists are needed as consultants to, and as members of, interdisciplinary palliative care teams. This need presents limitless opportunities for psychiatrists to care for patients, provide education, and engage in research.

A Dutch perspective.", "Abstract": "Social psychiatry as an academic discipline and field of clinical practice seems to have lost its prominence and is being incorporated in regular clinical services of mental healthcare and also in various branches of social, genetic, psychiatric or clinical epidemiology. However, the central debate in social psychiatry from its very beginning on how to care best for patients with severe mental illness (SMI) in the community, what to do with mental hospitals as potentially harmful pernicious institutions or with the hospitalization process, has never lost its momentum even in scientific meetings today. Social psychiatry and rehabilitation share a common focus on these issues, e.g. on independent living and working, on participation in society, and on prevention of hospitalization. Rehabilitation as an ideological and somewhat revolutionary movement of users and professionals in wanting to produce a fundamental change of mental healthcare (e.g. no compulsory treatment) and of society (e.g. elimination of stigma) developed its methods away from medicine and psychiatry and also away from testing these methods. Nowadays we observe growing scientific evidence for various psychosocial rehabilitative interventions which could substantiate the original mission of social psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Which future for social psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Social psychiatry started over a century ago under the auspices of mental and racial hygiene, but after World War II it embraced concepts of community-based care and de-institutionalization. The major psychiatric reforms in the second half of the last century were mainly based on such concepts, including the reforms of Swiss and especially Zurich psychiatry. The present needs for psychiatric care, and the specific political and economic conditions for a continuation along this line are explored and found to be favourable. Also, the profile of future psychiatrists, as formulated by professional associations and expert groups, corresponds to concepts of social psychiatry. The World Health Organization stimulates service improvements in the same direction. The consequences concern the education and training, and the professional role of future psychiatrists. Finally, the future of social psychiatry will be shaped by public expectations and acceptance of community-based services."}, {"Title": "From the hospital into the community and back again - a trend towards re-institutionalisation in mental health care?", "Abstract": "Despite numerous and indispensable advantages, the shift from hospital-based to community mental healthcare has engendered problems. To analyse whether or not the process of de-institutionalization has gone too far, studies are needed that cover general psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, and penitentiaries as interlocked systems, but these are still scarce.\nWe combined epidemiological and service utilization data from three recent European studies that explored the legal frameworks for and the practices with regard to involuntary treatment in general mental healthcare, to the care of mentally disordered offenders in forensic care and to the care of mentally ill inmates in the European prison systems, and used more specific data from one country to illustrate how changes to the legal frameworks in one sector may potentially affect the others.\nTime series from European Union (EU) member states suggest that civil detention rates remained more or less stable during the 1990s, though on rather different levels internationally. Admissions to forensic psychiatric facilities increased during the same period. Data on the mental state (or changes in rates of psychiatric morbidity) in European prison populations are not available-aside from the prison suicide rate. Data from selected countries are likely to suggest that changes to the legal framework in one sector may considerably affect admission rates in others.\nNational or regional studies are needed to analyse the linkage between sectors and to identify inappropriate patient shifting.

Although fewer studies have been conducted in community psychiatry than in psychological treatments, there is increasing evidence that the therapeutic relationship predicts outcome across various psychiatric settings. The clinician-patient relationship and communication may indirectly improve outcome, e.g. mediated through better treatment adherence. Yet, evidence suggests that these interpersonal processes also have a direct therapeutic effect. Thus, depending on the conceptual model of therapeutic processes they may be seen as therapy in itself. Clinicians receive little specific instruction and supervision in communication skills, and research on the issue is scarce. Whilst there are conceptual and methodological challenges to such research, the aim should be to identify therapeutically effective elements of relationships and communication that can be tested in experimental studies. Although still rare, interventions to improve clinician-patient communication in routine mental healthcare show favourable results. A further step may be adapting established psychological treatment models, such as cognitive behaviour or solution focused therapy, to make routine clinical interactions more therapeutic and evidence based. This would be in the interest of clinicians, in optimizing their therapeutic potential, and patients alike."}, {"Title": "Do social psychiatry and neurosciences need psychopathology-and if yes, what for?", "Abstract": "Psychopathology is usually recognized as an important clinical and research tool in psychiatric textbooks. However, in the era of operationalized psychiatric diagnosis, therapeutic guidelines and strong neuroscientific impact on the self-understanding of psychiatry, its role became somewhat insecure in recent decades. And it has even been argued that psychopathology will sooner or later be fully replaced by neuroscientific concepts. This paper elucidates the theoretical (and, partly, historical) framework of this debate and argues for a modern understanding of psychopathology. This understanding will, on the one hand, be compatible with neurobiological and social sciences appoaches to mental illness, and, on the other hand, will not abandon psychopathology's demand to be an indispensable foundation of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "How depressive symptoms correlate with stigma perception of mental illness.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to survey the attitudes of 115 patients with the diagnosis of somatoform pain disorder, toward anticipated discrimination and mental illness stigma and how it is influenced by depressive symptoms.\n115 consecutive in- and outpatients with somatoform pain disorder (mean age: 50 +/- 11 years; 62% female) from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, were administered a modified 12-item version of Link's Perceived Stigma Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory.\nWith regard to close personal relationships, such as taking care of children or dating, somatoform pain patients showed a rather high perceived stigma score (over 70% for both items). Also nearly 70% think that 'most employers' would pass over the application of a psychiatric patient in favour of another applicant. The overall results show a significant correlation with depressive symptoms (r = 0.228 and p = 0.014).\nFear of stigma increases with depressive symptoms and both are a risk for treatment delay.

This new era is often referred to as \"postmodern.\" Social theory suggests that such transformations influence multifarious processes related to psychiatry, including risk factors, help-seeking behavior, the clinical encounter, and clinical outcomes. I introduce and critically discuss five key themes that arise out of sociological analysis of postmodernity and that may have special relevance to psychiatry: (1) individualization; (2) social roles and self-identity; (3) the culture of expertise; (4) the transformation of intimacy; and (5) future orientation. Although extant work implicitly corroborates the importance of the identified themes as influences relevant to psychiatry, little work in psychiatry has explicitly applied these themes or investigated their impact. Further integration of these themes into research may give a fresh perspective on important issues pertinent to contemporary psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Lack of insight in schizophrenia: a review. Part I: theoretical concept, clinical aspects and Amador's model].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is the psychiatric disorder in which the awareness of pathology (or insight) is most frequently altered.\nA review of the literature shows that between 50 and 80% of patients with schizophrenia do not believe they have a disorder. Studies published on this subject over the two last decades stressed the specificity of this phenomenon in schizophrenic patients, taking into account both its prevalence and its clinical consequences comparatively to other mental disorders. If in bipolar disorders a lack of insight is linked with the intensity and acuteness of symptomatology, there is only a limited relationship between these factors in schizophrenia, thus making lack of insight a trait rather than a state-related symptom.\nThough defined for a very long time as a dichotomic phenomenon, the recent interest on insight in psychosis and the development of assessment tools for its evaluation have made it possible to underline its multifactorial and dynamic characteristics. Although lack of insight related to pathologies may vary across time in bipolar disorders, the results of clinical studies suggest that this phenomenon remains stable in schizophrenia. CONCEPTUAL PROPOSALS: In this review, we will reconsider the evolution of this concept in psychiatry and its definition. The clinical characteristics, which are specifically associated with the lack of insight in schizophrenia will be outlined. We will describe more specifically the model of Amador and Strauss and their assessment tool: the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD). This model developed since the 1990s takes into account the time-related evolution of insight, and can be applied both to bipolar and psychotic disorders.\nThe SUMD has six general items and four subscales. The general items estimate the three most widely used definitions of insight: awareness of having a mental disorder, awareness of the achieved effects of medication and awareness of the social consequences of having a mental disorder, and include assessment of both current and past-time periods. Four other subscales, each composed of 17 items, assess awareness and attribution of specific current and retrospective symptoms as well as deficits associated with severe mental disorders. Insight, thus, appears as a multidimensional and continuous phenomenon, since patients' awareness may apply only to part of their symptoms and vary over time. In this article, we will review existing scales assessing insight in schizophrenia. The deficiency of available scales validated in French limits the number of scientific publications concerning this important aspect of the clinical evaluation of schizophrenic patients. THERAPEUTICAL ASPECTS: Finally, interventions to improve insight in patients with schizophrenia are presented. Recent studies have shown cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to be of benefit in the treatment of poor insight in schizophrenia.\nEvidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia leads to better prognosis. An important suggestion from theses studies may be that psychosocial therapy needs to focus on explanations that are in tune with the culture, rather than focus on diagnostic labels."}, {"Title": "[Interest of a new instrument to assess cognition in schizophrenia: The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS)].", "Abstract": "An increasing interest in the study of cognition in Schizophrenia has developed within the last few years although cognitive problems have been described in this disorder since the beginning of the 20th century. Presently, various data tend to assert that cognitive disorders are the core disturbance in schizophrenia and that their severity is predictive of the course of the disease. Indeed, studies have shown that the disturbances measured in cognitive tests are neither the consequences of positive or negative symptoms, nor related to motivation or global intellectual deficit, nor to anti-psychotic medication. It is also presently known that the severity of cognitive symptoms is a better indicator of social and functional outcome than the severity of the negative or positive symptoms. The patients who have the most severe cognitive deficits during the first episode of the disease are most likely to present a chronic and severe form later on. The aspects of cognition that are specifically impaired in schizophrenia are verbal memory, working memory, motor function, attention, executive functions, and verbal fluency. Cognitive disturbances are thus very important in several fields of research in schizophrenia such as: understanding the psychopathology, epidemiology (indicators of vulnerability), genetics (endophenotypes), neuro-imaging (including functional neuro-imaging), and psychopharmacology (they can be used as a parameter of evaluation in therapeutic trials with new molecules, or cognitive psychotherapy). LIMITS OF COGNITION ASSESSMENTS: However, there are some methodological limits to these cognitive evaluations. First, schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease and there are no specificities of the different subgroups in terms of cognition. Secondly, the time chosen to evaluate the abilities of the patient is also a limiting factor. But most of all, the batteries of tests used in different studies are not standardized. BRIEF ASSESSMENT OF COGNITION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: It is therefore of great interest to create an available and easily used battery of validated tests. This would enable one to measure the different cognitive deficits and to repeat the tests, and assess evolution through longitudinal follow up of the patients. The BACS is a new instrument developed by Keefe et al. in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Duke Medical Centre. It evaluates the cognitive dimensions specifically altered in schizophrenia and correlated with the evolution of the disease. This test is simple to use, requiring only paper, pencils and a stopwatch. It can be administered by different carers. The duration of the test session is approximately 35min. This battery of tests was validated on a sample of 150 patients compared with a sample of 50 controls, matched for age, parent education and ethnic groups. This aim of this study is to create a French adaptation of the BACS (translation and back translation approved by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Duke Medical Centre) and then to test its easiness of administration and its sensitivity, performing correlation analysis between the French Version of the BACS (version A) and a standard battery. Its adaptation and validation in French would at first be useful for the French-speaking areas and then would add some new data for the pertinence of using the BACS.\n35 French stabilized schizophrenic patients were recruited from the inpatient and outpatient facilities at the Clermont-de-L'Oise Mental Health Hospital (Picardie area, France) in Dr Boitard's Psychiatric Department (FJ 5.) Patients were required to meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective illness. The patients were tested on two separate days by two independent clinicians with less than two weeks between the two assessments. During the first test session, subjects received the French A version of the BACS and during the second session, they were administered the standard battery of cognitive tests including: the Rey Auditory-Verbal learning test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition, subtests (Digit inverse sequencing, Digit Symbol-Coding), the Trail-Making A, Verbal Fluency (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Category Instances), and the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (128 card version). The factor structure of the French BACS A Version was determined by performing a principal components analysis with oblique rotation. The relationship between the French BACS sub-scores and the standard battery sub-scores was determined by calculating Pearson's correlations among the sub-scores, with a level of significance of alpha<0.05.\nAll the 35 patients completed the standard battery and each subtest of the French BACS A Version without interruption and with good understanding of the instructions. The average duration of the BACS test sessions was 36.51min (S.D.=12.14.) compared to the standard battery in which the sessions lasted more than one hour with more difficulty during the Wisconsin tests. The factor analysis conducted on the data collected from patients suggests that there is a single dimension, a factor of general cognitive performance, which accounted for the greatest amount of variance. The BACS thus permits an assessment of overall cognitive function as a global score, more than some individual specific cognitive domains. The sub-scores from the French BACS A Version were strongly correlated with the standard battery corresponding sub-scores. We observed significant correlations for all the subtests evaluating: verbal memory (Pearson=0.83; p<0.001; IC [0.69; 0.91]), working memory (Pearson=0.67; p<0.001; IC[0.43; 0.80]), verbal fluency (semantic: Pearson=0.64; p<0.001; IC[0.40; 0.80]), alphabetical (Pearson=0.87; p<0.001;IC[0.77; 0.93]), attention and speed of information processing (Pearson=0.69; p<0.001; IC[0.47; 0.83]), executive function (Pearson=0.64; p<0.001; IC[0.39; 0.80]). We almost found a significant correlation for motor speed (Pearson=-0. 32; p=0.06; IC [-0.59; -0.014]).\nThe French adaptation of the BACS scale is easier to use in schizophrenic patients with French as mother tongue, with a completion rate equal to 1, and also with less than 35min to complete and check. We obtained significant correlations for all domains except motor speed, which is almost significant. The BACS is as sensitive to cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia as a standard battery of tests that required over 2h to complete. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the BACS, the global score of which may be the most powerful indicator of functional outcome, can also be a good neuropsychological instrument for assessing global cognition in patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[On the work of Austrian authorised experts on procedures in custodial and visiting rights--a survey of current practice from the parents and children view].", "Abstract": "Children who are involved in their parents' contentious separations, and about whom custody or visiting rights have become a matter of legal dispute, often demonstrate changes in behaviour, sometimes to the extent that these changes develop into noticeable psychological problems. Where custody and visiting rights are in dispute the expert child psychological/psychiatric evaluator appraises the family and recognises the suffering of the children involved, but is unable to intervene to treat the child for they have only been authorised to provide an appraisal. The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which an expert's evaluation provides the opportunity to intervene with the child's parents, and to what extent it offers a greater insight and understanding of the child's behaviour. The study also aims to record the children's own attitude to the expert evaluation.\nWith the support of each Austrian district court, 1200 parents involved in custodial proceedings were contacted by post. Likewise, 27 children aged between 6 and 14 years old who were referred to a forensic psychology outpatient's clinic as a result of their parent's highly contentious separations, were recruited as test persons. Parents as well as children were asked to complete an especially designed questionnaire in order to assess the work of the expert evaluator; this took place before the study began and was conducted by an expert who didn;t work at the forensic outpatient clinic of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry.\nOverall, the parents displayed a high level of dissatisfaction with the expert evaluation procedure. More than a third of those questioned highlighted the lack of information about the psychological and educational contents of the appraisal, and about the way the child is treated in terms of the provisions for custody and visiting rights. A key point of criticism turned out to be the brevity of the discussion with the expert evaluator, whilst the opportunity to hold a sympathetic and understanding discussion with the expert evaluator was commonly regarded as desirable. The children evaluate the appraisal experience and the evaluator more positively, but they believe themselves to be responsible for the outcome of the court decision and feel insecure about the statements they make regarding their father and mother.\nIn order to provide greater relief for the affected children, and because of the demonstrable and overwhelming parental dissatisfaction with the evaluation process, a modification of the current form of evaluation to create a solution-oriented process approach should be considered in Austria. The feasibility of this proposal, and its adherence to methodological-theoretical and normative framework conditions, should be discussed amongst expert evaluators. This requires relevant legal input to ensure that a modified form of the expert evaluator's work is implemented in a manner which is legally compliant."}, {"Title": "[Mental health care in Austria: history--developments--perspectives].", "Abstract": "The reform of psychiatric services in Austria started during the second half of the seventies of the 20th century. During the early phase the reform focussed on dehospitalization and principles of community psychiatry. About 60% of psychiatric hospital beds were closed and the size of psychiatric hospitals was reduced. One of the psychiatric hospitals was closed and psychiatric departments were opened as part of district general hospitals. During this time the number of psychiatric hospital admissions increased markedly and a large proportion of mentally ill are treated as inpatients in non-psychiatric wards. Only about a fifth of self-employed psychiatrists working in their own office have a contract with health insurances. In Austria, the number of psychotherapists is much higher than the number of psychiatrist. A variety of different types of community services provide social and vocational rehabilitation, focussing on consultation, housing, daily structure and employment. Psychiatric services are nowadays fragmented into a number of sub-disciplines such as psychosomatics or child and adolescent psychiatry. This fragmentation and the missing coordination of psychiatric services hamper the enhancements of psychiatric care. This complicates the development of integrated services, i.e. the structured and planned cooperation of the different types of services. Since there are no binding rules for the organisation and planning in entire Austria, financing and organisation of services is fragmented. For establishing an integrated health care, coordination and cooperation between providers, sponsors of health care as well as policy makers are essential."}, {"Title": "Depression during pregnancy in a tertiary care center of eastern Nepal.", "Abstract": "This is a cross sectional study, conducted in 45 pregnant women coming for antenatal check ups in the eastern regional hospitals in Nepal.

Patients and their spouses fulfilling inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after taking informed consent. A diagnosis of Opioid Dependence Syndrome (ODS) was made based on ICD-10 criteria and the assessment of severity of ODS was determined by Addiction Severity Index (Hindi version). Subsequently the family burden, perceived by spouses was assessed using Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS). Most of the subjects were from urban or semi-urban areas, mostly from around the service facility. The maximum number of subjects was of age group 31-40 years with majority of having below high school level education. Both subjective and objective family burden was perceived as \"severe\" by subjects' spouses. The relationship between spouses' perceived burden and socio-demographic variables including duration of substance abuse were not correlated. Hence it was found that opioid dependent subjects cause considerable amount of distress to their care providers."}, {"Title": "The real-life practice of acute inpatient mental health nurses: an analysis of 'eight interrelated bundles of activity'.", "Abstract": "This study focuses on nursing in an inpatient mental health setting. Its analytic structure follows from a previous review of nursing studies by Allen, which did not include studies of mental health nursing. Allen's review concluded that the nurses' role could be understood as that of healthcare intermediary and that nurses' work could be analysed as eight interrelated bundles of activity. These bundles include such matters as managing the work of others. This study aims to assess the fit of this model to mental health nursing and to add to the body of work concerning the social organisation of nursing. The research materials discussed are derived from an ethnography of a psychiatric unit. The analytic framework employed leads us to conclude that the work of mental health nurses can be understood, too, as that of the healthcare intermediary. However, one bundle is found to fit less well and this is attributed to the fragile uncertainty of knowledge in psychiatry. The use of an additional bundle to describe in-context nursing interventions is suggested. It is argued that getting to grips with the reflexive relationship between individual patient care and the social organisation in which this is practised is essential for any practice development efforts."}, {"Title": "Quality of life of male outpatients with personality disorders or psychotic disorders: a comparison.", "Abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) has become increasingly important as an outcome measure in community-based psychiatry. QoL refers to an individual's sense of well-being and satisfaction with his current life conditions. It is measured both through objective social indicators and life domain-specific subjective indicators. People with a personality disorder (PD) or a major mental disorder (MMD) tend to show poor social adjustment, but their relative subjective QoL is not known.\nTo compare the QoL of male outpatients in treatment for PD or MMD overall and by means of specific social and subjective indicators.\nA sample of 135 men under treatment for PD in Dutch forensic outpatient facilities were compared with 79 men with MMD using the extended Dutch version of the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (LQoLP).\nAlmost all of the objective indicators of QoL were significantly poorer among men with MMD than those with PD, but the groups did not differ on domain-specific subjective ratings of QoL. Indeed, global subjective QoL was lower in the PD than in the MMD patient group. PD outpatients seemed to have a more complex concept of QoL than the MMD outpatients for whom almost half of the variance in subjective QoL rating was related to their everyday activities and their objective sense of safety.\nFurther study of QoL among PD patients would be warranted to test the extent to which subjective dissatisfaction is intrinsic to PD and to explore the possibility of improving it with targeted treatments."}, {"Title": "The impact of the CONSORT statement on reporting of randomized clinical trials in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "To determine whether the CONSORT recommendations influenced the quality of reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of psychiatry, we evaluated the quality of clinical trial reports before and after the introduction of CONSORT statement.

The higher frequency of depression as the onset mood episode and the higher number of manic episodes in the group with PD may have important treatment implications and should be further investigated."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatry: a review of features and clinical realities.", "Abstract": "This article focuses on the first generation of pharmacogenetic tests that are potentially useful in psychiatry. All pharmacogenetic tests currently on the market, or soon to be marketed in psychiatry, for which some information has been published in peer-reviewed journal articles (or abstracts), were selected. Five pharmacogenetic tests are reviewed in detail: the Roche AmpliChip CYP450 Test, the Luminex Tag-It Mutation Detection Kit, the LGC clozapine response test, the PGxPredict: Clozapine test, and the Genomas PhyzioType system. After reviewing these tests, three practical aspects of implementing pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatric clinical practice are briefly reviewed: (1) the evaluation of these tests in clinical practice, (2) cost-effectiveness, and (3) regulatory oversight. Finally, the future of these and other pharmacogenetic tests in psychiatry is discussed."}, {"Title": "Exploring gender issues in the development from conduct disorder in adolescence to criminal behaviour in adulthood.", "Abstract": "Using results from a large Norwegian follow-up study of former adolescent psychiatric in-patients we have traced the progression from mental disorders requiring hospitalisation in adolescence to registered criminal behaviour in adulthood, particularly highlighting gender differences. A nationwide representative sample of 1095 adolescent psychiatric inpatients (46% females) was followed up 15-33 years after admission to the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Oslo, Norway. In adolescence 45% fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for a disruptive behaviour disorder. At follow-up, 63% of the males and 39% of the females had a criminal record. Among females, psychoactive substance use disorder in adolescence seemed to be a sine qua non for later registered criminality, with intravenous drug use a potent risk factor for life-course-persistent criminality. The same strong association between drug use and criminality was not found in males. Factor analysis demonstrated that while the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder criteria structure was similar across genders, the prevalence of the various forms of expression was different in males and females. The differences between individuals with violent and non-violent crimes were more substantial in males than in females. There were marked gender differences in the criminal profiles observed, with the females' criminal career developing in a less serious manner than in males: females had later criminal debut, a lower number of acts on record, less diverse criminal behaviour, and an escalation in the severity of offences over time was less frequently encountered. However, secular trend analyses indicated that gender differences had diminished over the last several decades, with females \"catching up\" with their male counterparts. Overall, the results demonstrated important qualitative and quantitative gender differences in the criminal behaviour of former adolescent psychiatric in-patients. The results may be of use in prevention."}, {"Title": "HPA axis hyperactivity and cardiovascular mortality in mood disorder inpatients.", "Abstract": "Depression is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiac death. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is frequent in major depression and hypercortisolemia may be a mediating factor in these relationships. The aim of this study was to assess HPA axis function measured with the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in relation to CVD and CHD mortality in a cohort of 382 inpatients with mood disorder admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000. Death certificates ascertained that 75 patients had died of cardiovascular disease and 30 patients of CHD during the mean follow-up of 18 years. DST non-suppression and higher baseline serum cortisol predicted CVD death. In male inpatients with mood disorder, the DST non-suppressor status was significantly associated with CVD death but not with CHD death. In depressed female inpatients the DST non-suppression was not associated with cardiovascular mortality. Baseline serum cortisol and post-dexamethasone serum cortisol levels at 4:00 p.m. showed a trend to be higher in female CVD/CHD victims. Effect of aging on HPA axis functioning was shown in male CHD deaths. HPA axis dysregulation may be a mediating factor between depression and increased risk of cardiovascular death in male mood disorder inpatients indicating that HPA-axis hyperactivity is a long term risk factor for cardiovascular mortality."}, {"Title": "Syphilis, psychiatry and offending behaviour: clinical cases from nineteenth-century Ireland.", "Abstract": "Syphilis presented substantial challenges to nineteenth-century medical and psychiatric services.\nTo illustrate the clinical course and diagnostic challenges associated with neurosyphilis in nineteenth-century Ireland.\nThis paper uses original archival material from the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum, Dublin to present clinical cases and inform a discussion of related issues.\nMr A, a 34-year-old banker convicted of \"felonious entry\", demonstrated many psychiatric and neurological features of neurosyphilis (\"general paralysis of the insane\"); he soon became \"feeble\", \"paralytic\" and \"demented\", and died within 2 years.

Of 1685 neurology admissions, 106 (6%) were referred to liaison psychiatry for assessment. 91 referrals (86%) met criteria for a psychiatric disorder according to DSM-IV, the commonest being major depression (24%) and somatoform disorder (23%). Patients with multiple sclerosis or epilepsy comprised nearly half of all referrals (48 cases; 45%). Approximately 20% of M.S. in-patients (21 cases) were referred for psychiatric assessment, with the corresponding figure in epilepsy being 25% (18 cases). Although only 106 (6%) neurology in-patients were referred to liaison psychiatry, psychiatric diagnoses were documented in 327 (20%) discharge forms, presumably reflecting previous diagnosis. The above findings indicate that psychiatric illness is common among neurology inpatients screened by liaison psychiatry yet referral rates are relatively low in terms of the overall number of neurology in-patients. Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 86% of referrals indicating high concordance between neurologists and liaison psychiatry regarding the presence of a psychiatric disorder."}, {"Title": "Individualized preventive psychiatry: syndrome and vulnerability diagnostics.", "Abstract": "The development of prevention and treatment strategies of psychiatric disorders will depend on a more profound knowledge of the complex relationships between gene-environment interactions, particularly the interplay of vulnerability and resilience factors within a person's biography.

New directions for a future multiaxial system including biological, psychological, social, life span, gender and cultural factors based on the DSM-V- and ICD-11-research agenda are going to be outlined. Psychiatry without psychopathology is impossible. However, in the future, psychopathology will be closer linked to the biological and psychological nature of the disease process and more function-based.

This approach is based on scientific evidence from neurophysiology and cognitive psychology regarding the organisation of the human brain in functionally discernible, not necessarily temporally or spatially stable subunits, which are interconnected in complex, often multilayered networks of neuronal circuits. Such a definition would reconcile modern network theories of brain function with localizationist models. Module-based diagnosis and therapy of mental disorders will be the goal of a modular psychiatry, which has the advantage that it is founded in neuroscientific evidence and does not rely on arbitrary definitions of mental disorders based mainly on clinical empiricism."}, {"Title": "Comparisons between psychotropic drugs: must the risk of side effects dictate our practices?", "Abstract": "Recently, SOHO and CATIE's studies in the field of schizophrenic disorders asserted that molecules apparently showing the most side-effects are not only the most effective but also lead to the least changes in treatments. Can we generalise this assertion to other domains of pharmacological treatments, such as in mood and anxiety disorders? And, more generally, do we possess information about comparison between different types of molecules in these different fields.\nReview of the literature (medline-psycinfo-psycarticles) addressing these three psychiatric disorders, and comparing efficacy of treatments, or cost-effectiveness studies.\nAlthough there is a plethora of publications about the efficacy of given molecules vs. placebo, studies comparing molecules are scarce, and studies on cost-effectiveness in natural environments are even more scarce. Independently of the type of disorders under study, the last few years' efforts to completely limit side effects seem to have resulted in a loss of efficacy. Moreover, the previously held hypothesis suggesting that the fewer the side effects, the lesser the need to change treatment has not been confirmed. The duration of a treatment is more dependent upon its efficacy than on other variables.\nClinicians cannot determine the absence of noxiousness of a molecule as their primary criterion of choice. In contrast, they should carefully balance side effects and efficacy. In Psychiatry, there is a lack of studies about cost-effectiveness in natural environments."}, {"Title": "Cultural analysis as a perspective for gender-informed alcohol treatment research in a Swedish context.", "Abstract": "An exploratory study to investigate the role of culture in women's drinking at a clinic for women with alcohol problems in a Swedish treatment context.\nA content analysis of the case journal material of 20 consecutive female patients at the EWA clinic (Early treatment of Women with Alcohol addiction) in Stockholm, Sweden, was conducted using an original instrument informed by the field of cultural psychiatry and emerging from recurrent themes in the case journals.\nThe patients perceived themselves as having a sub-group status. A trajectory of ritualized actions around drinking, especially private drinking rituals, was identified. Existential components of patients' struggles with addiction in a highly secularized cultural context were identified. Multiple, contradictory explanatory frameworks for understanding drinking problems were creating cognitive dissonance.\nUsing cultural analysis as a perspective for gaining gendered information may allow for identifying new patterns within specific cultural and subgroup contexts.

He credited Despine and Janet for their contributions to dynamic psychiatry and documented Janet's intellectual debt to Despine's successful magnetic treatment of 11-year-old Estelle's hysteria (dissociative disorder). No scholarship, however, has identified Janet's unique addition to Despine's 1838/1839 monograph--written decades before Janet's birth. Supplementing Despine's account of Estelle's minor fall that precipitated her paralysis, Janet reported that Estelle disobeyed her mother by quarreling with a friend, soiled her frock, experienced fright and shame, and sought to conceal everything from her mother. The author argues (a) that Despine knew yet wisely excluded Janet's data lest Estelle's family prevent his publishing the case; (b) that Janet's published data about the youngster's fall reached him through a professional network; and (c) that Janet's plausible addition comports well with his theoretical psychology of action--used in this article to explain the fine-grained parsing of Estelle's inner processes during the milliseconds of her fall: her vehement affect substituted for adaptive behavior. This article deepens the understanding of the Despin-Janet connection; maintains that Janet's addition deserves a place in the tradition of the medical case report; encourages trauma specialists to become familiar with their pioneers; and highlights the clinical continuity from Janet's affirmation of Despine's pioneering treatment strategies with the chronically traumatized to contemporary treatment for the same population, conceptualized along Janetian lines."}, {"Title": "Use of an audience response system in an evidence-based mini-curriculum.", "Abstract": "Since 2002, library faculty at the Indiana University School of Medicine have taught third-year medical students how to retrieve the best evidence from MEDLINE to address their clinical questions.

The session was team-taught by two faculty members, one from the Internal Medicine department and the other from the Library. The librarian reviewed important MEDLINE principles for constructing a good subject search and applying appropriate evidence-based filters. During the clerkships, students were asked to generate clinical questions arising from their patient encounters, searched MEDLINE for the best evidence, critiqued the results, and then applied them back to their patients' care. Library faculty provided individualized feedback on the student searches. A follow-up session two months later reinforced MEDLINE principles, used student searches as examples, and extended the discussion to other evidence-based, point-of-care resources. To add to the interactivity of the follow-up sessions, librarians used an audience response system to measure students' understanding of literature retrieval techniques and to gauge student preferences for information seeking on clinical topics.

The two disorders most commonly associated with offending behaviour, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and psychopathy, are also less prevalent in female samples. However, developments in forensic psychiatry have often ignored gender, and the utility of constructs such as psychopathy and their assessment instruments in female samples remains unclear. This article presents a review of studies looking at rates of ASPD and psychopathy and on the reliability and validity of assessment instruments of these disorders in women. Gender differences in symptom patterns will be considered. The literature seems to suggest that DSM-IV criteria for ASPD may lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of the disorder in women due to the requirement of childhood conduct disorder symptoms. The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) is a valid and reliable instrument to identify psychopathy in women but there are gender differences in the factor structure and item loadings on this measure. Research to date seems to suggest a three-factor model may be most strongly supported in females. Preliminary evidence suggests the PCL-R may have some value in predicting future offending while the PCL:SV may be useful in predicting institutional violence.

Anthropology has taught us to pay attention to the transactions between local-level actors and those operating at the global level in the construction of this new world of medicine. This article examines the role played by the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee of Mental Health in the reform of the French mental health system during the 1950s. Rooted in the experience of practitioners and administrators participating in the process of reforming local psychiatric systems, the recommendations of the WHO Expert Committee developed a new vision of regulating psychiatry, based on professionalism and an idea of a normativity of the doctor-patient relation. This article shows how, by mobilizing the WHO reports' recommendations, French administrators and doctors succeeded in creating a typically French object: \"the psychiatric sector\", founded on elaborating a new mandate for the psychiatric profession. The article thus questions the deinstitutionalization model as an explanation of transformations of the structure of the French psychiatry system in the post-war period."}, {"Title": "A review of the natural course of bipolar disorders (manic-depressive psychosis) in the pre-drug era: review of studies prior to 1950.", "Abstract": "A review of the most important original studies describing the natural course of bipolar disorder (manic-depressive psychosis) published in the pre-drug era - before 1950 - is conducted.

Using three narratives of soldiers assessed at the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) during a period of marked conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the author portrays ethical dilemmas generated during assessments for fitness to go to combat. When the focus of the assessment is the soldier's refusal to serve in the army, particularly during periods of increased conflict, the psychiatrist faces a dilemma because of double loyalties, to the army of which he is a part, and to the soldier and his right to live. Based on previous literature and experience, some cases of refusal to serve may be understood going beyond the boundaries imposed by the medical model. The author discusses these issues in the context of Israeli society. In Israel, conscription is universal, and the army is not professional. However, given the lack of social legitimacy in Israel for refusal to serve in the IDF due to conscientious objection, soldiers who are otherwise aware of the ethical dilemmas imposed upon them by the harsh Israeli reality are left with no option other than to get exempted from military duties on psychiatric grounds.

Adrian Upton in 1985 proposed deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for the treatment of seizures and psychosis [Cooper I.S., Upton A.R.: Biol Psychiatry 1985;20:811-813]. Francisco Velasco, in 1987, introduced DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus, proposing its employment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and for multifocal epilepsy. Other proposed targets are the subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, Forel fields and mammillothalamic tract. We employed DBS for stimulating 2 'unconventional targets', the posterior hypothalamus (pHyp) and caudal zona incerta (CZi), for the treatment of 2 patients with multifocal epilepsy and behavioural comorbidity, and 2 patients with sensorimotor focal seizures, respectively. Such patients did not meet criteria for resective surgery.\nIn our institution, between January 2003 and May 2004, we started DBS in 2 epileptic patients The former patient was affected by multifocal epilepsy, and the second one by refractory partial motor and secondary generalized seizures. The chosen targets were the pHyp in the former case and the CZi in the latter. The encouraging results obtained led us to replicate such a favourable experience in 2 more patients, 1 with focal motor epilepsy once again (resulting in status epilepticus) and the other with behavioural comorbidity and multifocal epilepsy.\nA significant reduction in seizure frequency was observed, and the 2 patients with behavioural comorbidity also showed a dramatic improvement in their disruptive behaviour. The patient with motor focal seizures showed a 70% reduction in seizure frequency, and in the last patient remission from status epilepticus was obtained.\nOur data confirm DBSof deep brain structures modulates the functional activity of the cerebral cortex as suggested by Adrian Upton in 1985. In the reported series, deep-brain stimulation of 2 unconventional targets belonging to the reticulo-cortical system (the brainstem-diencephalon functional system including structures that act as remote controls in modulating cortical excitability) was found to be effective in controlling otherwise refractory multifocal (pHyp) and focal sensorimotor (CZi) epilepsy when resective surgery was not feasible."}, {"Title": "Effects of training on suicide risk assessment.", "Abstract": "This study evaluated the impact of structured training in evidence-based risk assessment for suicide.\nForty-five psychiatry and psychology trainees participated in a workshop on evidence-based risk assessment.

It is no wonder that the greatest expectations for progress in the treatment of mental conditions are focused on new drugs or molecules that share interesting properties of pharmacological mechanisms of action. However, nowadays the development of non-pharmacological options, including transcranial magnetic stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation, indicates the need for more efficacious and better tolerated treatment modalities. Before the age of modern psychopharmacology, which began in the 1950s, treatment of mental disorders was rather limited to only a few methods that had proved to be of some efficacy. In the absence of other, more efficacious treatment methods, these therapies-such as insulin coma or atropine coma-brought at least some relief to those who suffered from serious mental disorders. Obviously, at present we are aware that these therapies should be considered far less efficient than modern psychotropic drugs; however, at the time when these methods were used, no other efficient treatment methods were available."}, {"Title": "Deep brain stimulation in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a reversible surgical procedure that involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes into the targeted brain regions, with a subcutaneously placed pulse generator powering the electrodes via one or two leads. The mechanism of action can be explained by the stimulation-induced modulation of impaired network activity. So far, the main use of DBS has been for neurological conditions, such as essential tremor, motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, dystonia, epilepsy, and chronic pain. In psychiatry, case series and open studies indicate treatment efficacy of DBS in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, and refractory major depression. Neuroimaging studies have confirmed the effects of DBS on the brain regions implicated in specific neuropsychiatric disorders. It is a well-tolerated method with relatively few serious side effects. Additional well-designed and appropriately powered controlled clinical trials are needed to conclusively establish the efficacy and safety of DBS and to identify the patient population(s) who may benefit most. Ongoing research with stimulation techniques may also significantly contribute to our understanding of major neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Electroconvulsive therapy in psychiatric practice: a selective review of the evidence.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is largely historical but is still in use.

Although known for decades, in the last few years vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has become increasingly popular as a novel method of treatment of pharmacoresistant depression. In spite of an emerging body of literature concerning the effectiveness and potential mechanisms of action of VNS, some crucial questions regarding those issues remain to be answered. We review the pre-clinical and clinical literature relating to VNS, with the impact of studies of efficacy and safety in treatment of pharmacoresistant depression and also in other clinical applications in the field of psychiatric disorders. We conclude that in light of emerging reports, VNS warrants more controlled studies for the treatment of other forms of depression, including depression in a younger population, and also of other psychiatric disorders. Because of its safety, VNS could potentially become a treatment of choice in fields in which treatment procedures traditionally require the least aggressive methods."}, {"Title": "[Diagnostic and stating problems in delirium tremens cases].", "Abstract": "To get to know the kinds and prevelence of diagnostic problems related to delirium tremens cases as well as their stating ramifications related to correctness of medical treatment.\nTwelve forensic psychiatric opinions of delirium tremens cases made in Adult Psychiatry Department of Medical University in Lodz in years 2002-2007 were assessed as far as correctness of medical treatment is concerned.\nIn analyzed material of 12 delirium tremens patients no mistreatment cases were found.

The Project was conducted in 19 Italian mental health services (MHS), with the aims of: (a) evaluating the appropriateness of the NICE Guidelines for Schizophrenia in the Italian context, (b) developing and testing a set of 103 indicators that operationalised preferred clinical practice requirements according to the NICE Guidelines, and (c) evaluating their actual application in Italian MHSs.\nThe indicators investigated five different areas: common elements in all phases of schizophrenia; first episode treatment; crisis treatment; promoting recovery; the aggressive behaviour management.\nThe NICE recommendations examined were judged in most instances to be appropriate to the Italian MHS context, and the indicators fairly easy to use. The more severe and frequently encountered evidence-practice discrepancies were: lack of written material, guidelines, and information to be systematically provided to users; lack of intervention monitoring and evaluation; difficulty in implementing specific and structured forms of intervention; difficulty in considering patients' family members as figures requiring targeted support themselves and who should also be regularly involved in the patient care process.\nThe key actions to be undertaken to favour implementation of evidence-based routine practices are: focussing on mental illness onset and family support/involvement in care; planning training activities aimed at achieving specific treatment goals; encouraging MHS participation in evaluation activities; identifying thresholds for guideline application and promoting specific guideline implementation actions; and activating decision making and resource allocation processes that rely more strictly on evidence and epidemiological assessment. These considerations are of value for rethinking the model of community psychiatry in Italy as well as in other countries."}, {"Title": "Guidelines for treating mental illness: love them, hate them.

The SIEP-DIRECT'S ((DIscrepancy between Routine practice and Evidence in psychiatric Community Treatments on Schizophrenia) Project's potential role in fostering this advancement is discussed in detail. This Project developed a set of 103 indicators that operationalised the NICE clinical guidelines for schizophrenia recommendations and tested them in 19 MHS in Italy. A multi-step design was used to assess recommendation and indicator acceptability in the Italian context; provide an assessment of any current discrepancies between routine practice and guideline recommendations in the treatment of schizophrenia; and understand the reasons for any discrepancies that might emerge. This process, moreover, was instrumental in keeping the debate arising during conduction of this Project far from the excesses of hostility - and excesses of \"bright-eyed enthusiasm\" - that frequently influence discussion on topic.

After implantation, the activity of the electrodes can be adjusted. The field of psychiatry shows great interest in deep brain stimulation because there is little risk of complications and because it is reversible and postoperatively adjustable to optimalize the treatment. Deep brain stimulation is being investigated as a potential treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and major depressive disorder. Deep brain stimulation for psychiatric conditions is still strictly experimental. It is expected that deep brain stimulation will be the treatment of choice for chronic therapy-refractory psychiatric disorders.

Some consequences on the way indicators are used are discussed.\nThe importance of the question of access to care in psychiatry is known since the epidemiologic catchment area research. Although inequalities of access to psychiatric care are an important research field, few studies are related to them in France. They should be studied in France all the more since public psychiatry is sectorised since 1960 in order to provide continuity of care. Models can be used to that end, most notably the two books about the pathway to care by Golberg and Huxley, as well as the mental health matrix by Thornicroft and Tansella. The internal dynamics of populations in psychiatric care are closely related to the preceding questions; several examples of possible researches are given. However, since populations in care are constructed, their construction process must be analysed, lest comparisons between populations be biased. Three factors help describe this process: the relations with neighbouring populations, the propensity to enter the population in care and the perimeter of the population in care. Consequences on the use of indicators are discussed in relation to three examples: prevalence, length of care and rehospitalisation rates.\nIt is important to organize a consistent information system about psychiatric care, based upon a thorough problem analysis.

Mental health professionals, laymen and patients have great interest in spirituality and religious activities but still it is one of the most neglected fields of life. Spirituality and religion often are used interchangeably and it has also been described as an individual search for meaning. In psychiatry, religion and spirituality play a vital role in an individual's personal and social life. They are part of a very powerful medium to help in the healing process. Spiritual people know the meaning and goal of their life, have strong belief and firm faith in God or themselves, they can easily cope with stress and have the ability to adjust in every situation. They have satisfaction and contentment. They are less anxious and depressed and if they feel so, they try to overcome it through religious activities or rituals. Patients who depend heavily on their religious faith are significantly less depressed than those who don't. Spiritual practices foster an awareness that serves to identify and promote values such as creativity, patience, perseverance, honesty, kindness, compassion, wisdom, equanimity, hope and joy, all of which support good healthcare practice.

The wills covered by this study were mostly made by male, 65 years old or older testators, with primary education, who executed a holograph will and survived it for less than a year.\nTestamentary incapacity for medical reasons was established in 47% of the testators, while a strong, statistically significant relationship between a diagnostic category and testamentary incapacity was established among the testators suffering from an organic mental disorder (Chi-square=133.256, p=0.000) or a substance induced mental disorder (Chi-square=6.971, p=0.008).\nTestamentary capacity is a specific focus of medical assessment given that the evidence for overturning a will is generally dependent upon medical assessment. In that respect, much litigation and expenses could be avoided if medical experts were given a chance to correctly assess the testamentary capacity of a person at the time of making a will. The fact remains that our findings may not be a representative cross-section of the general population, and this important issue certainly deserves to be addressed by future research based on a larger sample."}, {"Title": "Mental health care of psychotraumatized persons in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina--experiences from Tuzla Canton.", "Abstract": "Majority of Bosnia-Herzegovina (BH) residents were exposed to cumulative traumatic events during and after the (1992-1995) war, which demanded emergency organizing of psychosocial support as well as psychiatric-psychological treatment of psychotraumatized individuals.\nTo describe organizing of psychosocial help during and after the BH war, institutional treatment of psychotraumatized in the frame of mental health service reform program with an overview on the model of psychosocial support and psychiatry-psychological treatment of psychotraumatized persons of Tuzla Canton region.\nThe retrospective analysis of functioning in the Department for traumatic stress disorders on the Psychiatry Clinic in Tuzla for the 1999-2003 period has been described in regard of number, gender, age and trauma related mental disorders of referred patients.\nIn the observed period, 8.329 of patients in the outpatient care program were included, 617 of inpatients were treated in the Clinic, while 301 of patients in the Partial hospitalization program were included.

These interviewing techniques are housed within a conceptual framework, the Choice Triad, designed for the sensitive exploration of the thought processes and emotional responses patients experience when using medications.\nThe model holds the promise of providing 1. interviewing techniques and strategies for immediate application by case managers for improving medication adherence; 2. a practical conceptual umbrella for the integration of well-established collaborative interviewing principles, such as the principles of motivational interviewing, with new interviewing techniques created by case managers in the field; and 3. a platform for the development of research studies and training protocols consistent with evidenced-based educational innovations in teaching clinical interviewing skills such as microtraining, macrotraining, and the use of competency testing."}, {"Title": "[The establishment of SUMC (Severance Union Medical College) Psychiatry Department and the formation of humanistic tradition].", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine which deals with the problem of mental health. Although psychiatric concept and treatment is not absent in traditional medicine in Korea, it was not regarded as an independent discipline of medicine. Modern psychiatry was introduced into Korea as modern Western medicine w as introduced in 19th century. The American medical missionary Dr. Allen and Dr. Heron gave the first classification of mental diseases of Korean patients in their first year report of Jejoongwon hospital. The statistics are characterized by relatively high rate of hysteria patients among the patients with mental disorders. It was Dr. Mclaren who took the charge of the Psychiatric Department of Severance hospital, the successor of Jejoongwon hospital. As a psychiatrist, Dr. Mclaren had a deep interest in human nature and mind. His thinking on the subjects was based on his Christian faith and philosophy. He claimed that Christian faith plays an important role in curing mental diseases. And several medical students decided to become a psychiatrist under his influence. Among them is Dr. Lee Chung Chul who took the charge of the Department of Psychiatry after Mclaren. After graduation in 1927, Dr. Lee studied in Peking Union Medical College, Australia, and Japan. His main research interests were focused on the biological aspects of mental disorders, and he published several important papers on the subject. But his unexpected early resignation and subsequent expulsion of Dr. Mclaren from Korea by Japanese colonial government hindered further development of psychiatry in Severance Union Medical College until the Liberation from Japanese occupation in 1945. But some of their students specialized in psychiatry during the hard period of early 1940s and they played an important role in the development of modem psychiatry in Korea after the Liberation."}, {"Title": "Experience-dependent epigenetic modifications in the central nervous system.", "Abstract": "This mini-review describes recent discoveries demonstrating that experience can drive the production of epigenetic marks in the adult nervous system and that the experience-dependent regulation of epigenetic molecular mechanisms in the mature central nervous system participates in the control of gene transcription underlying the formation of long-term memories. In the mammalian experimental systems investigated thus far, epigenetic mechanisms have been linked to associative fear conditioning, extinction of learned fear, and hippocampus-dependent spatial memory formation. Intriguingly, in one experimental system epigenetic marks at the level of chromatin structure (histone acetylation) have been linked to the recovery of memories that had seemed to be \"lost\" (i.e., not available for recollection). Environmental enrichment has long been known to have positive effects on memory capacity, and recent studies have suggested that these effects are at least partly due to the recruitment of epigenetic mechanisms by environmental enrichment. Finally, an uncoupling of signal transduction pathways from the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms in the nucleus has been implicated in the closure of developmental critical periods. Taken together, these eclectic findings suggest a new perspective on experience-dependent dynamic regulation of epigenetic mechanisms in the adult nervous system and their relevance to biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Emergency psychiatric services for individuals with intellectual disabilities: perspectives of hospital staff.", "Abstract": "Strains on the mainstream mental health system can result in inaccessible services that force individuals with intellectual disabilities into the emergency room (ER) when in psychiatric crisis. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and systemic issues surrounding emergency psychiatry services for people with intellectual disabilities, from the perspective of hospital staff. Focus groups were conducted with emergency psychiatry staff from 6 hospitals in Toronto, Canada. Hospital staff reported a lack of knowledge regarding intellectual disabilities and a shortage of available community resources. Hospital staff argued that caregivers need more community and respite support to feel better equipped to deal with the crisis before it escalates to the ER and that hospital staff feel ill prepared to provide the necessary care when the ER is the last resort. Input from hospital staff pointed to deficiencies in the system that lead caregivers to use the ER when other options have been exhausted. Both staff and caregivers need support and access to appropriate services if the system is to become more effective at serving the psychiatric needs of this complex population."}, {"Title": "Setting a public health research agenda for Down syndrome: summary of a meeting sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Down Syndrome Society.", "Abstract": "On November 8-9, 2007, a meeting entitled \"Setting a Public Health Research Agenda for Down Syndrome\" was held to review current knowledge, identify gaps, and develop priorities for future public health research related to Down syndrome.

Various medical journals have editorialized on this drug protocol, the death penalty in general and the role that physicians play. Many physicians, and societies of physicians, express the opinion that it is unethical for doctors to participate in executions. This Target Article explores the harm that occurs to murder victims' relatives when an execution is delayed or indefinitely postponed. By using established principles in psychiatry and the science of the brain, it is shown that victims' relatives can suffer brain damage when justice is not done. Conversely, adequate justice can reverse some of those changes in the brain. Thus, physician opposition to capital punishment may be contributing to significant harm. In this context, the ethics of physician involvement in lethal injection is complex."}, {"Title": "A framework for interpreting genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded a plethora of new findings in the past 3 years.

Without a track record of published research and lacking internationally recognized clinicians, it failed to impress the British Medical Research Council. To challenge leading U.S. and German departments of neuropsychiatry, Edward Mapother, the medical superintendent, looked overseas for investment in an \"institute of psychiatry.\" Intense lobbying and a modified strategy for research and training designed to meet the Rockefeller Foundation's prioritization of psychiatry and medical specialization ultimately led to a significant endowment. Alan Gregg and Daniel O'Brien at the Foundation played a pivotal role in re-defining the Maudsley's programs of research and teaching. Pressure on Mapother to attract funding was matched by that on administrators required to show that their philanthropy had yielded tangible gains in public health. While wealthy charities, like the Rockefeller, often had a vision of the direction that they wished to pull medical science, and they provided much needed income, the impact of their policy agenda was not without drawbacks. Institutions unwilling to embrace a charity's philosophy were unlikely to secure grants, while those that did might find themselves drawn into less optimal areas."}, {"Title": "The future (or lack of future) of personalized prescription in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Rapid technological advances in genetics have created conceptual chaos regarding the genetics of drug response. Terms for differing concepts are used interchangeably: pharmacogenetics with pharmacogenomics, personalized medicine with personalized prescription. Biomarker has many definitions. The author prefers the concept of personalized prescription and uses it with implications beyond pharmacogenetics by considering all scientific information valid for prescribing medication. Genetics may not be crucial for all drugs. In this comprehensive view, clinicians must consider genetic, environmental and personal variables when prescribing medication and incorporate some basic pharmacological principles: (1) safety and efficacy, (2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, (3) therapeutic window and prescriber's role, and (4) idiosyncratic and dose-related adverse drug reactions. Personalized prescription in the clinical environment can be expressed in two main ways: as personalized selection of the drug and as personalized dosing. The future, or lack of future, of personalized drug selection and of personalized dosing in psychiatry is reviewed. Currently, the author thinks that, in psychiatry, pharmacogenetic tests have some potential in two areas: (1) excluding some drugs for some unusual patients (HLA-B*1502 genotyping in Asians for carbamazepine), and (2) using pharmacokinetic genes for personalizing dosing in narrow therapeutic window drugs. In the short term, there is dubious potential for other pharmacogenetic tests and no potential for pharmacogenetic testing to ascertain the best drug for each patient. Personalized dosing has immediate application if one understands it as the use of our current scientific knowledge of genetic, environmental and personal variables to determine dosing; its sole requirement is well-trained psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Targeting the NMDA receptor for fear-related disorders.", "Abstract": "The gap between basic neuroscience and clinical psychiatry in the treatment of anxiety disorders has been steadily diminishing over recent years.

Animal studies have identified N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as crucial in fear memory acquisition and consolidation, as well as in its extinction and reconsolidation. Based on this, the NMDA receptor partial agonist D-cycloserine, which facilitates fear extinction in rodents, has been shown to increase the effect of exposure therapy in psychiatric patients for conditions such as phobias, social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In this article, we review current strategies for targeting the NMDA receptor in the treatment of fear-related disorders, analyzing experimental results, clinical data, and recent patents in the field, while also addressing potential new approaches to explore this field of drug discovery."}, {"Title": "[Quality of life measurement in child-psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) has become an important outcome measure in health care, including in child psychiatry.\nTo formulate assessment criteria with regard to instruments that are designed to measure QoL in children.\nLiterature search, using five key electronic databases. results When selecting an instrument, one has to consider the following aspects: its validity and reliability, the relative dimensions of QoL, its suitability for use with both the child and its parents and its cross-cultural applicability.

Particularly, illness-related issues were explored from the perspective of developmental psychology.\nCoping with typical developmental tasks of early adulthood (e. g. autonomy; intimate relationships; vocational training) is impeded. At the same time, young patients wish as much normality as possible in their daily life, e. g. social contacts with not-affected peers. In many cases, young adults affected try to maintain a cautious distance to psychiatric facilities as well as to other patients.\nYoung people suffering from mental illness are in a complicated process of identity formation, as they have to integrate the illness into their self-concept and their daily life (illness-identity work). Hence, their assistance needs are different from those of older patients. It is a challenge for community based psychiatry to provide help offers which meet the specific requirements of young mentally ill people."}, {"Title": "Using longitudinal data from a clinical trial in depression to assess the reliability of its outcome scales.", "Abstract": "Longitudinal studies are permeating clinical trials in psychiatry. Additionally, in the same field, rating scales are frequently used to evaluate the status of the patients and the efficacy of new therapeutic procedures. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study the psychometric properties of these instruments within a longitudinal framework. In the area of depression, the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) is regularly used for antidepressant treatment evaluation. However, the use of HAMD has not been exempted from criticism what has lead to the development of new scales that are expected to be more sensitive for change, such as the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). In general, the reliability of these scales has been extensively studied by using classical methods for reliability estimation, developed for specifically designed reliability studies. Unfortunately, the settings customarily considered in these reliability studies are usually far from the practical conditions in which these scales are applied in clinical trials and practice. In the present paper, we assess the reliability of these instruments in a more realistic scenario thereby using longitudinal data coming from clinical studies. Nowadays, newly developed methodology based on an extended concept of reliability, allows us to use longitudinal data for reliability estimation. This new approach not only enables to avoid bias by offering a better control of disturbing factors but it also produces more precise estimates by taking advantage of the large sample taking sizes available in clinical trials. Further, it offers practical guidelines for an optimal use of a rating scale in order to achieve a particular level of reliability. The merits of this new approach are illustrated by applying it on two clinical trials in depression to assess the reliability of the three outcome scales, HAMD, MADRS, and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA)."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with alopecia areata in a child and adolescent psychiatry clinical sample.", "Abstract": "This study reports the comorbidity of lifetime psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with alopecia areata (AA) in a child and adolescent psychiatry clinical sample.\nFourteen patients with AA were interviewed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria and the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime-Farsi Version (KSADS-PL-Farsi Version).\nThe rate of at least one psychiatric disorder was 78%.

For persons who continued to take lithium, the rate of dementia decreased to the same level as the rate for the general population. The rate of dementia decreased early after the consumption of lithium tablets corresponding to 1 prescription (typically 100 tablets) and stayed at a low level, although with a slight increase according to the number of subsequent prescriptions. The association between the number of prescriptions for lithium and dementia was unique and different from the association between the number of prescriptions for anticonvulsants and dementia.

Interrater reliability indices were obtained for 30 randomly selected interviews. Associations between OPTION scores and some clinical and socio-demographic variables were tested using t-test, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation coefficient where appropriate. The distribution of scores for each psychiatrist was assessed by intracluster correlation coefficients.\nInterrater reliability and internal consistency of the OPTION scale in the psychiatric setting were satisfactory. The total score and the ratings for the single OPTION items showed a skewed distribution, with a prevalence of scores in the low range of abilities, corresponding to minimal attempts to involve patients or a minimal skill level.\nThe OPTION scale proves to be a reliable instrument to assess patient involvement in a psychiatric setting. Psychiatrists showed poor patient involvement abilities parallel to previous findings in psychiatry and primary care. They need to be encouraged to share treatment decisions with their patients and to apply patient involvement skills.

Mood disorders were also associated with a lower odds of isolation, while a history of a personality disorder and a personal biography of institutionalization were both clearly associated with an increased odds for isolation. Although significant bivariate predictors in the multivariate model, both schizophrenic and organic diagnoses failed to reach statistical significance. In addition, patients hospitalized at an earlier age and/or predicted to have a longer stay on the current admission were much less likely to have contact with informal supports. Of the study variables indexing functional status, only activities of daily living (ADLs) remained a significant predictor for isolation in the final multivariate model.\nThe analyses demonstrate the detrimental effects of an earlier life experience with mental illness. Having an earlier age of illness onset may lead to a potentially greater impairment in establishing and maintaining informal social ties throughout the life course into older age.

Since the publication of the first version of this guideline, a substantial number of new randomized controlled studies of anxiolytics have been published. In particular, more relapse prevention studies are now available that show sustained efficacy of anxiolytic drugs. The recommendations, developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders, a consensus panel of 30 international experts, are now based on 510 published randomized, placebo- or comparator-controlled clinical studies (RCTs) and 130 open studies and case reports. First-line treatments for these disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and the calcium channel modulator pregabalin. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are equally effective for some disorders, but many are less well tolerated than the SSRIs/SNRIs. In treatment-resistant cases, benzodiazepines may be used when the patient does not have a history of substance abuse disorders. Potential treatment options for patients unresponsive to standard treatments are described in this overview. Although these guidelines focus on medications, non-pharmacological were also considered.

The 4-day programs were part of larger travel awards, and included daily small group meetings consisting of a mode of two mentors and six participants. The authors created a survey with 40 quantitative questions designed to measure the change in participants' perceptions related to the conference and mentoring program, and provided additional fields for narrative comments.\nMean participant ratings were positive for all questions on the survey. Changes in connectedness were rated higher than those in knowledge. The highest mean ratings were related to feeling more connected to the host organization, to CAP, and to other program participants. Outcomes were similar between the two conferences, except for knowledge gained on research, which was higher among participants in the international meeting. Outcomes were similar across demographic variables, except for internationally trained participants rating higher on research knowledge, connectedness, and overall knowledge. Over 75% of participants felt they made a connection with their mentor, bonded as a group, and learned new things about CAP and the host organization. A qualitative review of comments revealed several themes, including heightened importance of networking, increased awareness of the field, improved connectedness, a desire for trainee-focused events, and mixed feelings about how much structure to provide within the mentorship experience.\nA brief group-style mentoring program is logistically feasible within large conferences, and can result in broad positive impact for trainees.

It discusses the historical background of family therapy training, a scientific foundation for what residents should be taught, and an integrative clinical model for how it could be taught.\nThe article is the synthesis of the perspectives and experience of a child and adolescent psychiatrist educator who began his career at the end of the systemic era in psychiatry and continues it through the developments of the neurobiologic era. It draws on selected literature from the fields of family therapy, child and adolescent psychiatry, developmental psychopathology, and general psychiatry.\nThis article submits that the term \"family therapy\" should be replaced by the term \"family intervention\"; the evidence base indicates that family interventions are effective; family risk and protective factors influence the onset and course of disorders; families help shape and maintain cognitive schema; intervention must start with thorough case formulation; and family interventions should be coordinated with other interventions, include parent management training, and build on family strengths.\nFamily intervention is an important clinical process in child and adolescent psychiatry, and contemporary education must address the multiple ways clinicians can assist families. Future models will be successful to the degree they build on the past contributions of systems thinking and include the perspectives of developmental psychopathology.

However, exposure to inpatient CAP correlated with increased interest in the field and in its influence on pursuing a CAP career. Interest in CAP positively correlated with agreement that the CAP clinical experience influenced their career decision. The influence of the CAP clinical experience on career decision was associated with interest in both psychiatry and CAP, as well as with change in CAP interest after the clerkship.\nThese preliminary results suggest that the CAPE-Q may be useful for assessing students' clerkship experiences and the impact of these experiences on their decision to pursue a career in child psychiatry.

The age at the first onset on symptoms, possible changes in diagnoses, early signs noted prior to or upon admission to child and adolescent psychiatric care and possible differences between patients with early- and later-onset disorder were of particular interest.\nThe study population consisted of patients (285 in- and 1115 outpatients) born between 1957 and 1976 and admitted to and treated by child and adolescent psychiatric care units in J\u00e4mtland County, Sweden, between 1975 and 1990. The status of their mental health was monitored until 2003 using official registries and hospital records. Diagnoses based on the ICD-8 and -9 systems, which were used in Sweden from 1968-1997, converted to diagnoses according to ICD-10, which has been in use since 1997. The Comprehensive Assessment of at Risk Mental States was employed to assess the information concerning psychopathology provided by the hospital records.\nBy the end of the follow-up period 62 former child and adolescent psychiatric patients (36 females and 26 males), 4.4% of the entire study group, had received an ICD-10 diagnosis of \"F20-29: Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders\" (48) and/or \"F30-39: Psychotic mood disorders\" (14). One-third (21) of these individuals were given their initial diagnosis of psychosis in connection with child and adolescent psychiatric care. Two of these 21 were not treated later for this disorder in general (adult) psychiatric care whereas the remaining 19 individuals were diagnosed for the same type of disorder as adults. The other 41 patients were diagnosed as psychotic only in connection with general (adult) psychiatric care. The mean age at the time of first onset of symptoms was 21.4 years (SD 6.4) and corresponding median age was 18. Behavioural changes and positive symptoms were the most frequent signs associated with a diagnosis of \"F20-F29: Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders\" made during child and adolescent psychiatric care. In cases where a specific psychopathology developed later on the initial admission to child and adolescent psychiatry involved unspecified psychopathology.\nIn summary, it appears that psychotic disorders are relatively uncommon among patients admitted to child and adolescent psychiatric care in Sweden. However, individuals experiencing early onset of disorders categorized as \"F20-29: Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders\" may already exhibit typical symptoms upon admission to child and adolescent psychiatric care of the age of 13-17; whereas late-onset disorders it appear not be associated with any obvious signs or symptoms years before the disorder has developed fully.

In addition the control group consisted of 50 children and adolescents with psychiatrically normal parents. We assume that children with a depressive parent need more and longer treatment and the diagnosis will differ from the control group. Furthermore we assume that children of the investigation group are environed more by psychosocial strains. In fact the results proof that children with a depressive parent need significant longer outpatient treatment and a significant increased number of inpatient treatment, appearing syndromes are not specific though. All in all the children of the investigation group are exposed more by psychosocial strains. Further results show, that this children consult more mental institutions and attending therapists commend more often an aftertreatment.

The treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms is essential and although, to date, no therapeutic solution is satisfactory, it is necessary to look for an alternative to the neuroleptics usually employed, which raise real problems of tolerance in this geriatric population.\nFor several years, anticonvulsants, among which some have shown mood stabilizing activity, have been the object of research in this indication. The purpose of this review of the literature is to assess the interest and the limits of anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, valproic acid, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine) in the treatment of the so-called \"noncognitive\" symptoms of dementia. Their mechanism of action in mood disorders is not well known, but it would appear to be via the modulation of glutamate-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission that anticonvulsants might reduce behavioral symptoms in demented patients.\nThe method employed in this work was a systematic bibliographic review, in which only the double-blind placebo-controlled studies or the clinically detailed enough open-labelled studies using validated scales were retained.\nAmong these medications, only carbamazepine demonstrated its efficacy in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in controlled studies, notably that of Tariot et al. [J Am Geriatr Soc 42 (1994) 1160-1166 and Am J Psychiatry 155 (1998) 54-61] and Olin et al. [Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 9 (2001) 400-405], but with significant adverse events (sedation, hyponatremia, cardiac toxicity), particularly in the elderly and, being a strong enzymatic inducer, with a high likelihood of drug-drug interactions. Valproic acid showed some interesting results in BPSD within a large number of open studies and case reports. However, among the five controlled studies that have been published [Curr Ther Res 62 (2001) 51-67; Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 9 (2001) 58-66; Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 17 (2002) 579-585; Curr Alzheimer Res 2 (2005) 553-558 and Am J Geraitr Psychiatry 13 (2005) 942-945], none confirmed its efficacy on these symptoms. Regarding its tolerability in the geriatric population, no notable major side effect was reported (haematologic and hepatic effects are not more frequent than in the general population), except possible excessive sedation. Moreover, it appears that valproic acid could have neuroprotective effects, even if the contrary has been observed in a recent study. More studies need to be (and are being) conducted, notably on the interest of valproic acid in prophylaxis of BPSD. Gabapentin seems to be worthwhile and well tolerated in this indication, but no controlled study has been conducted to prove its efficacy, even if a quite important number of case reports and open studies have shown encouraging results. Concerning lamotrigine, which may potentially induce severe cutaneous side effects when administered with valproic acid, this drug has shown its efficacy in bipolar disorders and two recent case reports seem to indicate some interest in BPSD. Furthermore, lamotrigine appears to have neuroprotective effects. Although topiramate has shown interesting results in one open study in BPSD, its use in demented patients cannot be recommended because of its deleterious effect on cognitive functions. Oxcarbazepine, theoretically, could be an alternative to carbamazepine, which is, as aforesaid, the only anticonvulsant that proved its interest in BPSD. However, no clinical study has yet been published to support this hypothesis. This drug is better tolerated than carbamazepine, but induces severe and more frequent hyponatremia.\nFinally, although we all know that antipsychotics should no longer be prescribed in the elderly, the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia remains a difficult problem, considering the lack of a real alternative to these medications. Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are an interesting solution but none of them, other than carbamazepine, which did, but which is not better tolerated than the usual drugs in this population - was able to prove its efficacy in this indication. Among these medications, valproic acid, gabapentin and lamotrigine should be studied further, and the neuroprotective effect of some of them is an interesting route for research."}, {"Title": "[Predictors of prophylactic response to lithium].", "Abstract": "Since their first utilization in psychiatry as mood stabilizers in the 1940s, lithium salts have been widely studied in the medical literature. The considerable amount of data available to date, supports the use of lithium salts as first-line mood stabilizing agents, with acute antimanic and antidepressant properties and proven efficacy in the long term prevention of manic and depressive relapses.\nSeveral predictors were reported by different authors in early articles and were confirmed later on by the medical literature. All the psychopathological, environmental, biological, neurophysiologic and genetic predictors known to date are reviewed here. PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS: Psychopathological predictors of a good response to lithium prophylaxis include: the initial good response to lithium during the first 6-12 months of treatment, considered to date to be the most reliable predictor of a favourable response to lithium; the classical pattern of elated manic episodes; a positive familial history of bipolar disorders, especially those known to be responsive to lithium; the absence of comorbid personality disorders; bipolar type I disorders; melancholic features during depressive episodes; MDI pattern in the illness course and early onset of lithium treatment. In contrast, the following have been confirmed as psychopathological predictors of poor prophylactic lithium response: mixed episodes, considered to be one of the most reliable predictors of poor response to lithium since Kraeplin's description; rapid cycling bipolar disorders; comorbid alcohol and/or drug abuse; mood disorders with incongruent psychotic features; early onset bipolar disorder before the age of 18; discontinuation of lithium treatment; high number of previous affective episodes in the illness course before lithium initiation and DMI pattern. ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTORS: Among environmental factors, being single was found to be the only predictor of a poor response to lithium treatment in prophylaxis. BIOLOGICAL PREDICTORS: Biological predictors of a good prophylactic response to lithium include a high RBC/plasma-lithium ratio, one of the most controversial predictors of a favourable response to lithium in the literature, a higher platelet serotonin-induced calcium mobilization, and a high rate of red blood cell membrane phospholipids, especially of phosphatidylcholine, and a phospholipid implicated in lithium intracellular transport. Among neurophysiologic predictors of a favourable response to lithium, the following have been reported: brain lithium concentrations above 0.2 mEq/L when measured by 7Li-MRS; decreased cerebral intracellular pH and white matter hyper intensity at (31)P-MRS and a high intensity of loudness dependence auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), the latter being one of the best indicators of human cerebral serotoninergic functioning. In contrast, the following have been reported as neurophysiological predictors of a poor lithium response in prophylaxis: epileptiform anomalies with diffuse theta waves on electroencephalography, a predictor of poor response to lithium known since the descriptions of Dalen in 1965 and decreased cerebral phosphocreatine levels at (31)P-MRS, the latter being an indicator of cerebral mitochondrial dysfunction. GENETIC PREDICTORS: Genetic predictors of good response to lithium in prophylaxis include a lower-inositol-monophosphatase (IMPase-2) mRNA expression, IMPase-2 being a key enzyme of the calcium-intracellular-signalling pathway and IMPase-2 gene being studied recently as a candidate gene in bipolar disorder. A higher frequency of phospholipase C isoenzyme gamma1 (PLCG1)-5 repeat allele genes has also been associated with a good response to lithium, PLCG1 being a major enzyme of the phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. Genetic predictors of negative prophylactic lithium response include the homozygotic forms of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), the presence of the A/A subtype of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene and a high frequency of human leukocyte antigens type A3 (HLA-A3), this genotype being associated with cellular membrane anomalies implicated in alteration of lithium intracellular transport.\nThe search for new predictors of lithium prophylactic response is currently facing several methodological problems: lack of representativity of the samples of bipolar patients enrolled in research studies, poor reliability of retrospective reconstructions of the course of the bipolar disorder before initiation of lithium treatment, absence of consensus on tools used to assess response to lithium prophylaxis in study designs, difficult access and high costs of most of the laboratory and neuroimaging techniques used in recent studies such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and LDAEP measures, and problematic evaluation of the impact of treatment on a disorder whose natural intrinsic course is often irregular."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric autopsy: its uses and limits in France].", "Abstract": "Within the framework of an evaluation program for the prevention of suicide in Brittany conducted by the academic department of psychiatry (University of Rennes, Brittany, France), we have addressed the issue of the potential usefulness of psychological autopsy as a tool for the better comprehension of suicide risk factors.\nWe reviewed the appropriate literature in 30 articles found amongst those obtained from the \"Medline\" database. These articles were selected according to the quality of their methodology. For the Medline data retrieval search, the following keywords were used: \"psychological autopsy\", \"psychiatric autopsy\", \"psychological autopsy and methodology\", \"psychiatric autopsy and methodology\". This review's objective was to determine, firstly the nature and the content of psychological autopsies, secondly to evaluate their use as a methodological tool to assist the comprehension and prevention of suicide. Finally, it was also to assess its feasibility for use in France.\nThe majority of the published studies using psychological autopsy for the evaluation of suicide expertise came from Scandinavian or Anglo-Saxon countries. Schneidman [Schneidman ES. The psychological autopsy. Suicide Life Threat Behav 1981;11:325-40], whose aim was to clarify the causes of sudden death related to psychological circumstances, focused on suicidal intentions and the symptoms exhibited. He coined the term: \"psychological autopsy\". Gradually, the definition of psychological autopsy has evolved and is now being used for the evaluation of death by suicide with a single goal in mind: to retrospectively identify any suicidal predictive and risk factors available at the time of the event. At present, no unequivocal definition of \"psychological autopsy\" has been put forth. However, this formerly only descriptive procedure is now becoming more analytical in nature (comparison of psychiatric profiles between pre- and postmortem assessments, research on precipitating factors, comorbidity studies...). Presently, it corresponds to a methodological tool to be used essentially for case reports that vary a great deal and do not permit cross-comparisons with other case-studies. For the past fifteen years, case-control studies in this field have become more frequent with various choices of control groups: healthy subjects with no psychiatric history, as well as attempted suicides, with or without a psychiatric history. Partial standardization of autopsy procedures is now possible with some data extracted from police inquiries, medical charts, or data gathered following interviews with the deceased patient's relatives.\nIn the aggregate, the literature review showed that the aims of psychological autopsy include understanding and prevention of suicide in a population-based sample. It seems difficult to generalize with results from other population references. In France, the use of psychological autopsy as a standardized tool for the assessment of suicidal behaviors would be difficult, due to the complexity of the procedures involved: data coming from external sources, such as medical sources, is nearly impossible to obtain. Practitioners would be required to overcome administrative rules and regulations, plus incurring the high costs of such procedures. They must also take into account ethical considerations that make such interviews with the deceased patient's relatives difficult to obtain. Be this as it may, the French Ministry of Health is presently attempting to find a solution in order to alleviate the all too frequent problem of suicide in the population at large and to promote suicide prevention in France."}, {"Title": "[Clinical particularism of bipolar disorder: unipolar mania. About a patient's study in Tunesia].", "Abstract": "Although present classifications (CIM, DSM) have not included the notion of a unipolar disorder to characterise the recurrence of the same type of episode, this concept conserves its pertinence for many people. Unipolar mania, in particular, is a clinical reality in our daily practice, and a predominant form of bipolarity expression. These assertions have led us to question this notion and its nosographical place: is it a subtype, distinguished by certain characteristics, or a particular category in the bipolar disorder?\nWe conducted a retrospective, descriptive and comparative study on medical briefs of patients with type I bipolar disorder (DSM-IV criteria), who were interned for the first time between 1997 and 2001 in the Psychiatry \"E\" service of the Razi hospital of Tunis, and were followed up for at least five years. Two groups were identified: Group 1 or \"unipolar mania\": patients who presented at least two manic episodes without depression, and Group 2: the rest of the sample; and then were compared based on their sociodemographical profile, familial psychiatric antecedents, premorbid temperament, comorbidity and clinical and progressive characteristics.\nSeventy-two patients were included. The average age was 36. The sex ratio was three men to two women. The first episode was a manic episode in 56.9% of the cases. The average duration of illness progression was 11.6 years. Unipolar mania represented 65.3% of the sample. Between 1997 and 2001, 92% of bipolar patients interned were hospitalised for mania. Concerning recurrences, we observed nine times as many cases of manic episodes as depression. Depressive episodes of light to medium intensity had probably not been well assessed due to the families' tolerance. The high rates of both manic episodes and unipolar mania observed in this study were also found by other authors, showing the differences of bipolarity expression between the West and the other parts of the world, and in particular Africa. There was no significant difference concerning the sociodemographical features. We noticed similar results in the literature. The two groups were comparable in familial psychiatric past history and premorbid temperament. Substance abuse or dependence was observed in 5.6% of the patients. This rate was less than others found in the literature, due to the fact that it is considered as an offence in our country. We found twice as many cases of toxic consumption in bipolar as in unipolar manic patients. A recent Tunisian study has shown the absence of substance abuse in unipolar manic patients. This is probably because of the fact that substance abuse is more related to depressive manifestations. The sample starting age was 24.6 years and was significantly more precocious in the unipolar manic group (27.6 years versus 23 years, p=0.001). A significant difference in both groups was found concerning the first episode season: two extremities were observed: \"summer-autumn\" in Group 1 (63.6% G1 versus 29.4% G2) and \"winter-spring\" in Group 2 (73.6% G2 versus 36.4% G1), p=0.03. The seasonal influence on mood disorders is dealt with by other authors. Unipolar manic patients presented less affective recurrences than the rest of the group (0.37 versus 0.49 on average per year), p=0.056.\nUnipolar mania is still considered as a clinical variety of bipolar disorder, which is distinguished by certain features. It is a debated notion because it is based on retrospective studies that may be insufficient, although it appears as a clinical evidence and a predominant progressive variety of bipolar disorder in Tunisia."}, {"Title": "Computational models of neuronal biophysics and the characterization of potential neuropharmacological targets.", "Abstract": "The identification and characterization of potential pharmacological targets in neurology and psychiatry is a fundamental problem at the intersection between medicinal chemistry and the neurosciences. Exciting new techniques in proteomics and genomics have fostered rapid progress, opening numerous questions as to the functional consequences of ligand binding at the systems level. Psycho- and neuro-active drugs typically work in nerve cells by affecting one or more aspects of electrophysiological activity. Thus, an integrated understanding of neuropharmacological agents requires bridging the gap between their molecular mechanisms and the biophysical determinants of neuronal function. Computational neuroscience and bioinformatics can play a major role in this functional connection. Robust quantitative models exist describing all major active membrane properties under endogenous and exogenous chemical control. These include voltage-dependent ionic channels (sodium, potassium, calcium, etc.), synaptic receptor channels (e.g. glutamatergic, GABAergic, cholinergic), and G protein coupled signaling pathways (protein kinases, phosphatases, and other enzymatic cascades). This brief review of neuromolecular medicine from the computational perspective provides compelling examples of how simulations can elucidate, explain, and predict the effect of chemical agonists, antagonists, and modulators in the nervous system."}, {"Title": "Should or should not forensic psychiatrists think about free will?", "Abstract": "The forensic psychiatrist's task is often considered to be tightly connected to the concept of free will. Yet, there is also a lack of clarity about the role of the concept of free will in forensic psychiatry. Recently, Morse has argued that forensic psychiatrists should not mention free will in their reports or testimonies, and, moreover, that they should not even think about free will. Starting from a discussion on Morse's claims, I will develop my own view on how forensic psychiatrists are confronted with the issue of free will and how they should deal with this concept and the confusion surrounding it. I conclude that psychiatrists should at least feel free to think about free will and that the conceptual challenges connected to the issues of free will and accountability could rather encourage than deter forensic psychiatrists to think about them."}, {"Title": "Development and results of the first ABMS subspecialty Certification Examination in Sleep Medicine.", "Abstract": "In November 2007, the first Certification Examination in Sleep Medicine was administered to 1,882 candidates under the cosponsorship of five member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)--the American Board of Internal Medicine, the American Board of Family Medicine, the American Board of Otolaryngology, the American Board of Pediatrics, and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.

Although, currently, the intradisciplinary discussion in neuroscience is mainly focused at the methodological and neurobiological level, psychological and philosophical theories are also needed for the interpretation of results. This raises questions regarding the epistemic priority of neuroimaging data and theories.\nIn the current paper, we present the hypothesis that there is an interdependence of neuroimaging data and theoretical concepts. An approach to 'correlational neuroscience' with an awareness of this issue may help in avoiding misunderstandings and oversimplifications as well as building an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that is able to integrate findings from life sciences, mind sciences and humanities."}, {"Title": "Ethical issues in psychopharmacology of children and adolescents.", "Abstract": "This summary of the literature published over recent years focuses on the ethical aspects of interventions with psychotropic medication in child and adolescent psychiatry. Ethical issues of pharmacotherapy concern aspects of research, safety, indicated use, enhancement, information and evidence-based practice.\nThe literature on pharmacological interventions suggests changes in prescribing patterns for some substance classes owing to regulatory authorities' warnings. For most of the commonly used medications in children and adolescents no sound database about efficacy and safety is available and knowledge about adverse events and long-term safety remains poor. This is due to a general lack of clinical trials in this population. Legislative efforts have tried to improve safety and labelling of medicines for children. Ethical issues of enhancement in minors have been increasingly discussed over recent years.\nThe ethical aspects of psychopharmacotherapy in minors are still rarely discussed in the literature.

The mechanism by which this occurs, or whether these factors are truly causal, is unclear. There is still insufficient evidence that the treatment of vascular risk decreases the subsequent risk of cognitive decline and depression.\nIn view of this mounting evidence and the cardiovascular benefits associated with the treatment of vascular risk factors, there is an argument that older patients presenting with the problems of cognitive decline and depression should have vascular risk assessed and treated."}, {"Title": "Mental health economics, health service provision, and the practice of geriatric psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Economic evaluation is becoming more and more important as a means to assist policy makers in choosing the best intervention or treatment against a pervasive scarcity of resources relative to the demands.

Novel structural and functional neuroimaging techniques that have recently been developed show promise as biomarkers of both late-life depression and specific dementia syndromes. The fields of proteomics and genomics are advancing our ability to identify genes and aberrant proteins that detect preclinical dementia. As depression is often a harbinger of dementia in late life, recent studies are beginning to elucidate the relationship between different types of late-life depression and the subsequent emergence of dementia.\nBiomarker research in late-life mental disorders is progressing at a rapid pace.

This article uses empirical material from acute psychiatry that reveals that it is distrust rather than trust that is prevalent in this field. Our data analyses show how distrust is expressed in the therapeutic environment and in the relationship between nurse and patient. We point out how trust can nonetheless be created in an environment that is characterized by distrust. Both trust and distrust are exposed as ;fragile' phenomena that can easily ;tip over' towards their opposites. Trust is not something that nurses possess or are given; it is rather something that they earn and have to work hard to achieve. Regarding themselves as potential causes of distrust and active wielders of power can contribute to nurses developing a more realistic view of their practice. Assuming a realistic middle-way perspective can help to manoeuvre between the extremities of excellence and resignation, which in turn can lead to processes that create trust between psychotic patients and nurses."}, {"Title": "Partial compliance in schizophrenia and the impact on patient outcomes.", "Abstract": "This review evaluates the impact of partial compliance on treatment outcomes in schizophrenia and discusses strategies that may be implemented to enhance compliance. As such, a search of English language articles evaluating compliance in schizophrenia was performed using Medline and EMBASE, with no time limits. Abstracts and posters presented at key psychiatry congresses were also reviewed. Results demonstrated that partial compliance with antipsychotic medication is a significant barrier to achieving optimal outcomes in schizophrenia. The problem increases with the duration of treatment, and is difficult to monitor. The impact of partial compliance is significant, leading to increases in psychotic symptoms, the risk of relapse and rehospitalization, and even suicide. Compliance is a complex phenomenon, influenced by aspects of the illness itself such as cognitive impairment and patients' health beliefs. The patient's environment and therapeutic alliance also influence medication compliance. Behavioural and pharmacological measures should be used together to improve compliance. While atypical antipsychotics have demonstrated improvements in psychotic symptoms, insight and cognition, these may not be enough to ensure compliance with oral daily medication. Long-acting risperidone may therefore bring together the benefits of the atypical antipsychotics with the long-acting injection delivery system required to build a platform for improved outcomes."}, {"Title": "The role of psychopharmacology in the medical abuses of the Third Reich: from euthanasia programmes to human experimentation.", "Abstract": "German psychiatry and pharmacology both enjoyed an extraordinary international reputation prior to the promulgation of the Third Reich. However, with the triumph of eugenic ideas and the imposition of a \"racial hygiene\" policy by the Nazi regime, various organs of the German health system saw themselves involved in a perverse system of social control, in which the illicit use of psychopharmacological tools became customary. In the present work, we review, from the historical perspective, the factors that helped to bring about this situation and we analyze the abuses (known and documented) committed through the specific use of psychotropic drugs during the Nazi period. Among such abuses we can identify the following illegitimate activities: the use of psychoactive drugs, mainly sedatives from the barbiturates family, in the different euthanasia programmes implemented by the Nazi authorities, in police activity and various types of repression, and for purely criminal and extermination purposes within the so-called \"Final Solution\"; psychopharmacological research on the mentally ill, without the slightest ethical requirements or legal justification; and the use of psychotropic agents in research on healthy subjects, recruited from concentration camps. Finally, we refer to the role of poisonous nerve agents (tabun, sarin and soman) as instruments of chemical warfare and their development by the German authorities. Many of these activities, though possibly only a small portion of the total - given the destruction of a great deal of documentation just before the end of World War II - came to light through the famous Nuremberg Trials, as well as through other trials in which specific persons were brought to justice unilaterally by individual Allied nations or by the authorities of the new German government after the War."}, {"Title": "A model for self-treatment of four sub-types of symptomatic 'depression' using non-prescription agents: neuroticism (anxiety and emotional instability); malaise (fatigue and painful symptoms); demotivation (anhedonia) and seasonal affective disorder 'SAD'.", "Abstract": "This article will present a model for how 'depression' (i.e. depressive symptoms) can be divided into four self-diagnosed sub-types or causes which might then be self-treated using agents available without prescription. (Another, much rarer, cause of depressed symptoms is the classical illness of 'melancholia', which when severe cannot be self-treated and typically requires hospitalization.) A self-management option and alternative is now needed due to the an inappropriate emphasis of modern psychiatry on treatment of imprecise syndromal 'disorders' which may entail treating 'depression' at the cost of making the patient feel and function worse. By contrast, the basic theoretical stance of self-management is that depressed mood should be seen as a result of unpleasant symptoms - and it is the symptoms that require treatment, not the mood itself. Furthermore, drugs (or other interventions) need to be classified in terms of their potential therapeutic effects on these symptoms that may cause depressed mood. The four common causes of depressed mood considered here are the personality trait of Neuroticism; the state of malaise (fatigue, aching etc) which accompanies an illness with an activated immune system; demotivation due to lack of positive emotions (anhedonia); and the syndrome of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Each of the four sub-types is then 'matched' with a first-line non-prescription agent. The 'stabilizing' agents such as St John's Wort and the antihistamines chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine are used for treatment of Neuroticism; analgesics/pain killers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol/acetaminophen and the opiates are used to treat malaise; energizing agents such as caffeine and nicotine are used for the treatment of demotivation; and bright light used in the early morning to treat SAD. Self-treatments are intended to be used after research and experimentally, on a trial-and-error basis; with self-monitoring of beneficial and harmful effects, and a willingness to stop and switch treatments. The model of S-DTM (self-diagnosis, self-treatment and self-monitoring) is suggested as potentially applicable more widely within psychiatry and medicine."}, {"Title": "[Follow-up of the metabolic syndrome induced by atypical antipsychotics: recommendations and pharmacogenetics perspectives].", "Abstract": "Despite a better overall tolerance as compared to classical antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics are not devoid of side-effects, notably metabolic factors (weight gain, alteration of lipid and glucose profile). These side-effects are very troubling concerning long term morbidity and mortality and may also influence compliance towards drugs. The department of psychiatry of the Hospital University Centre has established a guideline on the clinical monitoring of patients receiving atypical antipsychotics, based on recently published consensus, which will be presented here. In addition, recent studies show that weight gain and metabolic alterations induced by this type of medication may be influenced by the genetic background of the patients.

At military call-up in 1999, the boys filled in the Young Adult Self-Report (YASR) and Antonovsky's Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC-13), which measure SOC. In univariate analysis, low parental education level, death and serious illness of parent, parental divorce and high symptom level in all YASR scales were associated with poor SOC. In multivariate analysis, most YASR syndrome scales and father's education level were independently associated with SOC.

To help make sense of these claims, the interventionist model (IM) of causality has several attractive features. First, it connects causation with the practical interests of psychiatry, defining causation in terms of 'what would happen under interventions', a question of key interest to those of us whose interest is ultimately in intervening to prevent and treat illness. Second, it distinguishes between predictive-correlative and true causal relationships, an essential issue cutting across many areas in psychiatric research. Third, the IM is non-reductive and agnostic to issues of mind-body problem. Fourth, the IM model cleanly separates issues of causation from questions about the underlying mechanism. Clarifying causal influences can usefully structure the search for underlying mechanisms. Fifth, it provides a sorely needed conceptual rigor to multi-level modeling, thereby avoiding a return to uncritical holistic approaches that 'everything is relevant' to psychiatric illness. Sixth, the IM provides a clear way to judge both the generality and depth of explanations. In conclusion, the IM can provide a single, clear empirical framework for the evaluation of all causal claims of relevance to psychiatry and presents psychiatry with a method of avoiding the sterile metaphysical arguments about mind and brain which have preoccupied our field but yielded little of practical benefit."}, {"Title": "Do nurses working in adult psychiatry take into consideration the support network of families affected by parental mental disorder?", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to gain information about registered and practical mental health nurses' activities concerning support network of families affected by parental mental illness. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire distributed to all 608 practical and registered mental health nurses working in adult psychiatric units in five Finnish university hospitals. A total of 311 nurses returned completed questionnaires (response rate 51%). Sixty per cent (n = 222) of registered nurses and 36% (n = 88) of practical mental health nurses responded. Information about family relationships and socio-economic situation was gathered regularly by all nurses. The nurses' individual characteristics, such as being a parent, further family education and use of family-centred care, were significantly related to their activeness in discussing the family's support network with the parents. Discussing family relationships and families support networks forms part of patient care in adult psychiatric nursing with families with dependent children (under 18 years of age).

Some subjects were followed for up to 20 years. Among those, cases with epilepsy were first selected for study; within that group, cases with DRE were identified and studied. The association between clinical severity of their epilepsy and quantitative or qualitative scores of EEG severity was tested using rank coefficients (Spearman's rho values). The relationship between DRE and RTT genotype category (i.e. gene deletion, gene duplication, early truncating mutation, late truncating mutation, and missense mutation) or a specific MECP2 genotype was tested using the chi-square test. A p-value <0.05 (two sided) was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nPrevalence of DRE was 16% (i.e. 16 DRE out of 100 MECP2-mutated RTT epileptic patients). No significant relationship was found between clinical severity of DRE and quantitative (p=0.9190) or qualitative EEG scores (p=0.1511).

He observes how to transfer experiences taken from the \"epileptologic\" practice into the psychiatric care of bipolar patients. He shortly demonstrates the relevant information on the mechanisms of action, controversies and possible clinical effects influenced by the seizure inhibiting effect of the concerning molecules. By the opinion of the author the clinical importance of pharmacokinetic parameters are underestimated in the psychiatric practice. Therefore--as an original approach in the literature--he summarizes the detailed clinical indications of serum level measurements of antiepileptic drugs applied in psychiatry as mood stabilizers. The therapeutic experiences in epilepsy added a lot of practices for the most effective dosing, building, tapering and exchange of the mood stabilizer antiepileptics. Drug interactions (appear among the psychotropic drugs or with the commonly used medicines). As in any chronic therapies the main condition of patient's compliance is the lacking or very mild presence of the applied therapy. The paper discusses the most frequently occurring and drug-specific side effects in table forms. Using the term of \"relative therapeutic potential\" the need of balance between the efficacy (influenced by the choice and dosing) and the tolerance are pointed.

A cross-sectional survey.", "Abstract": "The number of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders being treated with antipsychotic medication is increasing significantly; however, only a limited evidence-base is available on this topic, especially when children are concerned. This study reports and discusses the use of antipsychotic medication in children and adolescents below 19 years of age in Denmark. A national cross-sectional survey registered the use of antipsychotic drugs on a given date. A questionnaire was sent to all child and adolescent psychiatric departments and all consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry throughout the country. All children and adolescents, aged 0-18 years, registered in treatment with antipsychotic medication, were included. Sixty-seven per cent of clinics and 63% of consultants participated. The total number of subjects registered in examination or treatment in the participating units was 3854. Antipsychotic medication was used in n=244 (6.4%) of these cases. Eighty-eight patients received additional medication, of which 24% received antidepressants, 8% sedative medication and 4% psychostimulants. The age of the patients was 4-18 years, and 63% was male. The most frequent diagnoses for patients in antipsychotic treatment were: schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, autism spectrum disorders and personality disorders. Monotherapy was used in 87% of cases. Sixty-four per cent of patients treated with antipsychotics, received a second-generation antipsychotic as the main treatment. All 244 patients received one or more additional treatment modalities other than medication. Antipsychotic medication has a definite role in the treatment of children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Second-generation antipsychotics used as monotherapy prevail."}, {"Title": "Estimating clinically relevant mental disorders in a rural and an urban setting in postconflict Timor Leste.", "Abstract": "Epidemiologic studies undertaken in postconflict countries have focused primarily on trauma-related disorders. There is a need to include disabling psychotic disorders in order to plan clinical services in these settings.\nTo estimate the prevalence of key clinical disorders in Timor Leste (East Timor), and to assess cultural factors that may influence help-seeking patterns.\nA 2-phase total population survey of 1544 adults in an urban and a rural area of Timor Leste. Phase 1 involved a household informant survey using indigenous terms to detect psychosis and a screen of all adults for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of psychologic distress, including depression and anxiety. In phase 2, clinicians interviewed all those identified by household informants and half of those who screened positive in order to assign DSM-IV diagnoses. Disability, explanatory models, and perceived needs were also assessed.\nPhase 1: Demographic characteristics; trauma events and PTSD (Harvard Trauma Questionnaire); psychologic distress (Kessler-10 scale). Phase 2: Structured Clinical Interview for relevant DSM-IV diagnoses; the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scales; and the modified Short Explanatory Model Interview.\nThe household informant method in phase 1 detected mainly psychotic disorders, and the screen method detected PTSD and depression. Phase 2 yielded a DSM-IV point prevalence estimate of 5.1% (including psychosis, 1.35%; and PTSD, 1.47%). Psychotic disorders were most disabling, primarily attributed to supernatural causes and treated mainly by traditional healers. Those with depression and PTSD experienced substantial disability but had received little treatment. They attributed their mental problems to social and traumatic causes.\nOur 2-phase method proved effective for identifying the range of disorders relevant to planning clinical services in postconflict developing countries.

Our purpose was first to define the role of CL Psychiatry, to review essential steps in the process, and to advise on how to set up services. Second, a 1-year retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients referred. A total of 708 persons were referred for psychiatric consultation, of which 41% (291) were referred because of suicidal behavior. Sixty-six percent were female and there was an over-representation of Indo-Trinidadians (67%). Twenty-six percent of all cases of suicidal behavior were diagnosed with clinical depression, 3% were suffering from a psychotic illness (schizophrenia), and 8% (24/291) were under the influence of alcohol.

Early intervention means better access and systematic early delivery of existing and incremental improvements in knowledge rather than necessarily requiring dramatic and elusive breakthroughs. A clinical staging model has proven useful and may have wider utility in psychiatry. The earliest clinical stages of psychotic disorder are non-specific and multidimensional and overlap phenotypically with the initial stages of other disorders. This implies that treatment should proceed in a stepwise fashion depending upon safety, response and progression. Withholding treatment until severe and less reversible symptomatic and functional impairment have become entrenched represents a failure of care. While early intervention in psychosis has developed strongly in recent years, many countries have made no progress at all, and others have achieved only sparse coverage. The reform process has been substantially evidence-based, arguably more so than other system reforms in mental health. However, while evidence is necessary, it is insufficient. It is also a by-product as well as a catalyst of reform. In early psychosis, we have also seen the evidence-based paradigm misused to frustrate overdue reform. Mental disorders are the chronic diseases of the young, with their onset and maximum impact in late adolescence and early adult life. A broader focus for early intervention would solve many of the second order issues raised by the early psychosis reform process, such as diagnostic uncertainty despite a clear-cut need for care, stigma and engagement, and should be more effective in mobilizing community support.

Yet at the time of its 1956 founding, organized psychoanalytic attitudes toward homosexuality could be reasonably characterized as hostile. First there was a transition from Freud's early views of homosexuality as immature to later neofreudian theories that pathologized same-sex attractions and behavior. Following the 1973 decision of the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the DSM, homosexuality is now more commonly regarded as a normal variant of human sexuality. The history of psychoanalytic attitudes toward homosexuality reinforces the impression that psychoanalytic theories cannot be divorced from the political, cultural, and personal contexts in which they are formulated. This history also shows that analysts can take positions that either facilitate or obstruct tolerance and acceptance."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry in Tibetan Buddhism: madness and its cure seen through the lens of religious and national history.", "Abstract": "Tibetan Buddhism offers the oldest written theory of psychiatry, dating back to the 7th and 8th century C.E.

This article focuses on conceptualization of wisdom in the Bhagavad Gita, arguably the most influential of all ancient Hindu philosophical/religious texts. Our review, using mixed qualitative/quantitative methodology with the help of Textalyser and NVivo software, found the following components to be associated with the concept of wisdom in the Gita: Knowledge of life, Emotional Regulation, Control over Desires, Decisiveness, Love of God, Duty and Work, Self-Contentedness, Compassion/Sacrifice, Insight/Humility, and Yoga (Integration of Personality). A comparison of the conceptualization of wisdom in the Gita with that in modern scientific literature shows several similarities, such as rich knowledge about life, emotional regulation, insight, and a focus on common good (compassion). Apparent differences include an emphasis on control over desires and renunciation of materialistic pleasures. Importantly, the Gita suggests that at least certain components of wisdom can be taught and learned. We believe that the concepts of wisdom in the Gita are relevant to modern psychiatry in helping develop psychotherapeutic interventions that could be more individualistic and more holistic than those commonly practiced today, and they aim at improving personal well-being rather than just psychiatric symptoms."}, {"Title": "Significance in the increase of women psychiatrists in Korea.", "Abstract": "The number of female doctors has increased in Korea; 18.9% (13,083) of the total medical doctors registered (69,097) were women in 2006, compared to 13.6% (2,216) in 1975.

Although the biopsychosocial approach has become the mainstream concept of the present-day psychiatry, it is not fruitful enough because it is excessively broad and provides no real complex field integration and guidance to clinicians and researchers. The postmodern psychiatry alternatives have been appeared as pluralism and integrationism. Holistic and integrative approach in medicine and psychiatry is built on the premise that human beings in health and disease are complex systems of dinamically interacting biological, psychological, social, energetic, informational and spiritual processes. Emerging as a transdisciplinary holistic, complementary and integrative psychiatry implies widely accepted general systems theory on psychopathology, novel integrating interpretative models, new integrative understanding of etiopathogenesis or meanings of symptoms, and novel integrative assessment and treatment approaches addressing those etiopathogenesis and meanings."}, {"Title": "Patterns of psychiatric consultation in an Austrian tertiary care center - results of a systematic analysis of 3,307 referrals over 2 years.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the phenomenology of a newly structured Austrian tertiary - care hospital consultation - liaison (C - L) psychiatry service.\nWe compared two 1 - year surveys over two years of observation (2003 - 2005). Survey A (August 1, 2003, until July 31, 2004) comprised 1474 consecutive new consultations, and the more recent Survey B (August 1, 2004, until July 31, 2005) extended over 1833 consecutive new referrals to our C - L service. Psychiatric referrals were analyzed with regard to consultation rate, demographic characteristics, referring departments, principal reasons for referral, diagnostic characteristics, and intervention patterns.\nThe consultation rate increased by 0.61% from 2.69% in Survey A to 3.30% in Survey B. Internal medicine consistently accounted for almost 31% of all referrals in both surveys. In Survey A, the most common psychiatric diagnoses were adjustment disorders (21.4%), depressive disorders (18.5%), and delirium (18.1%). The most prevalent diagnoses in Survey B were adjustment disorders (24.5%), delirium (18.8%), and depressive disorders (14.3%).

Correlations with other clinician-rated scales of psychopathology and overall functioning showed that the GAF is primarily related to a reduction in functioning due to psychiatric symptoms, while an assessment of functioning beyond psychopathology, considering the effects of the individual's general medical condition as well, was provided by the SOFAS and the GARF, which is of importance for a comprehensive evaluation of the patients' health status. The factor analysis of the Axis V scales revealed a theoretically meaningful, single common factor (variance accounted for by the extracted factor = 76.91%), while observed differences, between the subjects with complete and partial PTSD, in scores on the axis V scales support further use of the axis V scales as useful outcome variables.\nThe issue of a valid and reliable measurement of functional impairment is of paramount importance not only in the domain of clinical psychiatry but in forensic practice as well. In this respect, our findings give strong support to extending the scope of the DSM axis V scales with the two experimental scales which provide both conceptual framework and useful tools for reliable and valid evaluation of adaptatinal functioning in persons suffering from PTSD."}, {"Title": "Suicide risk: where, why and how is it generated?", "Abstract": "In this editorial we will first use the findings of epidemiological research to show that the closer we get to brain dysfunction, the higher is the suicide risk (Where?).

Twenty-three studies involving a total of 1053 patients were included (11 RCTs and 12 observational studies).\nInformation on study characteristics and treatment outcome was extracted by 2 independent raters. Effect sizes were calculated for overall effectiveness, target problems, general psychiatric symptoms, personality functioning, and social functioning. To examine the stability of outcome, effect sizes were calculated separately for end-of-therapy and follow-up assessment.\nAccording to comparative analyses of controlled trials, LTPP showed significantly higher outcomes in overall effectiveness, target problems, and personality functioning than shorter forms of psychotherapy. With regard to overall effectiveness, a between-group effect size of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-3.4) indicated that after treatment with LTPP patients with complex mental disorders on average were better off than 96% of the patients in the comparison groups (P = .002). According to subgroup analyses, LTPP yielded significant, large, and stable within-group effect sizes across various and particularly complex mental disorders (range, 0.78-1.98).\nThere is evidence that LTPP is an effective treatment for complex mental disorders.

The black box of the human mind has become illuminated with the following consequences: (1) diagnosis and monitoring of mental and neurological diseases have improved significantly; and (2) early interpretations of the brain's workings as we can now see it, influence the way we think and feel about ourselves. They form an inevitable part of modern anthropology, particularly in its applied forms, e.g. psychiatry and psychotherapy.

When these are exceeded, they are punished in all social systems. If there is no severe mental disturbance, the responsibility for a crime or for socially damaging or non-conformist behaviour lies with the individual himself. The question, whether a person could have acted differently in a defined situation on the basis of his personality characteristics and his neural constitution, leads to diverse answers. Is anti-social, criminal behaviour a \"disturbance in itself\" or the result of a personality structure which has been defined as an illness or an organic deficit? The widest branches of science are occupied with this topic: psychiatry, psychology and philosophy, neural sciences and sociology, jurisprudence and ethics. The list could be continued. The results of personality research along with findings concerning neural mis-connections and the discourse regarding free will in contrast to deterministic interpretations are undoubtedly of particular relevance. On the basis of research results from the scientific disciplines mentioned above, the author concludes that people with socially damaging or radically \"evil\" behaviour are a very heterogeneous group with strongly varying personality profiles, unfavourable family socialisation conditions and often varied neuro-physiological disturbances, but that responsibility for the crimes they are accused of lies with them as long as their disposition and discretion capacity has not been impaired or removed through serious psychiatric illness.Without classifying them as patients, as our fellow citizens, they deserve our due care and recognition of their human dignity."}, {"Title": "Phobic postural vertigo treated with autogenic training: a case report.", "Abstract": "Patients suffering from dizziness due to vertigo are commonly encountered in the department of otolaryngology. If various clinical examinations do not reveal any objective findings, then the patients are referred to the department of internal medicine or psychiatry. In many cases, the diagnosis is psychological dizziness. Phobic postural vertigo, which was first reported by Brandt T et al in 1994, is supposed to be a type of psychological dizziness. The diagnosis is based on 6 characteristics proposed by Brandt et al. Patients are usually treated with conventional medical therapy, but some cases may be refractory to such a therapy. Psychotherapy is recommended in some cases; however, psychotherapy including autogenic training, which can be used for general relaxation, is not widely accepted. This paper describes the successful administration of autogenic training in a patient suffering from phobic postural vertigo.\nWe present a case of a patient who suffered from phobic postural vertigo. A 37-year-old female complained of dizziness. She had started experiencing dizziness almost 3 years She was intractable to many sort of conventional therapy. In the end, her symptom disappeared after introduction of autogenic training.\nAutogenic training can be a viable and acceptable treatment option for phobic postural vertigo patients who fail to respond to other therapies.

In many countries, there is a shortage of doctors practicing in rural and remote communities. There is evidence that locating undergraduate medical education in rural areas increases the likelihood that graduates will choose to practice in underserved areas. Through its Parallel Rural Community Curriculum (PRCC), Flinders University School of Medicine (FUSM) now enables over 25% of its students to undertake an entire clinical year based in small rural communities supervised principally by rural family physicians. Objective The PRCC was conceived to provide a high quality educational intervention that would result in an increased number of students choosing to practice in rural and remote Australia. It was also designed to test the hypothesis that small rural and remote practices were capable of facilitating a full year of medical training at a standard comparable to that provided at a major tertiary hospital. Intervention Starting with eight students in four towns in 1997, the PRCC now places 30 students across 18 towns in rural Australia. The students simultaneously learn the disciplines of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and family medicine. At the end of the year, all Flinders students, regardless of training location, take the same comprehensive exam. Outcomes PRCC students improved their academic performance in comparison to their tertiary trained peers. This improvement has been consistent over the ten years studied. Seventy percent of the PRCC students have chosen to practice in rural locations, compared to 18 percent of tertiary-trained students. Over twelve years, the program has proved to be sustainable in a private practice environment with a workforce shortage. Conclusions Evaluation of the PRCC indicates that a rural community-based clinical education can provide a high quality academic experience for students as well as a sustainable solution to rural medical workforce maldistribution."}, {"Title": "Contrasting Models of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Reply to.", "Abstract": "We address the four main points in Monroe and Mineka (2008)'s Comment. First, we first show that the DSM PTSD diagnosis includes an etiology and that it is based on a theoretical model with a distinguished history in psychology and psychiatry. Two tenets of this theoretical model are that voluntary (strategic) recollections of the trauma are fragmented and incomplete while involuntary (spontaneous) recollections are vivid and persistent and yield privileged access to traumatic material. Second, we describe differences between our model and other cognitive models of PTSD. We argue that these other models share the same two tenets as the diagnosis and we show that these two tenets are largely unsupported by empirical evidence. Third, we counter arguments about the strength of the evidence favoring the mnemonic model, and fourth, we show that concerns about the causal role of memory in PTSD are based on views of causality that are generally inappropriate for the explanation of PTSD in the social and biological sciences."}, {"Title": "The role of consultation-liaison psychiatry in the general hospital.", "Abstract": "This article reviews some of the recent data concerning Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry in a general hospital.

From 1919 to 1929 he worked at the Institute for Mental illnesses Stenjevec (today the Psychiatric Hospital Vrapce) where in 1921 he became the head physician (orig. primarius) at the age of 37 years only. Between 1929 and 1945, he worked in Sarajevo as a Head of the State Hospital's Neuropsychiatry Department. In 1948 he was appointed the director of the Hospital for Mental Illnesses in Sarajevo. The hospital was in fact a remodelled rope factory with a favourable position near a homestead. He managed this institution until 1956.

Criminals who are considered to have diminished judgment or control may nonetheless be prosecuted and jailed Psychiatric experts may also be asked to predict aggressive behaviour, and to identify determinants of crime. Too often the answers are not fully grounded in science, and this is not made sufficiently clear. There are 26 psychiatric wards in French prisons, which only treat inmates who accept to be treated. When prisoners are prescribed compulsory treatment, they are discharged from prison and transferred to a psychiatric ward. This situation is more and more frequent but is not the most convenient: it delays treatment and does not facilitate long-term therapeutic relationships. Responsibility or pragmatism? About 20% of French prison inmates are psychotic, and these individuals are at risk of repetitive violent behaviour if left untreated. The main question is not one of criminal responsibility, but rather the most effective response to antisocial behaviour: is punishment or medical treatment the most effective way of preventing future crimes and protecting society? Ethical aspects: the situation could be improved by a number of measures.

Most observers agree that the category of hikikomori encompasses a wide range of problems and provocations. The fact that these various dilemmas lead to the shared outcome of shutting oneself away at home is the point of departure here. The article explores the spheres of mental health care, education and family, focusing on the reluctance to highlight underlying psychological dimensions of hikikomori and the desire on the part of schools and families to \"mainstream\" Japanese children, accommodating as many as possible within standardized public education. Hikikomori can perhaps be seen as a manifestation of Japanese democracy, in which the good society is imagined as cohesive, protective and secure, rather than one in which the individual can freely exercise the right to be different. Schools, families and the sphere of mental health care have focused on producing social inclusion but have discouraged citizens from being labeled as \"different\" -- even when such a distinction might help them. The dearth of facilities and discourse for caring for the mentally ill or learning disabled is, in many respects, the darker side of Japan's successes. Those who cannot adjust are cared for through the institutions of families, companies and various other spheres that offer spaces to rest and to temporarily \"drop out\"; however, the expectation is that rest will eventually lead to a re-entry into mainstream society. Often the psychological problem or disability that led to the problem goes unnamed and untreated (hikikomori, psychiatry, special education, youth, family, Japan)."}, {"Title": "\"Enhanced\" interrogation of detainees: do psychologists and psychiatrists participate?", "Abstract": "After revelations of participation by psychiatrists and psychologists in interrogation of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Central Intelligence Agency secret detention centers, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association adopted Position Statements absolutely prohibiting their members from participating in torture under any and all circumstances, and, to a limited degree, forbidding involvement in interrogations.

This paper explains why psychiatrists and psychologists involved in coercive interrogations violate the Geneva Conventions and the laws of the United States.

Cardiac vagal regulation at age 2 was assessed across six challenge tasks, three in which the child and mother worked together and three in which the child worked independently, and was indexed by the magnitude of vagal withdrawal (decrease in respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) to challenge. Results indicated that children displayed greater cardiac vagal regulation and heart rate acceleration during collaborative tasks versus independent tasks. In addition, maternal-child relationship quality predicted the degree of vagal regulation in children at age 5, even after controlling for early and concurrent level of behavior problems as well as 2-year cardiac vagal regulation. Children with poorer quality relationships displayed significantly poorer vagal regulation and lower heart rate acceleration (p < .01).

Early detection of complex patients can further improve the effectiveness of psychiatric consultation. Follow-up contacts and investing in liaison contacts improve adherence to the advice provided."}, {"Title": "[Endophenotypes in psychiatry: an interim evaluation].", "Abstract": "Inheritance plays an undisputedly important role in the development of most psychiatric disorders. However, the genes involved have mostly not yet been identified. In all probability, not a single gene but a large number of genes are involved in each disorder. In psychiatry, a lot is expected from research into the relationship between so-called endophenotypes and genotypes because endophenotypes are more closely related to the genotype and are better defined and quantifiable than the phenotype. Endophenotypes are biological or neuropsychological markers which are (a) associated with the disorder in the population, (b) are themselves heritable, (c) are manifest in the absence of the disorder, (d) cosegregate with the illness in the families and (e) are more prevalent in relatives of people suffering from the disease than in the general population. To date only a few markers have been examined in sufficient detail to know whether they fulfil these criteria. Therefore it is still too early to evaluate the significance ofendophenotypes in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "HPA axis hyperactivity as suicide predictor in elderly mood disorder inpatients.", "Abstract": "Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function is associated with suicidal behaviour and age-associated alterations in HPA axis functioning may render elderly individuals more susceptible to HPA dysregulation related to mood disorders. Research on HPA axis function in suicide prediction in elderly mood disorder patients is sparse. The study sample consisted of 99 depressed elderly inpatients 65 years of age or older admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000. The hypothesis was that elderly mood disorder inpatients who fail to suppress cortisol in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) are at higher risk of suicide. The DST non-suppression distinguished between suicides and survivors in elderly depressed inpatients and the suicide attempt at the index episode was a strong predictor for suicide. Additionally, the DST non-suppression showed higher specificity and predictive value in the suicide attempter group. Due to age-associated alterations in HPA axis functioning, the optimal cut-off for DST non-suppression in suicide prediction may be higher in elderly mood disorder inpatients. These data demonstrate the importance of attempted suicide and DST non-suppression as predictors of suicide risk in late-life depression and suggest the use for neuroendocrine testing of HPA axis functioning as a complementary tool in suicide prevention."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation: a device intended for the psychiatrist's office, but what is its future clinical role?", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a novel, noninvasive, office-based device technology that delivers focused stimulation to the cortex of the brain by means of magnetic pulses. It is a promising therapeutic approach in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. A large number of clinical trials have examined repetitive TMS as a novel treatment for major depression, with additional significant work in schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and pain syndromes. In this review, we describe how repetitive TMS is administered clinically and discuss how excitatory and inhibitory forms of stimulation are applied depending on what is known of the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Future putative clinical applications of repetitive TMS in psychiatry are discussed, with the authors' perspective on its likely role in clinical practice. TMS is a promising form of neuromodulation therapy that will most likely become a significant part of clinical practice in the future."}, {"Title": "Template for quickly creating forensic psychiatry reports.", "Abstract": "Great variability exists in written forensic psychiatry reports.

We sought to ascertain how regions postulated to be abnormal in bipolar and unipolar disorders were functionally connected to the rest of the brain, and how this associativity differed from healthy controls. Thirty patients with bipolar disorder (BPs), 34 patients with unipolar disorder (UPs), and 66 healthy volunteers (Willis, M.W., Benson, B.E., Ketter, T.A., Kimbrell, T.A., George, M.S., Speer, A.M., Herscovitch, P., Post, R.M., 2008. Interregional cerebral metabolic associativity during a continuous performance task in healthy adults. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 164 (1)) were imaged using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) while performing an auditory continuous performance task (CPT). Five bilateral regions of interest (ROIs), namely dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, inferior parietal cortex (INFP), thalamus and cerebellum, were correlated with normalized cerebral metabolism in the rest of the brain while covarying out Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Scores. In bipolar patients compared with controls, metabolism in the left DLPFC and INFP, and bilateral thalamus and insula had more positive and fewer negative metabolic correlations with other brain regions. In contrast, compared with controls, unipolar patients had fewer significant correlative relationships, either positive or negative. In common, bipolar and unipolar patients lacked the normal inverse relationships between the DLPFC and cerebellum, as well as relationships between the primary ROIs and other limbic regions (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and temporal lobes) compared with controls. Associations of DLPFC and INFP with other brain areas were different in each hemisphere in patients and controls. Bipolar patients exhibited exaggerated positive coherence of activity throughout the brain, while unipolar patients showed a paucity of normal interrelationships compared with controls. These abnormal patterns of metabolic associativity suggest marked interregional neuronal dysregulation in bipolar and unipolar illness exists beyond that of mere absolute regional differences from control levels, and provides rationale for using acute and long-term therapies that may re-establish and maintain normal associativity in these devastating illnesses."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenomics: the promise of personalized medicine for CNS disorders.", "Abstract": "This review focuses first on the concept of pharmacogenomics and its related concepts (biomarkers and personalized prescription). Next, the first generation of five DNA pharmacogenomic tests used in the clinical practice of psychiatry is briefly reviewed. Then the possible involvement of these pharmacogenomic tests in the exploration of early clinical proof of mechanism is described by using two of the tests and one example from the pharmaceutical industry (iloperidone clinical trials). The initial attempts to use other microarray tests (measuring RNA expression) as peripheral biomarkers for CNS disorders are briefly described. Then the challenge of taking pharmacogenomic tests (compared to drugs) into clinical practice is explained by focusing on regulatory oversight, the methodological/scientific issues concerning diagnostic tests, and cost-effectiveness issues. Current information on medicine-based evidence and cost-effectiveness usually focuses on average patients and not the outliers who are most likely to benefit from personalized prescription. Finally, future research directions are suggested. The future of 'personalized prescription' in psychiatry requires consideration of pharmacogenomic testing and environmental and personal variables that influence pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug response for each individual drug used by each patient."}, {"Title": "Non-human primates: model animals for developmental psychopathology.", "Abstract": "Non-human primates have been used to model psychiatric disease for several decades. The success of this paradigm has issued from comparable cognitive skills, brain morphology, and social complexity in adult monkeys and humans. Recently, interest in biological psychiatry has focused on similar brain, social, and emotional developmental processes in monkeys. In part, this is related to evidence that early postnatal experiences in human development may have profound implications for subsequent mental health. Non-human primate studies of postnatal phenomenon have generally fallen into three basic categories: experiential manipulation (largely manipulations of rearing), pharmacological manipulation (eg drug-induced psychosis), and anatomical localization (defined by strategic surgical damage). Although these efforts have been very informative each of them has certain limitations. In this review we highlight general findings from the non-human primate postnatal developmental literature and their implications for primate models in psychiatry. We argue that primates are uniquely capable of uncovering interactions between genes, environmental challenges, and development resulting in altered risk for psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Masters of their conditions II: intercultural theatre, narration and stage work with patients and healers.", "Abstract": "What can a healer learn from theatre and performance studies? What can theatre and performance studies bring to healing practices? Both disciplines are distinct in Western societies, at times merged into miscellaneous forms of 'art therapy'. What lessons can we learn from traditions that do not separate these competencies and have always integrated them as being naturally complementary? In a consultation of cultural psychiatry, both patients and healers are actively aware of various degrees of merging of art and medicine. Narration, then, cannot be limited to verbal case-history making and verbal therapeutic approaches. Bringing patients and healers on a stage and using all forms of text and performance allow for another way of (re)constructing case histories. Expanding the narrative process opens doors to exploring traditions: their origin, their apprenticeship, their performance and their transmission."}, {"Title": "[Surgical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy].", "Abstract": "The surgical treatment of epilepsy is a therapeutic procedure aimed at removal of the brain tissue responsible for seizures. Neurological examinations are performed to delineate the epileptic zone, which is then removed, without causing a functional deficit. In order to fulfill these goals, it is essential to localize accurately and lateralize the epileptogenic zone and the surrounding eloquent cortex.\nNinety-four adult patients were included in the study of the Epilepsy Center, National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Budapest. All patients underwent a standard anterior temporal lobectomy between 1989 and 2001, whereas their preoperative evaluation consisted of detailed history of epilepsy, interictal EEG (awake and asleep), video EEG monitoring of seizures, magnetic resonance imaging, all according to the epilepsy protocol and neuropsychological investigations. The mean follow up was 6.1 years (range: 2-17 years). Seizure outcome was assessed annually, using Engel's classification. Seventy-two percents of patients were seizure-free 1 year after surgery.\nThe percentage of seizure-free patients two, five and ten years after the surgery was 67%, 59%, and 61%, respectively.\nAccording to cost analysis, epilepsy surgery is considered to be cost effective. However, in the long run, indirect cost benefits (employment, independent living) add even more to the cost effectiveness of this method. Although the economic aspect is of great importance, especially in countries with limited financial resources, it is often neglected both by neurologists and health authorities."}, {"Title": "Social and emotional outcomes of child sexual abuse: a clinical sample in Turkey.", "Abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse is a traumatic life event that may cause psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.

Two years later, the psychological adjustment of these children (M age = 9.4 years, SD = 3.63 years, range = 5 to 16 years) is evaluated. Semistructured interviews, a form for the sociodemographic characteristics, are used for evaluations by a child psychiatrist who is blind to the first evaluation.

Our analysis of 402 schizophrenia subjects showed a trend (p=0.072) only under a fixed-model. As it was observed heterogeneity among the studies (p=0.007), we re-analyzed using a random-effects framework and no significance was found (p=0.339). No evidence for bias publication was reported (p=0.868). Our analysis of 18,903 subjects showed a trend (p=0.053) associating CC and lower BMI under a fixed model. Although no significant association was found, the same pattern (CC and lower antipsychotic-induced weight gain) was observed.

Since then, a penal code, paragraph 174 c StGB, was decreed, prohibiting sexual contact between therapists and their patients. A current follow-up survey was conducted in order to determine whether the results of previous surveys concerning situation conditions and after-effects converge with current results and if so, to what extent. Secondly, the survey was conducted to determine whether or not changes in the way the involved patients and authorities deal with this type of incident are evident. To ensure the comparability of the data, an online version of the Questionnaire about Sexual Contacts in Psychotherapy and Psychiatry (SKPP; Becker-Fischer, Fischer u. Jerouschek) was created and a survey of N = 77 affected patients was conducted. The majority of the participants in the study reported a serious decline in their overall well being following the incident, however, only very few undertook legal steps; only in three cases did it come to a legal procedure. The assumption that sexual contacts in psychotherapy result in extremely damaging consequences to patients, which the first study already revealed, was affirmed in the follow-up examination. Despite the changed legal situation, however, therapists in Germany are still not held legally responsible more often than they were 10 years ago."}, {"Title": "[The neurobiology of burnout: the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis and other findings].", "Abstract": "This review aimed to present an overview of neurobiological research on the etiology of burnout and to evaluate the proposed arguments.\nA retrospective literature review of the relevant studies conducted within the last 17 years. For this purpose a literature search was conducted via internet-based search engines, including PubMed, Science-Direct, Medline, GoogleScholar, ULAKBIM Turkish Medicine Index, and Turkish Psychiatry Index, using the key words, burnout, cortisol, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA)-axis, stress, neurobiology, neurogenesis, BDNF, immunology, and etiology, in different combinations.\nThe pioneering studies that focused on the relationship between burnout and dysregulation of the HPA-axis have yielded inconsistent results. Data from subsequent studies with improved designs suggest there is no HPA-axis dysregulation in burnout, but the results do not lead to more concrete interpretations. There is some evidence of impaired immunity function in burnout as compared with controls. Although there is strong evidence of a relationship between stress and impairment in hippocampal neurogenesis, there is no study of burnout in the field. Data about monoaminergic involvement in burnout, which is one of the probable pathways, is scarce.\nIn future research the essential guidelines for evaluating HPA-axis functioning (i.e. timing of collecting samples from saliva or blood and controlling for possible influencing factors on HPA-axis functioning) in patients clinically diagnosed with burnout should be taken into account, and in addition to the HPA-axis, evaluation of hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophins, immunity functioning, and the monoaminergic system will provide more data on the neurobiology of burnout."}, {"Title": "[Neurocognitive features of the frontal lobe in parents of autistic children].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the neurocognitive functions of the frontal lobe in parents of autistic children.\nThe study group included 64 parents of children (aged 4-18 years) diagnosed with autism, according to DSM-IV criteria, that were followed-up at the child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic. Parents of children with Down syndrome (n = 60) were selected as the control group. We administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Stroop Test, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (WAIS) to both groups in order to evaluate executive functions, attention, inhibition, and intelligence.\nMothers of children with autism performed better than the control group mothers on the executive function measures of WCST. There were no group differences in Stroop Test measures of attention and inhibition, or in the verbal and performance intelligence subtests of WAIS. Fathers of children with severe autistic symptoms performed better on some WAIS subtests compared to other; however, there were no significant differences in IQ between the parents in both groups.\nThe results suggest that parents of autistic children could display different cognitive styles, but we did not observe any distinctive cognitive profile pertaining to frontal lobe functions.

This, in combination with very slow progress in the area of molecular genetics, has generated interest in more complicated models of schizophrenia etiology that explicitly posit gene-environment interactions (EU-GEI. European Network of Schizophrenia Networks for the Study of Gene Environment Interactions. Schizophrenia aetiology: do gene-environment interactions hold the key? [published online ahead of print April 25, 2008] Schizophr Res; S0920-9964(08) 00170-9). Although findings of epidemiological gene-environment interaction (G x E) studies are suggestive of widespread gene-environment interactions in the etiology of schizophrenia, numerous challenges remain. For example, attempts to identify gene-environment interactions cannot be equated with molecular genetic studies with a few putative environmental variables \"thrown in\": G x E is a multidisciplinary exercise involving epidemiology, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, neuroimaging, pharmacology, biostatistics, and genetics. Epidemiological G x E studies using indirect measures of genetic risk in genetically sensitive designs have the advantage that they are able to model the net, albeit nonspecific, genetic load. In studies using direct molecular measures of genetic variation, a hypothesis-driven approach postulating synergistic effects between genes and environment impacting on a final common pathway, such as \"sensitization\" of mesolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, while simplistic, may provide initial focus and protection against the numerous false-positive and false-negative results that these investigations engender. Experimental ecogenetic approaches with randomized assignment may help to overcome some of the limitations of observational studies and allow for the additional elucidation of underlying mechanisms using a combination of functional enviromics and functional genomics."}, {"Title": "Developing translational animal models for symptoms of schizophrenia or bipolar mania.", "Abstract": "Animal models have long been used to explore hypotheses regarding the neurobiological substrates of and treatments for psychiatric disorders. Early attempts to develop models that mimic the entirety of the diagnostic syndromes in psychiatry have evolved into more appropriate efforts to model specific symptoms. Such an approach reflects the facts that even in patients, clinical symptoms transcend diagnostic categories, and the specific etiologies of psychiatric disorders are unknown. An animal model can only be identified adequately by specifying both the manipulation (drug, lesion, strain) used to induce abnormalities and the measure(s) used to characterize them. A wide range of pharmacological, lesion, and developmental manipulations have been combined with various measures of information processing to develop useful animal models that parallel human tests. Prepulse inhibition of startle, event-related potential (ERP) measures of auditory gating, and Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (CANTAB) measures of cognition are examples of measures that can be used in both rodents and humans and that are robustly altered in both psychiatric disorders and animals manipulated with appropriate drugs or lesions. The further development of cross-species models is critically important, given the new opportunities for the development and registration of specific treatments for the cognitive disorders of schizophrenia that are not ameliorated by available drugs. In moving beyond the focus on psychotic symptoms to the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, animal models that do not involve manipulations of dopamine D(2) receptors but that do utilize information processing measures that are correlated with cognitive disturbances are receiving increased attention. Here, selected examples of how cross-species measures of psychiatric disorders are developed and validated are discussed. Specific animal paradigms that parallel the specific domains of cognition that are altered in schizophrenia provide one focus of the review. Another focus includes efforts to develop new human models of psychiatric symptoms that are designed to parallel existing tests used in rodents."}, {"Title": "The primacy of mania: a reconsideration of mood disorders.", "Abstract": "In contemporary psychiatry, depression and mania are conceived as different entities. They may occur together, as in bipolar disorder, or they may occur separately, as in unipolar depression. This view is partly based on a narrow definition of mania and a rather broad definition of depression. Generally, depression is seen as more prominent, common, and problematic; while mania appears uncommon and treatment-responsive. We suggest a reversal: mania viewed broadly, not as simply episodic euphoria plus hyperactivity, but a wide range of excitatory behaviors; and depression seen more narrowly. Further, using pharmacological and clinical evidence, and in contrast to previous theories of mania interpreted as a flight from depression, we propose the primacy of mania hypothesis (PM): depression is a consequence of the excitatory processes of mania. If correct, current treatment of depressive illness needs revision. Rather than directly lifting mood with antidepressants, the aim would be to suppress manic-like excitation, with depression being secondarily prevented. Potential objections to, and empirical tests of, the PM hypothesis are discussed."}, {"Title": "Outcome among community dwelling older adults with schizophrenia: results using five conceptual models.", "Abstract": "There have been few studies examining the outcome of schizophrenia in later life. Using five conceptual models, we test two hypotheses with respect to range of outcomes among older schizophrenia outpatients and how they compare to their age peers in the community. We operationalized five outcome measures from the following conceptual models: Remission, adapting criteria of Andreasen et al. (The American Journal of Psychiatry, 162:441-449, 2005); Recovery, adapting the criteria by Liberman et al. (International Review of Psychiatry, 14:256-272, 2002); Community Integration using the model of Wong and Solomon (Mental Health Services Research, 4:13-28, 2002); Subjective and Objective Successful Aging using the model of Rowe and Kahn (Science, 237:143-149, 1987). The schizophrenia (S) group consisted of 198 community-dwelling persons aged 55 and over who developed schizophrenia before age 45 and a community comparison (CC) group (N = 113). Remission and recovery criteria were met by 49 and 17% of the S group, respectively. There were significant differences between the S and CC groups in the distribution of community integration and successful aging scales: 41% of the CC group met at least 10 of 12 criteria versus 23% of the S group on the Community Integration Scale; 19% of the CC group met all six criteria vs. 2% of the S group on the Objective Successful Aging Scale; 27% of the CC group vs. 13% of the S group met all six criteria on the Subjective Successful Aging Scale. Correlations among the five outcome measures ranged from r = .19 to .48 (median value: r = .26 or 7% shared variance). There is wide variability in outcome in later life depending on which measure is used. Rather than one universal indicator, each measure offers a different perspective that can provide useful guidelines for researchers, clinicians, and policy makers."}, {"Title": "Effect of hippocampal and amygdala volumes on clinical outcomes in major depression: a 3-year prospective magnetic resonance imaging study.", "Abstract": "According to the stress-toxicity hypothesis of depression, hippocampal volumes may diminish as the disease progresses. We sought to examine the changes in hippocampal and amygdala volumes at baseline and at 3 years after an acute depressive episode, and the impact of reduced hippocampal volumes on the outcome.\nIn a prospective, longitudinal study, we examined the hippocampus and amygdala of 30 inpatients with major depression from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and 30 healthy participants from the community (control group) using high-resolution magnetic resonance images at baseline and after 3 years. Psychopathology was assessed at baseline, weekly during the inpatient phase and then after 1, 2 and 3 years.\nDuring the 3-year follow-up period, neither hippocampal nor amygdala volumes changed significantly among patients or participants in the control group. However, in the subgroup of patients who took antidepressants over the full 3 years, the left hippocampal volumes increased significantly. Patients with small hippocampal volumes and previous depressive episodes had a worse clinical outcome compared with patients with large hippocampal volumes and previous depressive episodes.\nOverall, our results suggest that a relatively small hippocampal volume may be a vulnerability factor for a bad treatment response in major depression. Subtle changes in hippocampal volumes may be detectable during continuous antidepressant therapy. Such changes may be the result of neuroplastic processes."}, {"Title": "[Motives for choice of specialty during and after medical school].", "Abstract": "The basis for preference and choice of specialty is a complicated mixture of individual interests and job opportunities. We wanted to investigate the possible explanations for such preferences and choices.\nTwo groups of Norwegian doctors, 421 who entered medical school in 1993 and 631 who completed medical school in 1993 and 1994, received four questionnaires between 1993 and 2003 which included questions on preference or choice of specialty and possible motives for this.\nIndividual preferences change extensively over time, but there is also a remarkably stabile distribution between the specialist categories. A specialty's prestige was emphasized less after medical school and the importance of having an optimal combination of an interesting job and a good private life increased This was also the case after controlling for the female respondents. Those who chose surgery or internal medicine were more motivated by medical challenges and career possibilities, while those who chose psychiatry or general medicine were more motivated by conditions such as variety and time for own family.\nThe motives behind choice of specialty are complicated and difficult to interpret, but seem to be a combination of ambitions and prestige on one hand, and lifestyle and family on the other. Recruitment into low status specialties may be achieved by increasing the possibilities for doctors to lead more normal family and social lives."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of ward attendants towards mental illness: comparisons and predictors.", "Abstract": "In India few studies exist that explore attitudes of mental health professionals, especially psychiatric ward attendants, towards psychiatric illnesses.

Clozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia. Archive of General Psychiatry 60, 82-91]. The primary goal of this analysis was to determine if the ISST and CDS ratings indicated that the raters, an unblinded (UP) and a blinded psychiatrist (BP) using the ISST, and a blinded rater using the CDS, were able to identify those patients who had a Type 1 event. The ratings of patients adjudged to have experienced a Type 1 event (Group 1) were compared with patients who did not (Group 2). The ISST and the CDS ratings obtained 2-8 weeks prior to a Type 1 event (Pre-1) and Pre-2, the rating immediately prior to Pre-1, obtained 2-12 weeks before Pre-1, were analyzed to test the hypothesis that the difference between Pre-2 and Pre-1 ratings for the Group 1 patients was significantly greater than the difference in the comparable ratings for Group 2 patients. The prediction that patients with Type 1 events would show greater worsening in ISST and CDS ratings between Pre-2 and Pre-1 than the Group 2 patients was confirmed. However, the sensitivity and specificity of a worsening in ratings was not sufficient to provide definitive warning of an impending Type 1 event. Other characteristics of the patients with Type 1 events provide additional warning: e.g. overall higher ratings on these scales, slower improvement in suicidality during treatment, and previous number of suicide attempts. These results indicate that the ISST and CDS may provide some additional information that can assist clinical decision making regarding suicidal risk in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder."}, {"Title": "Creating a space for recovery-focused psychiatric nursing care.", "Abstract": "Within contemporary mental health-care, power relationships are regularly played out between psychiatric nurses and service users. These power relationships are often imperceptible to the practicing nurse. For instance, in times of distress, service users often turn to or/and 'construct' discourses, beliefs and knowledge that are at odds with those which psychiatric nurses rely on to inform them of the mental status of the service user. The psychiatric nurse is in the position to impose knowledge onto service users, usually in concurrence with 'traditional or bio-psychiatry', without realizing or failing to acknowledge that the service user may have an alternative explanation of his/her mental health problems/experiences. In this paper, practice examples, based on the experiences of the four authors (from within and outside of services), are used to illustrate this 'hidden' power relationship. The authors use Foucault's ideas about: (i) government; (ii) the knowledge/power nexus and resistance; (iii) and his analytic tool of genealogy to help unravel this paradox within psychiatric nursing practice. The authors also use the emerging discourse of recovery as an alternative (and challenge) to 'traditional bio-psychiatry' and consider the implications for psychiatric nursing practice."}, {"Title": "Humanism in forensic psychiatry: the use of the tidal nursing model.", "Abstract": "The humanist school of thought, which finds resonance in many conceptual models and theories designed to guide nursing practice, needs to be understood in the context of the total institution, where the individual is subjected to a mortification of the self, and denied autonomy. This article will engage in a critical reflection on how humanism has influenced nursing theorists and the subsequent production of conceptual models and theories, especially as they relate to the field of forensic psychiatric nursing. Although humanism provides optimism for nurse-patient relations, this article explores the incapability of such a philosophy to acknowledge the power relationships between individuals and its inability to explain the day-to-day realities experienced in forensic nursing, where the possibility of interpersonal violence reshapes nursing care. The tidal model will be discussed in detail as an example of a recently developed humanistic nursing model. Viewed from this perspective, it is clear that humanistic philosophy and its subsequent models of care are in discordance with the highly specialized field of forensic nursing."}, {"Title": "Changing gender profile of medical schools in South Africa.", "Abstract": "Since 1994, higher education policy has been committed to equity of access for all, irrespective of race and gender.\nWe investigated progress towards these goals in the education of medical doctors, with an emphasis on gender.\nDatabases from the Department of Education (DoE), Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) and University of Cape Town (UCT) Faculty of Health Sciences were used to explore undergraduate (MB ChB) trends at all eight medical schools and postgraduate (MMed) trends at UTC.\nNationally women have outnumbered men in MBChB enrollments since 2000, figures ranging between 52% and 63% at seven of the eight medical schools in 2005. However, the rate of change in the medical profession lags behind and it will take more than two decades for female doctors to outnumber male doctors. A study of UCT postgraduate enrollments shows that females had increased to 42% of MMed enrollments in 2005.

Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis are tools with which to assess and develop protective factors, and enhance positive adjustment. Meta-analyses and overviews have demonstrated the effect of hypnotherapy in paediatric disorders like asthma, chronic and acute pain, and in procedure-related distress in cancer patients. We wanted to examine the use and benefits of hypnotherapy when applied to child psychiatric disorders. A review of a literature search from PubMed, PsychINFO and the Cochrane databases revealed 60 publications, mostly case reports based on 2-60 cases, addressing the use of hypnotherapy in various child psychiatric conditions. Findings indicate that hypnotherapy may be useful for a wide range of disorders and problems, and may be particularly valuable in the treatment of anxiety disorders and trauma-related conditions. In conclusion, knowledge of hypnosis is useful in clinical practice and hypnotherapy may play an important role as an adjunctive therapy in cognitive-behavioural treatment and family therapy. Additional qualitative and quantitative studies are needed to assess the place for hypnosis/hypnotherapy in child psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Being Bleuler: the second century of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to examine the background to the emblematic psychiatric term, schizophrenia, the historical, cultural and social factors affecting the two men who defined modern psychiatric practice, and anticipate what lies ahead in the next century.\nThe term schizophrenia was created by Swiss psychiatrist Eugene Bleuler and first used on 24 April 1908. The condition was first described by German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and called dementia praecox.

Except for very frequent individual therapy, there were no differences in the probability of receiving any psychosocial treatment or medication between the sexes. Receiving individual therapy, lengthy treatment contacts and medications were more frequent among older adolescents. The rating tool worked best among adolescents with affective or anxious disorders and worst among those with conduct disorders.\nThe present study indicates that the structured tool used in Finland, originally modified from a Canadian priority rating tool for child and adolescent psychiatry, is able to identify adolescents requiring specified, multiple and lengthy treatments, indicating a need for specialist level services. The scoring system tested is a good candidate for a transparent prioritization tool for European adolescent psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Why should addiction medicine be an attractive field for young physicians?", "Abstract": "The clinical practice and science of addiction are increasingly active fields, which are attracting professionals from diverse disciplines such as psychology and neurobiology. Our scientific knowledge of the pathophysiology of addiction is rapidly growing, along with the variety of effective treatments available to clinicians. Yet, we believe that the medical specialties of addiction medicine/psychiatry are not attracting the interest and enthusiasm of young physicians. What can be done?\nWe offer the opinions of two experience addiction psychiatrists.\nIn the US, there has been a decline in the number of psychiatrists seeking training or board certification in addiction psychiatry; about one-third of graduates with such training are not practicing in an addiction psychiatry setting. There is widespread neglect of addiction medicine/psychiatry among the medical profession, academia and national health authorities. This neglect is unfortunate, given the enormous societal costs of addiction (3-5% of the gross domestic product in some developed countries), the substantial unmet need for addiction treatment, and the highly favourable benefit to cost yield (at least 7:1) from treatment.\nWe believe that addiction medicine/psychiatry can be made more attractive for young physicians. Helpful steps include widening acceptance as a medical specialty or subspecialty, reducing the social stigma against people with substance use disorders, expanding insurance coverage and increasing the low rates of reimbursement for physicians. These steps would be easier to take with broader societal (and political) recognition of substance use disorders as a major cause of premature death, morbidity and economic burden."}, {"Title": "Selective progesterone receptor modulators 3: use in oncology, endocrinology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A number of synthetic steroids are capable of modulating progesterone receptors with a spectrum of activities ranging from pure antagonism to a mixture of agonism and antagonism. The best known of these are mifepristone (RU 486), asoprisnil (J 867), onapristone (ZK 98299), ulipristal (CDB 2914), Proellex() (CDB 4124), ORG 33628 and ORG 31710.\nOutside reproduction selective modulators of progesterone receptors have been under investigation for a large variety of indications, for example in oncology as adjuvants in breast, cervical, endometrial, ovarian and prostate cancer, as well as inoperable meningioma and leiomyosarcoma. In addition, they have been used as antiglucocorticoids. It is therefore useful to review the results obtained in these conditions.\nA careful evaluation of existing major review papers and of recently published articles was carried out for the indications under review, focusing not only on mifepristone but also on those other selective modulators of progesterone receptors for which data are available.\nIn preliminary studies selective modulators of progesterone receptors had some activity on a number of neoplasias.

This was sent to all 624 Fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry registered in Victoria at the time. A series of questions was asked based on workload, training, the role of psychiatry in intellectual disabilities, opinions on assessment and management, improving services, and the demographics of participant psychiatrists. Results of the 2004 survey are compared with the 1994 study.\nThere has been some change in psychiatrists' opinions about acute admission wards, believing strongly that they do not meet the needs of the adults with severe intellectual disabilities, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. There has been some improvement in their ability to adequately manage adults with intellectual disabilities who have mental health needs and/or problem behaviours.\nMainstream mental health services fail to meet the needs of adults with intellectual disabilities.

A sample of 300 doctors was set to be representative of hospital doctors through the 5 main regions, and hospital types. Telephone numbers were dialled by an automat in respect of the objectives of quotas. Questionnaires were administered by telephone between August 30 and September 7, 2007, and done by trained operators.\nAmong the 300 interviewed doctors, 218 (73%) were from general or specialised hospitals and 82 (27%) were from Universitary hospitals.

Although neuroimaging and lesion studies have provided empirical evidence for the neural basis of ToM ability, including the involvement of several prefrontal and temporal structures, the association between pathology of these structures and ToM impairment in schizophrenia patients is less well understood. To address this issue, we investigated structural brain abnormalities and ToM impairment in patients with schizophrenia, and examined the relationship between them. Twenty schizophrenia patients and 20 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were examined for ToM ability based on the revised version of the \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" (or Eyes) test [Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Hill, J., Raste, Y., Plumb, I., 2001.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to investigate regional brain alterations. Relative to normal controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited gray matter reductions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right insula. The patients performed poorly on the Eyes test. Importantly, poor performance on the Eyes test was found to be associated with gray matter reduction in the left VLPFC in the patient group. These results suggest that prefrontal cortical reduction, especially in the left VLPFC, is a key pathology underlying the difficulties faced by schizophrenia patients in inferring the mental states of others."}, {"Title": "\"Bashing\" of medical specialties: students' experiences and recommendations.", "Abstract": "Exposure to non-constructive criticism of medical specialties is believed to be fairly common among medical students. Better understanding of this \"bashing\" phenomenon is needed to promote greater professionalism in medical education and student interest in primary care careers. This study examines exposure and reactions to bashing among third-year medical students in a public university.\nA survey assessing amount, sources, targets, and nature of perceived bashing was completed by 105 students. Three open-ended questions elicited students' experiences, opinions, and recommendations.\nStudents perceived that bashing of other specialties occurred during all clerkships; the most were perceived during the surgery clerkship, for which 87.5% reported such bashing. Specialties perceived as the object of bashing were family medicine (72%), general internal medicine (40%), psychiatry (39%), and general surgery (36%). Sixty-seven percent of students reported personally receiving non-constructive criticism about their preferred specialty. Seventy-nine percent believed bashing was unprofessional behavior. Strategies suggested by respondents to decrease bashing included increasing awareness, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of medicine, and evaluating professionalism.\nMedical students perceived bashing of medical specialties, recognized it as unprofessional behavior, and would be receptive to interventions to reduce bashing.

Effectiveness of care was assessed before RPB-introduction and after 1.5 years. Use of care was determined semi-annually.\nCosts of inpatient psychiatric treatment decreased more strongly in the MR, while hospital based outpatient care and day clinic treatment were intensified in comparison to the CR. Quality of life, severity of illness and illness-specific symptoms in patients improved similarly in MR and CR. The functional level improved more in the MR than in the CR, which was especially evident in schizophrenia patients.\nInpatient psychiatric care costs can be reduced with the RPB without compromising the quality of care."}, {"Title": "Teaching child psychiatry in ethiopia: challenges and rewards.", "Abstract": "Ethiopia is a country of 81 million people, half of whom are children. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children ranges from 3.5-23.2%. However, there are very limited mental health resources in the country, including few psychiatrists.

The article then focuses on the author's experiences on one recent trip to Ethiopia to provide some of this training.\nFormal teaching sessions as well as clinical supervision were provided to the Ethiopian residents. Content had to be adapted to be relevant to the Ethiopian context, but teaching approaches did not have to be modified significantly.

Previous studies utilizing self-report questionnaires indicate that many medical students regard clinical work with psychiatric patients as unappealing, while the professionalism literature has documented a general decline in students' capacity for empathy over the course of medical school. Through in-depth interviews, this study attempts to better understand the formation of medical students' perceptions of psychiatry and the implications of that process for a more general understanding of the impact of emotionally-laden experiences on medical students' capacity for empathy. Forty-seven fourth-year medical students who had expressed interest or performed well in psychiatry were asked a series of questions to elicit their perceptions of the field of psychiatry. Interview transcripts were systematically coded using content analysis and principles of grounded theory. Stigma, stereotypes, and stressfully intense emotional reactions seemed to adversely affect the students' expected satisfaction from and willingness to care for the mentally ill, despite enjoying psychiatry's intellectual content and the opportunity to develop in-depth relationships with patients. Teaching faculty need to directly address the stigma and stereotypes that surround mental illness and actively help medical students cope with the stress that they report experiencing during their psychiatry clerkship in order to improve the recognition and treatment of psychiatric illness by newly graduating physicians. More generally, the relationships that we identify among stress, stigmatization, and stereotyping along an empathic spectrum suggest that increased attention should be paid to the stress that empathy can entail. This perspective may allow for the creation of similarly targeted interventions throughout the medical school curriculum to counteract the decline in empathy, the so-called \"hardening of the heart,\" associated with physician-training worldwide."}, {"Title": "Association of physical and social anhedonia with depression in the acute phase of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Researchers have shown interest in the association between anhedonia and depression in schizophrenia.

The revised Social Anhedonia Scale score significantly correlated to self-depreciation, guilty ideas of reference, pathological guilt, early wakening, suicidality and observed depression. The revised Physical Anhedonia Scale score significantly correlated with depressive mood, self-depreciation, pathological guilt and observed depression.

The study tests this hypothesis.\nThe sample consisted of 73 patients, with a diagnosis of CFS according to the Oxford criteria, randomly selected from clinics in the Departments of Immunology and Psychiatry at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. The degree of fatigue experienced by patients was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire and a visual analogue scale. Self-rated instruments were used to measure physical and social functioning, quality of life, and physical and psychological symptoms.\nPrincipal-component analysis of all scale scores revealed 2 distinct components, explaining 53% of the total variance. One component was characterized by psychological symptoms and generic quality of life indicators, whilst the other component was made up of physical symptoms, social and physical functioning and indicators of fatigue.\nThe findings suggest that perceived functional incapacity is a primary characteristic of CFS, which is manifested and/or explained by physical symptoms."}, {"Title": "[Sexual offending in schizophrenia - a comparative trial].", "Abstract": "Studies suggest a complex relationship between schizophrenia and sexually offensive behaviour. The mental disorder itself, antisocial personality traits, drug abuse and adverse childhood experiences are suggested to have an impact on sexual offending in mentally disordered offenders. Similarities in psychosexual variables for schizophrenic and sexual offenders in general are found. This study aimed to preserve first findings of sex offence features and behaviours exhibited by psychotic men in Germany. Furthermore a typology of the schizophrenic offenders was developed. Records of 64-male restricted hospital order in-patients (32 patients with and 32 patients without an ICD-10 psychotic disorder) examined at the Institute for Forensic Psychiatry or resident in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the prisons in Berlin from 1980 - 2006 with an index conviction for a contact sex offence against a woman provided the material for research. A comparative trial design was used to differentiate the psychotic and non psychotic offender group. A check list which based on the method of a content analysis containing items related to the offender and the index offence was developed and applied to the records of men. A similar extent of social isolation, psychosexual variables and adverse childhood experiences are found for schizophrenic and non schizophrenic offenders. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as antisocial traits had a great impact on schizophrenic sexual offending. Solely the occurrence of bizarre behaviour was influenced by positive symptoms. Different offence characteristics appeared in the four outlined schizophrenic subgroups such as bizarre behaviour of the psychotic, assaultive behaviour of the dissocial, chaotic behaviour of the substance abusive and negative childhood experiences of the sadistic schizophrenic offenders.

To test whether the insula also has a significant role in psychiatry behavior, we also mapped the major receptor of serotonin, 5HT-2A, in the developing insula as well. Opercular formation was evident by 21 weeks gestation. At this time, the cortical layers in the insula had started to organize, with silver impregnated pyramidal and stellate cells demonstrated various processes. By 25 gestation weeks, gyri in the insula were observed. PCNA positive cells decreased in density from 21 gestation weeks onwards while an increase of TUNEL positive cells was evident from 25 to 32 weeks of gestation. Activated capase-3 positive cells were detected in the insula, along with TUNEL positive cells, confirming possibly apoptosis. Serotonin 2A receptor appeared robustly in the 31/32 gestation week specimens. Our study showed early differentiation in the insula, when compared with other parts of the human cortex in the literature. In addition, proliferation as well as apoptosis were demonstration.

Results show that gender-specific information is scarce or absent, and hardly accessible via index or layout. The scarce gender-specific information mainly applies to epidemiological data and reproductive items.\nCurrent medical textbooks are still gender-biased.

This study examines the correlation of aggressiveness and its subtypes with quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction, personality dimensions and family functioning. The research is conducted on 99 psychiatric patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychotic disorder similar to schizophrenia (F20-F29) in two forensic psychiatry institutions. The patients committed criminal offence in state of insanity. These offences had signs of aggressive acts and the patients were therefore admitted to inpatient psychiatric forensic institutions. The research was conducted by using the Aggressiveness Questionnaire (AG-87), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Family Functioning Scale. The results show that aggressiveness has a negative correlation with the quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction. Regression analyses indicate that bad family relations and psychoticism are significant predictors of aggressiveness and its subtypes.

The study of addictive behavior crosses several disciplines, including, among others, behavioral neuroscience, epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, pharmacology, psychology, psychiatry, and sociology. Articles in this issue examine aspects of AOD use disorders from the perspective of some of these varied disciplines."}, {"Title": "Is computed tomography still useful as a neuroimaging tool in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) has played a pivotal role in psychiatry from its inception; however with the advent of other high-resolution noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as MRI, the field has gone through a dramatic transformation.\nThis article will explore the current role of CT in psychiatry.\nAn extensive search of the published literature (1970 - 2008) was conducted, employing a number of databases and terms relevant to CT and imaging.\nAt present CT is primarily used as a screening tool to exclude intracranial pathology. This is partly because it is widely available and less expensive than other imaging modalities. CT is unable to provide region-specific information like MRI and this has restricted its use in disorders in which functional disturbances are suspected, however it remains the preferred mode of investigation where gross structural abnormalities are suspected."}, {"Title": "Making fewer depression diagnoses: beneficial for patients?", "Abstract": "Currently, general practitioners actively search for depressive disorders in their patients. When they diagnose 'depressive disorder', they tell their patients that they have a disease and can be treated accordingly. This is probably an important reason for the huge prescription rates of anti-depressants. In doing so, general practitioners implement specialised, psychiatric diagnostic methods in a setting characterised by patients with symptoms that superficially may resemble those of depressive disorder but in reality mainly arise from normal problems in everyday life due to losses of valued relations or failure to achieve desired goals. We argue that it might be beneficial for patients if general practitioners, in a stepped care approach, hold back on specialised methods of psychiatry and instead use a more generalist approach as first step, in which patients' problems are formulated in their own words, and efforts are directed in helping patients regain their self-confidence to solve them. Our arguments for directing attention away from diagnosing depressive disorder are: depressive disorder is a diagnosis by agreement and therefore relative, so there are other ways to look at problems than though psychiatric glasses; depression has unclear boundaries with other mental disorders and with normality; depression is often not an adequate summary of the real problems of the patient; the patient often has a very different conception about what is wrong and often does not agree with the proposed presence of a mental disorder; to diagnose depressive disorder may have more disadvantages than advantages for the patient;. the efficacy of anti-depressants is very modest."}, {"Title": "On unsafe ground: the practices and institutionalization of Danish psychiatry, 1850-1920.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to characterize the efforts of late nineteenth-century Danish psychiatrists to have their field recognized as a discipline in its own right, and their fight to be accepted as practitioners of science, following common scientific standards of exactness and proof. This struggle took place on two fronts: with colleagues in the somatic branches of medicine, and also with lay people and the general public. According to the psychiatrists, laymen persistently contested psychiatry's legitimacy in diagnosing and treating mentally ill patients. Criticism of its scientific objectivity made it difficult for psychiatry to gain respect on an equal footing with other branches of medicine."}, {"Title": "The provision of mental health services in England for people over 65 years of age, 1970-78.", "Abstract": "The twentieth century saw an increasing number of people living into old age, and consequently a higher prevalence of age-related chronic degenerative brain disorders. By 1971 the mental hospitals were almost half full with people over 65 years of age. Thus plans to close the mental hospitals meant that the development of community mental health services for older people was a necessity.

The development of several centres for this new treatment contributed to this success story, mainly the Viennese Psychiatric-neurological clinic and the Swiss asylum M\u00fcnsingen. Visiting psychiatrists in these clinics and Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s became important advocates of the new therapy in other countries. The success of insulin coma therapy was also based on the hope of many psychiatrists in the 1930s for a more somatic approach for mental illness- thereby promising to catch up with biologically defined 20th century medicine.

While a large number of associations, with generally small effect size, have been discovered, a \"test\" with widespread use and adoption is still missing. A more realistic picture, recognizing the important contribution of clinical and environmental factors toward overall clinical outcome has emerged. In this emerging view, genetic findings, if considered individually, may have limited clinical applications. Thus, in recent years, combinations of information in several genes have been used for the selection of appropriate therapeutic doses and for the prediction of agranulocytosis, hyperlipidemia, and response to antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. While these tests based on multiple genes show greater predictive ability than individual allele tests, their net impact on clinical consequence and costs is limited, thus leading to limited penetration into widespread clinical use. As one looks at other branches of medicine, there are successful examples of pharmacogenetic tests guiding treatment, and thus, it is reasonable to hope that with the incorporation of clinical and environmental information and the identification of new genes drawn from genome-wide analysis, will improve the predictive utility of these tests leading to their increased use by clinicians."}, {"Title": "At what age do biomedical scientists do their best work?", "Abstract": "Several human characteristics that influence scientific research performance, including set goals, mental and physical abilities, education, and experience, may vary considerably during the life cycle of scientists. We sought to answer the question of whether high-quality research productivity is associated with investigator's age. We randomly selected 300 highly cited scientists (50 from each of 6 different biomedical fields, specifically immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, psychology-psychiatry, clinical medicine, and biology-biochemistry). Then, we identified the top 5 highly cited articles (within 10 yr after publication adjusted for the expansion of the literature) as first author of each of them. Subsequently, we plotted the distribution of the 1500 analyzed articles of the 300 studied scientists in the eight 5-year intervals of investigator's age during the year of article publication (21-25 to 55-60 yr of age), adjusted for person-years of contribution of each scientist in the various age groups. Highly cited research productivity plotted a curve that peaked at the age group of 31-35 yr of age and then gradually decreased with advancing age. However, a considerable proportion of this highly cited research was produced by older scientists (in almost 20% of the analyzed articles, researchers were older than 50 yr). The results were similar in another analysis of the single most cited article of each studied scientist. In conclusion, high-quality scientific productivity in the biomedical fields as a function of investigator's age plots an inverted U-shaped curve, in which significant decreases take place from around 40 yr of age and beyond."}, {"Title": "An Icelandic version of the Kiddie-SADS-PL: translation, cross-cultural adaptation and inter-rater reliability.", "Abstract": "The development of structured diagnostic instruments has been an important step for research in child and adolescent psychiatry, but the adequacy of a diagnostic instrument in a given culture does not guarantee its reliability or validity in another population. The objective of the study was to describe the process of cross-cultural adaptation into Icelandic of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (Kiddie-SADS-PL) and to test the inter-rater reliability of the adapted version. To attain cross-cultural equivalency, five important dimensions were addressed: semantic, technical, content, criterion and conceptual. The adapted Icelandic version was introduced into an inpatient clinical setting, and inter-rater reliability was estimated both at the symptom and diagnoses level, for the most frequent diagnostic categories in both international diagnostic classification systems (DSM-IV and ICD-10). The cross-cultural adaptation has provided an Icelandic version allowing similar understanding among different raters and has achieved acceptable cross-cultural equivalence.

This paper sets out to investigate the 'state of play' regarding consumer participation in mental health services.\nConsumer participation is not a common topic in the recent literature, despite the significant public policy push to promote it. Although the vision of public policy is for consumers to be at the centre of decision making, the changes are understandably slow in coming. The implications for the practice of psychiatry, and therefore mental health services, of the demands for meaningful participation are profound. They challenge some of the social covenants under which mental health services have historically been delivered. Traditionally, people living with a mental illness have not had their rights respected. In recent times, the College has developed policies that aim to ensure that the rights of people living with a mental disorder are respected.

The students consisted of two randomly assigned groups; group A received a case description with a psychiatric label attached while group B received the same case description but without a psychiatric label.\nA total of 68 (47.2%) of the students responded to the questionnaire with the attached psychiatric label, while 76 (52.8%) responded to the questionnaire without the attached label. There was no statistical difference in age (p = 0.187) and sex (p = 0.933) between the two groups of students. The students who responded to the questionnaire with the attached psychiatric label would not rent out their houses (p = 0.003), were unwilling to have as their next-door neighbour (p = 0.004), or allow their sister to get married (p = 0.000) to the man depicted in the case description compared with those that responded to the questionnaire without label. This group also felt that the man would exhaust them both physically (p = 0.005) and emotionally (p = 0.021) in any relationship with him.\nThese results strengthen the view that stigma attached to mental illness is not limited to the general public; medical students are also part of the stigmatizing world.

Data are based on a literature review of published papers, conference proceedings, analyses of official policy and popular media, interviews with key Indian mental health professionals, and fieldwork in Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh (2004-2006). The authors demonstrate how three influences have shaped community psychiatry in India: a cultural asymmetry between health professionals and the wider society, psychiatry's search for both professional and social legitimacy, and WHO policies that have provided the overall direction to the development of services. Taken together, the consequences are that rural community voices have been edited out. The authors hypothesize that community psychiatry in India is a bureaucratic and culturally incongruent endeavor that increases the divide between psychiatry and local rural communities. Such a claim requires sustained ethnographic fieldwork to reveal the dynamics of the gap between community and professional experiences. The development of culturally sensitive psychiatric theory and clinical services is essential to improve the mental health of rural citizens who place their trust in India's biomedical network."}, {"Title": "Do we need theory to study disease?

I claim that traditional philosophical debates over the nature of disease make demands on medicine that are mistaken. I demonstrate this philosophical error by applying the perspective of the philosophy of science to understanding the nature of disease in two concrete cases, cancer and depression. I first argue that cancer research produces various kinds of piecemeal causal explanation and does so without any well-developed theory of normal and malignant functioning, despite the rhetoric of some leading cancer researchers. I then defuse doubts about the scientific status of psychiatry, by demonstrating that it is not necessary to have a theory of normal functioning in order to understand and treat depression."}, {"Title": "Mental illness from the perspective of theoretical neuroscience.", "Abstract": "Theoretical neuroscience, which characterizes neural mechanisms using mathematical and computational models, is highly relevant to central problems in the philosophy of psychiatry. These models can help to solve the explanation problem of causally connecting neural processes with the behaviors and experiences found in mental illnesses. Such explanations will also be useful for generating better classifications and treatments of psychiatric disorders. The result should help to eliminate concerns that mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia are not objectively real.

Assessment of trainees offers an opportunity to provide explicit feedback on their skills and encourages learning. This article describes a pilot study in which clinician-educators affiliated with the geriatrics training programs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University Medical Center designed and piloted a novel Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to assess the communication and interpersonal skills of medical, dental, and geriatric psychiatry fellows. The OSCE consisted of three stations where geriatricians and standardized patients evaluated candidates using specifically designed checklists and an abbreviated version of the Master Interview Rating Scale. Communication skills were assessed through performance of specific \"real life\" clinical tasks, such as obtaining a medical history, explaining a diagnosis and prognosis, giving therapeutic instructions, and counseling. Interpersonal skills were assessed through the effect of the communication between doctor and standardized patient on fostering trust, relieving anxiety, and establishing a therapeutic relationship. This pilot study demonstrated that the OSCE format of assessment provides a valid means of evaluating the communication and interpersonal skills of interdisciplinary geriatric trainees and provides a valuable forum for formative assessment and feedback. Given that geriatricians and non geriatricians involved in elder care both need communication and interpersonal skills, this novel OSCE can be used for assessment of these skills in trainees in diverse healthcare subspecialties."}, {"Title": "Riluzole in psychiatry: a systematic review of the literature.", "Abstract": "The glutamate system seems to be an important contributor to the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders.

The patients' education was the only factor that significantly influenced the HCSB.\nIn Cambodia, traditional and religious medicine are the first pathway to mental healthcare when patient and caregiver decide to seek help due to psychotic symptoms. The lack of knowledge on mental health and facilities appears the main reason to explain the schizophrenic patients' HCSB.

The critique overlooks, however, the ways that everyday, emergent moral discourse is influenced--over time and through several mediations--by formal ethical notions. High-order ethical pronouncements become sedimented into the conditions of work, illustrated in this article by a two-year ethnographic study of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), a popular mode of outpatient psychiatric services. ACT clinicians' moral unease when they break the confidentiality of patients is connected to high-order debates, dating back 35 years, about ensuring patients' autonomy without abandoning them. These debates originally spurred the invention of ACT, and they get braided into today's moral discourse through several mediations: regulatory paperwork, the mandates and micropolitics of staff-patient interactions, and the idealized self-image of front-line staff. This article shows how everyday moral talk is coproduced by both the immediate contexts of clinical work and the categories of formal bioethics."}, {"Title": "Which physicians have access to electronic prescribing and which ones end up using it?", "Abstract": "This study examines the availability of electronic prescription and the utilization of e-prescribing by physicians in the US.\nNationally representative data from the 2004-2005 Community Tracking Study Physician Survey were used to identify which subgroups of physicians have access to e-prescribing technology and which subgroups are using this technology more or less intensively.

The mechanisms underlying hypnosis and how hypnosis differs from other cognitive states are almost totally unknown. With the exceptions of suggestions for pain control, current concepts of high, medium, low or non-hypnotizability do not reliably predict clinical outcomes for most medical, psychiatric or dental disorders. We do know that it is relatively easy to reliably evaluate hypnotizability, but other than choosing volunteers or subjects who will or will not exhibit traditional hypnotic phenomena, we rarely know what to do with that evaluation with actual clinical patients. Four case studies, representative of many others, chosen retrospectively from a practice that spans 45 years, illustrate how traditional or modern hypnotizability assessment is irrelevant in the clinical setting.

Since the dawn of human consciousness, each of these two forms of pain-one clearly physical, the other having more to deal with the mind-have played a central role in human existence. Psychological pain and suffering add dimensions that go far beyond the boundaries of its physical counterpart. In the past 50 years, one of the more remarkable accomplishments of medical science has been to increasingly enable the clinician to impact, as never before, each of these critical realms of human existence. Our intention is, therefore, to initially describe a few of the many exciting neuroscientific and neurosurgical advances that have been made in the treatment of various types of pain and to speculate on some of the emergent questions that we believe need to be addressed. After this is accomplished, we will then use this information as a kind of two-pronged philosophical entrance into questions of the mind, brain, and soul that we feel are necessary to bring back into the sphere of the modern physician's practice. The goal of this article is two-fold: 1) to share some of our exciting research and 2) to renew the interest in timeless questions, such as that of the mind-brain and the brain-mind, in the conversation of the modern neurosurgeon. The International Association for the Study of Pain divides pain into two broad functions and anatomical categories. In this framework, \"nociceptive\" pain is defined as the kind of physical pain that results when the tissue is damaged. Given this perspective, such pain is usually considered a consequence of one's defense against one's environment. The other pain is the \"neuropathic\" one resulting from a lesion or a dysfunction of the human nervous system. As such, we will take the risk of crossing beyond the boundaries of neurosurgery and venture into boundaries that, at another time, might seem more natural to the discipline of psychiatry for two reasons. The first is that psychiatry seems to be so focused on the brain-its biochemistry and pharmacology--that questions of mind and soul have become rare and almost negligible. The second is to follow the course of the results of our own clinical investigations that have taken us into that very human world where questions of physical pain, psychological pain, and the experience of suffering abound. Today, however, the strategy of neuromodulation offers the advantage of being precisely tailored in neuroanatomical terms and, even more importantly, of being altogether reversible. At both our own Istituto Neurologico C. Besta and many other neurosurgical centers worldwide, many procedures have been reported in which implant neuromodulation devices successfully treat pain. For example, long-term stimulation of the spinal cord has been fairly effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis, and various other forms of pain. Good results have been obtained in treating peripheral vascular diseases and sympathetic reflex dystrophy syndrome. Good results have also been achieved in trigeminal nerve stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation. In the case of thalamic stimulation, there has also been an improvement of symptoms, but a long-term degree of tolerance was noticed. Hypothalamic stimulation has also been seen to be effective in controlling trigeminal autonomic cephalalgic pain, as well as the facial pain that is known to occur in multiple sclerosis. Motor cortex stimulation was found to occasionally have good results in treating neuropathic pain, whereas occipital nerve stimulation was found to achieve good results in controlling chronic cluster headache and other chronic headaches, although with only short-term follow-up so far. Recent reports of functional magnetic resonance imaging have prompted us to propose exciting new neurosurgical targets that may be effective in treating psychoaffective disorders. Our results appear to be more than promising so far. It appears that neuropathic pain and psychoaffective disorders seem to be sharing an anatomophysiological common background at the Brodmann Area 25 of the anterior cingulated gyrus. On the basis of these exciting findings, we believe that it is reasonable to suggest that neuropathic pain and psychoaffective disorders may ultimately be managed with complementary or, at least, similar, therapeutic strategies, each of which lie within the domain of the neurosurgeon."}, {"Title": "Pharmacist-led program to improve venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in a community hospital.", "Abstract": "The implementation of a pharmacist-led program to improve venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is examined.\nNursing and pharmacy leaders at a 278-bed hospital reviewed VTE prophylaxis. The review revealed that among the total patient days for a month (excluding maternity, nursery, pediatric, and psychiatry patient days), prophylaxis was administered on only 19.5% of those days. Pharmacy leadership viewed this as an opportunity to make hospitalwide improvements and offered to develop a pharmacist-led program to assess all new admissions for risk of VTE and to recommend appropriate pharmacologic prophylaxis. Under the new program, a pharmacist receives a daily report of all new admissions, which are cross-referenced with a report including patients currently prescribed heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin.

The pharmacist then places all recommendations in the progress notes of the chart in the form of a bold sticker alerting the physician of known risk factors, VTE risk, and treatment recommendations. The program was developed to be performed seven days a week and maintained by one pharmacist per day for an average of four hours a day. Evaluation of the program three and six months after its implementation revealed marked increases in the use of prophylaxis and associated reductions in the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography.\nA pharmacist-led program for VTE prevention was associated with a significant increase in the prescribing of VTE prophylaxis and a significant reduction in ultrasonographically confirmed DVT."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic use in the elderly: what doctors say they do, and what they do.", "Abstract": "To review psychiatrists' attitudes and actual practice on the use of typical and atypical antipsychotics in the elderly.\nAudit data were collected from 18-old-age psychiatry units across Australia.

In this study we have tried to find out if use of antipsychotics is associated with increase in weight and body mass index (BMI) in the Pakistani population.\nWe performed a case note review of all patients who had been prescribed antipsychotic medication at the psychiatry outpatient clinic of a tertiary care university hospital in Pakistan over a 4-year period.\nA total of 50% of patients had a BMI in the overweight or higher range at baseline. Patients showed a mean weight gain of 1.88 kg from baseline in 3 months and 3.29 kg in 6 months. Both of these values were statistically significant. The increase in mean BMI from baseline was 0.74 and 1.3 in 3 months and 6 months, respectively. In patients for whom we had at least one further weight measurement after baseline, 48% (39/81) showed a clinically significant weight gain.\nPakistani patients are just as likely to put on weight during antipsychotic treatment as patients from other countries. Considering that this population already has a much higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus compared to the Western countries, the consequences of increased weight may be even more serious in terms of increased morbidity and mortality."}, {"Title": "Association of narcolepsy-cataplexy with HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 in Mexican patients: a relationship between HLA and gender is suggested.", "Abstract": "Narcolepsy-cataplexy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness with recurrent episodes of irresistible sleep, cataplexy, hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Its aetiology is unknown, but it is positively associated with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in all studied populations. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association of HLA class II DRB1/DQB1 alleles with narcolepsy-cataplexy in Mexican Mestizo patients.\nThis is a case-control study of consecutive patients and ethnically matched controls. We included 32 patients diagnosed with typical narcolepsy-cataplexy, of the National Institute of Neurology, of the Institute of Psychiatry and at the Center of Narcolepsy at Stanford University. As healthy controls, 203 Mexican Mestizos were included. DRB1 alleles were identified using sequence based typing. A PCR-SSOP reverse dot blot was used for DQB1 typing. Allele frequency was calculated by direct counting and the significance of the differences was assessed using the Yates Chi square. Odds ratio and confidence intervals were evaluated.\nHLA-DRB1*1501 (OR = 8.2; pc < 0.0001) and DQB1*0602 (OR = 8.4; pc < 0.0001) were found positively associated with narcolepsy. When deleting DQB1*0602+ patients from the analysis, DQB1*0301 was also found increased (OR = 2.7; p = 0.035; pc = NS). DQB1*0602/DQB1*0301 genotype was present in 15.6% of the cases (OR = 11.5; p = 0.00035), conferring a high risk. DRB1*0407 (OR = 0.2; p = 0.016 pc = NS) and DQB1*0302(OR = 0.4; p = 0.017, pc = NS) were found decreased in the patients. The gender stratification analysis showed a higher risk in females carrying DRB1*1501 (OR = 15.8, pc < 0.0001) and DQB1*0602 (OR = 19.8, pc < 0.0001) than in males (OR = 5.0 for both alleles; p = 0.012, pc = NS for DRB1 & p = 0.0012, pc = 0.017 for DQB1). The susceptibility alleles found in Mexicans with narcolepsy are also present in Japanese and Caucasians; DRB1*04 linked protection has also been shown in Koreans. A stronger HLA association is suggested in females, in accordance with the sexual dimorphism claimed previously.\nThis knowledge may contribute to a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis in different populations. The evaluation of the risk to develop narcolepsy-cataplexy in carriers of the described alleles/genotypes may also be possible. A larger sample should be analysed in Mexican and in other Hispanic patients to confirm these results."}, {"Title": "Five systems of psychiatric classification for preschool children: do differences in validity, usefulness and reliability make for competitive or complimentary constellations?", "Abstract": "DSM-IV and ICD-10 have limitations in the diagnostic classification of psychiatric disorders at preschool age (0-5 years).

Here, we present a study assessing the factors that influence such transfers.\nWe examined the demographic and clinical backgrounds of a group of patients transferred from internal medicine and surgery to the psychiatric ward over an 11-year period. A comparison was made of this data with data obtained from a group of non-transferred patients, also seen by the same consultation-liaison psychiatry service.\nAccording to our findings, the typical transferred patient, either female or male, is single, divorced or widowed, lives alone, belongs to a lower socioeconomic class, presents initially with (on the whole) a disturbed and disruptive behaviour, has had a recent suicide attempt with persistent suicidal ideas, suffers from a mood disorder (mainly depressive and dysthymic disorders), has a prior psychiatric history as well as a prior psychiatric inpatient treatment, and a positive diagnosis on axis II of the five axis system used for mental health diagnosis.\nThe transfer of a patient to the psychiatric ward is a decision depending on multiple factors. Medical diagnoses do not seem to play a major role in the transfer to the psychiatric ward. From the psychiatric diagnosis, depressive and dysthymic disorders are the most common in the transferred population, whilst the transfer is influenced by social factors regarding the patient, the patient's behaviour, the conditions in the ward she/he is treated in and any recent occurrence(s) that increase the anxiety of the staff."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotics and hyperprolactinaemia: clinical recommendations.", "Abstract": "A group of international experts in psychiatry, medicine, toxicology and pharmacy assembled to undertake a critical examination of the currently available clinical guidance on hyperprolactinaemia.

The model is illustrated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for assessment of schizophrenia symptoms which, like many other metrics in psychiatry, is composed of a sum of scores on several components, each in turn, made up of sums of evaluations on several questions. We simultaneously examine the effects of baseline socio-demographic and co-morbid correlates on all of the components of the total PANSS score of patients from a schizophrenia clinical trial and identify variables associated with increasing or decreasing relative contributions of each component.

Nevertheless, the accompanying downgrading of medical aspects of care has resulted in services that often are better suited to offering non-specific psychosocial support, rather than thorough, broad-based diagnostic assessment leading to specific treatments to optimise well-being and functioning. In part, these changes have been politically driven, but they could not have occurred without the collusion, or at least the acquiescence, of psychiatrists. This creeping devaluation of medicine disadvantages patients and is very damaging to both the standing and the understanding of psychiatry in the minds of the public, fellow professionals and the medical students who will be responsible for the specialty's future.

As CRF expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is important in adaptation to chronic stress, we hypothesized that unrestrained synthesis of CRF in CeA would mimic the consequences of chronic stress exposure and cause dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increase emotionality and disrupt reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we used a lentiviral vector to increase CRF-expression site specifically in CeA of female rats. Increased synthesis of CRF in CeA amplified CRF and arginine vasopressin peptide concentration in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and decreased glucocorticoid negative feedback, both markers associated with the pathophysiology of depression. In addition, continuous expression of CRF in CeA also increased the acoustic startle response and depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. Protein levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the medial preoptic area were significantly reduced by continuous expression of CRF in CeA and this was associated with a lengthening of estrous cycles. Finally, sexual motivation but not sexual receptivity was significantly attenuated by continuous CRF synthesis in ovariectomized estradiol-progesterone-primed females. These data indicate that unrestrained CRF synthesis in CeA produces a dysregulation of the HPA axis, as well as many of the behavioral, physiological and reproductive consequences associated with stress-related disorders.Molecular Psychiatry (2009) 14, 37-50; doi:10.1038/mp.2008.91; published online 12 August 2008."}, {"Title": "Feasibility of randomized controlled trials on seclusion and mechanical restraint.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry seclusion and mechanical restraint are most commonly used in the management of violence and self-directed aggression.

We also review the development of clinical neuropsychiatry in Singapore in the context of historical developments and recent changes in the field from other countries. At a more practical level, we discuss a few of the clinical settings in which neuropsychiatry operates, in particular, the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders locally, and the significant number of patients with psychiatric or psychosomatic symptoms presenting to neurology and general practice clinics. The stigma may be ameliorated by better understanding of the neurobiological basis of psychiatry.

The objective of this study was to analyze features of premorbid and clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and course of bipolar disorder in adolescence. Data for analysis were collected from all case histories (N=6) of 14-18-year-old patients, hospitalized with diagnosis of bipolar disorder in the Unit of Children's and Adolescents' Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Hospital of Kaunas University of Medicine, during the period from 2000 to 2005. Analysis of bipolar disorder course showed that five patients previously had been diagnosed with an episode of depression. The most frequent symptoms typical to bipolar disorder were disobedience and impulsive behavior, rapid changes of mood. The most common premorbid features were frequent changes of mood, being active in communication, hyperactive behavior. Adolescence-onset bipolar disorder was frequently comorbid with emotionally instable personality disorder, borderline type. Findings of the study confirm the notion that oppositional or impulsive behavior, rapid changes of mood without any reason, dysphoric mood and euphoric mood episodes with increased energy were cardinal symptoms of bipolar disorder with mania in adolescents.

A total of 295 patients suffering from schizophrenia participated in this study at Vilnius Mental Health Center in Lithuania, among whom 63.3% reported religious delusions. The most frequent content of religious delusion in women was their belief that they were saints and in men--that they imagined themselves as God. Univariate multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that four factors such as marital status, birthplace, education, and subjective importance of religion were significantly related to the presence of religious delusions. However, multivariate analyses revealed that marital status (divorced/separated vs. married OR (odds ratio)=2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5) and education (postsecondary education vs. no postsecondary education OR=2.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9), but not personal religiosity, were independent predictors of the religious delusions.

Implementation of formal education and training on religious and spiritual issues, however, is lacking. Few psychiatric residencies offer mandatory courses or evaluation of course utility. The authors present findings from a pilot study of a course on the interface between spirituality, religion, and psychiatry. Course objectives were to increase both residents' understanding of clinically relevant spiritual/religious issues and their comfort in addressing these issues in their clinical work.\nA 6-hour mandatory course was implemented for third- and fourth-year psychiatry residents at the University of British Columbia. Teaching sessions consisted of didactic and case-based modules delivered by multidisciplinary faculty. The Course Impact Questionnaire, a 20-item Likert scale, was used to assess six areas: personal spiritual attitudes, professional practice attitudes, transpersonal psychiatry, competency, attitude change toward religion and spirituality, and change in practice patterns. A pre/post study design was used with the questionnaire being administered at week 0, week 6, and 6 months follow-up to two groups of residents (N=30).

Higher PAID scores significantly predicted lower levels of diet, exercise and medication adherence (all p values <0.05). However, once depression symptom scores were entered into these models, most relationships were reduced to non-significance, while the HANDS score retained significant relationships with most indices of diabetes self-care. The same pattern of results was found in the subset of patients who did not screen positive for MDD.\nThese results suggest that specific symptoms of depression have a greater negative relationship with diabetes self-care than diabetes-specific distress, even among those patients who do not meet screening criteria for MDD.

One major problem is the lack of valid definitions in adult and in child psychiatry; the current definitions are unsatisfactory, and heavily favor an overdiagnosis of MDD. Biological research is partially based on those definitions, which have a short half-life. An additional, dimensional, approach, quantifying hypomania, depression, and anxiety by self-assessment and symptom checklists is recommended.

Respondents included 271 addiction specialists (72% response rate) and 224 psychiatrists who were not listed as addiction specialists but who had patients with addictions in their practice (57% response rate).\nThree years after approval of buprenorphine for office-based addiction treatment, nearly 90% of addiction specialists had been approved to prescribe it and two-thirds treated patients with buprenorphine. However, fewer than 10% of non-addiction specialist psychiatrists prescribed it. Regression-adjusted factors predicting prescribing of buprenorphine included support of training and use of buprenorphine by the physician's main affiliated organization, less time in general psychiatry compared with addictions treatment, more time in group practice rather than solo, ten or more opiate-dependent patients, belief that drugs play a large role in addiction treatment, and patient demand.\nOffice-based pharmacotherapy offers a promising path to improved access to addictions treatment, but prescribing has expanded little beyond the addiction specialist community."}, {"Title": "[Contributions of professor Xue Chong-cheng in acupuncture and neuropsychiatry].", "Abstract": "Professor Xue Chong-cheng devotes himself in clinical and research of integrative works of TCM, acupuncture, neuropsychiatry, neurosurgery and medicopsychology for more than 70 years.

Autism is one example for the influence of the psychoanalytic school of Sigmund Freud on scientific psychiatry at the beginning of the 20th century. In particular psychoanalysis had an impact on Eugen Bleuler's concept of schizophrenia. The Swiss psychiatrist did not only acknowledge and follow a biological, but also a psychological approach to psychiatry and thus opened up his subject to psychoanalytic thoughts. This paper provides insights into the term's conceptual history--or, more specifically and precisely--sheds light on the expansion of the term's scope, which has gotten to be used for more and more symptoms and phenomena. When Bleuler first presented the term autism, he used it to refer to a classical schizophrenic symptom. Since, however, Bleuler was not very specific and exclusive in his definition, the term was soon used for other phenomena as well, such as to describe a schizoid symptom in the sense of today's schizoid personality disorder (schizoid autism). The concepts of autistic hebephrenia and depressive autism are further examples how the term was used and give insight into how the contents behind the term changed, got less and less specific and widened its scope. Due to its growing vagueness its suitability and usability as a psychopathological term decreased. This process further was strengthened when the word autism got more and more widely used in colloquial language for different aspects of day-to-day routine and thinking. Thus in psychiatry today, autism is exclusively used in connection with the so-called autism spectrum disorders, but has, as other formerly exclusively technical terms, different and rather unspecific meanings in everyday communication."}, {"Title": "[E-learning about dementia: a randomized study].", "Abstract": "Curricular medical training on dementia at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Erlangen comprises of a traditional lecture.

Anxiety symptom ratings were tracked using weekly psychiatric status ratings (PSRs). Controlling for demographic and clinical variables, the course of PD, GAD and SP were examined using longitudinal growth models, with the most severe PSR at each follow-up point as the main outcome variable.\nPSRs significantly decreased in severity over time in each of the three disorders. In the interaction effects models, age x time had a significant effect on course for PD and GAD, but not for SP, in that older age was associated with lower PSRs over time.\nThe present findings suggest that the severity of anxiety disorders declines over time, although this decline is modest and depends on the specific disorder being assessed. Older individuals with PD and GAD have a better prognosis than their younger counterparts, as their course is characterized by a steeper decline in severity.

Papers on 'coercion and the law' identified cross-national differences of legal regulations, or addressed justice and equality issues. Studies on the 'patient's perspective', and 'family burden of coercion' showed that involuntariness is associated with feeling excluded from participation in the treatment. A review on 'outpatient commitment' recommended the evaluation of a range of outcomes if this specific legislation is introduced. 'Coercion in special (healthcare) settings and patient subgroups' needs to be assessed in detail. This refers to somatic hospitals, establishments for mentally retarded patients, prisons, forensic settings, and coercion mechanisms for addiction treatment, eating disorders, and minors. Empirical findings in other areas focused on attitudes towards involuntary treatment; decision variables for involuntary commitment; guidelines on the use of coercive measures; and intervention programs for staff victims of patient assaults.\nCoercion in psychiatry is an important area for future clinical and research initiatives. Because of the linkages with legal, human rights and ethical issues, a huge number of individual questions needs to be addressed."}, {"Title": "A visual metaphor describing neural dynamics in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "In many scientific disciplines the use of a metaphor as an heuristic aid is not uncommon. A well known example in somatic medicine is the 'defense army metaphor' used to characterize the immune system. In fact, probably a large part of the everyday work of doctors consists of 'translating' scientific and clinical information (i.e. causes of disease, percentage of success versus risk of side-effects) into information tailored to the needs and capacities of the individual patient. The ability to do so in an effective way is at least partly what makes a clinician a good communicator. Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder which affects approximately 1% of the population. Over the last two decades a large amount of molecular-biological, imaging and genetic data have been accumulated regarding the biological underpinnings of schizophrenia. However, it remains difficult to understand how the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations and delusions are related to disturbances on the molecular-biological level. In general, psychiatry seems to lack a conceptual framework with sufficient explanatory power to link the mental- and molecular-biological domains.\nHere, we present an essay-like study in which we propose to use visualized concepts stemming from the theory on dynamical complex systems as a 'visual metaphor' to bridge the mental- and molecular-biological domains in schizophrenia. We first describe a computer model of neural information processing; we show how the information processing in this model can be visualized, using concepts from the theory on complex systems. We then describe two computer models which have been used to investigate the primary theory on schizophrenia, the neurodevelopmental model, and show how disturbed information processing in these two computer models can be presented in terms of the visual metaphor previously described. Finally, we describe the effects of dopamine neuromodulation, of which disturbances have been frequently described in schizophrenia, in terms of the same visualized metaphor.\nThe conceptual framework and metaphor described offers a heuristic tool to understand the relationship between the mental- and molecular-biological domains in an intuitive way. The concepts we present may serve to facilitate communication between researchers, clinicians and patients."}, {"Title": "A postmenopausal woman presenting with Ekbom syndrome associated with recurrent depressive disorder: a case report.", "Abstract": "Ekbom syndrome is a rare psychiatric disorder that can manifest as a delusion, overvalued idea or hallucination of parasitic infestations.

The patient presented with tactile hallucinations of insects crawling just under her skin. These hallucinations resolved with Mirtazepine and electroconvulsive therapy treatment in the absence of an antipsychotic pharmacological agent.\nThis case report highlights the presence of a rare psychiatric presentation of Ekbom syndrome within the context of depression. The majority of such cases will not be seen by psychiatrists but by dermatologists. Therefore collaborative consultations between dermatologists and psychiatrists of patients presenting with symptoms of Ekbom are essential for the identification and management of such cases.

This restrictive interpretation fails to do justice to the theory that psychopathology has a multitude of causes.

Edmund Forster, his psychiatrist at that time, is supposed to have suggested to Hitler that he would be ordained as Germany's redeemer in times of defeat, thus causing a profound change in his patient's personality.\nFollowing three lines of argument, this paper examines if such an assumption can be made plausible. Firstly, it takes a close look at the main historical source which is the novel THE EYEWITNESS, written in German language by the Czech-Jewish author Ernst Weiss. Then it asks if Forster is likely to have chosen hypnosis as a method of treatment. Finally, it exploits the work of the even lesser known author Alexander Moritz Frey who happened to serve close to Hitler as a medical orderly in WW I, thus trying to validate whether or not Hitler really underwent a change of personality in autumn 1918.\nAlthough the eventualities of such a hypnotic treatment or a profound change in Hitler's behaviour in that time cannot be disproved, both seem highly unlikely.\nS One should altogether abandon the notion of Hitler having suffered a permanent change of personality in 1918, be it due to psychiatric treatment or to psychological trauma itself."}, {"Title": "Family practice: professional identity in transition. A case study of family medicine in Canada.", "Abstract": "With increasingly fewer family physicians in many countries and students less interested in primary care careers, generalists are becoming an endangered species. This situation is a major health care resource management challenge. In a rapidly changing health care environment, family medicine is struggling for a clear identity -- a matter which is crucial to health system restructuring because it affects the roles and functioning of other professions in the system. The objective of our study was to explore representations of roles and responsibilities of family physicians held by future family and specialist physicians and their clinical teachers in four Canadian medical school faculties of medicine, using both focus groups and individual interviews. In addition to family medicine, we targeted residency programs in general psychiatry, radiology and internal medicine -- three areas that interface significantly between primary care and specialized medicine. In each faculty, respondents included the vice-dean of postgraduate studies; the director of each relevant program; educators in the program; residents in each specialty in their last year of training. Findings are centred around three major themes: (1) the definition of family medicine; (2) family medicine as an endangered species, and (3) the generation gap between young family physicians and their educators. The sustained physician-patient relationship is considered a core characteristic of family medicine that is much valued by patients and physicians -- both generalists and specialists -- as something to be preserved in any model of collaboration to be developed. Overall, two divergent directions emerge: preserving all the professions' traditional functions while adapting to changing contexts, or concentrating on areas of expertise and moving towards creating \"specialist\" general practitioners, in response to a rapidly expanding scope of practice, and to the high value attributed to specialization by society and the professional system."}, {"Title": "Oxidative imbalance in adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "There are few studies evaluating the biochemical basis of adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (A-ADHD).

To explore the perspectives of mental health professionals and patients on self-injurious behavior and treatment, the authors carried out a literature review. The reviewers found little documented data that elucidated or discussed any shared understanding about self-injurious behavior between patients and professionals or between professionals themselves. Many of the problems experienced in relation to self-injury may be due to this lack of a common view.

The coercive intervention of seclusion is often used to manage patient aggression in the Netherlands. However, GGZ Nederland, the Dutch association of service providers for mental health and addition care, has initiated a project to decrease the number of seclusions in clinical psychiatry. A first step in this project is to gain insight into the current situation: the perceived prevalence of patient aggression, the attitudes of mental health nurses towards patient aggression and those socio-demographic and psychosocial factors that contribute to the use of coercive interventions. A survey was undertaken among 113 nurses from six closed and semi-closed wards. In this survey, two questionnaires were used: (1) the Attitude Toward Aggression Scale; and (2) the Perceptions of the Prevalence of Aggression Scale. Variables derived from the Theory of Planned Behaviour were also measured. Nurses reported being regularly confronted with aggression in general and mostly with non-threatening verbal aggression. They perceived patient aggression as being destructive or offensive and not serving a protective or communicative function. The nurses generally perceived themselves as having control over patient behaviour (i.e. considerable self-efficacy) and reported considerable social support from colleagues. Although the nurses in this study were frequently confronted with aggression, they did not experience the aggression as a major problem."}, {"Title": "A prospective study of patients absconding from a general hospital psychiatry unit in a developing country.", "Abstract": "Characteristics of patients absconding from an open psychiatry ward in a developing country may be different from both those in developed countries and a mental hospital setting.

The cost categories were inpatient and outpatient costs, and costs for psychopharmacological drugs. Two consecutive years, 2001 and 2002, were chosen as the study period.\nThe study included all costs for admissions, visits and prescribed drugs for adults aged > or = 18 years in 2001 and 2002 in Sweden. These costs were aggregated and analysed at the county level. A multiple linear regression analysis was fitted to the data, and independent variables (i.e. predictors) were chosen on the basis of previous studies. All cost types (e.g. total, inpatient, outpatient and drug costs) were analysed separately in different models.\nLarge variations in total direct psychiatric costs were found between county councils (for example, the total costs varied between euro112 and euro195 per capita in 2001). The results indicate that psychiatric outpatient care is less utilized in rural than in urban areas, and drugs are more often prescribed in rural areas than in urban areas. Areas with a high proportion of women and people aged 65 years and over are strong predictors of mental healthcare costs, i.e. variables showing that the higher the proportion, the lower the direct costs.\nFactors such as urbanization, gender, age and number of immigrants are reasons for differences in psychiatric direct costs. On the basis of these findings, it seems plausible to conclude that women, older patients and immigrants may benefit from specialized psychiatry, but that such healthcare does not seem to be provided in all regions."}, {"Title": "Establishing non-inferiority in treatment trials in psychiatry: guidelines from an Expert Consensus Meeting.", "Abstract": "Comparing the efficacy of different treatments in psychiatry is difficult for many reasons, even when they are investigated in \"head-to-head\" studies.

While this has greatly advanced the knowledge base, any account of schizophrenia without a full consideration of the illness's first-person dimensions risks missing that schizophrenia is a disorder that interrupts the lives of people who must continue to struggle to find and create security and meaning. While literature from a range of sources has explored self-experience in schizophrenia, one barrier to the creation of a larger synthesis and application of this work is that it remains unclear whether, and to what degree, these differing views of self-experience are comparable with one another. To address this issue, this article reviews 6 different accounts of self-experience, a fundamental, first-person dimension of schizophrenia. The 6 are early psychiatry, existential psychiatry, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, psychosocial rehabilitation, and dialogical psychology. After comparing and contrasting the 6, we conclude that there is a wide-ranging, if general consensus, which suggests that many suffering from schizophrenia experience themselves as diminished relative to their former selves, ie, after onset they experience themselves as less able to engage the world effectively, which intensifies their anxieties in the face of everyday interactions. However, within this broad consensus, significant disagreements exist around issues such as whether these difficulties meaningfully predate the illness, how recovery is possible, and if so, under what conditions. In closing, we suggest a program of research to address these disagreements."}, {"Title": "Medicalizing mental health: a phenomenological alternative.", "Abstract": "With the increasingly close relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) there has been a growing tendency in the mental health professions to interpret everyday emotional suffering and behavior as a medical condition that can be treated with a particular drug. In this paper, I suggest that hermeneutic phenomenology is uniquely suited to challenge the core assumptions of medicalization by expanding psychiatry's narrow conception of the self as an enclosed, biological individual and recognizing the ways in which our experience of things--including mental illness--is shaped by the socio-historical situation in which we grow. Informed by hermeneutic phenomenology, psychiatry's first priority is to suspend the prejudices that come with being a medical doctor in order to hear what the patient is saying. To this end, psychiatry can begin to understand the patient not as a static, material body with a clearly defined brain dysfunction but as an unfolding, situated existence already involved in an irreducibly complex social world, an involvement that allows the patient to experience, feel, and make sense of their emotional suffering."}, {"Title": "Effect of a behavioural health and specialty care telemedicine programme on goal attainment for youths in juvenile detention.", "Abstract": "We conducted a pre-post study of the effect of a telepsychiatry counselling service on youths housed in three juvenile detention facilities.

Because of several factors including decreased morbidity from donor surgery, online resources appealing for organs, and increased publicity about donation, new populations of unrelated donors are seeking evaluation for donor surgery. However, concern about potential coercion of vulnerable individuals, the potential for adverse psychosocial outcomes, and recent reports of donor deaths have reinvigorated discussion within the medical community about how best to assess donors. Research on the long-term quality of life outcomes for donors suggests that most donors are satisfied with their decision to donate. Small single-center studies on psychosocial outcomes have reported psychiatric sequelae after donor surgery. Little is known about the psychosocial outcomes for donors who are psychosocially excluded from donating. A multidisciplinary team approach, including social work and psychiatry evaluations, allows for the comprehensive assessment of important areas including motivation and expectations about surgery, current and past psychiatric conditions, history of substance or alcohol abuse, family support, understanding of the risks and alternatives of donor surgery for the donor and recipient, and motivation for donation including any evidence of coercion."}, {"Title": "Methodological structure for aggression research.", "Abstract": "Kendler's seminal essay listed 8 major propositions outlining a philosophical framework for the entire field of psychiatry [Kendler (American Journal of Psychiatry 162:433-440, 2005)].

At that time little was known about the science of addiction, so our program from the very beginning was designed to gather data about the nature of addiction and measure the effects of available treatments. In other words, the goals were always a combination of treatment and research. This combination has continued to the present day. A human laboratory for the study of addiction phenomena such as conditioned responses was also founded in 1971. The key clinician investigators in this group have remained in the Center since the 1970s with most of the research staff continuing to work together. Important new investigators have been added over the years. Treatment was empirically based with randomized, controlled clinical trials as the gold standard for determining evidence-based treatment. The patients coming to treatment do not distinguish between abuse of alcohol and other drugs, so the treatment and research programs have always focused on all drugs including ethyl alcohol and the combination of ethyl alcohol with other drugs such as cocaine and opioids. Most of the patients coming for treatment also suffered from additional psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Thus, the addiction treatment program in 1980 absorbed the rest of the VA Psychiatry Service into the Substance Abuse Program forming a new Behavioral Health Service with responsibility for over 9000 patients. The integration of substance abuse treatment with overall mental health care was the most efficient way to handle patients with complicated combinations of disorders. While this continues to be the best way to treat patients, it has proven difficult in practice. The main reason for this difficulty is that most mental health therapists whether they are psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers feel very inadequate to handle substance abuse problems. Unless they have had specialized training in addictive disorders, therapists are likely to be uncomfortable if substance abuse is one of the diagnoses while they may be quite comfortable treating other complex disorders such as schizophrenia. This lack of education of clinicians remains a major problem for our field.

In a clinical study, the usefulness of the combination of the V.A.C. and implantable Doppler probe was critically evaluated in patients with microsurgical lower extremity reconstruction. We retrospectively analyzed the usefulness of the implantable Doppler probe in five consecutive patients treated in our department from January to July 2007. Inclusion criteria were lower extremity reconstruction by means of skin-grafted free tissue transfers with subsequent application of the V.A.C. device. Five consecutive patients (four males, one female) with a mean age of 37.8 years (range, 8-58 years) matched the criteria mentioned above. Of note, the two pediatric patients (8-year-old male and 12-year-old female) suffered from significant posttraumatic stress disorder necessitating concomitant psychological care by the Department of Psychiatry. All flaps healed uneventfully displaying no signs of vascular compromise. Interpretation of the Doppler signal was simple and well received by the nursing staff. The combination of V.A.C. and the implantable Doppler probe enhances patient comfort due to a reduction of the number of dressing changes while still allowing continuous free flap monitoring.

It is less clear whether such problems follow a particular pattern in such patients.\nTo examine the utility of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) among offenders, to test whether externalizing behaviour problems, as measured by the CBCL, are more frequent in psychotic offenders than in non-offenders with psychosis, and to investigate relationships between early behavioural problems and adult personality disorder in psychotic offenders.\nThree groups of violent offenders detained under the Dutch Entrustment Act (TBS-detainees)(n = 78) and one group of psychotic patients in general psychiatry (n = 16) were rated from case records on the CBCL.\nThere was a significant difference between psychotic offenders with a personality disorder (n = 25) and the non-offender patients with psychosis (n = 16) on the 'delinquent behavior' scale, but no such difference between psychotic offenders with (n = 25) and without (n = 21) personality disorder. A hierarchic cluster analysis revealed significantly higher scores for externalizing behaviour in all TBS-detainees with a personality disorder. Those starting to offend early had higher scores for externalizing behaviour than late starters.\nPsychotic and non-psychotic offenders with personality disorder resemble one another in their early childhood behaviour problems; psychotic offenders without a personality disorder differ from these two groups but resemble non-offenders with psychosis. In contrast to findings in non-forensic populations, there were no differences on other problem scales of the CBCL. Given the small sample sizes, replication is needed, but the findings lend weight to treatment models which focus on the psychosis in the latter two groups but extend also to personality disorder in the former."}, {"Title": "Nicotine and alcohol use in adolescent psychiatric inpatients: associations with diagnoses, psychosocial factors, gender and age.", "Abstract": "The aim of the survey was to describe the proportion of smokers and alcohol users in a group of children and adolescents admitted to a German department of child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy. In addition, the proportion of smokers in this group of patients was compared with the proportion in the general population of the same age. The sample was composed of all children and adolescent inpatients (n=432, 8-17 years old meeting inclusion criteria) admitted to a German department of child and adolescent psychiatry between May 2001 and June 2003. A shortened adaptation of the questionnaire on legal and illegal drug use, developed by the Swiss Professional Service for Alcohol Problems, Lausanne, was used. Initiation, frequency and quantity of drug use, and parental substance use were assessed. The results showed an association between conduct disorder (CD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an early initiation of nicotine and alcohol use. Girls and boys with CD and ADHD were significantly more likely to be involved in higher levels of nicotine use compared with the general population. Parental nicotine use was associated with smoking in girls, while maternal nicotine use was associated with smoking in boys. Furthermore, regular alcohol use in both girls and boys was associated with nicotine use. To conclude, early initiation and elevated rates of nicotine and alcohol use are a particular risk for adolescents with CD and ADHD."}, {"Title": "Expensive detour or a way forward?

Historical, social and political factors contribute to the elevated rates of mental distress and disorder experienced by many Aboriginal young people. However, these young people often do not receive the help they need. Knowledge, skills and attitudes of clinicians are associated with the uptake of services. Therefore, a training course for clinicians was developed utilizing a detailed consultation process with Aboriginal stakeholders.\nThe course was delivered as part of an ongoing comprehensive interagency training program for 2000 clinicians. The course was positively evaluated by participants and stakeholders, suggesting that the course development, including the consultation process with Aboriginal stakeholders, was effective in meeting participant and stakeholder needs.

The study included 100 adult patients hospitalized in Geneva, Switzerland.\nPatients were in majority male (63%), originated from Switzerland (54%) and spoke the local language fluently (93%). They took on the average 3 different psychotropic drugs. Sixty-eight percent of patients expected side effects and 60% were ready to stop medication because of them. Thirty percent of patients expected negative personal changes with treatment and 34% thought that their mental disorder could have been treated without drugs. Thirty six percent of the sample used alternative or complementary medicines. 35% of immigrant patients believed that medication had different effects on them than on local patients. When compared with Swiss patients, they more often reported that significant others had an opinion about medication (p = 0.041) and more frequently valued information provided by other patients about treatment (p = 0.010).\nPatients' attitudes toward medication should be investigated in clinical practice, as specific expectations and prejudice exist.

The B-APP theory refers to the following paradigms: 1) the individual represents a psychosomatic unity integrated in the social context; 2) the individual needs to build and regulate the image of the self; 3) bond patterns regulate human relationships and represent the symbolic ''fil rouge'' connecting the elements of the life-style. Its objectives are: 1) an at least partial resolution of the focus problem; 2) a decrease or a non-increase of symptoms; 3) a global increase of quality of life. The results depend on intrapsychic and relational changes. Indications are more relative than absolute. The possibility of identifying a meaningful focus is fundamental. The treatment scheme includes 15 sessions subdivided into 5 phases. B-APP offers a technical approach to brief psychotherapy which is suitable in many fields of psychiatry and liaison medicine such as preventive interventions in at-risk subjects, somatopsychic disorders and liaison psychiatry, personality and eating disorders, and treatment of emotionally disturbed children.

Furthermore, little is known about whether depression and HRV share common genetic pathways.\nWe performed power spectral analysis on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiograms in 288 middle-aged male twins. Log-normalized ultra low, very low, low, high frequency, and total power were calculated. A lifetime history of major depressive disorder (MDD) was determined, using the Structured Clinical Interview for Psychiatry Disorders, and current depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. Mixed-effect regression models were used to account for intrapair variability and estimate within-pair effects at the same time controlling for potential confounders.\nBoth current depressive symptoms and a history of MDD were significantly associated with lower HRV. There was a graded effect, and power in each frequency band was 29% to 36% lower in the lowest band compared with the highest BDI category. All HRV measures except high frequency remained significantly associated with current depressive symptoms in multivariable analysis, but not with lifetime history of MDD. When analyses were stratified by zygosity, a significant within-pair association between BDI score and HRV was found in the dizygotic but not in the monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic influence on the association.\nA shared, genetically influenced biological pathway underlies the association between depression and lower HRV.

Mental pathology, he presumed, is subdividable in discrete entities each based on a specific pathophysiology. Kraepelin provided the diagnostic process in psychiatry with a solid infrastructure. It has been used in biological psychiatric research until this very day. Searching for the biological determinants of categorical entities has been its major goal. The yield of those efforts has been meagre, in that none of the biological findings reported so far seemed to be specific for a particular nosological entity. The question thus arises: is nosology the right model to classify mental disorders. It is suggested that it is not. The disease categories presently delineated are utterly heterogeneous, and therefore cannot be expected to have a well-defined pathophysiology. The nosological system cannot be rejected (as yet), but it has to be upgraded by incorporation of a strong dynamic-functional component. The functional components should become the focus of biological psychiatric research. The question whether an alternative classificatory model, such as the reaction form model, has to be preferred in biological psychiatry should become a matter of serious discussion."}, {"Title": "Multifactorial inheritance, rates of maturation and psychiatry's taxonomic dilemma: on Saugstad's \"radical proposition\" for two extremes of brain function and structure.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews aspects of Letten F. Saugstad's Maturation Theory in relation to the Kraepelinian dichotomy and psychiatric classification. The maturation theory is based on existing neuroscience, cross-national and mental health case register data and offers an innovative alternative to current etiological formulations. The maturational theory holds (1) that manic depressive illness relates to early maturation and (2) the schizophrenic syndrome relates to late maturation. The foundation of these processes lies in cerebral pruning of excitatory synapses particularly at puberty but also at a number of earlier crucial periods in development. The process of synaptic pruning has by puberty eliminated some 40% of the synapses, leading to the disappearance of glutematergic excitatory synapses without apparently appreciably influencing inhibitory GABAergic neurons. As a consequence, early maturation is related to the manic-depressive syndrome and characterized by increased neural excitability. Conversely, late maturation is related to schizophrenia characterized by diminished neural activity. Saugstad demonstrates using cross-national and neuroscience studies the multifactoral and environmental influences on rates of maturation and thereby mental illness. Using these data Saugstad reasons her agreement with the Kraepelinian dichotomy based on the existence of two extremes in brain structure and function developed through interactions between the person and the environment."}, {"Title": "Historical overview: Kraepelin's impact on psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper reviews the importance Emil Kraepelin put on disease course as a classificatory principle.

In recent years, however, there have been a number of critical remarks on his acceptance of degeneration theory in particular and on his political opinion in general, which was said to have carried \"overtones of proto-fascism\" by Michael Shepherd [28]. The present paper discusses the theoretical cornerstones of Kraepelinian psychiatry with regard to their relevance for Kraepelin's attitude towards degeneration theory. This theory had gained wide influence not only in scientific, but also in philosophical and political circles in the last decades of the nineteenth century. There is no doubt that Kraepelin, on the one hand, accepted and implemented degeneration theory into the debate on etiology and pathogenesis of mental disorders.

The ICD-10 and DSM-IV classification is based on the dichotomy of endogenous psychoses into affective psychoses and schizophrenia as early as 1899. Moreover, beside his classification system he put enormous impact on the development of psychiatry to an empirical field of science. The research activities of Kraepelin and his coworkers show that he was not only the most active researcher in the field of psychiatry in his time but also that his research activities included a lot of clinical and experimental work in different disciplines of psychiatry, including psychology, pharmacology and natural sciences as 'Hilfswissenschaften'. Due to his extraordinary position also in his time he brought together important researchers of this time, in particular after the foundation of a psychiatric research institute. Alois Alzheimer, Franz Nissl, Robert Gaupp, or Korbinian Brodman are only a few of his well known coworkers. Kraepelin tried to bring foreward the empirical knowledge in psychiatry, he did not want to have cessation in psychiatry in general and in the classification of psychiatric disorders in particular. He discussed and partly revisted his view and his theoretical approach in the different editions of his textbook according to the state of his empirical knowledge. This is also true for the dichotomy. More than twenty years after the 6th edition of his textbook, he wrote in an essay 'Die Erscheinungsformen des Irreseins' ('The manifestations of insanity') regarding the dichotomy: \"No experienced diagnostician would deny that cases where it seems impossible to arrive to a clear decision, despite extremely careful observation, are unpleasantly frequent.\" and \"....therefore, the increasingly obvious impossibility to separate the two respective illnesses satisfactorily should raise the suspicion that our question is wrong\". This contribution shows that Kraepelin himself questioned his dichotomy of dementia praecox and manic depressive insanity, a discussion which is lively still today--more than 80 years later."}, {"Title": "Psychopathology and causal explanation in practice. A critical note on Heidegger's Zollikon Seminars.", "Abstract": "From 1959 until 1969, Heidegger lectured to psychiatrists and psychiatry students at the University of Zurich Psychiatric Clinic and in Zollikon. The transcriptions of these lectures were published as the Zollikon Seminars. In these seminars Heidegger is highly critical of psychoanalysis, because of its causal and objectifying approach to the human being. In general, Heidegger considers it an objectification or even an elimination of the human being to approach a patient from a causal perspective. In our view Heidegger has overlooked the peculiar nature and complexity of psychotherapy and psychiatry, namely that psychiatry is not just a discipline that combines a hermeneutical approach and a natural science approach on a theoretical level, but it also deals with psychopathology in practice. We argue, also referring to Strawson and Gadamer, that in psychiatric practice causal explanation and hermeneutic understanding are no mutually exclusive approaches. We conclude that the encounter of philosophy and psychiatry in matters of causality and motivation could be particularly fruitful when the practical situation is addressed, recognizing the special character of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "[The hard problem of conciousness and the clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The present paper reviews what in the specialized literature has been called the \"easy problem\" and the \"hard problem\" of consciousness.

Traditional family, twin, and adoption studies show that child and adolescent psychiatric disorders are familial and genetically influenced. Genes and environment contribute to all disorders. Genetic factors seem especially important for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Twin and adoption study designs are now being used to examine gene-environment interplay, the effects of environmental risk factors, co-morbidity, phenotype definition, and developmental change. Molecular genetic strategies are increasingly being adopted to identify gene variants that increase risk of specific disorders. The ways in which specific gene variants exert risk effects at cellular and biological system levels are proving to be highly complex. There is also interest in examining the brain mechanisms that may be involved in risk pathways that link gene variant to psychopathology. Finally, molecular genetic studies also highlight the importance of gene-environment interplay, which seems to be especially important in depression and antisocial behaviour."}, {"Title": "[Necessity and conditions of individual psychotherapy application in a child psychiatric / psychiatric inpatient unit].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric care, and especially child psychiatry, is influenced by the modern rational way of economic thinking and the quality of its services is threatened by the demand for greater \"productivity\".

Several health care systems have initiated major service overhauls on the basis of published evidence. Yet this evidence has been ambiguous and supports differing interpretations. Research is examined which explores the differences in outcomes reported. It uses a range of approaches, most prominently meta-regression, to test a small range of hypotheses to explain the heterogeneity in outcomes. The main determinant of differences between ACT and CM studies is the local bed management procedures and occupancy practice. Those organizational aspects of ACT which are generally shared by CM teams are associated with reduced hospital care but the stringent staffing proposed for ACT does not affect it. ACT is a specialized form of CM, not a categorically different approach. The benefits of introducing it will depend on the nature of current local practice. Important lessons about the need to focus on treatments rather than structures seem not to have been learnt.

Spouses were associated with lower carer strain scores. Patient diagnoses did not affect carer depression or carer strain.\nWe found high levels of depression in the primary carers of community-dwelling patients attending an old age psychiatric service. The patients' behavior and their cognitive and functional ability conferred greater risk of carer depression or strain than their diagnosis.

His remarks have proven a useful goad to the field, focusing attention on the importance of an ethics framework for forensic practice. But Stone remains dubious that any system of ethics--including the \"Standard Position\" on which he focuses his critique--could be of much value in practice. In contrast, I suggest that Stone's pessimism is not well founded. Immanent in forensic practice itself is a reasonable set of ethics principles, based on truth-telling and respect for persons. Psychiatrists can offer reliable and valid testimony, while resisting seduction into an advocacy role. Indeed, with new structured approaches to assessment, the potential utility of forensic testimony is probably greater than ever.

The plants' indications were selected according to the PDR for Herbal Medicines. As a bibliometric indicator of the production, Price's Law was applied. Another indicator included was the national participation index (PI) for overall scientific production. A total of 21,409 original documents were obtained.

A recent meta-analysis has estimated TRD to be as high as 40%. Just over a decade ago, TRD was estimated to be as low as 10% to 15%. The causes of TRD are not fully understood. Finding ways to bring patients to remission faster may be part of the solution, but increasing our understanding of how depression works and how the brain responds to treatment may shed some light on this growing problem. Patients with TRD have been shown to have decreased volumes in gray matter structures, particularly in the hippocampus. Hippocampal volumes are correlated with decreased expression of neurotrophic factors (most notably, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]), and decreased expression of BDNF correlates with the presence of depression. Increased expression of BDNF has a strong association with increased volumes in the hippocampus. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a safe and effective treatment of severe depression, has been shown to be effective in TRD. Patients who undergo ECT have also had measurable increases in BDNF, indicating that ECT may be modulating intracellular processes in the patients with depression.

Narcological practice is in turn constrained by the State. The emergence of widespread injection opiate use and associated HIV morbidities and mortalities during the first decade following the collapse of the Soviet Union has brought the contradictions in Russian narcological discourse into high relief. Narcology officials in the Russian Federation have consistently opposed substitution treatment for opiate dependence--the replacement of a short-acting illegal substance with a longer acting prescribed drug with similar pharmacological action but lower degree of risk. Thus, despite the addition of methadone and buprenorphine to WHO's list of essential medicines in 2005 and multiple position papers by international experts calling for substitution treatment as a critical element in the response to HIV (IOM, 2006; UNODC, UNAIDS, and WHO, 2005), methadone or buprenorphine remain prohibited by law in Russia. The authors detail Russian opposition to the prescription of methadone and buprenorphine, describing four phenomena: (1) the dominance of law enforcement and drug control policy over public health and medical ethics; (2) the conflation of Soviet era alcoholism treatment with treatment for opiate dependence; (3) the near universal representation of detoxification from drugs as treatment for dependence; and (4) a framework for judging treatment efficacy that is restricted to \"cure\" versus \"failure to cure,\" and does not admit its poor outcomes or recognize alternative frameworks for gauging treatment of opiate dependence. In keeping with this position, Russian narcology officials have taken an implacable ideological stance toward illicit drug use, the people who use drugs, and their treatment. By adopting policies and practices totally unsupported by scientific evidence and inquiry, officials in Russia have rendered narcology (and medical practice) insensitive to the alarming rates and continued spread of HIV, with its dire morbidity and mortality rates in the Russian Federation, turning their backs on all the other health problems posed by opiate use and dependence itself."}, {"Title": "The eugenic legacy in psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Assumptions about genetic differences in human mental characteristics can be traced in large part to the eugenic movement, ascendant at the turn of the 20th century.\nThis paper offers historical case studies, of 'innate general cognitive ability' and 'psychiatric genetics', in order to appraise the eugenic legacy in current psychology and psychiatry.\nReviewing the work of representatives, Cyril Burt, Franz Kallmann and Eliot Slater, along with their research networks, it is argued that eugenics remains a quiet but powerful background influence in modern-day psychology and psychiatry.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, eugenics remains an important area of inquiry, reflection and education for those in the inter-disciplinary field of social psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A neural model of voluntary and automatic emotion regulation: implications for understanding the pathophysiology and neurodevelopment of bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "The ability to regulate emotions is an important part of adaptive functioning in society.

We then use this model as a theoretical framework to examine functional neural abnormalities in these neural systems that may predispose to the development of a major psychiatric disorder characterized by severe emotion dysregulation, bipolar disorder."}, {"Title": "[Psychopathology of schizophrenia and brain imaging].", "Abstract": "While in the midth the 19th century Griesinger and 80 years later Mayer-Gross regarded schizophrenia as a brain disease, a far-reaching change in the view of schizophrenia found expression in the review of Manfred Bleuler in 1951: All classical assumptions of the schizophrenia doctrine and especially, that schizophrenia could be classified a somatically conditioned illness and not psychogenic, would be, as he wrote, shaken severely. On the 1st International Meeting of Neuropathology in Rome (1952) the opinion became generally accepted that pathological changes of the brain could not be expected in schizophrenias. The neuropathological research into psychoses, considered as unfruitful, has been practically stopped. The World Congress of Z\u00fcrich \"The group of schizophrenias\" has summarized through Walter Schulte that schizophrenia must be understood as a \"riddle of the human being\", unapproachable for the methods of scientific medicine. In contrary to the main trends of psychiatry of that time, we were convinced that schizophrenias have a pathological-somatic basis and considered the search for empirical indications of the somatosis hypothesis an aim of research having priority. Thus, we tried to associate findings gained with the available somatic methods (neurohistopathology, neuroradiology, neurophysiology, neuropsychology, neurochemistry) with clinical syndromes and course of the disorder. These investigations, directed to psychopathological-somatic correlations went already since the monograph of 1957 hand in hand with the gradual development of the basic symptom concept (BSC) and of the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic symptoms (BSABS) and with our long-term course- and early recognition research. I originated with three observations, made at the Heidelberg Clinic of Kurt Schneider, (1.) the cenesthetic schizophrenia; (2.) the asthenic pure defect and (3.) lethal catatonias, patients who were diagnosed clinically as idiopathic schizophrenias, but could be separated from idiopathic schizophrenias as symptomatic by neurohistopathological findings of post mortem examinations and e.g. diagnosed as sporadic, atypical encephalitis. The cenesthetic type had a pilot function for the development of the BSC, because in its course the basic symptomatology determined as well the prodromes before the first psychotic episode, as after that the reversible postpsychotic basic stages respectively the irreversible pure defect syndromes, into which two thirds of cenesthetic schizophrenias terminate; then, because with this type the first time has been observed, that from initially quite uncharacteristic basic symptoms (BS) (level 1 BS), qualitatively peculiar basic symptoms (level 2 BS) and then distinct psychotic symptoms, i.e. bodily hallucinations arise; and because in patients with persisting pure deficiency syndromes neuromorphological changes in the sense of a basal ganglia syndrome could be proved. The clinical neuroradiological correlation study in 195 schizophrenic patients with slight residues or full remissions and 212 chronic schizophrenias as well as in 535 patients with organic psychosyndromes of different diagnostic groups reveal that brain imaging and biological-psychiatric research are only promising in close connection with clinical psychopathology and observation of the course, if they aim to assign certain structural or functional cerebral disturbances with certain clinical symptoms and syndromes. In this respect schizophrenic, schizoaffective and affective idiopathic psychosyndromes do not differ from somatically based psychoses in definable brain diseases. With functional-dynamic parameters the differentiation in process active and inactive stages has to be made guided by the actual clinical psychopathological syndrome at the moment of the collecting of the electroencephalographic, neurochemical, fMRI or PET findings. The reasons of inconsistencies of the EEG, PEG, CT, MRI, PET findings are analysed and it is shown that they are frequently conditioned by insufficient definition of the random sample and, with functional-dynamic parameters by the missing consideration of the process activity. The Bonn Schizophrenia Long-term Study and the Bonn-Cologne early recognition study established that the dichotomic models of course of schizophrenia cannot be maintained: Negative respectively minus symptoms in the sense of basic symptoms precede the positive ones many years, negative schizophrenias pass over into positive ones and vice versa. In the search for morphological brain findings an irreversible psychopathological alteration with the component of a pure dynamic-cognitive deficiency syndrome is relevant as clinical criterion, while other persisting psychosyndromes as structural deformities and \"pure psychosis\" usually show no morphological brain changes. \"Schizophrenia\" is not always associated with neuromorphological changes. There exists a group of neuroradiologically negative schizophrenias with small dysplastic ventricles and other constitutional anomalies that is characterized by a premorbid psychopathic personality and a typically schizophrenic personality deformation. Brain alterations, regarding the 3rd and the lateral ventricles in the neighbourhood of the basal ganglia, can be found in the subgroup with irreversible dynamic-cognitive pure defect, but not in courses with full psychopathological remission. According to Dewan for the first time a correlation between psychopathological and brain morphological findings in schizophrenics with the component of pure residual syndrome has been found by our studies, as well as a parallel progression of the cerebral atrophy and the psychopathological changes. Quantitative-morphometric and MRI changes of regions of the limbic system and neurophysiological findings are hints that disorders in limbic key structures are able to explain the basic symptoms and the first rank symptoms, developing out of distinct transition relevant basic symptoms. Finally, the process activity concept and its criteria and its meaning for the studies with functional brain imaging methods are described."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of patients and family members towards implantable psychiatric medication.", "Abstract": "Medication is a necessary part of treatment for severe psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and nonadherence to prescribed medication is one of the most important public health issues in psychiatry today. The devastating consequences of nonadherence have motivated the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including a new long-term implantable medication delivery system.\nThe current study assesses attitudes towards implantable medication in psychiatric patients and their family members. Patients included in the study had diagnoses of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Mood or Anxiety related disorders.\n49.62% of patients and 74.47% of family members endorse support for implantable medication.\nThis study demonstrates that implants may be an acceptable alternative to oral and injectable medication for a subset of psychiatric patients and their families."}, {"Title": "Autism spectrum disorders in institutionalized subjects.", "Abstract": "What do we know about the prevalence and the specific features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) among subjects in forensic psychiatry and special youth centres? A clinical case series consisting of 42 subjects with ASD, recruited from three well-characterized populations in forensic psychiatry and special youth care, was used to determine: 1) the prevalence of ASD in these institutions (at least 13%), 2) the distribution of diagnostic criteria in this special population (mostly social interaction and communication problems, few or atypical flexibility problems), 3) the degree of comorbidity (the rule rather than the exception), 4) neuropsychological test profiles (lowered IQ with uneven profiles), 5) types of crimes and offences (very heterogeneous, often stress-related with dissociated features), 6) mental health care needs (high), and 7) special clinical features (especially expressions of flexibility deficits in non-classical areas and proneness to dissociation). This descriptive study indicates that ASD is a clinically relevant problem among forensic populations that has to be considered in diagnostics, assessments of needs and treatment planning."}, {"Title": "Cost of disorders of the brain in Denmark.", "Abstract": "The cost of brain disorders in Denmark is unknown and such information is important to decision makers. The aims of the study were to estimate the total number of subjects with brain diseases, and the associated direct and indirect expenses in Denmark. This was part of a larger pan-European study commissioned by the European Brain Council, which is an international collaboration of organizations within psychiatry, neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-research and patient organizations. The project provided the best possible estimates of the expenses for brain diseases based on available international scientific literature. The present study presents results for Denmark. There were an estimated 1.4 million Danish citizens who in 2004 had one of the selected 12 brain diseases, equivalent to one quarter of the total population. Anxiety disorders and migraine were the two most frequent diseases with 500,000 and 340,000 patients, respectively. The total expenses for all selected brain diseases were 37.3 billion DKR. Affective disorders, dependency, dementia and stroke were the most costly diseases. An estimated 12% of all direct costs in the Danish health system were spent on brain diseases; 9% of the total drug consumption was used for treatment of brain diseases. Expenses to brain diseases constituted 3% of the gross domestic product. Brain disorders are very prevalent in Denmark and they cause high societal and personal cost."}, {"Title": "Changes in psychiatric patients' thoughts about quitting smoking during a smoke-free hospitalization.", "Abstract": "Though exempted from national bans of tobacco smoking in hospitals, some psychiatric facilities have voluntarily gone 100% smoke free with little reported difficulty in clinical management. The impact of smoking restrictions on psychiatric patients' thoughts about quitting smoking, however, is not known. This study investigates changes in thoughts about quitting smoking for patients hospitalized in a smoke-free psychiatric inpatient facility. Participants were 100 smokers recruited from a university-based adult inpatient psychiatry unit. The present study focused on participants' reported desire to quit smoking, their expectancy of success and anticipated difficulty with quitting, and their smoking abstinence goal. Assessments were conducted at hospital intake and shortly before hospital discharge. Follow-up assessments were conducted by phone at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months post-hospitalization to measure smoking behavior. Although no cessation treatment was provided in this observational study, from admission to discharge, participants reported an increased expectancy of success with quitting and a decreased expectancy of difficulty with staying quit. They also were more likely to endorse a smoking-related goal. Psychiatric diagnosis was not related to thoughts about abstinence. Furthermore, participants' thoughts about abstinence at discharge were significantly related to their subsequent smoking behavior. Hospitalization in a smoke-free environment is associated with increases in patients' expectancies about quitting and staying smoke free."}, {"Title": "Implications of fMRI and genetics for the law and the routine practice of forensic psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This review outlines recent neurobiological findings in humans relevant for the practice of law and forensic psychiatry. We focus on offenders with antisocial personality disorder and on sex offenders. In addition, the impact of risk polymorphisms in monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), previously related to violence in interaction with the environment, on brain structure and function and on personality traits in healthy persons are presented. While increasing knowledge of functional and structural alterations provides a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of delinquent behaviour, antisocial and violent behaviour arises from a complex pattern of biological, psychological, social and situational factors, precluding a stance of simple biological reductionism. Rather, optimal integration of neurobiological findings requires cooperation among many disciplines such as medicine, criminology, sociology, psychology, politics and neuroscience."}, {"Title": "Worldwide child and adolescent mental health begins with awareness: a preliminary assessment in nine countries.", "Abstract": "To temper untoward mental health outcomes in children and adolescents, the World Psychiatric Association's Presidential Global Child Mental Health Programme, in collaboration with the WHO and the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professionals, established a Child Mental Health Awareness Task Force headed by Sam Tyano. Its task was to develop methodologies to increase awareness among policy-makers, community leaders, health professionals, teachers, parents, and children. Based on a prior comprehensive international search for effective techniques for information dissemination, an awareness manual was written for use by health professionals in diverse communities so as to guide the design and implementation of location specific awareness campaigns. We assessed the children, parents and teachers both before and after the campaign to determine changes in knowledge, attitudes and understanding of mental health. The school-based studies were conducted in selected communities in nine countries on five different continents distinguished by their different languages, cultures and their differing levels of economic development: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, China, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Russia, and Uganda. In the six sites that completed all assessments, indicators of positive change in awareness of child mental health were identified, and results demonstrated an increased willingness to discuss emotional problems freely. These data support the utility of collaborating with schools so as to foster better child mental health in such under-resourced communities."}, {"Title": "The Tofts: a private psychiatric hospital in the reigns of Edward VII and George V.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe 'The Tofts', a private psychiatric hospital in the reigns of Edward VII and George V.\nAn addendum to the history of psychiatry, in Australia is the conduct or treatment for the mentally ill in private hospitals during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

There are only a few studies on work related violence among physicians. The aim of this study was to determine how prevalent work-related violence against physicians is and whether gender, age, specializations and workplaces are associated with verbal and physical violence against physicians in Japan. A questionnaire was mailed to all the 1,705 physicians who had graduated from one medical school in Japan and had practiced for a minimum of 3 yr by the time of this study. The verbal and physical violence experienced by physicians at the hands of their patients and/or clients in the last 6 months preceding this study were collected. We defined ;verbal violence' as ;any threatening statement or complaint' while ;physical violence' referred to ;the attempted or actual exercise by persons of any physical force so as to cause injury to a physician'. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent contribution of each factor with violence. A total of 540 men and 158 women responded. The adjusted response rate was 41.8%. Among the participants, 168 (24.1%) physicians had experienced verbal violence and 15 (2.1%) physicians had experienced physical violence in the prior 6 months. Verbal violence was positively associated with physicians who were under 30 yr old (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-4.1 for 27-29 yr old) and, psychiatry (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4).

Furthermore, while there are frequent calls for a \"pluralistic\", comprehensive approach to understanding depression, few writers have tried to integrate insights from the spiritual, philosophical, and neurobiological literature. The author proposes that such a synthesis is possible, and that our understanding of ordinary sorrow and clinical depression is enriched by drawing from these disparate sources. In particular, a phenomenological analysis of sorrow and depression reveals two overlapping but distinct \"lifeworlds\". These differ in the relational, temporal, dialectical, and intentional realms. Recent brain imaging studies are also beginning to reveal the neurobiological correlates of sorrow and depression. As we come to understand the neurobiology of these states, we may be able to correlate specific alterations in \"neurocircuitry\" with their phenomenological expressions."}, {"Title": "[Influence of cannabis use on suicidal ideations among 491 high-school students].", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative contributions of cannabis use and depressive symptoms in the prediction of suicidal ideation.\nA random sample of 491 high-school students from the department of Haute-Garonne, France (290 girls, mean age=16.6+/-1.4; 201 boys, mean age=17.3 years+/-1.6) completed a questionnaire assessing cannabis use, the CES-D (center for epidemiological studies-depression scale) completed by the three-item sub-scale measuring suicidal ideation proposed by Garrison et al. (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry 30 (1991) 636-641).\nIn the total sample, 15% of girls (n=44) and 23% of boys (n=46) reported having used cannabis at least once a month during the last three months. The mean CES-D score for girls was significantly higher than for boys (20.6+/-11 versus 18.4+/-10.9, t=2.4, p=0.01). According to the cut-off score of 24, 22% of boys and 36% of girls exhibited a moderate to severe depressive symptomatology (p=0.02). The mean suicidal ideation score was not significantly higher in girls than in boys (1.3+/-2 versus 0.95+/-1.9, t=1.7, p=0.10). At least, the occasional wish to kill oneself was reported by 17% of boys and 20% of girls (p=0.40). The contribution of cannabis use and depressive symptomatology in the prediction of suicidal ideation were tested with a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, to determine whether cannabis use improved prediction of suicidal ideation beyond that afforded by CES-D scores. In the first step, including age and sex as covariates, the model accounted for a significant and important part of the variance of suicidal ideation (41%). Age and sex were not significant predictors. The second step, with cannabis use added to the prediction of suicidal ideation, afforded an increase of 1% in predictable variance. Cannabis use (beta=0.08, t=2.2, p=0.03) was significantly but weakly related to suicidal ideation, while depressive symptoms (beta=0.63, t=17.8, p<0.001) remained the main predictor. In a second regression analysis conducted among cannabis users, frequency of use was almost a significant predictor (beta=0.11, t=1.84, p=0.07).\nThis result suggests an association between suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and cannabis use in adolescents. Cannabis use appeared to be an independent predictor of suicidal ideation after controlling for depressive symptoms. However, the increment of variance accounted for by cannabis use was small. This suggests that cannabis use contributes to suicidal ideation independently from depressive symptoms, but weakly. A limitation to the study was the absence of control for other potential confounding variables. The association between cannabis use and suicidal ideation may be linked to common risk factors such as borderline personality disorder traits, sociodemographic and family factors. In this study, cannabis use does not appear as an important risk factor for suicidal ideation in adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Depressive disorders and quality of life: a cross sectional study including 360 depressive patients followed at the psychiatry consultation of the Mahdia university hospital].", "Abstract": "Depressive disorders affect many psychosocial and functional aspects, leading to a real social handicap and an alteration in quality of life.\nOur purposes were to evaluate the depressive patient's quality of life and to identify the risk factors responsible for this deterioration.\nOur cross sectional study lasted for four months, from 1st March to 30th June 2003, and included 360 depressive patients followed at the psychiatry consultation of the university hospital in Mahdia. The data were collected with a questionnaire composed of 60 items exploring the general characteristics of subjects, the clinical and evolutional characteristics of depressive disorder and providing information on the treatment. Quality of life was measured using the SF-36 (short form) generic scale. A global average score was calculated and it was considered that quality of life was altered if the score was less than 66.7, according to the threshold value of L\u00e9an [Arch Intern Med 159 (1999) 837-843]. Moreover, an average score was calculated for each dimension, thus permitting us to identify those most affected. We standardized initial average scores.\nThe assessment of quality of life revealed a global average score of 44.6 and an alteration in 81% of patients. The study of the dimensional average scores revealed that all dimensions were affected. The standardization also revealed deterioration in all the dimensions, with the mental component particularly more affected than the physical component with respectively estimated scores of 37.3 and 39.1. The analytic approach concerned the relationship between qualitative and quantitative variables and the occurrence of an alteration in quality of life. For this effect, a bivariate study displayed a statistically significant correlation between the eight dimensions of the SF-36 and 20 variables. In order to take into account the relationships which link each variable to the others, and to avoid the bias of the bivariate study, a logistic regression analysis was carried out. Only 12 variables with truly discriminating weight emerged from this analysis. According to the number of dimensions affected, the following factors were classified in decreasing order: the presence of at least two suicide attempts, the association of a psychotropic, the partial or absent observance, the feminine gender, the presence of somatic diseases, the absence of autonomy, the low social-economic level, the presence of a recent hospitalization (<12 months), the age greater than 45 years, the marital status of widow or separated, the number of children under charge greater than five and the presence of severe side effects.\nThis clinimetric approach permitted us to consider the whole life of each patient suffering from depressive disorder, rather than just the angle of their illness."}, {"Title": "[Mood induction procedures: a critical review].", "Abstract": "For a long period in the history of psychological research, emotion and cognition have been studied independently, as if one were irrelevant to the other. The renewed interest of researchers for the study of the relations between cognition and emotion has led to the development of a range of laboratory methods for inducing temporary mood states. This paper aims to review the main mood induction procedures allowing the induction of a negative mood as well as a positive mood, developed since the pioneer study of Schachter and Singer [Psychol Rev 69 (1962) 379-399] and to account for the usefulness and problems related to the use of such techniques. The first part of this paper deals with the detailed presentation of some of the most popular mood induction procedures according to their type: simple (use of only one mood induction technique) or combined (association of two or more techniques at once). The earliest of the modern techniques is the Velten Mood Induction Procedure [Behav Res Ther 6 (1968) 473-482], which involves reading aloud sixty self-referent statements progressing from relative neutral mood to negative mood or dysphoria. Some researchers have varied the procedure slightly by changing the number of the statements [Behav Res Ther 21 (1983) 233-239, Br J Clin Psychol 21 (1982) 111-117, J Pers Soc Psychol 35 (1977) 625-636]. Various other mood induction procedures have been developed including music induction [Cogn Emotion 11 (1997) 403-432, Br J Med Psychol 55 (1982) 127-138], film clip induction [J Pers Soc Psychol 20 (1971) 37-43, Cogn Emotion 7 (1993) 171-193, Rottenberg J, Ray RR, Gross JJ. Emotion elicitation using films. In: Coan JA, Allen JJB, editors. The handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. New York: Oxford University Press, 2007], autobiographical recall [J Clin Psychol 36 (1980) 215-226, Jallais C. Effets des humeurs positives et n\u00e9gatives sur les structures de connaissances de type script. Th\u00e8se de doctorat non publi\u00e9e. Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes] or combined inductions [Gilet AL. Etude des effets des humeurs positives et n\u00e9gatives sur l'organisation des connaissances en m\u00e9moire s\u00e9mantique. Th\u00e8se de doctorat non publi\u00e9e, Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes, J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150]. In music or film clip inductions, subjects are asked to listen or view some mood-suggestive pieces of material determined by the experimenter according to standardized music or film sets [J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150, Cogn Emotion 7 (1993) 171-193] and selected to elicit target moods. According to many authors, these two mood induction procedures seem to be among the most effective manners to induce moods [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580] in an individual or in a group setting [Jallais C. Effets des humeurs positives et n\u00e9gatives sur les structures de connaissances de type script. Th\u00e8se de doctorat non publi\u00e9e. Universit\u00e9 de Nantes, Nantes]. As it is believed that multiple inductions contribute additively to a mood [Am Psychol 36 (1981) 129-148], researchers proposed to combine two or more techniques at the same time. Thus, the Velten Mood Induction Procedure has been successively associated with the hypnosis mood induction procedure [J Pers Soc Psychol 42 (1982) 927-934], the music mood induction procedure [Behav Res Ther 21 (1983) 233-239, J Exp Soc Psychol 26 (1990) 465-480] or the imagination mood induction procedure [Br J Clin Psychol 21 (1982) 111-117]. Successful combinations of inductions usually use a first induction that occupies foreground attention and a second one that contributes to congruent background atmosphere. One of the most successful combined mood induction procedures has been developed by Mayer, Allen and Beauregard [J Ment Imagery 19 (1995) 133-150]. This technique associates guided imagery with music and is supposed to increase effectiveness of the induction. In the second part of this paper the aim is to present the usefulness of mood induction procedures in the study of cognitive processes in depression [Clin Psychol Rev 25 (2005) 487-510], borderline personality disorder [J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry 36 (2005) 226-239] or associated with brain imaging [Am J Psychiatry 161 (2004) 2245-2256]. Then the inherent problems to the use of experimental mood induction procedures are reconsidered. Doubts have effectively arisen about the effectiveness and validity of the mood induction procedures usually used in research. Some authors questioned whether a sufficient intensity of mood is produced or the possibility that the effects observed are due mainly to demand effects [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Clin Psychol Rev 10 (1990) 669-697, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. In fact, the various mood induction procedures are not equal with regard to the demand effects observed. The question of demand characteristics with respect to mood induction procedures is still under debate, even if demand effects are supposed to be most likely to occur with self-statement techniques (especially with the Velten mood induction procedure) or when subjects are explicitly instructed to try to enter a specific mood state [Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. Another interrogation relates to the effectiveness of these various procedures of induction and the duration of induced moods. Generally, the various techniques used produce true changes of moods in the majority if not the whole of the subjects. However, certain procedures seem more effective in inducing a mood in particular [Br J Psychol 85 (1994) 55-78, Clin Psychol Rev 10 (1990) 669-697, Eur J Soc Psychol 26 (1996) 557-580]. As for the duration of induced moods this depends at the same time on the procedure used and the mood induced. Nevertheless, mood induction remains fundamental in the study of the effects of mood on the cognitive activities, insofar as it makes it possible to study the effects of negative as well as positive moods."}, {"Title": "[Qualifying language disorders of schizophrenia through the speech therapists' assessment].", "Abstract": "This study investigates a comprehensive assessment of language disorders in order to identify impaired and unaffected language abilities of individuals with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the importance of the role of speech therapists in the treatment of schizophrenia. Speech therapy is especially thought to treat language disorders. However, to date, speech therapists have not been solicited in the treatment of schizophrenia, despite growing evidence supporting that schizophrenia is characterized by cognitive disorders such as impairments in memory, attention, executive functioning and language. In this article, we discuss the fact that elements of language and cognition are interactively affected and that cognition influences language. We then demonstrate that language impairments can be treated in the same way as neurological language impairments (cerebrovascular disease, brain injury), in order to reduce their functional outcome. Schizophrenia affects the pragmatic component of language with a major negative outcome in daily living skills [Champagne M, Stip E, Joanette Y. Social cognition deficit in schizophrenia: accounting for pragmatic deficits in communication abilities? Curr Psychiatry Rev:2006;(2):309-315]. The results of our comprehensive assessment also provide a basis for the design of a care plan. For this, subjects with schizophrenia were examined for language comprehension and language production with a focus on pragmatic abilities. In neurology, standardized tests are available that have been designed specifically to assess language functions. However, no such tests are available in psychiatry, so we gathered assessments widely used in neurology and examined the more relevant skills. In this article, each test we chose is described and particular attention is paid to the information they provided on impaired language abilities in schizophrenia. In this manner, we provide an accurate characterization of schizophrenia-associated language impairments and offer a solid foundation for rehabilitation. Current research makes connections between schizophrenia and other neurological disorders concerning language. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to explore these connections to complete our investigations. The strategies we designed are aimed at enabling a subject with schizophrenia to improve his/her language skills. We support the idea that such improvement could be reached by speech therapy. We conclude that speech therapists can play an important role in the non pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, by selecting appropriate interventions that capitalize on spared abilities to compensate for impaired abilities."}, {"Title": "On the psychometric validity of the domains of the PDSQ: an illustration of the bi-factor item response theory model.", "Abstract": "Competing item response theory (IRT) models were used to test the factor structure of the psychiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire (PDSQ; Zimmerman M, Mattia JI. A self-report scale to help make psychiatric diagnoses: the psychiatric diagnostic screening questionnaire. Archives of General Psychiatry 2001;58:787-94), a self-report psychiatric measure comprised of 139 items sampled from 15 symptom domains (e.g., Psychosis, Mania). Tested IRT models included: (a) a unidimensional model, (b) a simple structure model, (c) a bi-factor model, and (d) models that included 6, 10, and 15 sub-domain alternative conceptualizations of the scale. Based on the responses of 3791 individuals with major depressive disorder, the bi-factor model was found to provide a theoretically and statistically plausible description of the PDSQ factor structure. Primary dimension loadings were low to moderate; group factor loadings were moderate to high. Results support the validity of the PDSQ in identifying distinct categories of illness as defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual diagnostic groups, since preserving the 15 symptom categories (domains) provided a more accurate characterization of the observed data by the IRT models. The bi-factor model is useful in evaluating the multidimensional structure of mental health data. The specification of alternative IRT models is demonstrated as a noteworthy benefit over classical test theory for psychiatric measurement."}, {"Title": "Migraines and meditation: does spirituality matter?", "Abstract": "Migraine headaches are associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety (Waldie and Poulton Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry 72: 86-92, 2002) and feelings of low self-efficacy (French et al.

We aimed to establish what follow-up services were in place for children and young people with ADHD across Scotland, to highlight variations within these services and to examine their level of adherence to those national guidelines on follow-up which do exist.\nA postal survey of child and adolescent psychiatry departments across Scotland was carried out. Seventeen departments were contacted and the response rate was 100%. We compared results from areas with and without designated ADHD follow-up teams. We looked specifically at numbers and type of professional involved and the structure of the follow-up services provided.\nForty one percent of services had a designated ADHD follow-up team. These services held a significantly higher proportion of regular ADHD clinics and involved more staff from different professional groups. There were wide variations in services provided by child and adolescent psychiatrists for ADHD follow-up across Scotland.

Study participants included 7 older adults without dementia from a suburban geriatric medicine/psychiatry practice who elected to receive ECT. The lived experience of decision making as perceived by these 7 participants was a process that moved them toward wellness. The data revealed four significant themes: Support, Trust, Past Experience, and Desperation. An overriding substantive theme identified as an obstacle was the Stigma of Mental Illness. This study provided a basis for planning clinical practice and building further research."}, {"Title": "Empirical evidence on the use and effectiveness of telepsychiatry via videoconferencing: implications for forensic and correctional psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A growing body of literature now suggests that use of telepsychiatry to provide mental health services has the potential to solve the workforce shortage problem that directly affects access to care, especially in remote and underserved areas. Live interactive two-way audio-video communication-videoconferencing-is the modality most applicable to psychiatry and has become synonymous with telepsychiatry involving patient care, distance education, and administration. This article reviews empirical evidence on the use and effectiveness of videoconferencing in providing diagnostic and treatment services in mental health settings that serve child, adolescent, and adult populations. Descriptive reports, case studies, research articles, and randomized controlled trials related to clinical outcomes were identified and reviewed independently by two authors. Articles related to cost-effectiveness, technological issues, or legal or ethical aspects of telepsychiatry were excluded. The review of the evidence broadly covers mental health service provision in all settings, including forensic settings. Given the sparse literature on telepsychiatry in forensic settings, we discuss implications for mental health care across settings and populations and comment on future directions and potential uses in forensic or correctional psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Does evidence-b(i)ased psychiatry have its limitations?].", "Abstract": "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an algorithm that integrates information technology and the results of outcome research into clinical work. EBM, if well understood, is a valuable and critical bottom-up method that promotes a dialectical process by which the practitioner is able to arrive at an informed treatment choice; the method starts from the individual patient and involves discussion with the patient and critical reading of the relevant literature. However, there is a risk that EBM will become an ideology unless we are aware of its assumptions and epistemology. It is not valuefree, but is driven by an implicit objectivist view of man. EBM attaches greater value to biomedical sciences that to the humanities, to empiricism than to hermeneutics and to quantitative research than to qualitative research. EBM focuses on internal validity, but is in danger of neglecting factors such as qualitative changes that are difficult to measure, ecological validity and effectiveness and may hinder the generalisation of research results to clinical practice. The limitations of EBM are even more poignant in psychiatry, because psychiatry is highly sensitive to context and values. EBM is a blessing if we use it critically and remain aware of its limitations and underlying philosophy and if we supplement it with strategies such as value-based medicine (VBM). EBM, however, does not teach us what is useful or valuable, whereas VBM helps us to explain and weigh up the values that are at stake."}, {"Title": "[Evidence isn't enough: some comments from the daily practice of acute psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) generate knowledge that is useful in some situations but is of limited value when it comes to dealing with complex problems in clinical practice. By means of arguments drawn from acute psychiatry it is argued in this paper that a) the preconditions under which an intervention seems to work in a trial are all too often not met in the clinic; b) the problems that evidence-based interventions seek to solve tend to be unlike the problems that clinicians encounter in a day-to-day basis; and c) it is often impossible to ascertain the parameters against which the efficacy of intervention can be measured.

The evidence and the systematics of psychiatric assessment and mental status examination are based primarily on conventions established over time, on medical tradition and on the clinical experience of psychiatric experts. With regard to the mental status examination, according to Dutch tradition the symptoms are grouped on the basis of the 'classical' division of mental functions, the three groups being cognitive, affective and conative.

There are increasing demands from both postgraduate trainees and medical organisations for structured programmes with defined learning outcomes.\nThe aim of this study was to partner with postgraduate trainees and consultants in psychiatry to identify key learning issues that should be considered during CAP residency and to use these in designing a structured programme to meet the learning outcome requirements of a competency framework.\nParticipatory design was used to structure a learning and assessment programme in CAP. First, during working seminars, consultants and postgraduate trainees were interviewed about the characteristics of the learning and working in CAP. These interviews were audio taped, transcribed and analyzed for recurrent themes to identify key issues. Descriptive results were fed back to the participants for validation. In a subsequent iterative process the researchers and practitioners partnered to construct a learning and assessment programme.\nThe tasks within CAP were poorly described by study participants. Several other types of professionals within the healthcare team perform many of the tasks a CAP postgraduate trainee has to learn. Participants had difficulties describing how learning takes place and what postgraduate trainees need to learn in CAP. The partnership between researchers and practitioners identified three key issues to consider in CAP residencies: (1) Preparation for tasks postgraduate trainees are expected to fulfil, (2) Ensuring acquisition of physician-specific knowledge and skills, and (3) Clarifying roles and professional identity within the team. A structured training programme incorporating the key learning issues identified was created.\nParticipatory design was very helpful to structure a contextually suitable training programme in CAP.

The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate if SP used for clinical teaching in addition to real patients are well accepted for simulation of psychiatric illnesses and clinical teaching. After randomization, one half of the 139 study medical students were taught using real patients and the other half using real patients and SP. The amounts of patient contact were equal in both groups. Using a questionnaire, pre- and postanalysis was carried out of answers about communication skills, the capability of addressing difficult subjects such as suicidality, and interest in psychiatry. The acceptance rate of SP was very high. Students' ratings of clinical teaching and their own performance, and their interest in future psychiatric work were significantly higher in the SP group.

The pharmacy department subsequently examined its processes as they related to the two medications, and changes were implemented in the areas of order processing and floor-stock provision. Before policy implementation, injectable olanzapine was stored as floor stock in several automated medication cabinets for use in urgent situations. Injectable lorazepam was also included in the stock inventory for most patient care areas. After policy implementation, intramuscular olanzapine was removed from the general floor stock on all hospital units. The drug is now only available after a pharmacist's review and approval of each individual order. Upon receipt of an order for intramuscular olanzapine, the pharmacist is required to conduct a prospective review of the individual patient's medication profile to determine if an active order for an injectable benzodiazepine exists. In the event that the prescriber cannot be reached in a timely fashion, the new order is held until a physician's clarification can be obtained.\nImplementation of a policy that increased pharmacist surveillance and regulation of the use of intramuscular olanzapine reduced the potential for coadministration of the agent with parenteral benzodiazepines in a community hospital."}, {"Title": "Well-being in residency: effects on relationships with patients, interactions with colleagues, performance, and motivation.", "Abstract": "Previous studies about resident well-being have focused on negative aspects of well-being.

Nor did the frequency of EPS allow a clear distinction between the groups. There were 2 reasons for this: first, EPS rates rose continuously over the whole spectrum of drugs under study, and therefore precluded the definition of a cut-off score; second, there was considerable overlap between the 2 groups as EPS rates of various 'atypicals' (e.g. amisulpride, risperidone and zotepine) did not differ from some 'typical' substances (e.g. fluphenazine), while one 'typical' antipsychotic (perazine) even had a lower EPS risk than most 'atypicals'.\nThe odds of inducing EPS are not distinguishable between 'typical' and 'atypical' antipsychotics as EPS rates rise on a continuous scale throughout both classes.

In contrast, the cannabis users sampled significantly less information on the task, and tolerated a lower level of certainty in their decision-making, in comparison to the drug-naive controls. The effect in cannabis users extends our earlier observations in amphetamine- and opiate-dependent individuals (Clark, et al., 2006, Biological Psychiatry 60: 515-522), and suggests that reduced reflection may be a common cognitive style across regular users of a variety of substances.

Many misconceptions are biased and may hamper research in the mechanisms of healing and recovery if placebo is banned from clinical trials, as some influential ethicists propose. Current treatments in psychiatry are by no means optimal and may vary in their effect across studies, rendering difficult to find the best available therapeutic method with which to compare new drugs. Because drugs possess specific mechanisms, it is not possible to compare drugs with different mechanisms as to their relevance in the pathophysiology of a given disorder. Placebo acts through non-specific mechanisms and is the ideal control for any disorder whose pathophysiology is relatively unknown and its treatment is still suboptimal. Sticking to short-term patient benefit in a trial reflects an individualistically oriented thinking in contemporary ethics and is likely to limit further research and efforts to better understand the mechanisms of disease and drug action, but also those related to general body reactance and self-healing, which are enhanced by placebo administration. Because in history ethics are swinging between two opposed views, it is possible that in the near future, the balance will move towards communitarianism, which is more likely to better serve long-term patient needs.

The stimulatory effects of (-)-noepinephrine ((-)-NE) and 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (UK-14,304) at maximally effective concentrations were prominent only in the presence of micromolar to submillimolar levels of GDP, with the greatest signal/noise ratio achieved at 100 and 30-100 microM GDP for (-)-NE and UK-14,304, respectively. The alpha(2)-AR-mediated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding was also critically dependent on the presence of millimolar concentrations of MgCl(2) in assay medium. The maximum stimulation induced by UK-14,304 was equivalent to, or even greater than, that of an endogenous ligand (-)-NE at lower concentrations of NaCl, while it became a partial agonist with higher concentrations of NaCl. Concentration-response curves for several agonists revealed that the omission of NaCl from incubation buffer generally shifted the curves leftward and increased the relative efficacies as compared to the endogenous ligand. The pharmacological profile characterized with a series of adrenergic agonists and antagonists indicated that this response was derived from activation of G proteins coupled with alpha(2)-ARs, in particular alpha(2D)-AR subtype, though the possible involvement of alpha(2C)-ARs was not completely excluded. However, the stimulatory effects of several adrenergic compounds, such as rauwolscine and yohimbine, were ascribed to their agonist properties at 5-HT(1A) receptors. This method serves as a simple but useful strategy for investigating the functional interaction between alpha(2D)-ARs and their coupled G proteins in rat native cerebral cortical membranes, especially in the field of psychopharmacology and biological psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A study of neuropsychological deficit in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "This study was conducted to examine the neuropsychological deficits in children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

At the Department of Psychiatry of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, Netherlands, we have been carrying out neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia since 1995. We focused our research on three main questions. First, are brain volume abnormalities static or progressive in nature? Secondly, can brain volume abnormalities in schizophrenia be explained (in part) by genetic influences? Finally, what environmental factors are associated with the brain volume abnormalities in schizophrenia? Based on our findings we suggest that schizophrenia is a progressive brain disease. We showed different age-related trajectories of brain tissue loss suggesting that brain maturation that occurs in the third and fourth decade of life is abnormal in schizophrenia. Moreover, brain volume has been shown to be a useful phenotype for studying schizophrenia. Brain volume is highly heritable and twin and family studies show that unaffected relatives show abnormalities that are similar, but usually present to a lesser extent, to those found in the patients. However, also environmental factors play a role. Medication intake is indeed a confounding factor when interpreting brain volume (change) abnormalities, while independent of antipsychotic medication intake brain volume abnormalities appear influenced by the outcome of the illness. In conclusion, schizophrenia can be considered as a progressive brain disease with brain volume abnormalities that are for a large part influenced by genetic factors. Whether the progressive volume change is also mediated by genes awaits the results of longitudinal twin analyses. One of the main challenges for the coming years, however, will be the search for gene-by-environment interactions on the progressive brain changes in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "A survey of old age psychiatry consultation/liaison services in Ireland.", "Abstract": "The aim of this survey was to assess current structures for provision of consultation/liaison services to older people in the Republic of Ireland, and to ascertain the proportion of referrals to psychiatry of old age arising from consultation/liaison referrals.\nA postal questionnaire was sent to the 19 public sector, old age psychiatry services, operating in 2005.

Supportive Expressive Therapy--Parent Child (SET-PC) is a newly developed brief psychodynamic psychotherapy that focuses on a parent's internal representations of self and others, particularly as they manifest in problematic parent-child relationships. It is a manualized dyadic therapy that uses videotaped parent-child play sessions followed by parent-therapist discussions. This exploratory study is the first randomized controlled study of SETPC. SET-PC was compared with the Incredible Years Parenting Program (IYPP; Webster-Stratton, 2001), an empirically supported group parent training intervention for child disruptive behavior. Treatment completers were 37 consecutive referrals of parent- child dyads (children ages 30-72 months) to an outpatient psychiatry clinic. SET-PC produced treatment outcomes that were equivalent to IYPP. Both treatments were associated with large effect sizes for decreases in externalizing behavior and for the positive quality of observed parent- child interactions and small effect sizes for improvements in parents' psychological functioning.

Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between clinical symptoms and cognitive functions in the patient group. The cognitive variables that best predicted treatment response and prognosis were total errors on the WCST and immediate list recall component of the K-MAS. It was also shown that the number of total errors on the WCST was a better cognitive predictor than the number of errors in immediate recall.\nThe results of the present study show that the neurocognitive functions of patients with schizophrenia can be stabilized with treatment intervention, that treatment response is related to improvement in cognitive function, and that cognitive domains, especially executive function, can predict treatment response and prognosis in patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Bully victims: psychological and somatic aftermaths.", "Abstract": "Bullying is a well-known adversity among school-age children.

The so-called short-circuit movements represent a pathological exaggeration of immediate reactions to sensory impressions, such as sudden or threatening stimuli. \"Short-circuiting\" was deemed of utmost importance for the diagnoses of several WKL endogenous psychoses, such as hyperkinetic motility psychosis, periodic catatonia, and proskinetic catatonia. We suggest that short-circuit movements may be an under-reported behavioral phenotype that may cut across different phenotypes of non-psychotic DSM-IV-TR disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette's syndrome (TS), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Several features of a neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in the coarse frontal lobe disease (\"complex psychomotor release phenomena\") may provide a neurological working model for \"short-circuiting\" in ADHD, TS, and OCD. Further, short-circuit movements may be associated with different degrees of serotonergic, dopaminergic, and glutamatergic dysfunctions. Indeed, although there are a growing number of studies reporting successful treatment of short-circuit movements with topiramate and other glutamatergic antagonists, treatment response to drugs based on serotonergic or dopaminergic mechanisms of action is more uncertain and, sometimes, detrimental, leading to an aggravation of pathological behavior.

Obviously, new ideas that expand the present understanding of such problems are useful. In this paper, the following hypothesis is proposed: mental disorders are caused by hypoxic phenomena, stimulating hypertrophied growth of a neural network; treatment should be directed towards the damaging of abnormal elements of this network; successful treatment is inevitably accompanied by moderate retrograde amnesia. Based on this hypothesis, the connection between etiology, pathogenesis, and therapy of mental disorders is described, the role of retrograde amnesia is shown, and potential new methods of treatment (shaking, vibration, and ultrasound) are predicted. To test the hypothesis, some means are discussed. The first means is based on the analysis of the reasons of unsuccessful clinical trials of the method of mental disorders treatment by acute hypoxic hypoxia (USA, 1938-1940). Such a method, according to the hypothesis, should damage the abnormal elements of a neural network as a result of acute hypoxia. Analysis of the equipment and procedure shows that the trials were unsuccessful as a result of insufficiently powerful hypoxic influence. Improvements to this method are proposed. When using this method, it is advisable to measure the cerebral blood oxygenation index and reduce it by regulating the oxygen concentration in the hypoxic gas mixture given to the patient. This reduction should continue until the patient reaches a state of moderate retrograde amnesia. It is also advisable to note the blood oxygenation index value at the moment when the patient lapses into unconsciousness, and then, on the basis of this value, estimate a necessary power (i.e., acuteness and duration) of hypoxic hypoxia. Other means for testing the hypothesis are also discussed: retrospective analysis of the results of electroconvulsive therapy, and testing the predicted methods of treatment."}, {"Title": "Psychoanalysis, a bridge between attachment research and neurobiology.", "Abstract": "Attachment theory and neurobiology are at the forefront of scientific research, particularly in the area of child psychiatry.

The author also postulates that the neurobiology of attachment mediates but does not substitute psychoanalysis for the final understanding of the human bond. Findings in both fields, attachment theory and psychobiology, often compellingly lead to psychoanalytic concepts; on the other hand, the neurobiology of the psyche does not make full sense without the wealth of research conducted by psychoanalysts during the 20th century.

The case notes show that ZL repeatedly received COT between 1934 and 1937, first with camphor and then with cardiazol induction. After the first course of COT the catatonic stupor was resolved and the psychotic symptoms subsided. However, the remission lasted for only a few months and was followed by a relapse. Despite repeated courses of COT, ZL never became symptom free again, was never discharged and died in the Institute in 1945.

This phenomenon, known as the platelet hyperserotonemia of autism, is considered to be one of the most well-replicated findings in biological psychiatry. Its replicability suggests that many of the genes involved in autism affect a small number of biological networks. These networks may also play a role in the early development of the autistic brain.\nWe developed an equation that allows calculation of platelet 5-HT concentration as a function of measurable biological parameters. It also provides information about the sensitivity of platelet 5-HT levels to each of the parameters and their interactions.\nThe model yields platelet 5-HT concentrations that are consistent with values reported in experimental studies. If the parameters are considered independent, the model predicts that platelet 5-HT levels should be sensitive to changes in the platelet 5-HT uptake rate constant, the proportion of free 5-HT cleared in the liver and lungs, the gut 5-HT production rate and its regulation, and the volume of the gut wall. Linear and non-linear interactions among these and other parameters are specified in the equation, which may facilitate the design and interpretation of experimental studies."}, {"Title": "Overcoming hurdles to achieving good physical health in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.", "Abstract": "Hurdles that must be overcome in order to implement guidelines and maximize physical health in patients treated with antipsychotics include the impression that a disruption in physical health is an inevitable token for the patient to pay in order to achieve and maintain his or her mental health; lack of routine monitoring; lack of defined care pathways for evaluation, monitoring and treatment of physical health issues in psychiatry; the burden of guideline implementation on mental health team resources; the difficulty to perform certain procedures (e.g. monitoring of waist circumference); and reluctance to switch medications once physical health effects are recognized, especially if the psychiatric symptoms are under relatively good control. It is imperative that we act now to overcome these hurdles and maximize outcomes for our patients. Strategies include establishing simple, consistent processes for physical health monitoring and tracking in clinical practice; provision of appropriate equipment to staff; effective education of all personnel involved in the care of psychiatric patients regarding this important topic; and consideration of a medication switch in patients whose medication is a high-risk contributory factor to poor physical health."}, {"Title": "Recurrence of major depressive disorder is predicted by inhibited startle magnitude while recovered.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder, for some, follows a chronic relapsing course. However, no reliable marker has been established that allows the identification of this sub-group of patients. Preliminary findings suggest that baseline startle magnitude may be such a marker. This study evaluated whether differences in baseline startle magnitude during remission could prospectively predict depressive symptomatology and recurrence.\nA group of previously depressed individuals (n=25), who were in full remission at the time of testing, had their startle reflex measured via surface EMG electrodes on the left orbicularis oculi muscle. These people were then followed-up 2 years later and their depressive symptomatology during the intervening period was assessed using the psychiatric ratings scale of the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE; [Keller, M.B., Lavori, P.W., Friedman, B., Nielsen, E., Endicott, J., McDonald-Scott, P., et al.

Additionally, as no healthy control group is included, we report a relative rather than absolute attenuation of startle to be indicative of symptom severity and recurrence proclivity.\nThese preliminary findings suggest that an attenuated startle response may have utility as an endophenotypic marker of risk for recurrence of Major Depression and residual sub-syndromal symptomatology.

Chosen for the underserved population of children it cares for, the school exhibits all of the national risk factors for obesity: low-income families (57% of annual household incomes less than $10,000); minority population (80% of the children African-American or Hispanic); and located in an unsafe neighborhood for outdoor physical activity. These demographics resulted in a school population that had body mass index (BMI) demographics of 48.8% overweight (BMI >85%), including 30.7% obese (BMI >95%), in contrast with the national average of 16% obese.\nTargeting the school's children with a BMI >85th percentile, an after-school program was created. The students met twice a week for 90-minute sessions of fun physical activities, proper nutritional information, as well as small group sessions with pediatric psychiatry residents focusing on good choices and proper motivations in life. Universal school interventions were also instituted in an attempt to reach the entire school population.\nInitial findings after the first year of the program indicated a slowing in the average rate of weight gain by the targeted population. While the results, compared to accessible data in a school population with similar demographics, did not reach statistical significance, the trends were in the desired direction.

However, a non-trivial number of children diagnosed with dyslexia fail to respond to these interventions (Torgesen, Learning Disabilities Research & Practice 15: 55-64, 2000). A cross-sectional fMRI study investigating post-treatment effects was conducted in an effort to better understand differences in brain function between treatment responders and non-responders. Educational testing and brain activation measured after treatment suggested that the reading intervention used in the present study rehabilitated several basic level reading processes in all participants diagnosed with dyslexia.

Children with persistent deficits in single word decoding (treatment non-responders) demonstrated significantly less activation in the left inferior parietal lobe when compared to non-impaired readers."}, {"Title": "Explanatory models for psychiatric illness.", "Abstract": "How can we best develop explanatory models for psychiatric disorders? Because causal factors have an impact on psychiatric illness both at micro levels and macro levels, both within and outside of the individual, and involving processes best understood from biological, psychological, and sociocultural perspectives, traditional models of science that strive for single broadly applicable explanatory laws are ill suited for our field. Such models are based on the incorrect assumption that psychiatric illnesses can be understood from a single perspective. A more appropriate scientific model for psychiatry emphasizes the understanding of mechanisms, an approach that fits naturally with a multicausal framework and provides a realistic paradigm for scientific progress, that is, understanding mechanisms through decomposition and reassembly. Simple subunits of complicated mechanisms can be usefully studied in isolation. Reassembling these constituent parts into a functioning whole, which is straightforward for simple additive mechanisms, will be far more challenging in psychiatry where causal networks contain multiple nonlinear interactions and causal loops. Our field has long struggled with the interrelationship between biological and psychological explanatory perspectives. Building from the seminal work of the neuronal modeler and philosopher David Marr, the author suggests that biology will implement but not replace psychology within our explanatory systems. The iterative process of interactions between biology and psychology needed to achieve this implementation will deepen our understanding of both classes of processes."}, {"Title": "Computing inter-rater reliability and its variance in the presence of high agreement.", "Abstract": "Pi (pi) and kappa (kappa) statistics are widely used in the areas of psychiatry and psychological testing to compute the extent of agreement between raters on nominally scaled data. It is a fact that these coefficients occasionally yield unexpected results in situations known as the paradoxes of kappa. This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized pi and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics."}, {"Title": "The Amsterdam Studies of Acute Psychiatry I (ASAP-I); a prospective cohort study of determinants and outcome of coercive versus voluntary treatment interventions in a metropolitan area.", "Abstract": "The overall number of involuntary admissions is increasing in many European countries. Patients with severe mental illnesses more often progress to stages in which acute, coercive treatment is warranted. The number of studies that have examined this development and possible consequences in terms of optimizing health care delivery in emergency psychiatry is small and have a number of methodological shortcomings. The current study seeks to examine factors associated with compulsory admissions in the Amsterdam region, taking into account a comprehensive model with four groups of predictors: patient vulnerability, social support, responsiveness of the health care system and treatment adherence.\nThis paper describes the design of the Amsterdam Study of Acute Psychiatry-I (ASAP-I). The study is a prospective cohort study, with one and two-year follow-up, comparing patients with and without forced admission by means of a selected nested case-control design. An estimated total number of 4,600 patients, aged 18 years and over, consecutively coming into contact with the Psychiatric Emergency Service Amsterdam (PESA) are included in the study. From this cohort, a randomly selected group of 125 involuntary admitted subjects and 125 subjects receiving non-coercive treatment are selected for further evaluation and comparison.First, socio-demographic, psychopathological and network characteristics, and prior use of health services will be described for all patients who come into contact with PESA. Second, the in-depth study of compulsory versus voluntary patients will examine which patient characteristics are associated with acute compulsory admission, also taking into account social network and healthcare variables. The third focus of the study is on the associations between patient vulnerability, social support, healthcare characteristics and treatment adherence in a two-year follow-up for patients with or without involuntarily admittance at the index consultation.\nThe current study seeks to establish a picture of the determinants of acute compulsory admissions in the Netherlands and tries to gain a better understanding of the association with the course of illness and patient's perception of services and treatment adherence.

First, some brief conceptual and empirical descriptions are provided of Australia's mental health services, both as a total system, and of its two principal components, viz. public psychiatric institutions and private psychiatry services. Expenditures on public psychiatric hospitals clearly demonstrate the effect of deinstitutionalisation. Data from 1984 on private practice psychiatry indicate that per capita utilisation rates peaked in 1996 and have since fallen. Generally, since 1984 gross fees have not risen. However, for both utilisation and fees, there is evidence (of a statistical kind) that there are significant differences between the states of Australia, in these two variables (utilisation and fees). Emphasis is also placed on the economic incentives that arise from health insurance and the heterogeneous nature of mental illness. The effects of these incentives are regarded as by-products of the health insurance mechanism; and another effect, \"unmet need\" and \"met non-need\", is a somewhat unique problem of an informational kind. Discussion of many of these issues concludes on a somewhat negative note, e.g. that no empirical results are available to quantify the particular effect that is discussed.

Despite this bias, the responses are nonetheless revealing and contribute to understanding of the factors that may influence trainees to enter the field.

To date, the cut-off scores for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been determined. Given the need for an earlier diagnosis of mild dementia, new cut-off values are also necessary, taking into account cultural and educational effects.\nOne hundred and fifty-seven older adults (mean age: 69.6 +/- 7.4 years) with 8 or more years of formal education (mean years of schooling 14.2 +/- 3.8) attending a memory clinic at the Institute of Psychiatry University of Sao Paulo were included. Subjects were divided into three groups according to their cognitive status, established through clinical and neuropsychological assessment: normal controls, n = 62; MCI, n = 65; and mild or moderate dementia, n = 30. ROC curve analyses were performed for dementia vs controls, MCI vs controls and MCI vs dementia.\nThe cut-off values were: 92/93 for dementia vs controls (AUC = 0.99: sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95%); 95/96 for MCI vs controls (AUC = 0.83, sensitivity: 64%, specificity: 88%), and 85/86 for MCI vs dementia (AUC = 0.91, sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 88%). The total CAMCOG score was more accurate than its subtests Mini-mental State Examination, Verbal Fluency Test and Clock Drawing Test when used separately.\nThe CAMCOG discriminated controls and MCI from demented patients, but was less accurate to discriminate MCI from controls. The best cut-off value to differentiate controls and demented was higher than suggested in the original publication, probably because only cases of mild to moderate dementia were included. This is important given the need for a diagnostic at earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"Title": "Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials as indicator of central serotonergic neurotransmission: simultaneous electrophysiological recordings and in vivo microdialysis in the rat primary auditory cortex.", "Abstract": "Serotonin released in synapsis is one of the key neurotransmitters in psychiatry and psychopharmacology. The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) has been proposed as a marker for central serotonergic neurotransmission. Several findings in animals and humans support this hypothesis. However, the in vivo measurement of cortical extracellular serotonin levels has never been performed simultaneously with the recording of auditory evoked potentials. The interrelationship between low cortical serotonergic activity and strong LDAEP is yet to be proven. The auditory evoked potentials were recorded in the epidura above the primary auditory cortex of male Wistar rats whereas extracellular serotonin levels in the primary auditory cortex were measured by in vivo microdialysis before and after i.p. application of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. At baseline, the correlation of coefficients between the LDAEP, especially of the N1 component, and extracellular serotonin levels in the primary auditory cortex was negative. The increase of serotonin levels after citalopram application was significantly related to a decrease of LDAEP of the N1 component (r=-0.86, p=0.003). These data support the view that the LDAEP is closely modulated by cortical serotonergic activity. Thus, the LDAEP might serve as an inversely related marker of synaptically released serotonin in the CNS."}, {"Title": "[Difficulties in appraisals of adolescents aged over 14 years with respect to custody and visitation rights].", "Abstract": "This retrospective study analyses 55 custody- and visitation rights expert opinions furnished at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of T\u00fcbingen from 1990 to 2005. The aim of the study was to find out reasons and circumstances prompting judges to order appraisals of adolescents aged over 14 years during proceedings of custody and visitation rights. Expertises were examined for possible gender-specific differences. Further, a census of the judges was arranged. It became obvious that expertises were rarely requested during proceedings of custody and especially of visitation rights. Financial problems, parental alcoholism and educational incompetence or mental diseases of the adolescents and/or their parents were found in these extremely conflict-ridden family situations. Gender-specific variable results were found as far as the relationship of the young towards their parents and siblings is concerned, their wish for future residence, and the expert recommendation on provision for custody and visitation rights."}, {"Title": "[Insufficiency of psychopathological identification in a case on non-processual schizophrenia].", "Abstract": "A case of non-processual and primarily non-productive schizophrenia is presented. However, its evolutive development and clinical manifestations of <<self>> experiences alterations are prototypic of the picture they represent. Nevertheless, this case was not diagnosed during more than one decade of observation. The presentation of this patient's case history shows how clinical praxis dissociates the theory of schizophrenia from the patient's experience. The discussion elaborated from the conceptual history and the self in schizophrenia suggests that the subjective phenomena manifested in these patients cannot be approached by the present applicable operatives criteria in psychiatry nor from a unifying criterion based on an exclusive nuclear approach that aims to explain the final cause. All of this refers to the insufficiency of psychopathology as mere semiology and raises the need for a psychopathological praxis that can implement the results of the theory."}, {"Title": "Admission to a psychiatric unit and changes in tobacco smoking.", "Abstract": "Smoking and withdrawal from smoking complicates the assessment and treatment of mental illness.

Demographics and role characteristics.", "Abstract": "Mental health nursing roles in Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychiatry and emergency departments are rapidly developing within Australia since the mainstreaming of mental health services within the general health-care system. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these positions have been initiated and developed in relative isolation and with little formalized support. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of these roles and the nurses who occupy them is limited. A survey was developed and distributed to gather information on CL nurses in Australia. The survey was aimed at CL nurses working in a range of settings and included questions relating to demographics, qualifications, experience, clinical practice, organizational structure, education, clinical supervision, education and training and work satisfaction. This, the first of a two-part paper, will present the key findings relating to demographics and characteristics of the role. Overall, the findings demonstrated that the CL nurses who responded to the survey (n = 56) were experienced psychiatric/mental health nurses working primarily in general hospital wards and/or emergency departments; receive requests for consultation from a range of health professionals but predominantly nurses; provide education to a range of staff groups; and use a range of titles to identify their role."}, {"Title": "Clinical correlates of tourette's disorder across cultures: a comparative study between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.", "Abstract": "Tourette's disorder is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal (phonic) tics. While the disorder has been researched extensively in the Western populations, the clinical correlates and associated features are less well known in other populations and cultures. This study examines the presentation and clinical correlates of Tourette's disorder in 2 distinct populations, namely the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.\nA consecutive series of 35 Tourette's disorder patients of Arab descent recruited from 2001 to 2005 from the Child Psychiatry clinics in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), were compared with 35 age- and gender-matched white Tourette's disorder patients attending the Tourette Clinic at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, United Kingdom, from December 2004 to December 2005.\nRates of occurrence of obsessive-compulsive disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were similar in the 2 cohorts. Coprolalia was higher in the U.K. cohort and was noted to correlate with the severity of Tourette's disorder. Comorbid oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder were also higher in the U.K. cohort (54.3% [N = 19] and 20.0% [N = 7], respectively) as compared to the U.A.E. cohort (11.4% [N = 4] and 5.7% [N = 2], respectively) but were not linked to any other clinical feature or severity of Tourette's disorder.\nThe findings illustrate the similarity in the core clinical symptoms between the 2 populations, thus emphasizing the underlying biological and genetic basis of these symptoms. However, our finding of higher occurrence of behavioral symptoms in the Western sample has implications for our understanding of the phenotypic presentation of Tourette's disorder as well as the management."}, {"Title": "Implicit awareness of ambiguity: a role in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "The cognitive-behavioral model of obsessive-compulsive disorder proposes that obsessional symptoms are the consequence of the manner in which intrusive cognitions are interpreted [e.g., Salkovskis, P. M. (1998). Cognitive-behavioral approach to understanding obsessional thinking. British Journal of Psychiatry, 173(35S), 53-63]. The present study suggests that this may be attributable to maladaptive implicit cognitive processing, a deficit that results in the explicit awareness of ambiguity in idiographic obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) stimuli. The present study examines decision-making responses of low and high OCD scorers in a non-clinical undergraduate sample. Via a computer console, participants were shown sentence statements for three levels of ambiguity. They were then presented with a propositional statement for which they had to indicate agreement or disagreement for sentences of varying ambiguity. After this, the participants indicated whether they were completely confident or unconfident as regards their previous agree-disagree decisions. Results indicate that the high compared to the low OCD scoring group had less agreement and subsequent less confidence in decisions made for sentences of varying ambiguity. Response latencies partially fitted the predicted hypotheses. Consequently, an addition to Salkovskis, Forester, and Richards' [1998. Cognitive-behavioral approach to understanding obsessional thinking. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 173(35S), 53-63] model of OCD is suggested: namely that an implicit ambiguity deficit mediates the likelihood of normally occurring intrusions developing into abnormal obsessions.

In this study, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 13 patients with severe PTSD and matched non-traumatized Controls, during performance of visuo-verbal tasks that involved either maintenance or continual updating of word stimuli in WM. The PTSD group failed to show differential activation during WM updating, and instead appeared to show abnormal recruitment of WM updating network regions during WM maintenance. These regions included the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Several other regions were significantly more activated in Controls than in PTSD during WM updating, including the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate (AC), and the brainstem pons, key regions that are consistently implicated in the neurobiology of PTSD. These findings suggest compensatory recruitment of networks in PTSD normally only deployed during updating of WM and may reflect PTSD patients' difficulty engaging with their day-to-day environment."}, {"Title": "[A historical analysis of \"insight\" category in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "This work presents a historical analysis of the formation and development of \"insight\" category (awareness of illness) in the process of interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatry, psychology and social sciences.

Nearly all (98-100%) believed that psychiatrists should obtain informed consent before genetic testing, should keep test results confidential, should provide pre- and posttest counseling, and should demonstrate competence in interpreting test results. Nearly all (96-100%) supported laws and regulations to prevent discrimination based on genetic test results and to protect consumers from misleading advertisements for testing.

An enormous literature with findings of abnormal central processing in psychiatric diseases has been acquired during the last decades. However, the benefit of this research has been limited in part due to the unresolved problem of precise and correct localization of the underlying neural generators. The difficulty of correct localization is due to the fact that different constellations of cortical neuroelectric generators can produce identical EEG activity. Therefore, even concerning several major event related potentials no generally accepted knowledge about their cerebral generation exists. While correct localization can easily be obtained by imaging methods based on hemodynamic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), these techniques can not distinguish between different aspects of neural activity such as oscillation modes or stages of information processing that are only some milliseconds apart. Accordingly, the integration of simultaneous measurements of EEG and fMRI has become a methodological key issue today. EEG-fMRI may prove to be crucial in providing much deeper understanding of brain activity over the next decades.

We also asked a group of experts in paediatric clinical research to refer us to any other relevant studies. From these articles we extracted data on the clinical condition of interest, description of the method used to select outcomes, the people involved in the selection process, the outcomes selected, and limitations of the method as defined by the authors. The literature search identified 8,889 potentially relevant abstracts. Of these, 70 were retrieved, and 25 were included in the review. These studies described the work of 13 collaborations representing various paediatric specialties including critical care, gastroenterology, haematology, psychiatry, neurology, respiratory paediatrics, rheumatology, neonatal medicine, and dentistry. Two groups utilised the Delphi technique, one used the nominal group technique, and one used both methods to reach a consensus about which outcomes should be measured in clinical trials.

The most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative diseases of the CNS. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent of them, much less common are Lewy's body disease, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is an autosomally dominant terminal illness, that occurs in approximately 5 - 7 persons in 100 000. In 90% of the cases it begins after the age of 35, the remaining 10% is the juvenile and early form, which varies from that seen in adults. Rigidity, oral motor dysfunction, gait disorder and rapid cognitive decline are the main characteristics of the juvenile and early form. Chorea is rare or absent. The case of a young woman who developed dementia with motor and speech abnormalities is presented in this paper. Due to the great non-specifity of the symptoms she was being diagnosed for about 2 years (hospitalized 3 times in the neurology wards and 4 times in the psychiatry wards). Lack of family history disorders, no specific abnormalities in neurological examination, abundance of traumatic experiences accounted for the preliminary diagnosis of a dissociative disorder (pseudodementia). Many symptoms, such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality and behavioural disturbances were observed in the course of the disease. Finally, after 6 years from the appearance of the first symptoms, based on the third MR of CNS, the diagnosis of the early HD was established.

It is relevant to consider whether these expectations about learning needs vary prior to and post-placement in psychiatry. To what extent these opinions should influence curriculum development needs to be assessed.\nA questionnaire was distributed to medical students before they commenced their psychiatry placement and after they had completed it. The questionnaire considered the relevance of psychiatry to their future careers, the relevance of particular knowledge and skills, the utility of knowledge of psychiatric specialties and the utility of different settings for learning psychiatry.\nThe students felt skills relevant to all doctors, such as assessment of suicide risk, were more important than more specialist psychiatric skills, such as the management of schizophrenia. They felt that knowledge of how psychiatric illnesses present in general practice was important and it was a useful setting in which to learn psychiatry. They thought that conditions that are commonly seen in the general hospital are important and that liaison psychiatry was useful.\nTwo ways that medical students believe their teaching can be made more relevant to their future careers are highlighted in this study. Firstly, there is a need to focus on scenarios which students will commonly encounter in their initial years of employment. Secondly, psychiatry should be better integrated into the overall curriculum, with the opportunity for teaching in different settings.

After a fire accident in 1918, she suffered from paralysis, deafness, and blindness. Later she developed stigmata on her extremities and left side of the thorax, bleeding lesions in the skin, bleeding in the eye region, and altered states of consciousness in the form of \"visions\" of religious content. On the basis of a report by her physician, Dr. Otto Seidl, to the Bishopric Ordinariate of Regensburg (1927) and a manuscript for presentation before the Catholic Medical Society of the Netherlands (1928) Seidl had no doubt of the authenticity of these phenomena, and he diagnosed hysteria. While under surveillance by four nuns for 14 days, Neumann exhibited no intake of nourishment; weight measurements and urine tests however suggest the opposite. Investigation in a clinic was refused. Her case is interpreted here in the light of contemporary psychiatry. As far as medical records go, Therese Neumann's is one of a series of surprisingly similar cases of stigmata development, conversion disorder, and alleged absence of nutrition.

(2007) How and why genetic linkage has not solved the problem of psychosis: review and hypothesis. American Journal of Psychiatry, 164, 13-21). Absence of evidence of linkage is consistent with the concept that the variation is epigenetic in form rather than DNA sequence-based. But what are the dimensions that underly the continuum?

Thus an epigenetic imprint, arising in relation to the sapiens specific torque and persisting over one or two generations is a better fit to the genetics of the psychotic continuum than Craddock and Owen's elusive \"polygenic\" variations."}, {"Title": "The frequency of the psychiatric symptoms in the patients with dyspepsia at a university hospital.", "Abstract": "According to the psychiatric hypothesis, the symptoms of dyspepsia may be due to depression, anxiety or a somatization disorder.

The scores of state-trait anxiety, somatization, obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety and psychotism subscales, and the total SCL-90 score were statistically significantly higher in those participants without a pathological finding than in the controls.\nRegarding the high frequency of psychiatric disorders in patients with dyspeptic symptoms, we think that such patients should be evaluated by two separate departments, gastroenterology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "A bibliometric study of international scientific productivity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder covering the period 1980-2005.", "Abstract": "We have carried out a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its pharmacological treatment over the period 1980-2005.\nWe selected (in EMBASE and MEDLINE databases) documents that contained in their title the descriptors attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, attention deficit disorder, ADHD and ADD. As bibliometric indicators of production and dispersion we applied Price's Law and Bradford's Law, respectively. We also calculated the national participation index (PI) and correlated it with overall PI in biomedical and health sciences, with PI in the discipline of Psychiatry and with the social-health indicators (per capita Gross Domestic Product, number of physicians and total per capita expenditure on health).\nWe obtained 5,269 original documents (2,325 corresponded to pharmacological therapy). Our results indicate fulfilment of Price's Law, since scientific production on ADHD undergoes exponential growth (correlation coefficient r = 0.9859, vs. r = 0.9011 after linear adjustment). The most widely studied drugs are methylphenidate (1,251 documents).

The example of studies for the prevention of conduct disorder.", "Abstract": "There is some emerging evidence in medicine that larger clinical trials tend to be associated with smaller effect sizes. Much of the evidence-base currently informing practice in Child Psychiatry relies on relatively small trials. We therefore investigated the relationship between trial size and effect size in research within a key area of child mental health.\nA recent systematic review of 20 trials of prevention of conduct disorder was subjected to meta-regression, to examine the relationship between study size and effect size, and to explore hypothesised confounding variables.\nIn this sample of studies, reported effect size was inversely related to sample size. This effect is not explained by year of publication, intervention type or quality of methodology in the study.\nOur finding is consistent with other reports in the literature.

While anecdotally supportive medical educational initiatives appear of value, little quantitative evidence exists to demonstrate whether such initiatives can deliver comparable educational standards. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an undergraduate psychiatry course given by UK psychiatrists in Malawi by studying University of Malawi and Edinburgh University medical students' performance on an MCQ examination paper.\nAn undergraduate psychiatry course followed by an MCQ exam was delivered by the SMMHEP to 57 Malawi medical students. This same MCQ exam was given to 71 Edinburgh University medical students who subsequently sat their own Edinburgh University examination.\nThere were no significant differences between Edinburgh students' performance on the Malawi exam and their own Edinburgh University exam. (p = 0.65). This would suggest that the Malawi exam is a comparable standard to the Edinburgh exam. Malawi students marks ranged from 52.4%-84.6%. Importantly 84.4% of Malawi students scored above 60% on their exam which would equate to a hypothetical pass by UK university standards.\nThe support of an undergraduate course in an African setting by high income country specialists can attain a high percentage pass rate by UK standards.

Consequently, the lack of HPA axis responses following the undisputable psychological stress of a panic attack stands out as one of the most intriguing findings of contemporary psychiatry. On the other hand, the defensive behaviors and aversive emotions produced by stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) have been proposed as a model of panic attacks. Therefore, we examined whether the plasma levels of 'stress hormones' corticotropin and prolactin show any change following the DPAG-evoked freezing and flight behaviors of the rat. Rats bearing an electrode into the DPAG and an intra-atrial catheter were stimulated at 9:00 a.m., 18-24 h after the catheter implantation. Blood samples were withdrawn just before 1-min stimulation of DPAG, immediately after (5 or 15 min) and throughout 3 to 27 h following stimulation. In another experiment, samples were withdrawn either before or following a prolonged stimulation (5 min) of the DPAG with flight threshold intensity. Hormones were measured by either chemiluminescent or double-antibody immunoassays. Hormone plasma levels following freezing and flight behaviors were compared to those of resting or restraint-stressed rats. Data show that stress hormones remain unaltered following the DPAG-evoked defensive behaviors. Not even the 5-min stimulation of DPAG with the flight threshold intensity changed corticotropin plasma levels significantly. As far as we known, this is the first demonstration of the lack of stress hormone responses following the intense emotional arousal and physical exertion of a fear-like behavior in rats. Data add new evidence of DPAG involvement in spontaneous panic attacks."}, {"Title": "Alcoholism leads to early perceptive alterations, independently of comorbid depressed state: an ERP study.", "Abstract": "Alcoholism is associated with a deficit in the processing of emotional facial expressions (EFE) and with a delayed P3b component, partially mediated by earlier perceptive deficits (P100, N170). Since alcohol dependence often occurs with depression, we aim at investigating whether classical event-related potentials (ERP) alterations observed in alcoholism are modulated or not by depression.\nFour groups (controls; alcoholics; depressed; alcoholics-depressed) of 12 participants performed two different discrimination tasks, a gender and an emotional one. They had to decide as quickly as possible about the gender or the emotion displayed by facial stimuli during an ERP recording session (32 channels). Reaction times (RTs), P100, N100, N170 and P3b were recorded.\nAt the behavioural level, control participants discriminated EFE (but not gender) more rapidly than the three other groups. At the ERP level, the differences observed on RTs for emotional task were neurophysiologically indexed by a delayed P3b component. This delay was associated with earlier ERP alterations (P100, N100, N170), but only in participants suffering from alcohol dependence, in association or not with depression.\nOn the one hand, individuals with alcoholism, associated or not with a comorbid depression, were impaired in the processing of EFE. This deficit was neurophysiologically indexed by early perceptive (P100, N100, N170) and decisional (P3b) alterations. On the other hand, non-alcoholic patients with depression only exhibited P3b impairment. These results lead to potential implications concerning the usefulness of the ERP for the differential diagnosis in psychiatry, notably concerning the comorbidities in alcoholism."}, {"Title": "Let's get physical!

None of the letters contained information relating to a physical examination. Only one in twenty had information on investigations despite 4 out of 10 patients in the sample presenting to the GP with somatic symptoms.\nDetails of physical examination and blood tests are not routinely included in referral letters to general psychiatry.

As it has increasingly become a focus in mainstream psychiatry, however, it has also become clear both that the concept is often used in multiple ways, and that it lacks a strong scientific basis. In this review, we argue that such a scientific basis is necessary for the concept of recovery to have a significant long-term impact on the way that schizophrenia is understood and treated. The discussion focuses on key issues necessary to establish this scientific agenda, including: 1) differences in definitions of recovery and their implications for studying recovery processes and outcomes; 2) key research questions; 3) the implications of data from outcome studies for understanding what is possible for people diagnosed with schizophrenia; 4) factors that facilitate recovery processes and outcomes, and methods for studying these issues; and 5) recovery-oriented treatment, including issues raised by peer support. Additional conceptual issues that have not received sufficient attention in the literature are then noted, including the role of evidence-based practices in recovery-oriented care, recovery-oriented care for elderly people with schizophrenia, trauma treatment and trauma-informed care, and the role of hospitals in recovery-oriented treatment. Consideration of these issues may help to organize approaches to the study of recovery, and in doing so, improve the impact of recovery-based initiatives."}, {"Title": "Adolescents' attitudes toward schizophrenia, depression and PTSD.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare adolescents' attitudes toward schizophrenia, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Results indicated that stigmatizing attitudes toward PTSD were at the same level as attitudes toward depression and were less stigmatizing than were attitudes toward schizophrenia. Negative attitudes were the lowest among medical students. Gender differences existed only for attitudes toward depression. Stigmatizing attitudes toward PTSD were not as high as expected.

The mailing included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), measuring acute sleepiness, and a new Sleep Deprivation Impact (SDI) scale, consisting of 12 items designed to measure the perceived impact of sleep deprivation on an individual's own performance.\nOverall, 62.5% of surgery (95/152) and 59.5% of non-surgery residents (194/326) completed the survey. Surgery residents reported working longer hours per week (83.0 versus 62.5 hours; P < 0.01), and scored higher on the ESS (12.8 versus 9.2; P < 0.01) compared with other residents. Surgery residents scored significantly lower than others on the SDI scale (45.2 versus 51.5, P < 0.01), indicating less perceived impact of sleep deprivation on performance.\nThese results are consistent with the presence of an underlying culture within surgery in which individuals may be less willing to accept a natural limitation of individual performance.

Four weeks prior to admission, she had a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) with cough which was treated with over-the-counter cough syrup. After resolution of the URI, she developed a persistent cough that turned into a \"bark\"-like vocalization. Both the mother and patient demonstrated the bark as an \"arf\" sound like that of a small dog at times, a large dog at others. These vocalizations were unrelenting, occurring 3-10 times per minute only while awake. They were not precipitated by any known factors nor were there alleviating factors. She could not voluntarily suppress the sound. In addition to the vocalizations, episodes of generalized shaking of the extremities began 2 weeks prior to admission. According to Erica's mother, each episode lasted about 10-60 seconds and occurred 30-40 times a day only when she was awake. These episodes were not rhythmic or symmetric, and they were not associated with bowel or bladder incontinence. There was no alteration of consciousness following the episodes. Erica denied any recollection of the barking or shaking.The medical evaluation did not reveal an etiology. It included a complete physical examination, a neurological examination, biochemical laboratory studies, and a negative video EEG study that captured 10 episodes of shaking.

Psychometric properties of the Spanish adaptation of the MDQ in psychiatry are described.\nThe MDQ is a self-administered questionnaire comprising a list of 13 hypomanic symptoms and two questions about concurrence of symptoms and functional impairment caused by the symptoms. We selected patients from 15 psychiatric outpatient departments, diagnosed with BD type I and II (BDI and BDII) and major depression (MD) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (concurrent validity instrument). A control group of healthy subjects (HS) was selected. The patient-selection criteria included stability of the disorder and pharmacological treatment. The MDQ was administered to 236 subjects, distributed among the four groups, on two occasions, four weeks apart. We analysed the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminative capacity of the MDQ for the detection of patients with BD.\nConcurrent validity based on diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR was 0.83.

Although the European Board of Medical Specialists recognizes awareness of cultural issues as a core component of the psychiatry specialization, few medical schools provide training in cultural issues. Cultural competence represents a comprehensive response to the mental health care needs of immigrant and ethnic minority patients. Cultural competence training involves the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that can improve the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment. Cognitive cultural competence involves awareness of the various ways in which culture, immigration status, and race impact psychosocial development, psychopathology, and therapeutic transactions. Technical cultural competence involves the application of cognitive cultural competence, and requires proficiency in intercultural communication, the capacity to develop a therapeutic relationship with a culturally different patient, and the ability to adapt diagnosis and treatment in response to cultural difference. Perhaps the greatest challenge in cultural competence training involves the development of attitudinal competence inasmuch as it requires exploration of cultural and racial preconceptions.

The latter is not only a function of the dose administered, but also of the extent and rate of drug absorption, distribution, tissue binding, biotransformation, and excretion, which can vary markedly between individual patients due to differences in gender, age, morbidity, smoking or eating habits, differential expression of drug metabolising enzymes or drug transporters or other factors. Therefore drug concentrations in blood resulting after a given dose differ by tenfold or more between individual patients. For psychoactive drugs, animal studies have shown that plasma concentrations of psychotropic drugs correlate well with concentrations in the target organ, the brain. In the brain of patients treated with antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs clear-cut relationships were found between plasma concentrations of the drug and occupancy of dopamine receptors or serotonin uptake sites by positron emission tomography (PET). Monitoring concentrations of psychoactive drugs in plasma of patients, so called therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), is therefore useful to adjust dosages for optimal \"receptor\" blockade. TDM is well established for mood stabilizers and anticonvulsant drugs. For other neuropsychiatric drugs, however, \"routine\" TDM is rare. Optimal target concentrations are unclear for many drugs, and the number of laboratories that use reliable methods to measure the low concentrations of the drugs within a single day is quite limited. Moreover, the use of TDM in practice is far from optimal. The TDM group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP see http://www.agnp.de/) has published literature-based guidelines for optimal use of TDM in psychiatry. TDM can be most informative to solve problems underlying the treatment of an individual patient. It can be clarified if suggested non-compliance or insufficient response in spite of recommended doses is due to rapid metabolism of the drug. Moreover, many drug interactions have been detected by using TDM. In conclusion, TDM is a reliable tool to optimise psychopharmacotherapy. When used adequately it is helpful for many psychiatric patients and in many situations."}, {"Title": "Refinement of diagnosis and disease classification in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Knowledge concerning the classification of mental disorders progressed substantially with the use of DSM III-IV and IDCD 10 because it was based on observed data, with precise definitions. These classifications a priori avoided to generate definitions related to etiology or treatment response. They are based on a categorical approach where diagnostic entities share common phenomenological features. Modifications proposed or discussed are related to the weak validity of the classification strategy described above. (a) Disorders are supposed to be independent but the current coexistence of two or more disorders is the rule; (b) They also are supposed to have stability, however anxiety disorders most of the time precede major depression. For GAD age at onset, family history, biology and symptomatology are close to those of depression. As a consequence broader entities such as depression-GAD spectrum, panic-phobias spectrum and OCD spectrum including eating disorders and pathological gambling are taken into consideration; (c) Diagnostic categories use thresholds to delimitate a border with normals. This creates \"subthreshold\" conditions. The relevance of such conditions is well documented. Measuring the presence and severity of different dimensions, independent from a threshold, will improve the relevance of the description of patients pathology. In addition, this dimensional approach will improve the problems posed by the mutually exclusive diagnoses (depression and GAD, schizophrenia and depression); (d) Some disorders are based on the coexistence of different dimensions. Patients may present only one set of symptoms and have different characteristics, evolution and response to treatment. An example would be negative symptoms in Schizophrenia; (e) Because no etiological model is available and most measures are subjective, objective measures (cognitive, biological) and genetics progresses created important hopes. None of these measures is pathognomonic and most appear to be related to risk factors especially at certain periods when associated with environmental events. One of the major aims for a classification of patients is to identify groups to whom a best possible therapeutic strategy can be proposed. Drugs may improve fear extinction while the genetic and/or acquired avoidance may be called phobia. The basic mechanism and or the corresponding phenotype should appear in the classification. Progresses in early identification of disturbances by taking into account all the information available (prodromal symptoms, cognitive, biological, imaging, genetic, family information) are crucial for the future therapeutic strategy: prevention."}, {"Title": "[New ways in psychiatric diagnostics?].", "Abstract": "There is an increasing criticism of the current operational diagnostic approach of ICD-10 and DSM-IV in psychiatry.

In conclusion, a multiaxial diagnostic model is suggested that comprises the axes \"syndromes\", \"course types\" and \"etiology\" and that may provide a bridge between the traditional categorical diagnostic approach and dimensional models."}, {"Title": "When prototypes are not best: judgments made by children with autism.", "Abstract": "The current study used a factorial comparison experimental design to investigate conflicting findings on prototype effects shown by children with autism (Klinger and Dawson, Dev Psychopathol 13:111-124, 2001; Molesworth et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 46:661-672, 2005). The aim was to see whether children with high-functioning autism could demonstrate prototype effects via categorization responses and whether failure to do so was related to difficulty understanding ambiguous task demands. Two thirds of the autism group did show an effect. The remainder, a sub-group defined by performance on a control task, did not. The discussion focuses on the influence of heterogeneity within the autism group and the ability to resolve ambiguity on task performance. Finally, an alternative experimental design is recommended for further research into these issues."}, {"Title": "Results from the Scottish National HAI Prevalence Survey.", "Abstract": "A national point prevalence survey was undertaken over the period of one calendar year in Scotland from October 2005 to October 2006. The prevalence of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) was 9.5% in acute hospitals and 7.3% in non-acute hospitals. The highest prevalence of HAI in acute hospital inpatients was found in the following specialties: care of the elderly (11.9%), surgery (11.2%), medicine (9.6%) and orthopaedics (9.2%). The lowest prevalence was found in obstetrics (0.9%). The most common types of HAI in acute hospital inpatients were: urinary tract infections (17.9% of all HAI), surgical site infections (15.9%) and gastrointestinal infections (15.4%). In non-acute hospitals one in ten inpatients in two specialties (combined) - medicine (11.4%) and care of the elderly (7.8%) - was found to have HAI, and one in 20 inpatients in psychiatry (5.0%) had HAI. In non-acute hospital patients, urinary tract infections were frequent (28.1% of all HAI) and similarly skin and soft tissue infection (26.8% of all HAI). When combined, these two HAI types affected 4% of all the inpatients in non-acute hospitals. This is the first survey of its kind in Scotland and describes the burden of HAI at a national level."}, {"Title": "Correcting biases in psychiatric diagnostic practice in Northwest Russia: comparing the impact of a general educational program and a specific diagnostic training program.", "Abstract": "A general education in psychiatry does not necessary lead to good diagnostic skills. Specific training programs in diagnostic coding are established to facilitate implementation of ICD-10 coding practices. However, studies comparing the impact of these two different educational approaches on diagnostic skills are lacking. The aim of the current study was to find out if a specific training program in diagnostic coding improves the diagnostic skills better than a general education program, and if a national bias in diagnostic patterns can be minimised by a specific training in diagnostic coding.\nA pre post design study with two groups was carried in the county of Archangelsk, Russia. The control group (39 psychiatrists) took the required course (general educational program), while the intervention group (45 psychiatrists) were given a specific training in diagnostic coding. Their diagnostic skills before and after education were assessed using 12 written case-vignettes selected from the entire spectrum of psychiatric disorders.\nThere was a significant improvement in diagnostic skills in both the intervention group and the control group. However, the intervention group improved significantly more than did the control group. The national bias was partly corrected in the intervention group but not to the same degree in the control group. When analyzing both groups together, among the background factors only the current working place impacted the outcome of the intervention.\nEstablishing an internationally accepted diagnosis seems to be a special skill that requires specific training and needs to be an explicit part of the professional educational activities of psychiatrists. It does not appear that that skill is honed without specific training. The issue of national diagnostic biases should be taken into account in comparative cross-cultural studies of almost any character. The mechanisms of such biases are complex and need further consideration in future research. Future research should also address the question as to whether the observed improvement in diagnostic skills after specific training actually leads to changes in routine diagnostic practice."}, {"Title": "[Operational criteria for diagnosis of dementia in primary care].", "Abstract": "Dementia is a chronic progressive mental disorder, which adversely affects different domains as memory, thinking, comprehension, judgment, orientation, calculation or language. People with dementia eventually lose the ability to carry out routine daily activities such as dressing, toileting, traveling and handling money. Memory impairment and dementia are commonly seen by physicians in multiple disciplines including primary care, geriatrics, neurology, and psychiatry. We discuss the pros and cons of brief cognitive tests such as the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) and test for executive functions to detect cognitive impairment in community patients. Diagnosis must meet standard diagnostic criteria, including tests of cognitive, global and behavioral functioning and activities of daily living. Preliminary diagnosis often takes place in primary care, usually followed by specialist assessment. In this paper we discuss operational criteria for diagnosis in primary care. An algorithm for practical physicians is proposed."}, {"Title": "Objective structured clinical interview training using a virtual human patient.", "Abstract": "Effective interview skills are a core competency for psychiatry residents and developing psychotherapists. Although schools commonly make use of standardized patients to teach interview skills, the diversity of the scenarios standardized patients can characterize is limited by availability of human actors. Further, there is the economic concern related to the time and money needed to train standardized patients. Perhaps most damaging is the \"standardization\" of standardized patients -- will they in fact consistently proffer psychometrically reliable and valid interactions with the training clinicians. Virtual Human Agent (VHA) technology has evolved to a point where researchers may begin developing mental health applications that make use of virtual reality patients. The work presented here is a preliminary attempt at what we believe to be a large application area. Herein we describe an ongoing study of our virtual patients (VP). We present an approach that allows novice mental health clinicians to conduct an interview with a virtual character that emulates an adolescent male with conduct disorder. This study illustrates the ways in which a variety of core research components developed at the University of Southern California facilitates the rapid development of mental health applications."}, {"Title": "A genetic decomposition of the association between parasomnias and dyssomnias in 8-year-old twins.", "Abstract": "To estimate genetic and environmental influences on parasomnias and dyssomnias and their association in 8-year-olds.\nParents of twins completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire.\nFamilies were primarily tested at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, England.\nA total of 300 pairs of 8-year-old twins and their parents participated in the study.\nSleep difficulties in children.\nIndividual differences in parasomnias and dyssomnias were largely explained by genes (accounting for 50% and 71% of the variances, respectively). The rest of the variances were mainly due to nonshared environmental influences. A moderate association was found between parasomnias and dyssomnias (r = 0.42), which was mainly accounted for by genetic influences (87%). The genetic correlation between parasomnias and dyssomnias was moderate (r = 0.61). In contrast, the nonshared environmental correlation was small (r = 0.10).\nThe decomposition of the association between parasomnias and dyssomnias suggests that there may be different manifestations of shared underlying genetic risks for sleep problems partly dependent on nonshared environmental influence."}, {"Title": "Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: personal follow-up of a 10-year material from an outpatient county clinic.", "Abstract": "Individuals who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience obsessive thoughts and/or urges to engage in compulsive behaviours. The condition causes severe discomfort and, in many cases, leads to serious impairment in social and work-related functioning. During the past decade, the Department of Psychiatry at F\u00f8rde Central Hospital has systematically offered a combination of exposure with response prevention and antidepressant medication to these patients. In this paper, we describe our treatment model, including two case histories, and evaluate the outcome of the first 25 patients, who were included in this prospective study. They were evaluated at the onset, at the end of treatment and at follow-up, 1-10 years after treatment cessation. We employed the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Obsessive-Compulsive Checklist (OCC) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The mean scores for obsessions, compulsions and depression were significantly reduced after treatment. Further improvement occurred during the follow-up period. Effect sizes were above 1.3 on all instruments. Eleven participants were gainfully employed prior to treatment, 14 at the end of treatment and 18 at follow-up. The study included few participants, and rates of improvement were not compared with a control group. We therefore cannot conclude that the positive changes were caused by the treatment, but lasting spontaneous remission among patients suffering from OCD is rare. The study shows that a county outpatient psychiatric unit can utilize methods that have previously been shown to be effective in highly specialized treatment facilities, with good results."}, {"Title": "An uncertain dominion: Irish psychiatry, methadone, and the treatment of opiate abuse.", "Abstract": "This paper investigates some productive ambiguities around the medical administration of methadone in the Republic of Ireland.

This study was deemed important and relevant due to the increasing importance of depression among high school students.\nA sample of students aged 14-19 years from the 6 high schools of 1 district of western Turkey were surveyed. The students selected were all attending the school during March and April 2006. The Beck Depression Inventory was used as a screening test.\nDuring the study, a total of 846 students completed the survey. Of the study group, 51.9% (439) were male and 48.1% (407) female, with an age average of 16.3 +/- 1.1 years. According to the scale, the prevalence of depression was 30.7% (n = 260), 22.6% for males (n = 99) and 39.6% for females (n = 161). The most depression was seen in males (22.6%), those with any kind of physical problem (37.3%), those with diseases necessitating the use of medication (51.1%), those with acne vulgaris (35.2%), and those having previously experienced any kind of problem (47.3%).\nThese results highlight not only the need for students' parents and teachers to be well informed on the subject of depression in terms of students' health but also the need for more education programs to be aimed at students relating to the problems they may experience during the period of adolescence. Furthermore, these results show that students identified as depressed should be referred for an appropriate diagnosis to specialized psychiatry centers."}, {"Title": "How to manage conflicts of interest with industry?", "Abstract": "The use of medications has risen steadily in psychiatry. Perhaps in response, during the past few years there has been increasing scrutiny of alleged unethical behaviours by medical researchers, educators, and practitioners secondary to influence by the pharmaceutical industry. Research is quite consistent that gifts and generous financial arrangements can dampen skepticism, sometimes unconsciously, and thereby persuade recipients to advocate for or prescribe medications that are more expensive, but no more effective, than alternatives. Interestingly, this research-backed premise that physicians can be lured by gifts remains often disbelieved by recipients. Adding to such inducements to prescribe new, expensive medications are pressures from patients due to the increasing ubiquity of direct-to-consumer advertising. Criticism from patient advocate groups, government agencies, and the press has sparked debate within the profession. Many medical journals, academic medical centre research and educational endeavours, and medical organizations are reviewing policies to eliminate, or better manage, their conflicts of interest with industry. The basic ethical standard is that although pharmaceutical companies' primary concern is for its shareholders, physicians' primary concern must be for their patients."}, {"Title": "An international perspective on pediatric psychopharmacology.", "Abstract": "The use of pharmacotherapy for children and adolescents with mental disorders varies widely across countries. More than 80% of the world use of stimulant medications occurs in the USA. The use of antidepressants and antipsychotics is many times greater in the USA than in other countries. Factors likely to influence the pediatric use of psychotropic medications are here examined and discussed. Variability in use reflects differences in diagnostic systems, clinical practice guidelines, drug regulation, health services organization, availability and allocation of financial resources, and cultural attitudes towards childhood behavioral and emotional disturbances. Cultural context seems to exert a greater influence on the identification and management of psychiatric disorders than on other areas of medicine. It is currently unknown if the heterogeneity in treatment approaches results in differential clinical outcomes and prognosis.

In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficient varied from the 0.41 to 0.99 for the different lists of symptoms mentioned above and all were statistically significant (p<0.0001).\nThis questionnaire is reliable and valid for gathering diagnostic information about relatives of probands and thus suitable for use in genetic studies of Cuban families with a history of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Personality disorders from a phenomenological perspective.", "Abstract": "Different studies have questioned the capacity of the categorical diagnostics to establish a clear distinction between the existence or not of a determined personality disorder. The dimensional perspective would approach more to reality, in the measure that it tries to measure the different intensity degrees in which these disorders are present in the patients. But its application is very laborious and besides, presupposes that those categories whose nuances it pretends to measure really exist. The foresaid leads us to appeal to phenomenological perspective, which seems to be more adequate for the study of complex realities, as it is the case of the personality and its disorders. The essential features of the phenomenological method in the sense of Husserl are described, as well as his contribution to the study of personality disorders. This can be summarized in three fundamental points: the ideal types, introduced in psychiatry by Karl Jaspers, the existential types, by Ludwig Binswanger, and the dialectic typologies and polarities, by Wolfgang Blankenburg and the undersigned.

Anger, fear, anxiety, hopelessness attend the diagnosis of cancer. Fifty percent of affected individuals develop psychiatric disorders, such as Stress Response Syndromes like Acute Response Syndromes, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression, Adjustment Disorders, and Delirium. The members of consultation-liaison psychiatry intervene in a wide spectrum of psychiatric complications of cancer. Also, there are patients with major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia who develop cancer and the psychiatrist has to give them an understanding of the illness and to facilitate their active participation in the medical treatment. The main purpose is co-operation between consultation liaison psychiatrists and physicians. Psychiatrists make efforts to promote a better understanding of schizophrenia among physicians and to fight the stigma attached to the disease. The risk of suicide is higher in cancer patients, than in general population and the identification of patients at increased risk of suicide among affected individuals such as those with major depression, alcohol abusers, uncontrolled pain, advanced illness is a very important step in suicide prevention. When the end of life is approaching, psychiatrists have to face physical problems, psychological symptoms and issues of existence, which pose special challenges for the patient.

During the meeting in Vienna, Austria, on day 1, each set of presentations was followed by discussions in small groups with the meeting participants. On day 2, conclusions reached by each discussion group were presented and used as a platform for a consensus view adopted by the meeting participants. The presentations and discussions were collated into a draft that was revised and approved by each of the bylined authors.\nGeneral health care needs are commonly neglected in patients with severe mental illness, with suboptimal integration of general somatic and psychiatric care services, current lack of consensus as to which health care professionals should be responsible for the prevention and management of comorbid somatic illnesses in patients with severe mental disorders, and, at least in some countries, a paucity of funding for general somatic care for patients with severe mental disorders, especially those in long-term psychiatric treatment.\nThe somatic health of patients with severe medical illnesses is too often neglected, thus contributing to an egregious health disparity.

Patient representatives want to participate in political decisions concerning health care. There have been political and legal improvements in recent years, including the implementation of a federal government commissioner for patient issues and the publication of patients' rights. With regard to potential effects of programs promoting patient participation, there are almost no results available for German psychiatry. Pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of user involvement and shared decision making in mental health and have also shown favourable outcomes.\nUntil now there has been no general implementation of user involvement in all areas of German psychiatry.

The aim of DHLPMR is to attract and develop physicians who seek to become capable of leading change and improvement of the systems where people and health care meet. The capabilities learned by residents are (1) leadership -- including design and redesign -- of small systems in health care, (2) measurement of illness burden in individuals and populations, (3) measurement of the outcomes of health service interventions, (4) leadership of change for improvement of quality, value, and safety of health care of individuals and populations, and (5) reflection on personal professional practice enabling personal and professional development. The DHLPMR program includes completion of an MPH degree at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice (formerly the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences) and a practicum during which the resident leads change to improve health care for a defined population of patients.

It has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, and it may also be associated with torsades de pointes and sudden death. Although QT prolongation is consistent with droperidol-induced increases in cardiac ventricular action potential duration, the cellular mechanism for these observations has not been clearly studied. The rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel, IKr, is a primary site of action of drugs causing QT prolongation and is encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). To determine the mechanism underlying these clinical findings, we investigated the effect of droperidol on human HERG potassium channels.\nWild type and mutant HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the current was recorded by using whole cell patch clamp technique (22-24 degrees C).\nHERG tail currents following test pulses to 50 mV were inhibited by droperidol with an IC(50) of 77.3 +/- 9.6 nM (n = 8). The onset of block was fast and inhibition was completely reversible upon washout. Droperidol affected HERG channels mainly in their open and inactivated states. The effects were use-dependent with a stronger steady-state level of block at higher frequencies. The activation curve was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials (P < 0.05, n = 8) and the time course of inactivation was significantly decreased (P < 0.05, n = 8) by 100 nM droperidol. But there was no relevant effect on HERG channel deactivation. The potency for block of HERG channels by droperidol was significantly decreased with mutation of Phe-656 to Thr or mutation of Ser-631 to Ala, respectively. However, mutation of Phe-656 to Met or the double mutation F656M/S631A had no effect on channel sensitivity to block by droperidol.\nDroperidol potently inhibits transfected HERG channels and this is the probable mechanism for QT prolongation. Channel blockade shows greatest affinity for the open and inactivated state.

Limit for diagnostic stability was established as the maintenance of the bipolar disorder diagnosis in at least 75% of the visits.\nA total of 158 (46.1 %) out of 342 patients diagnosed as having a bipolar disorders in the first visit kept this diagnostic constant in subsequent evaluations. Infradiagnostic initial error was committed with 108 stable patients who were not diagnosed in the first visit. 184 patients diagnosed in the first visit with bipolar disorder had less than 75 % concordant diagnosis along the follow-up and could be considered as initial overdiagnosis. Two hundred and nine out of the 443 patients who were diagnosed as bipolar disorder in their last visit did not keep stability criteria in their follow-up and could be considered therefore as final overdiagnosis. Thirty two stable patients not diagnosed in their last visit could be considered as infradiagnosis final error.

Overlap was seen in three other categories: anxiety disorders (F4), personality disorders (F6) and substance abuse disorders.\nInitial course of bipolar disorder causes difficulties in the diagnosis."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and military conscription in Brazil: the search for opportunity and institutionalized therapy.", "Abstract": "Since the fall of the Brazilian military dictatorship in 1984, a number of structural and ideological changes associated with demilitarization and democracy have changed the face of psychiatric theory and practice. Around the country, pockets of innovative, politically sensitive and Marxist-inspired community-based forms of \"psi\" practice are developing. This emergent psi movement is making a range of positive contributions to the lives of average citizens, including those of poor disenfranchized youth. This paper, however, explores one particular dimension of the work of psi practitioners that has proven antithetical to the psi community's current politicized community-based aims. Based on qualitative and quantitative longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork with therapists and young men in Pelotas, this paper analyzes how certain kinds of psi interventions being carried out in schools for a subset of lower-class young men during their early teen years are encouraging some youth to seek military training as a life option. Although these young men initially had quite captivating, engaged and politicized-if also conflicting-interactions with therapists, their eventual disillusionment with their therapeutic and scholastic experiences resulted in high levels of social alienation and de-politicization. In these young men's search for what can best be described as formulaic solutions to troubling psychological experiences associated with a tumultuous institutionalized transition to adulthood, military training came to represent a form of self-cultivation and self-therapy. Several youth also hoped military training would enable them to actively disengage with local political processes and find shelter from troubling social inequities and injustice. The paper ends by reviewing the implications of these results for the future of psi knowledge and practice in Brazil."}, {"Title": "Measuring adverse outcomes in inpatient psychiatry: the reliability of nurse recall.", "Abstract": "Nurses have been used in studies to report on quality-of-care issues and may be the most feasible sources of information about adverse outcomes. To date, however, the use of nurses to recall adverse outcomes of inpatient psychiatric care has not been examined systematically. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of psychiatric nurses' recall of physical restraint episode(s) (PRE) and assaultive/aggressive episode(s) (A/AE) and to describe the factors that influence recall. The study design was prospective and retrospective, and used a convenience sample of 36 nurses from a psychiatric hospital located in a large eastern city. Despite differences in nurse characteristics, perceptions of shift conditions, and organizational characteristics, nurse recall of PRE and A/AE was reliable overall. The majority of nurses actually recalled the exact number of events they had prospectively reported. Furthermore, the period for recall (2 vs. 4 weeks) did not significantly affect the reliability of nurse recall. These results suggest that psychiatric nurses are reliable informants of adverse outcomes. Lacking readily accessible and systematically reported data on PRE and A/AE, nurses may be the most feasible sources of information for these outcomes of inpatient psychiatric treatment. Future research should replicate these findings in other psychiatric treatment settings."}, {"Title": "[Transcultural aspects of depression].", "Abstract": "For many decades it was assumed that depressive disorders are mainly a problem of Western societies. However, a World Bank report published in 1993 revealed that Major Depression is already the fifth leading contributor to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) among women in developmentally disadvantaged countries. The core symptoms of depression are disorders of affect, conduct and somatic complaints. In Western societies, the key symptom of depression is regarded to be a disorder of affect. However, in other cultural settings, different symptoms may be more central for depression. Nowadays mental health specialists have regular contact with patients from different cultural backgrounds. In order to achieve optimal results in diagnosing and treating mental disorders, it is important to consider the cultural background of a patient and her or his explanatory model of the disease. Transcultural psychiatry and psychotherapy aims at developing culture-sensitive concepts for treatment and mental health services and tries to increase insight in culture-related psychopathology and epidemiology."}, {"Title": "Jinn, psychiatry and contested notions of misfortune among east London Bangladeshis.", "Abstract": "This study examines understandings of misfortune among east London Bangladeshis, particularly with respect to the role of jinn spirits.

In combination with the number of active medical problems and dementia severity, independence for activities of daily living (ADL) defined three distinct groups: patients discharged home, patients discharged to a nursing home and patients who died in hospital.\nThe findings suggest that although the key precipitants of admission to joint geriatric medicine/old age psychiatric care are behavioural and psychiatric, these factors are intercurrent, can be successfully treated in an appropriate environment, and do not play a major role in determining discharge outcome. These findings confirm the broad spectrum of need among older patients admitted to acute medical care identified in previous research and support the case for specialised joint provision to address their physical and mental health needs."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry's problem child: PTSD in the forensic context (part 2).", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper was to consider whether the Courts in their application of Criterion A for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the civil forensic context are in harmony or in conflict with psychiatry.\nDiscussed are five cases from the civil forensic jurisdiction that considered plaintiffs' submissions that, as a consequence of some wrong, they suffered PTSD.\nThe Courts have been quite consistent in their approach to PTSD--where there has been conflicting expert evidence as to whether a plaintiff has PTSD, the stressor which brings about this disorder must be extreme (i.e. objectively life-threatening).\nThe Courts have been consistent in their application of Criterion A and, as such, are consistent with what the DSM-IV-TR requires before the diagnosis can be made.

It is clear now that PTSD symptoms can be readily simulated when the simulator is seeking a benefit. It is also becoming clear that some psychiatrists are not being as rigorous in the forensic context as they might be in a clinical context.

The rise appears to have been driven by a reconceptualizing of clusters of emotional and behavioural symptoms in the paediatric age group by some academic child psychiatry departments, most notably in St Louis, Boston and Cincinnati. There is controversy in both the academic literature and public media centring on diagnostic methods, epidemiological studies, adverse effects of medication including media-reported fatalities, and pharmaceutical company influence.

SD is an inflammatory dermatitis associated, in most of cases, with colonization by lipophilic yeasts of the genus Malassezia. However, the exact mechanism of action of Li gluconate in SD still remains unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of topical Li on cytokine secretion and innate immunity. For this purpose, we investigated first the modulatory effect of Li on two pro-inflammatory and two anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and second, the modulatory effect of Li on Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 expression by unstimulated and stimulated keratinocytes. Two different skin models were used: keratinocytes in monolayer and skin explants. In some of them, inflammation was induced with LPS (1 mug/ml) or zymosan (2 mg/ml). Then the skin models were incubated with Li gluconate (Labcatal*, Montrouge, France) at three different concentrations (1.6, 3, 5 mM) determined according to viability MTT test. Expression of TNFalpha, IL6, IL10, TGFbeta1, TLR2 and TLR4 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cytokines were quantified by ELISA methods. Our results showed that the effect of Li on keratinocytes is dose-dependent. At low concentration (1.6 mM), Li enhanced TNFalpha secretion, whereas, at higher concentration (5 mM), Li significantly enhanced IL10 expression and secretion. However, there was no significant modulation of Li on IL6 and TGFbeta1 secretion. Moreover, Li at 5 mM significantly decreased TLR2 and TLR4 expressions by differentiated keratinocytes. As Li concentration during topical treatment is probably closer to 5 mM than to 1 mM, the therapeutic effect of Li gluconate in DS may be explained by two anti-inflammatory actions: an increased expression and secretion of IL10 and a decreased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by keratinocytes. The diminution of TLR2 expression by Li may not allow MF to trigger inflammation response in lesional skin."}, {"Title": "Convergent and discriminant validity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist.", "Abstract": "The Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist (CY-BOCS-SC; Scahill, L., Riddle, M.

Although factor analytic studies have established symptom dimensions of the CY-BOCS-SC, little is known of its psychometric properties. The present study sought to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the CY-BOCS-SC. Eighty-six youth with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and their parents were administered the CY-BOCS-SC, the CY-BOCS severity items, and the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV: Parent Version (ADIS-IV-P). Children completed the Children's Depression Inventory and Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children. Internal consistency of CY-BOCS-SC symptom dimensions ranged from poor to good. The CY-BOCS-SC demonstrated good to excellent convergent validity, as demonstrated by large correlations with conceptually similar items on the ADIS-IV-P. The discriminant validity of the CY-BOCS-SC was also good, as evidenced by small, generally non-significant, correlations between the CY-BOCS-SC dimensions and depressive and anxiety symptoms, OCD symptom severity, and trichotillomania symptoms.

However, the application of GABA(B) receptor agonists in anxiety research and psychiatry is hampered by side effects that include motor in-coordination and hypothermia. Recently the GABA(B) receptor positive modulator GS39783 was shown to be anxiolytic in rodent models, but was devoid of accompanying side effects characteristic of full agonists. However, it is important to test whether such anxiolytic effects generalise to another chemical class of GABA(B) receptor positive modulators. We therefore aimed to investigate the anxiolytic and side-effect profile of CGP7930, the first-reported GABA(B) receptor positive modulator, in rodent models of anxiety, motor coordination and hypothermia. CGP7930 (3-300 mg/kg) showed a modest, compared to the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (10mg/kg), dose-dependent anxiolytic profile in the mouse stress-induced hyperthermia (100mg/kg), staircase (100 and 300 mg/kg) and elevated zero maze tests (3-100mg/kg), but did not have any anxiolytic effects in the rat elevated plus maze. Similar to GS39783, CGP7930 also demonstrated a greatly reduced side-effect profile in comparison to the GABA(B) receptor full agonist baclofen in the mouse rotarod and traction wire tests and did not induce hypothermia. Although the effects of CGP7930 were modest, these results represent a second, structurally distinct, class of GABA(B) positive modulators showing anxiolytic activity. As such, these data support the premise that GABA(B) receptor positive modulation represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the development of anxiolytic drugs with a superior side-effect profile.

GSU counselors completed client severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in need of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most challenged students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of client difficulty, and client need for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC client severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC.

Due to the lack of available biological criteria, evaluation and therapy in forensic psychiatry have so far been restricted to psychosocial and mental criteria of offenders' personalities. Recent advances in neurosciences allow a closer approach to the neural correlates of personality, moral judgments and decision-making. We propose to discuss the introduction of biological criteria in the field of forensic psychiatry and to establish rules as to what extent such biological criteria will be a better and more reliable choice in judging mentally ill criminals by using all available information that can be obtained by biological means. Psychosocial and subjective criteria in forensic evaluation will be more and more accomplished by biopsychosocial and objective criteria. The responsibility of having committed a criminal act will no longer be exclusively defined by judging free and voluntary decision-making, but rather by brain-behavior relationships. What is often referred to as psychosocially determined mental processes thus could be complemented by estimating the degree of biopsychosocially determined neural processes. We conclude that such a process could contribute to a paradigm shift in forensic psychiatry, which will have profound implications for offenders, forensic psychologists and psychiatrists, the law and society in general."}, {"Title": "The latent structure of post-traumatic stress disorder: tests of invariance by gender and trauma type.", "Abstract": "Measurement invariance of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criterion symptoms was tested by gender and trauma type, assaultive and non-assaultive.\nAnalysis was conducted using latent class analysis (LCA), based on findings that the three-class LCA model from Breslau et al.

The classes represent three levels of PTSD-related disturbance: no disturbance, intermediate disturbance and pervasive disturbance, with the last one approximating the DSM-IV PTSD diagnosis.\nAnalysis of measurement invariance showed that, with respect to gender, there was no evidence of differential symptom reporting within the same disturbance class. DSM-IV symptom indicators represent the latent structure of PTSD equally in males and females. We found that more female than male victims of assaultive violence experienced pervasive disturbance. In the absence of measurement variability associated with gender, the finding is likely to reflect a gender difference in susceptibility. The analysis of measurement invariance detected evidence of variability associated with trauma type. Victims of assaultive violence in the pervasive disturbance class report more severe distress (especially emotional numbing) than do victims of non-assaultive violence in the same class.\nThe finding of measurement bias associated with type of trauma raises questions about the applicability of a single definition for PTSD associated with assaultive violence and PTSD associated with traumatic events of lesser magnitude."}, {"Title": "The creation of the concept of an antidepressant: an historical analysis.", "Abstract": "The concept of an \"antidepressant\" implies a drug that acts in a disease specific way to reverse the neuropathological basis of the symptoms of depression. However, there is little scientific research that could confirm this view. This paper reports an historical study of the emergence of the concept of the antidepressant and the social forces that influenced its adoption. Historical literature documents the increasing importance of the specificity of medical treatments in the 20th century and the increased power that they conferred on medical practitioners. In the case of depression, stimulants were used as treatment from the 1940s. During the 1950s the anti-tuberculous drugs iproniazid and isoniazid started to be portrayed as more specific than stimulants, even though their stimulant effects were well documented. When imipramine was suggested to be effective in depression, it was presented solely as acting in a disease specific way and it was soon referred to as an \"antidepressant\". The idea that some drugs have a specific action on the underlying basis of depression caught on rapidly and was well established by the 1960s before any evidence was available to support this view. Forces that could have driven the adoption of this view include the psychiatric profession's desire to integrate with general medicine to improve its social status and to move away from the asylum into the community. Physical interventions and drug treatments helped to boost its medical credentials and antidepressant drugs provided a convenient form of medical treatment for community-based distress. They also helped the profession to counter attacks from the antipsychiatry movement. The pharmaceutical industry too helped to establish and disseminate the view of antidepressants as disease specific treatments in order to distinguish them from non-specific drugs. This study raises questions about the view that psychiatry was transformed into a modern medical enterprise in the 1950s and 1960s by the introduction of disease specific drugs."}, {"Title": "[Dissociative disorders: neurologists and psychiatrists working together].", "Abstract": "Dissociative disorders often have an atypical neurological presentation requiring a complex diagnostic process at the interface between neurology and psychiatry.

Students also reported their gender and specialty choice. Specialty choice was classified as core (internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, and psychiatry) or noncore (all other specialties).\nVicarious empathy significantly decreased during medical education (P < .001), especially after the first and third years. Students choosing core careers had higher empathy than did those choosing noncore careers. Men choosing core careers initially had empathy exceeding population norms, but their empathy fell to be comparable with that of norms by the end of their third year. The empathy of men choosing noncore careers was comparable with that of norms. Women choosing core careers had empathy scores comparable with those of norms, but the scores of women choosing noncore careers fell below those of the norms by their second year.\nThe findings suggest that undergraduate medical education may be a major determinant differentially affecting the vicarious empathy of students on the basis of gender and/or specialty choice.

Thus, the population increase due to immigration does not translate directly into a corresponding increase in the number of emergency contacts.

The objective of the study was to analyse and describe the pharmacotherapy of first episode psychosis in Estonia.\nCase notes for consecutive patients with schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorders admitted to the psychiatry clinics of the North Estonia Regional Hospital (NERH) and Tartu University Hospital (TUH) between September 2005 and September 2006 were retrospectively reviewed by a trained researcher. Treatment regimens were assessed according to prescribed doses, the incidence of antipsychotic polypharmacy and prescribing of conventional vs. atypical agents.\nThere were 234 patients admitted to the NERH and TUH, 142 of which were included in the final analyses (mean age 30.3 years for males, 40.4 years for females). Patients were most frequently treated with risperidone (n = 94), olanzapine (n = 43), chlorpromazine (n = 31), haloperidol (n = 21) and quetiapine (n = 24). Fourteen patients received concurrent treatment with two or more antipsychotics for three or more treatment days. Nine patients received antipsychotics in doses exceeding the maximum recommended doses in the British National Formulary.\nThe pharmacotherapy of first episode psychosis in Estonia was largely consistent with Estonian and international guidelines, however, the use of conventional antipsychotics and antipsychotic polypharmacy remained common.

This study tested 12 PIP5K2A SNPs for association with schizophrenia in a sample of 152 sib-pair families of Indonesian descent. All SNPs had previously been tested for association with schizophrenia in a German family sample by Schwab et al. [2006; Mol Psychiatry] and seven SNPs were nominally associated with schizophrenia in this previous study. The purpose of the study was to examine whether previously implicated PIP5K2A variants influence susceptibility to schizophrenia in populations of non-European descent. No single markers showed nominal association with schizophrenia in this Indonesian family sample, however multi-marker haplotypes including a previously associated exonic SNP marker revealed nominally significant association (P = 0.03). Power to detect association was greater than 80% for all previously implicated variants except for rs11013052, where power was greatly reduced due to the low minor allele frequency of this marker in the Indonesian sample. An explorative study combining the results of this study with those of our previous study indicated that rs11013052 was significantly associated with schizophrenia in the combined sample (P = 0.002). The results of this study suggest that any contribution of previously implicated DNA variants within the PIP5K2A gene to schizophrenia susceptibility in the Indonesian population is only minor."}, {"Title": "Sensory gating in young children with autism: relation to age, IQ, and EEG gamma oscillations.", "Abstract": "Unusual reactions to auditory stimuli are often observed in autism and may relate to ineffective inhibitory modulation of sensory input (sensory gating). A previous study of P50 sensory gating did not reveal abnormalities in high-functioning school age children [C. Kemner, B. Oranje, M.N. Verbaten, H. van Engeland, Normal P50 gating in children with autism, J. Clin. Psychiatry 63 (2002) 214-217]. Sensory gating deficit may, however, characterize younger children with autism or be a feature of retarded children with autism, reflecting imbalance of neuronal excitation/inhibition in these cohorts. We applied a paired clicks paradigm to study P50 sensory gating, and its relation to IQ and EEG gamma spectral power (as a putative marker of cortical excitability), in young (3-8 years) children with autism (N=21) and age-matched typically developing children (N=21). P50 suppression in response to the second click was normal in high-functioning children with autism, but significantly (p<0.03) reduced in those with mental retardation. P50 gating improved with age in both typically developing children and those with autism. Higher ongoing EEG gamma power corresponded to lower P50 suppression in autism (p<0.02), but not in control group. The data suggest that ineffective inhibitory control of sensory processing is characteristic for retarded children with autism and may reflect excitation/inhibition imbalance in this clinical group."}, {"Title": "Management of emergencies in adults with congenital cardiac disease.", "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the quantity and nature of emergencies affecting adults with congenital cardiac disease (CCD) and evaluate infrastructural requirements for adequate management. There is an increasing number of adults with CCD requiring specialized complex care. This multicenter study evaluated all emergency admissions to 1 of 5 centers for adults with CCD within 1 year. Within 1 year, there were 1,033 admissions of adults with CCD, and 201 (160 patients; age 16 to 71 years) were emergencies. Underlying cardiac anomalies were univentricular heart (22%), complete transposition (14%), tetralogy of Fallot (21%), and others (43%). Seventy percent of patients had undergone previous cardiac surgery. The main reason for acute admission was cardiovascular (arrhythmia, heart failure, syncope, aortic dissection, and endocarditis). Diagnostic procedures most often assigned were echocardiography (n = 223), chest x-ray (n = 95), Holter electrocardiography (n = 85), cardiac catheterization/electrophysiologic study (n = 39), and others (n = 143). Forty-six patients underwent surgery (cardiovascular n = 41, general n = 5) or electrophysiologic treatment (n = 41). One hundred twenty-six of 201 emergencies (63%) required cooperation with another specialized department: surgery (n = 46), internal medicine (n = 42), neurology (n = 12), ophthalmology (n = 6), otorhinolaryngology (n = 5), gynecology (n = 5), psychiatry (n = 4), radiology (n = 3), dermatology (n = 2), and orthopedics (n = 2). In conclusion, physicians and consultants attending adult patients with CCD need a high degree of specialized experience concerning the cardiac anomaly to manage emergencies properly. Furthermore, a wide range of noncardiac diagnostic and therapeutic procedures must be available. Data support the demand for a multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers for adequate care of adults with CCD."}, {"Title": "Incorporating clinical guidelines through clinician decision-making.", "Abstract": "It is generally acknowledged that a disparity between knowledge and its implementation is adversely affecting quality of care. An example commonly cited is the failure of clinicians to follow clinical guidelines. A guiding assumption of this view is that adherence should be gauged by a standard of conformance. At least some guideline developers dispute this assumption and claim that their efforts are intended to inform and assist clinical practice, not to function as standards of performance. However, their ability to assist and inform will remain limited until an alternative to the conformance criterion is proposed that gauges how evidence-based guidelines are incorporated into clinical decisions.\nThe proposed investigation has two specific aims to identify the processes that affect decisions about incorporating clinical guidelines, and then to develop ad test a strategy that promotes the utilization of evidence-based practices. This paper focuses on the first aim. It presents the rationale, introduces the clinical paradigm of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and discusses an exemplar of clinician non-conformance to a clinical guideline. A modification of the original study is proposed that targets psychiatric trainees and draws on a cognitively rich theory of decision-making to formulate hypotheses about how the guideline is incorporated into treatment decisions. Twenty volunteer subjects recruited from an accredited psychiatry training program will respond to sixty-four vignettes that represent a fully crossed 2 x 2 x 2 x 4 within-subjects design. The variables consist of criteria contained in the clinical guideline and other relevant factors. Subjects will also respond to a subset of eight vignettes that assesses their overall impression of the guideline. Generalization estimating equation models will be used to test the study's principal hypothesis and perform secondary analyses.\nThe original design of phase two of the proposed investigation will be changed in recognition of newly published literature on the relative effectiveness of treatments for schizophrenia. It is suggested that this literature supports the notion that guidelines serve a valuable function as decision tools, and substantiates the importance of decision-making as the means by which general principles are incorporated into clinical practice."}, {"Title": "What do patients want from their psychiatrist?

They graded them as not important, important, very important or do not know. Non-psychotic patients aged 18 and above, visiting the clinic were recruited into the study before they went in for their first consultation.\nThe response rate of patients was 84%. More than 90% wanted the doctor to tell them the cause of their illness, talk to them about their condition, provide symptomatic relief, let them know that how long their illness would last and make the final decision about their treatment plan. Less than 20% wanted to be part of a support network.

There are a number of modifiable metabolic risk factors associated with some atypical antipsychotics that warrant careful monitoring and treatment in both psychiatric and primary care practice if the risk of cardiovascular disease is to be effectively reduced.\nPrevious guidelines have focused on awareness of metabolic risk factors in psychiatry, yet few articles have appeared in the primary care-focused journals. We present pragmatic guidelines that focus on monitoring metabolic abnormalities in primary care based on established guidelines, including joint recommendations of the American Diabetes Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, and the Mount Sinai conference.\nAll patients receiving atypical antipsychotic agents associated with metabolic adverse events should be routinely monitored for weight gain and abnormalities in blood glucose and lipid levels. Effective communication and collaboration between mental health and primary care services and better access to primary care screening and treatment for individuals with mental health problems are needed.\nThere is a clear need for awareness among primary care physicians, particularly as metabolic effects of atypical antipsychotics such as blood pressure and glucose and lipid levels are possibly best monitored in a primary care setting."}, {"Title": "[Trends in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "New data confirm that antidepressants have a global protective effect on the risk of suicide even if they very moderately and transiently increase suicide attempts, particularly in young people.

The referral letters were examined for the documentation of a number of demographic variables, reason for referral, interventions to date and level of urgency.\nThe clinical records of nine patients did not have an identifiable referral letter at the time of this analysis. Of the remaining 91 analysed, 59% were referred by their GP, 33% were inpatient liaison referrals and 8% from outpatient departments. In the majority, patients' details were given, however, only 30% included a phone number. Next-of-kin was mentioned in 29%.

It shows an increased prevalence of all QOF-assessed long-term physical conditions when compared to the local East London population and national UK population, confirming previously reported elevated levels of physical healthcare need in psychiatric populations.Conclusions This audit shows that the UK General Practice QOF can be used as a standardised instrument for commissioning and monitoring the delivery of physical health services to in-patient psychiatric populations, and for the evaluation of the effectiveness of clinical interventions in long-term physical conditions. The audit also demonstrates the effectiveness of using a GPwSI in healthcare delivery in non-community based settings. We suggest that the findings may be generalisable to other long-term inpatient psychiatric and prison populations in order to further the objective of delivering an equivalent primary care service to all populations.The QOF is a set of national primary care audit standards and is freely available on the British Medical Association website or the UK Department of Health website.

Modern technology using xDSL and other terrestrial network lines but also satellite connectivity is at hand to cover a wide variety of telemedicine applications and services from which teleoncology benefits. More and more specifically designed software applications can be used to assess the medical workflow of an oncological patient and determine a life-long oncological electronic patient record.

However, these protection policies are often implemented before taking into account the specific needs of patients in psychiatric facilities and are clouded by a lack of knowledge, myths and misconceptions held by a variety of stakeholders. Consequently, the implementation of smoke-free policies tends to result in unintended and unfavourable consequences for this aggregate. Patients are forced to abstain from tobacco use during their hospitalization but have few options to address their dependence upon discharge. The development and implementation of such policies should not occur in isolation. It requires thoughtful consideration of the needs of the affected population.

The very concept of the \"patient's perspective\" is a social and historical construct. Despite its remarkable prevalence, the notion remains vague. Mental health research pictures it as a stable attribute of the individual. Anthropologists integrate the contextual nature of the patient view; but they still largely envision the psychiatric patient as a rational actor producing narratives based on common sense. However, in psychiatric practice, the client's perspective is not something the patient individually produces; it is rather shaped by and in a context. To explore this process, my research investigated interactions between staff and patients in a French community mental health center, and showed that the client's perspective is the result of a collective process. Further analysis demonstrates that eliciting or producing the patient's view is sometimes considered a therapeutic goal in itself, since being granted the status of a rational and narrative actor gives access to the most valued model of care, one that is based on partnership. Being an outcome that is negotiated between patients and care providers, the \"patient's view\" then becomes a new resource in mental health settings."}, {"Title": "[Forensic psychiatry in Germany.

We carried out an open label dose-ranging study in 8 mild AD patients in which IVIg was added to approved AD therapies for 6 months, discontinued, and then resumed for another 9 months. Infusions were generally well-tolerated. Anti-Abeta antibodies in the serum from AD patients increased in proportion to IVIg dose and had a shorter half-life than anti-hepatitis antibodies and total IgG. Plasma Abeta levels increased transiently after each infusion. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta decreased significantly at 6 months, returned to baseline after washout and decreased again after IVIg was re-administered for an additional 9 months.

They have to do with how we classify things (diseases), and how we formulate hypotheses (causes). According to a simplified and currently untenable model, we come to defining what a disease, or a protone or a chromosome, is by progressive simplification--that is, by extracting an essence from the individual characters of disease. At the end of this inductive process a single element, which guarantees the unequivocal inclusion in the category, is identified. This is what has been called \"Merkmal-definition\" (Merkmal meaning distinctive sign)--that is, the definition of disease would be allowed by the isolation of a crucial property, a necessary and sufficient condition, which makes that disease unique (and a chair out of a chair, a proton out of a proton, etc). However many objections have been raised by Wittgenstein, Eleanor Rosch and others to this idea: a Merkmal is not always identifiable, and more often a word is used to indicate not a homogeneous and unequivocal set of observations, but a confused constellation with blurred borders. This constellation has been called a fuzzy set and is at the basis of the semantic theory of metaphors proposed by MacCormac and the prototype theory proposed by Rosch. In this way the concept of disease, for example, abandons monothetic definitions, amenable to a necessary and sufficient characteristic, to become \"polythetic.\" I explain how these concepts can help medicine and epidemiology to clarify some open issues in the definition of disease and the identification of causes, through examples taken from oncology, psychiatry, cardiology and infectious diseases. The definition of a malignant tumour, for example, seems to correspond to the concept of \"family resemblance,\" since there is no single criterion that allows us to define unequivocally the concept of cancer: not morphology (there are borderline situations between benign and malignant), not clinical features, not biochemical or molecular lesions. In the case of schizophrenia, the problem of indetermination, as it has been defined, is even stronger. Mental disease probably cannot be distinguished from health in a clearcut way (according to a minimum set of necessary criteria), but it would have a fuzzy border with mental conditions that characterise normal subjects, through intermediate linking conditions."}, {"Title": "Crocus sativus L.

The trained social workers used the HoNOS65+ with 387 patients from various units for older persons within Lentis.\nThe social workers found the HoNOS65+ to be a useful instrument and for each treatment setting and diagnosis it differentiated significantly between types of behaviour problems, symptoms and social problems.\nThe HoNOS65+ can be used profitably with individual patients and patient groups and it highlights the problems in relevant areas of psychiatry for older persons."}, {"Title": "Traces of freud--the unconscious conflict as a cause of mental disorders in the eyes of the general public.", "Abstract": "We aim to elicit how far the public has incorporated Freudian theory in its understanding of mental illness in different countries, focussing on the unconscious conflict as a possible cause of mental disorders.\nWe conducted representative population surveys with identical sampling procedures and face-to-face interviews in Germany (1990, n = 3,078; 2001, n = 5,025), Novosibirsk (Russia, 2002, n = 745), and Bratislava (Slovakia, 2003, n = 1,000) and a representative telephone survey in Germany in 2006.\nTwo thirds of respondents in Germany endorsed an unconscious conflict as a cause of mental disorder. Endorsement was stronger for depression than for schizophrenia, increased with duration of schooling, and was less prevalent in Bratislava and Novosibirsk and in East compared to West Germany. Endorsement in Germany increased between 1990 and 2001. However, only 5% of respondents could offer a definition of unconscious conflict that resembled Freud's initial theory.\nThe observed West-East gradient is likely to mirror the past political undesirability of psychoanalysis in former communist countries. The popularity of psychoanalytical concepts seems to lag behind their actually declining influence within psychiatry in Germany. Public conception of unconscious conflict however hardly resembles Freud's original ideas.\nAlthough psychoanalytical concepts warrant consideration when exploring patients' causal beliefs about mental illness, psychiatrists should focus on the subjective meaning of seemingly psychoanalytic phrases."}, {"Title": "Reduced mismatch negativity in posttraumatic stress disorder: a compensatory mechanism for chronic hyperarousal?", "Abstract": "Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is yet poorly understood in the context of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, e.g. [Morgan 3rd, C.A., Grillon, C., 1999.

A good differentiation of both groups was found in psychometric and electrophysiological data. The PTSD group revealed on most BSI scales enhanced values of psychic aberration. The amplitude of the MMN was significantly reduced in the PTSD compared to non-PTSD subjects. MMN was significantly correlated with the total PTSD score. The data suggest a reduction in pre-attentive auditory sensory memory in PTSD due to specific symptom variables such as hyperarousal, sleeplessness, impaired concentration and a general enhanced excitation of the nervous system.

Computerized Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are suggested to be able to improve diagnostic procedures, but some studies indicate possible problems. Therefore, it could be important to investigate CDSS systems with regard to their feasibility to improve diagnostic procedures as well as to save time.\nThis study was undertaken to compare the traditional 'paper and pencil' diagnostic method SCID1 with the computer-aided diagnostic system CB-SCID1 to ascertain processing time and accuracy of diagnoses suggested. 63 clinicians volunteered to participate in the study and to solve two paper-based cases using either a CDSS or manually.\nNo major difference between paper and pencil and computer-supported diagnosis was found. Where a difference was found it was in favour of paper and pencil. For example, a significantly shorter time was found for paper and pencil for the difficult case, as compared to computer support. A significantly higher number of correct diagnoses were found in the diffilt case for the diagnosis 'Depression' using the paper and pencil method. Although a majority of the clinicians found the computer method supportive and easy to use, it took a longer time and yielded fewer correct diagnoses than with paper and pencil.\nThis study could not detect any major difference in diagnostic outcome between traditional paper and pencil methods and computer support for psychiatric diagnosis. Where there were significant differences, traditional paper and pencil methods were better than the tested CDSS and thus we conclude that CDSS for diagnostic procedures may interfere with diagnosis accuracy. A limitation was that most clinicians had not previously used the CDSS system under study. The results of this study, however, confirm that CDSS development for diagnostic purposes in psychiatry has much to deal with before it can be used for routine clinical purposes."}, {"Title": "[The crisis of the operational diagnostic approach in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Based on historical and current contributions, the operational diagnostic approach is examined from a psychopathological point of view. Operational diagnostic systems in psychiatry are characterised by an atomising approach. In this context, psychopathological symptoms are interpreted as elementary entities which can be combined into a specific diagnostic category. Many years before operational diagnostic systems were introduced into psychiatry, however, such an atomising procedure was criticised by authors like Karl Jaspers, Willy Mayer-Gross or Klaus Conrad. Furthermore, validation of diagnostic criteria of operational diagnostic systems has not succeeded so far using biological findings or results of family and follow-up studies. This may be one reason for the fact that categorical approaches in psychiatric diagnosis are questioned increasingly and dimensional diagnostic models are suggested."}, {"Title": "[At the border of social psychiatric care systems--a study of \"high utilizers\" in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern].", "Abstract": "Research in social psychiatry has partly neglected the problem of comparatively disturbed persons, who are characterized by a shift from the regular social psychiatric care system into homelessness, closed psychiatric treatment or other desintegrated areas.

The International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Irish Journal of Psychiatry were handsearched. Reference lists of previous published systematic reviews, included/excluded trial articles and bibliographies were scrutinised. Experts in the field were contacted..\nAll randomised controlled trials that included older adults diagnosed as suffering from depression (ICD or DSM criteria) were included. All types of psychotherapeutic treatments were included, categorised into cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy and supportive therapies.\nMeta-analysis was performed, using odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcomes were a reduction in severity of depression, usually measured by clinician rated rating scales. Secondary outcomes, including dropout and life satisfaction, were also analysed.\nThe search identified nine trials of cognitive behavioural and psychodynamic therapy approaches, together with a small group of 'active control' interventions. No trials relating to other psychotherapeutic approaches and techniques were found. A total of seven trials provided sufficient data for inclusion in the comparison between CBT and controls. No trials compared psychodynamic psychotherapy with controls. Based on five trials (153 participants), cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than waiting list controls (WMD -9.85, 95% CI -11.97 to -7.73). Only three small trials compared psychodynamic therapy with CBT, with no significant difference in treatment effect indicated between the two types of psychotherapeutic treatment. Based on three trials with usable data, CBT was superior to active control interventions when using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (WMD -5.69, 95% CI -11.04 to -0.35), but equivalent when using the Geriatric Depression Scale (WMD -2.00, 95% CI -5.31 to 1.32).\nOnly a small number of studies and patients were included in the meta-analysis. If taken on their own merit, the findings do not provide strong support for psychotherapeutic treatments in the management of depression in older people. However, the findings do reflect those of a larger meta-analysis that included patients with broader age ranges, suggesting that CBT may be of potential benefit."}, {"Title": "[The next consensus for the irritable bowel syndrome has to be interdisciplinary].", "Abstract": "The publication of the Rome III consensus on functional bowel disorders one year ago has raised the question of whether a revision of the 1999 Celle consensus on the irritable bowel syndrome is necessary and who should be involved in this consensus.

The main reason is the paucity of scientific evidence to show that pharmacogenetic testing leads to improved clinical outcomes. Moreover, for most pharmacogenetic tests (such as tests for genetic variants of cytochrome P450 enzymes) a detailed knowledge of pharmacology is a prerequisite for application in clinical practice, and both physicians and pharmacists might find it difficult to interpret the clinical value of pharmacogenetic test results. Guidelines that link the result of a pharmacogenetic test to therapeutic recommendations might help to overcome these problems, but such guidelines are only sparsely available. In 2001, an early step was taken to develop such guidelines for the therapeutic use of antidepressants, and these included CYP2D6-related dose recommendations drawn from pharmacokinetic study data. However, the use of such recommendations in routine clinical practice remains difficult, because they are currently outside the ambit of the clinical environment and are not accessible during the decision-making process by physicians and pharmacists, namely the prescription and dispensing of drugs."}, {"Title": "[Cognitive milieu therapy and restraint within dual diagnosis populations].", "Abstract": "The use of restraint is common practice within psychiatry and is most frequently used with patients with a co-occurring serious mental illness and substance abuse or dual diagnosis.

In this paper, we analyse these arguments in relation to an idealized case, where a person with a mental disorder claims not to want medical treatment for religious reasons. We also discuss who should decide what in situations where patients with mental disorders deny treatment on seemingly rational grounds. We conclude that, in principle, coercive treatment cannot be defended for the sake of protecting others. While coercive actions can be acceptable in order to protect close family and others, medical treatment is not justified for such reasons but should be given only in the interest of patients. Coercive treatment may be required in order to promote the patient's health interests, but health interests have to waive if they go against the autonomous interests of the patient. We argue that non-autonomous patients can have reasons, rooted in their deeply-set values, to renounce compulsory institutional treatment, and that such reasons should be respected unless it can be assumed that their new predicaments have caused them to change their views."}, {"Title": "Integrative mental health care: from theory to practice, Part 2.", "Abstract": "Integrative approaches will lead to more accurate and different understandings of mental illness. Beneficial responses to complementary and alternative therapies provide important clues about the phenomenal nature of the human body in space-time and disparate biological, informational, and energetic factors associated with normal and abnormal psychological functioning. The conceptual framework of contemporary Western psychiatry includes multiple theoretical viewpoints, and there is no single best explanatory model of mental illness. Future theories of mental illness causation will not depend exclusively on empirical verification of strictly biological processes but will take into account both classically described biological processes and non-classical models, including complexity theory, resulting in more complete explanations of the characteristics and causes of symptoms and mechanisms of action that result in beneficial responses to treatments. Part 1 of this article examined the limitations of the theory and contemporary clinical methods employed in Western psychiatry and discussed implications of emerging paradigms in physics and the biological sciences for the future of psychiatry. In part 2, a practical methodology, for planning integrative assessment and treatment strategies in mental health care is proposed. Using this methodology the integrative management of moderate and severe psychiatric symptoms is reviewed in detail. As the conceptual framework of Western medicine evolves toward an increasingly integrative perspective, novel understanding of complex relationships between biological, informational, and energetic processes associated with normal psychological functioning and mental illness will lead to more effective integrative assessment and treatment strategies addressing the causes or meanings of symptoms at multiple hierarchic levels of body-brain-mind."}, {"Title": "[Addiction].", "Abstract": "This year review emphasizes four aspects coming from addiction psychiatry: 1.

Twenty-nine subjects had TLE (13 right, 16 left) and eight had fronto-central epilepsy (FCE). Each was matched on age and gender with a control subject. Subjects were asked to label the emotions expressed in pictures of children's faces miming five basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust and anger) or neutrality (no emotion). All groups of children with epilepsy performed less well than controls. Patterns of impairment differed according to the topography of the epilepsy: the left-TLE (LTLE) group was impaired in recognizing fear and neutrality, the right-TLE (RTLE) group was impaired in recognizing disgust and, the FCE group was impaired in recognizing happiness. We clearly demonstrated that early seizure onset is associated with poor recognition of facial expression of emotion in TLE group, particularly for fear.

Classic papers in the field of psychiatric ethics and their references were manually searched. Papers were selected for relevance to the topic of the dual-role dilemma in relation to psychiatry.\nThe dual-role dilemma is most explicitly addressed in the literature on forensic psychiatry and military psychiatry. Review of the ethics literature in other fields of psychiatry indicates many instances of the dilemma of psychiatrists facing conflicting obligations akin to the dual-role problem identified in the literature on forensic psychiatry. Many of these dilemmas are characterized by the presence of a powerful third party to whom the psychiatrist has some perceived obligations.\nIn psychiatric ethics, the dual-role dilemma refers to the tension between psychiatrists' obligations of beneficence towards their patients, and conflicting obligations to the community, third parties, other health-care workers, or the pursuit of knowledge in the field. These conflicting obligations transcend a conflict of interest in that the expectations of the psychiatrist, other than the patient's best interests, are so compelling. This tension illustrates how the discourse in psychiatric ethics is embedded in the social and cultural context of the situations encountered.

This has caused uncertainty among patients, clinicians and policy-makers about the relative utility of first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents in its treatment. To reduce confusion and provide a contextual understanding of the new data, the World Psychiatry Association Section on Pharmacopsychiatry comprehensively reviewed the literature on the comparative effectiveness of different antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia and developed this update. Utilizing data from the approximately 1,600 randomized controlled trials of antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, we applied the two indirect and one direct method to comparing the effectiveness of 62 currently-available antipsychotic agents. The subclasses of 51 first-generation and 11 second-generation antipsychotics were both found to be very heterogeneous, with substantial differences in side-effect profiles among members. Second-generation antipsychotic agents were found to be inconsistently more effective than first-generation agents in alleviating negative, cognitive, and depressive symptoms and had a lower liability to cause tardive dyskinesia; these modest benefits were principally driven by the ability of second-generation antipsychotics to provide equivalent improvement in positive symptoms along with a lower risk of causing extrapyramidal side-effects. Clozapine was found to be more efficacious than other agents in treatment-refractory schizophrenia. There were no consistent differences in efficacy among other second-generation antipsychotic agents; if such differences exist, they are likely small in magnitude. Dosing was found to be a key variable in optimizing effectiveness of both first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents. There was enormous individual variability in antipsychotic response and vulnerability to various adverse effects. In contrast to their relatively similar efficacy in treating positive symptoms, there were substantial differences among both first- and second- generation antipsychotic agents with regard to their propensity to cause extrapyramidal, metabolic and other adverse effects; second-generation agents have a lower liability to cause acute extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia along with a tendency to cause greater metabolic side-effects than first-generation agents.

Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most? To address these questions, we review current and potential applications of evolutionary biology to medicine and public health. Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease - and remarkably resilient - precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems."}, {"Title": "Severe eating disorder initially diagnosed in a 72-year-old man.", "Abstract": "Eating disorders in our society mainly affect young women.

Different definitions may have different diagnostic utility, such as treatment impacts.\nStudy aim was to test which definition of mixed depression was more supported, by using, as diagnostic validator, early age at onset on the basis of previous studies supporting its bipolar nature.\nConsecutive 336 Bipolar II Disorder (BP-II), and 224 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) outpatients were cross-sectionally assessed for major depressive episode (MDE) and concurrent DSM-IV hypomanic symptoms when presenting for treatment of depression, by a mood disorder specialist psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV as modified by Akiskal and Benazzi (J Clin Psychiatry, 2005) and the Hypomania Interview Guide (HIG), in a private practice. Mixed depression was defined as co-occurrence of MDE and hypomanic symptoms. Early age at onset (EO) below 21 years was used as diagnostic validator.\nMultivariable logistic regression of EO versus all within-MDE hypomanic symptoms, controlled for BP-II, showed that no specific symptom was independently associated with EO. By ROC analysis versus EO, the best combination of sensitivity and specificity, and the highest figure of correctly classified, were shown by a cutoff number >=3 symptoms, and by a cutoff HIG score >=8. Both cutoffs had similar strength of association with EO. Mixed depression defined by >=3 within-MDE hypomanic symptoms (A), or by a HIG score >=8 (B), were more frequent in EO group versus LO group (A: 70.5% versus 49.8%; B: 60.7% versus 40.9%; p<0.001), and in BP-II versus MDD (A: 72.3% versus 39.7%; p<0.001; positive predictive value for BP-II=73.1%; B: 63.9% versus 29.0%; p<0.001; positive predictive value for BP-II=76.7%).\nFindings could support the diagnostic validity of a definition of mixed depression based on a cutoff number/score of within-depression hypomanic symptoms versus one based on specific symptoms, complementing and supporting previous studies using bipolar family history as validator. Diagnosing mixed depression has treatment impacts, such as careful use of antidepressants added to mood stabilising agents or no use of antidepressants, as recently shown by large naturalistic and controlled studies."}, {"Title": "Arrhythmias associated with electroconvulsive therapy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.", "Abstract": "Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are inherently prone to arrhythmias.

Inmates' perceptions of telemental health versus face-to-face treatment modalities.", "Abstract": "In corrections, where staffing limitations tax an overburdened mental health system, telemental health is an increasingly common mode of mental health service delivery. Although telemental health presents an efficient treatment modality for a spectrum of mental health services, it is imperative to study how this modality influences key elements of the treatment experience. In this study, the authors compared inmates' perceptions of the working alliance, postsession mood, and satisfaction with psychiatric and psychological mental health services delivered through 2 different modalities: telemental health and face-to-face. Participants consisted of 186 inmates who received mental health services (36 via telepsychology, 50 via face-to-face psychology, 50 via telepsychiatry, and 50 via face-to-face psychiatry). Results indicate no significant differences in inmates' perceptions of the work alliance with the mental health professional, postsession mood, or overall satisfaction with services when telemental health and face-to-face modalities were compared within each type of mental health service.

Ireland is soon to witness an increase in numbers of people presenting with dementia, yet little is known about the service needs of GPs when attempting to diagnose dementia.\nTo detail the service needs of GPs, especially their training needs, access to diagnostic resources such as CT and MRI brain scans and access to specialist services such as Old Age Psychiatry (OAP), Geriatric Medicine (GM) and Neuropsychology (NP).\nThe paper is based on survey data collected from a sample of GPs (n = 300) registered with the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) and on qualitative data collected from a Focus Group (n = 7).\nGPs were more likely to blame themselves than either the health care system, their patients or family members for the late presentation of dementia in primary care. Stigma was a major obstacle preventing GPs from being more proactive in this area. Rural GPs felt geographically disadvantaged accessing diagnostic services and both rural and urban GPs experienced considerable time delays accessing specialist diagnostic services.\nFindings provide compelling evidence that training and access to diagnostic services are only two of several different structural and ideological obstacles that GPs encounter when attempting to diagnose dementia.

Usually, the answer is that the schizophrenic genotype is subject to some kind of balancing selection: the benefits it confers would then outbalance the obvious damage it does. However, in this paper I will show that the assumptions underlying such resolution are at least implausible, and sometimes even erroneous. First of all, I will examine some factual assumptions, in particular about schizophrenia's impact on reproductive success, its genetics, its history, and its epidemiology. Secondly, I will take a critical look at a major philosophical assumption in evolutionary psychiatric explanations of schizophrenia. Indeed, evolutionary psychiatrists take it for granted that schizophrenia is a natural kind, i.e. a bounded and objectively real entity with discrete biological causes. My refutation of this natural kind view suggests that schizophrenia is in fact a reified umbrella concept, constructed by psychiatry to cover a heterogeneous group of disorders. Therefore, schizophrenia, as we now know it, simply does not have an evolutionary history."}, {"Title": "Validity and reliability of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Trauma and Loss Spectrum (SCI-TALS).", "Abstract": "DSM-IV identifies three stress response disorders (acute stress (ASD), post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and adjustment disorders (AD)) that derive from specific life events.

The instrument is based on a spectrum model that emphasizes soft signs, low-grade symptoms, subthreshold syndromes, as well as temperamental and personality traits comprising clinical and subsyndromal manifestations. Study participants, enrolled at 6 Italian Departments of Psychiatry, included consecutive patients with PTSD (N = 48), CG (N = 44), and controls (N = 48).\nWe showed good reliability and validity of the SCI-TALS. Domain scores were significantly higher in participants with PTSD or CG compared to controls. There were high correlations between specific SCI-TALS domains and corresponding scores on established measures of similar constructs. Participants endorsing grief and loss events reported similar scores on all instruments, except those with CG who scored significantly higher on the domain of grief reactions.\nThese results support the existence of a specific grief-related condition and the proposal that different forms of stress response have similar manifestations."}, {"Title": "Manic symptoms probably associated with short-term low-dose quetiapine use.", "Abstract": "Nowadays, there is a widespread use of atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics as an adjunct pharmacotherapy in psychiatry clinics, especially at lower doses in several diagnoses. Here, 2 cases are reported where patients with diagnosed schizophrenia displayed manic symptoms on quetiapine 100 mg/d. The cases presented here had no history of mood disorders. It is discussed that the mania/hypomania may be associated with quetiapine treatment and defined as an adverse effect. Manic symptoms may be a 'probable adverse effect' according to the Naranjo adverse drug reactions probability scale, with a score of 6 points in both our cases. Several studies have suggested that quetiapine-induced mania/hypomania may be associated with frontal dopamine release via serotonin 5HT2A receptor blockade. Hence, clinicians should monitor the mood alterations of patients carefully during the atypical antipsychotic treatment.

The present study was a secondary analysis of neuropsychological predictors of functional outcome in our prior CBSST trial. We examined (1) whether neuropsychological impairment at baseline moderated functional outcome in CBSST relative to TAU, and (2) whether improvement in neuropsychological abilities mediated improvement in functional outcome in CBSST. Attention, verbal learning/memory, speed of processing, and executive functions were assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and 12-month follow-up. Greater severity of neuropsychological impairment at baseline predicted poorer functional outcome for both treatment groups (nonspecific predictor), but the interaction between severity of neuropsychological impairment and treatment group was not significant (no moderation). Effect sizes for the difference between treatment groups on functional outcome measures at 12-month follow-up were similar for participants with relatively mild (d=.44-.64) and severe (d=.29-.60) neuropsychological impairment. Results also did not support the hypothesis that improvement in neuropsychological abilities mediated improvement in functioning in CBSST. Adding CBSST to standard pharmacologic care, therefore, improved functioning relative to standard care alone, even for participants with severe neuropsychological impairment, and this improvement in functioning was not related to improvement in neuropsychological abilities in CBSST."}, {"Title": "Public knowledge and assessment of child mental health problems: findings from the National Stigma Study-Children.", "Abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatry confronts help-seeking delays and low treatment use and adherence.

A face-to-face survey of 1,393 adults (response rate 70.1%, margin of error +/-3.5%) used vignettes consistent with diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. Descriptive and multivariate analyses provide estimates of the levels and correlates of recognition, labeling, and treatment recommendations.\nRespondents do differentiate \"daily troubles\" from mental health problems. For the cases that meet diagnostic criteria, 58.5% correctly identify depression and 41.9% correctly identify ADHD. However, respondents are less likely to see ADHD as serious, as a mental illness, or needing treatment compared with depression. Moreover, a substantial group who correctly identifies each disorder rejects its mental illness label (ADHD 19.1%, depression 12.8%). Although women are more knowledgeable, the influence of other sociodemographic characteristics, particularly race, is complex and inconsistent. More respondents see general practitioners, mental health professionals, and teachers as suitable sources of advice than psychiatrists.

By the same token, coercion in health care raises numerous ethical, clinical, legal, political, cultural, and philosophical issues. In order to apply coerced care effectively, health care professionals should appreciate the indications, methods, advantages, and liabilities associated with this important clinical modality. An expert panel, consisting of the Addiction Committee of the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, listed the issues to be considered by clinicians in considering coerced treatment. In undertaking this task, they searched the literature using Pubmed from 1985 to 2005 using the following search terms: addiction, alcohol, coercion, compulsory, involuntary, substance, and treatment. In addition, they utilized relevant literature from published reports. In the treatment of addictions, coercive techniques can be effective and may be warranted in some circumstances. Various dimensions of coercive treatment are reviewed, including interventions to initiate treatment; contingency contracting and urine testing in the context of psychotherapy; and pharmacological methods of coercion such as disulfiram, naltrexone, and the use of a cocaine vaccine. The philosophical, historical, and societal aspects of coerced treatment are considered."}, {"Title": "Dissociative experience and cultural neuroscience: narrative, metaphor and mechanism.", "Abstract": "Approaches to trance and possession in anthropology have tended to use outmoded models drawn from psychodynamic theory or treated such dissociative phenomena as purely discursive processes of attributing action and experience to agencies other than the self. Within psychology and psychiatry, understanding of dissociative disorders has been hindered by polemical \"either/or\" arguments: either dissociative disorders are real, spontaneous alterations in brain states that reflect basic neurobiological phenomena, or they are imaginary, socially constructed role performances dictated by interpersonal expectations, power dynamics and cultural scripts. In this paper, we outline an approach to dissociative phenomena, including trance, possession and spiritual and healing practices, that integrates the neuropsychological notions of underlying mechanism with sociocultural processes of the narrative construction and social presentation of the self. This integrative model, grounded in a cultural neuroscience, can advance ethnographic studies of dissociation and inform clinical approaches to dissociation through careful consideration of the impact of social context."}, {"Title": "New potential clinical indicators of consultation-liaison psychiatry's effectiveness in Brazilian general hospitals.", "Abstract": "The authors identified patients' subjective well-being (SWB), relatives' satisfaction with their information needs, and the medical team's difficulty in helping patients, as potential indicators of effectiveness of consultation-liaison psychiatry.

Unfortunately, such disputes are rarely resolved to the satisfaction of all concerned. The authors discuss the conflicts that may arise among consultants and review techniques that can lead to more effective collaboration. Authors review the literature on consultants' conflicts and discuss strategies for their resolution. They present the case of a man with neuropsychiatric symptoms and discuss how practitioners of psychiatry and neurology often approach differential diagnosis, work-up, and treatment of challenging cases. The consultants were able to find several points of agreement and generated a workable plan that led to improvement in the patient's symptoms. Conflict among medical consultants is poorly described in the literature. However, an understanding of conflict and strategies for its resolution can lead to improved patient care. Conflict is a common and virtually unavoidable aspect of multidisciplinary care. However, effective tools exist that can help physicians embrace, rather than avoid, conflict, and lead to more effective collaboration. Effective management of interdisciplinary conflict improves communication, assists in medical decision-making, and, most importantly, improves the delivery of patient care."}, {"Title": "[German pilot study of psychiatric inpatients with histories of migration].", "Abstract": "The work group on psychiatry and migration of the Conference of Directors of Psychiatric Hospitals in Germany conducted a study on the use of inpatient psychiatric services by migrants in 12 psychiatric and psychotherapeutic hospitals and hospital departments.

However, there are currently no guidelines for variable selection in multiply imputed data sets. The usual practice is to perform variable selection amongst the complete cases, a simple but inefficient and potentially biased procedure. Alternatively, variable selection can be performed by repeated use of RR, which is more computationally demanding. An approximation can be obtained by a simple 'stacked' method that combines the multiply imputed data sets into one and uses a weighting scheme to account for the fraction of missing data in each covariate. We compare these and other approaches using simulations based around a trial in community psychiatry.

Taken together, drug levels and a knowledge of the pharmacological profile of the administered drugs can enable the optimal dosage to be tailored according to the need of the individual patient. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been established for a limited number of drugs. In psychiatry, it has a 40-year-long history, which started with nortriptyline. Evidence has accumulated which shows that TDM is a valid tool for the optimization of psychopharmacotherapy. When used adequately, TDM is helpful for many patients and in many situations. Combined with pharmacogenetic tests, the metabolic status of a patient can be well characterized. Several new observations have been made during routine TDM that have stimulated clinical pharmacological research, such as investigations on inherited differences in drug metabolism that are closely linked to TDM in psychiatry. The contributions of individual forms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) to the metabolism of drugs was elicited by clinical observations on pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring requires a close collaboration between the prescribing physician, the laboratory specialist, the clinical pharmacologist and the patient. This complexity may result in errors which can be detected by analysing the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice. More education has to be provided to the prescribing clinicians on the pharmacology of the drugs and the algorithm of TDM. Moreover, clinical trials should include measurements of blood concentrations during drug development to generate valid data on the relationships between drug concentrations and clinical outcomes under well-controlled conditions. This would merely increase the amount of work and costs, as high-throughput methods are now available in many laboratories. Any progress in TDM has direct benefits for the treatment of many individual patients."}, {"Title": "Explaining patients' beliefs about the necessity and harmfulness of antidepressants.", "Abstract": "Patients' beliefs about antidepressants vary widely and probably influence adherence, yet little is known about what underlies such beliefs.

Before patients started antidepressants, interview and self-report measures were used to assess treatment beliefs, depression features, and comorbid conditions. Linear multivariate regression was used to identify the strongest correlates of perceived medication necessity and harmfulness after adjusting for age, sex, education, and the random effects of patients within clinical site.\nPerceived necessity was associated with older age (P <.001), more severe symptoms (P = .03), longer anticipated duration of symptoms (P=.001), and attribution of symptoms to chemical imbalance (P=.005). Perceived harmfulness was highest among patients who had not taken antidepressants before (P = .02), attributed their symptoms to random factors (P=.04), and had a subjectively unclear understanding of depression (P = .003). Neither belief was significantly associated with sex, education, age at first depressive episode, presence of melancholia or anxiety, psychiatric comorbidity, or clinical setting.\nSkepticism about antidepressants is strongest among younger patients who have never taken antidepressants, view their symptoms as mild and transient, and feel unclear about the factors affecting their depression. Perhaps these patients would benefit the most from adherence promotion focusing on treatment beliefs."}, {"Title": "Depression screenings: developing a model for use in a community pharmacy.", "Abstract": "To develop a depression screening model that can be replicated by other community pharmacists, conduct a depression screening in a community pharmacy, identify and appropriately refer patients with symptoms consistent with depression.\nUncontrolled study.\nFour supermarkets in the Kansas City, Kans. and Mo\" metropolitan area, on January 25, 2003.\n18 supermarket shoppers, 6 community pharmacists, and 4 psychiatric pharmacy specialists.\nIdentification of symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD).\nThe feasibility and effectiveness of developed depression screening; identify and appropriately refer patients with symptoms consistent with depression.\nThe depression screening model was tested as a pilot project to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.

In a second study, 42 respondents to an email survey of the authors of RCTs analyzed in the first study indicated they consider it very important to know the magnitude and clinical importance of the effect, in addition to whether a treatment effect exists. The present authors conclude that published RCTs focus on statistical significance tests (\"Is there an effect or difference?\"), and neglect other important questions: \"How large is the effect?\" and \"Is the effect clinically important?\" They advocate improved statistical reporting of RCTs especially by reporting and interpreting clinical significance, effect sizes and confidence intervals."}, {"Title": "[Evaluation of the validity of AD/HD diagnoses in referrals from paediatrics to the child psychiatry clinic].", "Abstract": "To evaluate the validity of clinical diagnoses of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).\nDescriptive, cross-sectional study.\nMental Health Care area 6, Murcia, Spain.\nThe sample consists of those patients referred consecutively to the child psychiatry clinic between July and September 2005.\nThe presumptive diagnosis of AD/HD in the paediatric department referral was compared with the definitive one in psychiatry (gold standard).

The interest was slightly greater among first-year students but decreased in the course of their medical training. About 6% of recently qualified doctors actually work in psychiatry and a larger percentage want to become psychiatrist in five years' time. The interest profile of persons interested in psychiatry differs from that of persons not interested in psychiatry and is different for men and women.\nThe interest of students in a career in psychiatry decreases in the course of their medical training. This is in keeping with the general decrease in interest in any other career in medicine and probably reflects the current increasing focus on only one single medical specialism. The interest profile of persons interested in a career in psychiatry lies more in the communicative and psychosocial sphere and is focused in relationships that develop during long-term treatment rather than on medical-technical aspects. After qualifying as doctors, women with an interest in psychiatry often develop an interest in improvisation, diagnostics and pharmacotherapy."}, {"Title": "The nosological position of apathy in clinical practice.", "Abstract": "Apathy is increasingly recognised as a common behavioural syndrome in psychiatric disorders, but it is conceptually ill defined. The aim of this study was to examine the concept of apathy as it is currently used in neurology and psychiatry, by review of the literature and conceptual analysis. There is no consensus on diagnostic criteria for apathy as a syndrome. Apathy is mostly defined as a disorder of motivation, and operationalised as diminished goal oriented behaviour and cognition. There is discussion about whether an emotional dimension should form part of the definition of apathy. Abulia is considered a more severe type of apathy, but its nosological position is still unclear. A structured clinical interview and a proposal for diagnostic criteria for apathy in dementia have been recently validated. There are several valid and reliable scales to measure the severity of apathy in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders. In summary, apathy is increasingly recognised as a common behavioural syndrome associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. There is a need for consensus on diagnostic criteria to facilitate future research. From a nosological perspective, future studies should examine the overlap with other psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions and further validate specific diagnostic and assessment tools."}, {"Title": "Prevention of behavior problems for children in foster care: outcomes and mediation effects.", "Abstract": "Parent training for foster parents is mandated by federal law and supported by state statues in nearly all states; however, little is known about the efficacy of that training, and recent reviews underscore that the most widely used curricula in the child welfare system (CWS) have virtually no empirical support (Grimm, Youth Law News, April-June:3-29, 2003).

The effectiveness of a universal intervention, KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported) based on MTFC (but less intensive) was tested in a universal randomized trial with 700 foster and kinship parents in the San Diego County CWS. The goal of the intervention was to reduce child problem behaviors through strengthening foster parents' skills. The trial was designed to examine effects on both child behavior and parenting practices, allowing for specific assessment of the extent to which improvements in child behavior were mediated by the parenting practices targeted in the intervention. Child behavior problems were reduced significantly more in the intervention condition than in the control condition, and specific parenting practices were found to mediate these reductions, especially for high-risk children in foster families reporting more than six behavior problems per day at baseline."}, {"Title": "Nineteenth-century British psychiatric writing about homosexuality before Havelock Ellis: the missing story.", "Abstract": "Recent accounts of the emergence of sexology have addressed the role played by homosexuals and sexual radicals in framing the questions posed by psychiatrists. This work has focused largely upon American and Continental psychiatry (with regard to homosexuality), with attention to British sexologists sometimes being tied to contemporary feminist concerns with the sexual double standard. In both cases, psychiatrists are shown to be following other social movements. In the existing work, British psychiatrists of the nineteenth century who wrote about homosexuality have been largely ignored because it appears to have been assumed that very little material existed prior to Havelock Ellis' Sexual Inversion (1897). In this article, I demonstrate that there were a number of British psychiatric discussions of sexual perversions, and that these discourses show an engagement on the part of British psychiatrists with the theoretical issues that occupied their (mostly) Teutonic colleagues, rather than evidence of any other external driving force behind the production of sexological discourses. These sexological texts are either original papers, or reviews of Continental sources, both of which illustrate the importation of sexological ideas into Britain before the writing of Havelock Ellis."}, {"Title": "Public psychiatrists' reports of their own recovery-oriented practices.", "Abstract": "Alumni of Columbia University's Public Psychiatry Fellowship were surveyed to assess their use of recovery-oriented practices.\nA de novo survey designed specifically for psychiatrists was developed on the basis of prior measures and theories of recovery.

Collecting and mapping brains of elite Russians in a structured manner began in Moscow in 1924 with the brain of V. I. Lenin.

Korsakov (1854-1900), have been studied is largely unknown. A report of the results of this study was published by A. A. Kaputsin in 1925 providing a detailed neuroanatomical assessment of the brains. A considerable weight, a predominance of the left hemisphere and a particularly complex convolution of the frontal and parietal lobes of both brains were reported, the assumption being that these brain parameters can serve as an indicator of mental capacity. The names Kozhevnikov and Korsakov are among those most cherished by Russian neuroscientists; they are also familiar to Western colleagues.

In contrast, higher-level phenomics knowledge bases are underdeveloped, particularly with respect to the complex neuropsychiatric syndrome, symptom, cognitive, and neural systems phenotypes widely acknowledged as critical to advance molecular psychiatry research. This gap limits informatics strategies that could improve both the mining and representation of relevant knowledge, and help prioritize phenotypes for new research. Most existing structured knowledge bases also engage a limited set of contributors, and thus fail to leverage recent developments in social collaborative knowledge-building. We developed a collaborative annotation database to enable representation and sharing of empirical information about phenotypes important to neuropsychiatric research (www.Phenowiki.org). As a proof of concept, we focused on findings relevant to 'cognitive control', a neurocognitive construct considered important to multiple neuropsychiatric syndromes. Currently this knowledge base tabulates empirical findings about heritabilities and measurement properties of specific cognitive task and rating scale indicators (n=449 observations). It is hoped that this new open resource can serve as a starting point that enables broadly collaborative knowledge-building, and help investigators select and prioritize endophenotypes for translational research."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia and polymorphic variations in COMT, DRD2, CYP1A2 and MnSOD genes: a meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic interactions.", "Abstract": "Despite accumulating evidence pointing to a genetic basis for tardive dyskinesia, results to date have been inconsistent owing to limited statistical power and limitations in molecular genetic methodology. A Medline, EMBASE and PsychINFO search for literature published between 1976 and June 2007 was performed, yielding 20 studies from which data were extracted for calculation of pooled estimates using meta-analytic techniques. Evidence from pooled data for genetic association with tardive dyskinesia (TD) showed (1) in COMT(val158met), using Val-Val homozygotes as reference category, a protective effect for Val-Met heterozygotes (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.46-0.86, P=0.004) and Met carriers (OR=0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88, P=0.005); (2) in Taq1A in DRD2, using the A1 variant as reference category, a risk-increasing effect for the A2 variant (OR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.03-1.65, P=0.026), and A2-A2 homozygotes using A1-A1 as reference category (OR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.03-3.15, P=0.037); (3) in MnSOD Ala-9Val, using Ala-Ala homozygotes as reference category, a protective effect for Ala-Val (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.17-0.79, P=0.009) and for Val carriers (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.24-1.00, P=0.047).

In many countries, the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists with academic appointments is limited, and child and adolescent psychiatry programs are developed and taught by a small number of teaching staff at each medical school.\nMedical schools should reconsider the relatively low priority given to teaching child and adolescent psychiatry to medical students. The child and adolescent psychiatry profession must identify clear learning goals for a longitudinal developmentally appropriate model of child and adolescent psychiatry education commencing at an undergraduate level in medical schools and continuing through residency and fellowships.

This requires a critical reflection about ethical, methodical and therapeutic problems of the prevention of psychological disorders--especially schizophrenic psychosis.\nStudies dealing with the prodromal stage of schizophrenia point to a successful early detection and intervention. But also negative consequences like stigmatization and side effects by psychotherapeutic or pharmacologic interventions should be taken into account.\nUnder critical consideration of the ethical principles of not causing harm, acting for the well-being and the person's right of self-determination prevention should play a larger role in psychiatry.

In portraying this development, the struggle surrounding the clinical relevance of concepts on the one hand and their reliability and validity on the other are reflected. Thus far, diagnostic reliability has primarily been improved by focusing on externally observable symptoms in connection with expression and behavior. The identification of disease-specific symptoms, however, is principally achieved through the differential description of subjective experience. How this experience is to be explored and assessed remains for the most part unclear. With reference to its founder Karl Jaspers, the phenomenological method is presented as the decisive instrument for the assessment of experience. It is shown that a return to the legacy of phenomenology and a reformulation of the long-standing question concerning the specific symptoms of the schizophrenic psychosis are currently in progress.

From a perspective of C/L psychiatry persisting cognitive dysfunctions, anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in their negative impact on health-related quality of life are intensively investigated. In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD associated with ALI/ARDS, many influences have to be discussed, e.g., increases in CO<sub>2</sub> triggering panic affects, a mismatch of norepinephric overstimulation and cortisol insufficiency, negative effects of high doses of benzodiazepines resulting in oversedation, prolonged phases of weaning and more frequent states of delirium.

Catatonic symptoms were prominent in 30% of this small sample (n=6), more frequent than the 9% reported in a Canadian general psychiatry population of 140 inpatients (P=0.0126). Conclusions. This finding is limited by the small sample size and the provenance from troubled countries for most of the patients. It is consistent with earlier reports of a higher prevalence of catatonia in nonwhite subjects and among immigrants coming from developing countries, and stresses the importance of systematically assessing catatonia in clinical settings.

The goals of this study were to analyse the formation of a multidisciplinary team, the variation of patient types and diagnoses in the Child Developmental Centre as well as the evolution of therapeutic interventions and trends of psychopharmacology in the timeframe 1995-2005. Methods. Analysis of medical documentation on personnel resources as well as general information about patients and applied therapeutic interventions was made. Results. The study results showed that the number of nurses and caretakers was gradually increasing and services became more adequate with inclusion of social workers, speech therapists and teachers. Analysis showed an increase in the following disorders: mood, hyperkinetic, mixed disorders of conduct and emotions, those with onset specific to childhood. The total number of children receiving pharmacological treatment increased. Conclusions. Delivery of adequate inpatient child psychiatric service is strongly dependent on administrative support, presence of qualified personnel, and adequate financial funding. There was a significant increase in the number of certain diagnoses and applied psychopharmacological treatment over the years studied that reflects international trends for treatment, prevalence and comorbidity of psychopathology in children.

A questionnaire was mailed to 2000 consultant psychiatrists drawn randomly from the membership list of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom. Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with a series of statements about schizoaffective disorder and give some basic demographic data. Results. Of over 800 respondents, almost all reported using the diagnosis in clinical practice, but a small minority reported that they never use the diagnosis. Most psychiatrists considered the diagnosis to be clinically useful but there was little agreement about its nature, its relationship to other mental illnesses, its aetiology, or its characteristic clinical features. Conclusions. Schizoaffective disorder is an established diagnosis in psychiatric practice and is valued by clinicians but there is little consensus of opinion or practice in relation to it. Psychiatrists should be careful to use the diagnosis in accordance with current classificatory schemes, and further research should continue to investigate both its conceptual validity and its use in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "[Disorders of sweating in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "During the past few years psychiatric research has focused its interest on the disorders of sweating: hyperidrosis and hypoidrosis/anhidrosis. Hyperhydrosis is the most commonly encountered in practice. In this situation, the total amount of sweat produced is greater than needed for thermoregulation. The disorders of sweating receive the research attention of many medical specialties. This trend is attributed to their high prevalence, their relation with many psychiatric disorders, their effects on the quality of life of patients, but also of the new therapeutic approaches that have been developed (the use of botulinum toxin, surgical methods, etc). Balancing among different suggestions for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, the psychiatrist must be thoughtful for the therapeutic approach. The cases of hypohidrosis and anhidrosis are less frequently mentioned, for which patients hardly ever complain. They are characterized by reduced sweating below the amount needed to cool down an elevated body temperature, or even absent sweating. They may constitute an urgent medical situation leading to hyperthermia and death. Overall, disorders in sweating may be caused by pharmaceutical or hormonal causes.

It consists of 4 subscales (Satisfaction from Materials, Trainers, Program Organization, and General Satisfaction) and a total of 19 closed-ended items, evaluated in 5-point Likert scales, and an open-ended question for general remarks. One hundred and seventy six subjects, who participated in 8 consecutive training programs in psychiatry, organized by the Vocational Training Center of the Psychiatric Hospital of Petra Olympus, Greece, completed the questionnaire anonymously. The sample was divided into two groups: group A (N=112, from the first 5 programs), for the evaluation of the questionnaire's properties, and group B (N=65, from the next 3 programs) for the validation of the results. Principal component analysis in group A showed the existence of 4 factors corresponding to the 4 subscales and accounted for 67.4% of the questionnaire's variability, which were also confirmed in group B. Internal consistency was high in both groups for the overall questionnaire (Cronbach \u03b1>0.92) and for each subscale. Test-retest reliability of every subscale was also high (Pearson's r>0.90). The answers in the open-ended remark question were graded by two independent judges in a 5-point Likert scale, in relation to the satisfaction they revealed, which was highly correlated with all questionnaire subscales but one. For the total sample, the questionnaire subscales showed moderately high correlation with one another (r from 0.629 to 0.706) and even higher with the overall score (from 0.820 to 0.892). The questionnaire's sensitivity was demonstrated by the statistically significant differences observed in the satisfaction experienced from the various programs. None of the subscales was significantly correlated with age (r<0.134), with years in work (r<0.059) or was differentiated by gender. In general, this is a brief and easy to use satisfaction questionnaire for psychiatric training programs, with very satisfactory psychometric properties and relatively independent from demographic variables. It covers the four most important satisfaction components, independently from the specific characteristics of trainees or programs. Thus, it can be used as the main axis of satisfaction evaluation in a variety of programs."}, {"Title": "[Renal failure: Biological and Psychosocial consequences].", "Abstract": "One of the most challenging patient groups that the psychiatrist of consultation-liaison psychiatry is called to work with, are the patients with Renal Failure, since this disease is related to complicated and multidimensional physical and psychosocial problems. In this review, a holistic approach is attempted, considering the biological, psychological and psychosocial factors related to the disease and to specific therapeutical programs as well. The interaction of these factors and their impact not only on the course of the disease, but also on the quality of life are discussed.

Viewpoints differ from the standpoint of psychiatrists, caregivers, ethicists, lawyers, neighbours, human rights activists and patients. There is little systematic research data on its use but it is quite certain that there is relatively widespread use. The veil of secrecy around the procedure is due to fear of professional censure. Whenever there is a veil of secrecy around anything, which is aided and abetted by vociferous opposition from some sections of society, the result is one of two: 1) either the activity goes underground or 2) it is reluctantly discarded, although most of those who used it earlier knew it was needed. Covert treatment has the dubious distinction of suffering both such secrecy and disapproval.Covert treatment has a number of advantages and disadvantages in psychotic disorders. The advantages are that it helps solve practical clinical problems; prevents delays in starting treatment, which is associated with clinical risks and substantial costs; prevents risk of self-destructive behaviour and/or physical assault by patient; prevents relapse; and prevents demoralization of staff. The disadvantages are that it maybe used with malafide intent by caregivers with or without the complicity of psychiatrists; it may be used to force conformity in dissenters; and the clinician may land himself in legal tangles even with its legitimate use. In addition, it may prevent insight, encourage denial, promote unhealthy practices in the treating staff and prevent understanding of why noncompliance occurs in the first place.Some support its use in dementia and learning disorders but oppose it in schizophrenia. The main reason is that uncooperative patients of schizophrenia (and related psychoses) are considered to be those who refuse treatment but retain capacity; while in dementia and severe learning disorder, uncooperative patients are those who lack capacity. This paper disputes this contention by arguing that although uncooperative patients of schizophrenia (and related psychoses) apparently retain capacity, it is limited, in fact distorted, since they lack insight. It presents the concept of insight-unconsciousness in a patient of psychosis. Just as an unconscious patient has to be given covert medical/surgical treatment, similarly an insight-unconscious patient with one of the different psychoses (in the acute phase or otherwise) may also have to be given covert treatment till he regains at least partial insight. It helps control psychotic symptoms and assists the patient in regaining enough insight to realize he needs treatment. Another argument against covert treatment is that people with schizophrenia have the capacity to learn and therefore can learn that they are required to take medications, but if medications are given covertly it may well fuel their paranoia. However, it should be noted that the patient who has lack of insight cannot learn unless he regains that insight, and he may need covert treatment to facilitate this process. Covert treatment can fuel the paranoia, true, but it can also control the psychotic symptoms sufficiently so that regular treatment can be initiated. In a patient who refuses to accept that he is sick and when involuntary commitment is not an option to be considered, covert treatment is the only option, apart from physical restraint. Ultimately, a choice has to be made between a larger beneficence (control of symptoms and start of therapy) and a smaller malevolence (necessary therapy, but without the patient's knowledge and consent).A number of practical clinical scenarios are outlined wherein the psychiatrist should adopt covert treatment in the best interests of the patient. Ethical issues of autonomy, power, secrecy and malafide intent arise; each of these can be countered only by non-malfeasance (above all, do no harm) under the overarch of beneficence (even above that, dare to care). An advance directive with health care proxy that sanctions covert treatment is presented. Questions raised by the practical clinical scenarios are then answered.THE CONCLUSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS: covert treatment, i.e, temporary treatment without knowledge and consent, is seldom needed or justified. But, where needed, it remains an essential weapon in the psychiatrist's armamentarium: to be used cautiously but without guilt or fear of censure. However, the psychiatrist must use it very judiciously, in the rarest of rare cases, provided: i) he is firmly convinced that it is needed for the welfare of the patient; ii) it is the only option available to tide over a crisis; iii) continuing efforts are made to try and get the patient into regular psychiatric care; iv) the psychiatrist makes it clear that its use is only as a stop-gap; v) he is always alert to the chances of malevolence inherent in such a process and keeps away from conniving or associating with anything even remotely suspicious; and vi) he takes due precautions to ensure that he does not land into legal tangles later.The need of the hour is to explore in greater detail the need and justification for covert treatment, to lay out clear and firm parameters for its legitimate use, follow it up with standard literature and, finally, to establish clinical practice guidelines by unconflicted authors.The term \"covert treatment\" is preferable to \"surreptitious prescribing\"; they should not be used synonymously, the latter term being reserved for those cases where there is malafide intent."}, {"Title": "Positive emotions, spirituality and the practice of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT EIGHT POSITIVE EMOTIONS: awe, love (attachment), trust (faith), compassion, gratitude, forgiveness, joy and hope constitute what we mean by spirituality. These emotions have been grossly ignored by psychiatry. The two sciences that I shall employ to demonstrate this definition of spirituality will be ethology and neuroscience. They are both very new. I will argue that spirituality is not about ideas, sacred texts and theology; rather, spirituality is all about emotion and social connection.Specific religions, for all their limitations, are often the portal through which positive emotions are brought into conscious attention. Neither Freud nor psychiatric textbooks ever mention emotions like joy and gratitude. Hymns and psalms give these emotions pride of place.

Composite tissue allotransplantation in the form of face or hand transplantation may present opportunities for reconstructive surgery of patients with burns. The present paper addresses the question \"Could facial transplantation be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of pediatric burns associated with facial disfigurement?\"\nTherapeutic benefit of facial transplantation was defined in terms of psychiatric adjustment and quality of life (QOL). To ascertain therapeutic benefit, studies of pediatric burn injury and associated psychiatric adjustment and QOL in children, adolescents and adults with pediatric burns, were reviewed.\nPediatric burn injury is associated with anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorders. Many patients with pediatric burns do not routinely access psychiatric care for these disorders, including those for psychiatric assessment of suicidal risk. A range of QOL outcomes were reported; four were predominantly satisfactory and one was predominantly unsatisfactory.\nFacial transplantation may reduce the risk of depressive and anxiety disorders other than post-traumatic stress disorder. Facial transplantation promises to be the new reconstructive psychosurgery, because it may be a surgical intervention with the potential to reduce the psychiatric suffering associated with pediatric burns. Furthermore, patients with pediatric burns may experience the stigma of disfigurement and psychiatric conditions. The potential for improved appearance with facial transplantation may reduce this 'dual stigmata'.

Operations were very frequently determined by other people's manipulative or coercive influences. Should the blame be put on the Social-Democrats in power throughout the period (except in Finland and Estonia)? Apart from Denmark, perhaps, local physicians and local services, more than governments, seemed to have strongly supported sterilization practices. Teetotalers and feminists shared responsibilities. How can one explain that eugenics finally declined? Based on a sound application of the Hardy-Weinberg law, the science of the eugenicists was correct. Was it politics?

A study was retained in the meta-analysis if: (i) it comprised a group of schizophrenia patients, compared to a control group of healthy volunteers; and (ii) pain was measured via experimental procedures (e.g. thermal, electrical, or mechanical stimuli). Using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis-2, effect size estimates of the differences in pain scores (all pain scores derived from all pain tests) between schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers were calculated. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. For the composite analysis, a positive, moderate, and significant effect size estimate emerged (N=497; Hedges's g=0.437; p=0.005), suggesting that patients with schizophrenia show a diminished response to experimentally-induced pain.

This meta-analysis substantiates the hypothesis of a diminished pain response in schizophrenia. The study also suggests that hypoalgesia in schizophrenia cannot be solely explained by the effects of antipsychotic drugs, and that it may not be a pain-specific blunted response.

In 2004, self-poisoning accounted for 25% of suicides and open verdicts in males (n = 862) and 45% in females (n = 540). Poisoning death rates per million prescriptions were about 10 times higher for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) than for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), England and Wales, 1993-2004. However, despite the increased prescription of SSRIs and related compounds in recent years, there has been only a slight decrease (some 10%) in the annual number of antidepressant-related poisoning deaths, in line with the reduction in suicides (all methods) over this period. Citalopram appears to have higher overdose toxicity than other SSRIs. Of newer non-SSRI antidepressants, the overdose toxicity of venlafaxine, although lower than that of TCAs, appears to be higher than that of SSRIs, with seizures, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and hepatic failure having been reported. Poisoning deaths involving antipsychotics either alone, or with other drugs and/or alcohol are many fewer than those involving antidepressants (713 and 5602 deaths, respectively, England and Wales, 1993-2004). Following the restriction on thioridazine usage (2000), thioridazine-associated fatal poisoning fell to zero by 2002, but this was balanced by an increase in deaths associated with atypical antipsychotics, most notably clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine. Antipsychotic-related poisoning deaths were higher in 2004 than at any time since 1993."}, {"Title": "Haematological toxicity of drugs used in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Almost all classes of psychotropic agents have been reported to cause blood dyscrasias. Mechanisms include direct toxic effects upon the bone marrow, the formation of antibodies against haematopoietic precursors or involve peripheral destruction of cells. Agranulocytosis is probably the most important drug-related blood dyscrasia. The mortality from drug-induced agranulocytosis is 5-10% in Western countries. The manifestations of agranulocytosis are secondary to infection. Aggressive treatment with intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobials and bone marrow stimulants may be required. Of drugs encountered in psychiatry, antipsychotics including clozapine (risk of agranulocytosis approximately 0.8%, predominantly in the first year of treatment) and phenothiazines (chlorpromazine agranulocytosis risk approximately 0.13%), and antiepileptics (notably carbamazepine, neutropenia risk approximately 0.5%) are the most common causes of drug-related neutropenia/agranulocytosis. Drugs known to cause neutropenia should not be used concomitantly with other drugs known to cause this problem. High temperature and other indicators of possible infection should be looked for routinely during treatment. Clozapine is well known as a drug that can cause blood dyscrasias, but olanzapine and other atypicals may also cause similar problems. In addition to genetic factors, there are likely to be dose-related and immunological components to these phenomena. Important lessons have been learnt from the haematological monitoring that is necessary with clozapine and the monitoring has been very successful in preventing deaths related to clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. Continuing research into the mechanisms of drug-induced neutropenia and agranulocytosis may serve to further enhance the safe use not only of clozapine, but also of other agents."}, {"Title": "Ictal technetium-99 m ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission tomographic findings in epileptic patients with polymicrogyria syndromes: a subtraction of ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to MRI study.", "Abstract": "To describe the ictal technetium-99 m-ECD SPECT findings in polymicrogyria syndromes (PMG) during epileptic seizures.\nWe investigated 17 patients with PMG syndromes during presurgical workup, which included long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, neurological and psychiatry assessments, invasive EEG, and the subtraction of ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (SISCOM).\nThe analysis of the PMG cortex, using SISCOM, revealed intense hyperperfusion in the polymicrogyric lesion during epileptic seizures in all patients. Interestingly, other localizing investigations showed heterogeneous findings. Twelve patients underwent epilepsy surgery, three achieved seizure-freedom, five have worthwhile improvement, and four patients remained unchanged.\nOur study strongly suggests the involvement of PMG in seizure generation or early propagation. Both conventional ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SISCOM appeared as the single contributive exam to suggest the localization of the epileptogenic zone. Despite the limited number of resective epilepsy surgery in our study (n = 9), we found a strong prognostic role of SISCOM in predicting surgical outcome. This result may be of great value on surgical decision-making of whether or not the whole or part of the PMG lesion should be surgically resected."}, {"Title": "Benefits and risks of antipsychotic polypharmacy: an evidence-based review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Combination antipsychotic prescription is an increasingly common practice in clinical psychiatry. This clinical practice is at odds with clinical guidelines promoting antipsychotic monotherapy. Moreover, there has been increased concern over the safety profile of atypical antipsychotics in the last 10-15 years. We reviewed the literature on antipsychotic combinations with a focus on safety and efficacy. Multiple electronic database searches were complemented by relevant bibliography cross-checking and expert discussions. The review showed a literature that is dominated by case reports and uncontrolled studies. Polypharmacy was unequally studied, with some recent combinations (i.e. clozapine and risperidone) being extensively, albeit inconclusively, studied and other more commonly used combinations (first- with second-generation agents) receiving little attention. From an evidence-based perspective, further trials of antipsychotic association of sufficient power to address safety issues are needed before recommending any antipsychotic combination.

Among the top centers devoted to the microscopic anatomy of the brain was that of K\u00e1roly Schaffer in Budapest. Schaffer, a pioneer in the histopathology of Tay-Sachs-Schaffer disease, was also a charismatic teacher, bringing forth a school of investigators in psychopathology. Among them was L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Meduna, who originated convulsive therapy. Despite the importance of the Schaffer school, it is almost unknown outside of Hungary, largely the result of the introduction of neurophysiological, neurochemical and molecular genetic methods that distracted attention away from histopathological contributions in psychiatry after the Second World War. The microscopic study of the brain and its diseases seemed increasingly less important. The present biographical account of K\u00e1roly Schaffer and his school seeks to bring this important story in the early history of biological psychiatry to a wider audience and explain why it has since been forgotten."}, {"Title": "Antiepileptic drugs in non-epilepsy disorders: relations between mechanisms of action and clinical efficacy.", "Abstract": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used extensively to treat multiple non-epilepsy disorders, both in neurology and psychiatry. This article provides a review of the clinical efficacy of AEDs in non-epilepsy disorders based on recently published preclinical and clinical studies, and attempts to relate this efficacy to the mechanism of action of AEDs and pathophysiological processes associated with the disorders. Some newer indications for AEDs have been established, while others are under investigation. The disorders where AEDs have been demonstrated to be of clinical importance include neurological disorders, such as essential tremor, neuropathic pain and migraine, and psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Many of the AEDs have various targets of action in the synapse and have several proposed relevant mechanisms of action in epilepsy and in other disorders. Pathophysiological processes disturb neuronal excitability by modulating ion channels, receptors and intracellular signalling pathways, and these are targets for the pharmacological action of various AEDs. Attention is focused on the glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. In psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, AEDs such as valproate, carbamazepine and lamotrigine appear to have clear roles based on their effect on intracellular pathways. On the other hand, some AEDs, e.g. topiramate, have efficacy for nonpsychiatric disorders including migraine, possibly by enhancing GABAergic and reducing glutamatergic neurotransmission. AEDs that seem to enhance GABAergic neurotransmission, e.g. tiagabine, valproate, gabapentin and possibly levetiracetam, may have a role in treating neurological disorders such as essential tremor, or anxiety disorders. AEDs with effects on voltage-gated sodium or calcium channels may be advantageous in treating neuropathic pain, e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine and valproate. Co-morbid conditions associated with epilepsy, such as mood disorders and migraine, may often respond to treatment with AEDs. Other possible disorders where AEDs may be of clinical importance include cancer, HIV infection, drug and alcohol abuse, and also in neuroprotection. A future challenge is to evaluate the second-generation AEDs in non-epilepsy disorders and to design clinical trials to study their effects in such disorders in paediatric patients. Differentiation between the main mechanisms of action of the AEDs needs more consideration in drug selection for tailored treatment of the various non-epilepsy disorders."}, {"Title": "Personal and societal construction of illness among individuals with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder: a life-trajectory perspective.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness associated with substantial impairment in quality of life and function. Although there has been tremendous growth in understanding bipolar disorder with respect to treatments, very little study has focused on the viewpoint of affected individuals. The purpose of this study was to examine the subjective experience of illness among 19 men and women with rapid cycling bipolar disorder receiving treatment at an academic psychiatry clinic.\nPersonal constructs of illness with respect to life-trajectory and societal reaction to the individual, specifically the issue of stigma, were evaluated using a semistructured, open-ended anthropological interview.\nParticipants perceived bipolar disorder as a disease with biologic underpinnings. Stigma was a major issue for all individuals. In common with individuals without serious mental illness, individuals with bipolar disorder work at mastering developmental tasks appropriate for their life stage. At times, younger individuals appeared to have difficulty separating their own identity from the effects of illness. For older individuals with bipolar disorder, life was perceived to be disrupted by bipolar disorder, with early plans and dreams often \"derailed.\"\nAlthough bipolar disorder may severely alter an individual's planned life trajectory, accomplishment of life goals can at least partially offset the sense of loss that is often seen in bipolar illness."}, {"Title": "Childhood adversity predicts earlier onset of major depression but not reduced hippocampal volume.", "Abstract": "Childhood adversity may influence severity and age of onset of depression, potentially mediated by greater vulnerability to an existing biochemical or neural mechanism. Prior studies have suggested that reduced hippocampal volume is a result of childhood adversity. This study examined the relationship between childhood adversity, hippocampal volumes and clinical characteristics in women who were recruited for depression history rather than abuse experiences. Thirty-one women with remitted unipolar depression and 24 psychiatrically healthy women completed the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse interview [Bifulco, A., Brown, G.W., Harris, T.O., 1994. Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA): A retrospective interview measure. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 55, 1419-1435]. High resolution MRI scans and hippocampal volumetric determination by stereological assessment were obtained. We found that childhood adversity was associated with a history of recurrent depression and with earlier age of depression onset. We did not find a relationship between childhood adversity and hippocampal volumes in this sample with mild childhood adversity. Our results suggest that the decreased hippocampal volume seen in Major Depressive Disorder may be mediated by additional factors. Further research is needed to more fully understand the interrelationships among childhood adversity, hippocampal morphology, neuroendocrine regulation, and other genetic and environmental factors influencing vulnerability to depression."}, {"Title": "New interneurons in the adult neocortex: small, sparse, but significant?", "Abstract": "During the last decade, the intense study of adult hippocampal neurogenesis has led to several new lines of inquiry in the field of psychiatry. Although it is generally believed that adult mammalian neurogenesis is restricted to the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, a growing number of studies have described new neurons in the adult neocortex in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Interestingly, all of the new neurons observed in these studies have features of interneurons rather than pyramidal cells, the largest neuronal population of the neocortex. In this review, we discuss features of these interneurons that may explain why cortical neurogenesis has been so difficult to detect. In addition, these features suggest ways that production of even a small numbers of new neurons in the adult cortex could make a significant impact on neocortical function."}, {"Title": "Causes of schizophrenia reported by urban African American lay community members.", "Abstract": "Although mental health professionals' \"etiologic beliefs\" concerning schizophrenia have evolved in accordance with diathesis-stress and neurodevelopmental models, little is known about etiologic attributions in nonclinical general population samples in the United States. Yet, course and outcome for people with the illness may be indirectly influenced by beliefs about causes in the larger community. Because of very limited research in this area, especially among African Americans in particular, this descriptive study investigated the causes of schizophrenia reported by 127 urban African Americans from the general population. The aim of this study was to assess the most commonly reported causes of schizophrenia, as well as the frequency of endorsing items from a list of 30 factors, some of which are congruent with current psychiatric conceptualizations of schizophrenia, whereas others are not. Results of this report complement previously reported findings from the same setting involving family members of patients with schizophrenia [Esterberg ML, Compton MT. Causes of schizophrenia reported by family members of urban African American hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Compr Psychiatry 2006;47:221-226]. The 5 most commonly reported causes were disturbance of brain biochemistry (49.6%), drug/alcohol abuse (42.5%), hereditary factors (40.9%), brain injury (40.2%), and avoidance of problems in life (37.8%). The mean number of likely or very likely causes endorsed by participants was 7.5 +/- 5.7. Some 47.9% reported one or more esoteric factors as a cause. Of the 6 esoteric factors, possession by evil spirits (28.3%), radiation (20.2%), and punishment by God (19.7%) were most common. Esoteric causes were more commonly chosen by male participants, those with 12 years of education or less, and participants who reported never having known someone with schizophrenia. Future research should seek to better understand how esoteric beliefs about causation affect attitudes toward people with mental illnesses and acceptance of mental health treatment by those individuals.

From the broad spectrum of his psychiatry with many findings, two achievements are particularly meaningful: the schizophrenia monography of 1911 and the first edition of his educational manual from 1916. Psychiatry owes two achievements to E. Bleuler: \"deepened\" psychopathology, which depicted schizophrenic symptoms and their relation, and the importance of psychoanalysis for psychiatry. Bleuler was not a psychoanalyst himself but rather a pluridimensional psychiatrist in the best sense of the word and at the same time sympathetic to psychoanalysis. The reception and historical effect of Bleuler's work are described. Another important subject that Bleuler himself regarded as the central field in his work is pointed out: the fight against alcoholism."}, {"Title": "Should comprehensive diagnosis include idiographic understanding?", "Abstract": "The World Psychiatric Association has emphasised the importance of idiographic understanding as a distinct component of comprehensive assessment but in introductions to the idea it is often assimilated to the notion of narrative judgement. This paper aims to distinguish between supposed idiographic and narrative judgement. Taking the former to mean a kind of individualised judgement, I argue that it has no place in psychiatry in part because it threatens psychiatric validity. Narrative judgement, by contrast, is a genuinely distinct complement to criteriological diagnosis but it is, nevertheless, a special kind of general judgement and thus can possess validity. To argue this I first examine the origin of the distinction between idiographic and nomothetic in Windelband's 1894 rectorial address. I argue that none of three ways of understanding that distinction is tenable. Windelband's description of historical methods, as a practical example, does not articulate a genuine form of understanding. A metaphysical distinction between particulars and general kinds is guilty of subscribing to the Myth of the Given. A distinction based on an abstraction of essentially combined aspects of empirical judgement cannot underpin a distinct empirical method. Furthermore, idiographic elements understood as individualised judgements threaten the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. In the final part I briefly describe some aspects of the logic of narrative judgements and argue that in the call for comprehensive diagnosis, narrative rather than idiographic elements have an important role. Importantly, however, whilst directed towards individual subjects, narratives are framed in intrinsically general concepts and thus can aspire to validity."}, {"Title": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation in child neurology: current and future directions.", "Abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method for focal brain stimulation based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where small intracranial electric currents are generated by a powerful, rapidly changing extracranial magnetic field.

Schizophrenia occurs in all cultures and is inherited. Although most phenotypes are said to be \"selected for\" based on adaptive qualities, it is difficult to understand how the genetic basis of schizophrenia could have operated under a similar framework. This has lead several theorists analyzing the proposed evolutionary origins of other disease states to that of schizophrenia. To date, several models have been applied. We have tried to conceptualize schizophrenia in a compensatory advantage framework whereby incomplete penetrance of the full disorder, or alternatively, the inheritance of risk alleles insufficient in number to manifest as the classic clinical syndrome, may manifest as a behavioral phenotype with adaptive advantages (eg, creative behavior or novel illuminating ideas). The idea that even full penetrance can also be advantageous has been offered as applied to religious experience and ancient social standing, but is unlikely. Can complex behavioral phenotypes such as schizophrenia, and particularly those that seem purely deleterious, be explained by mechanisms of Darwinian psychiatry? Can models from other disease classes be applied successfully to schizophrenia? Such ideas have generated intense speculation, but often in the absence of testable models.

Although the clinical literature favors a \"serotonin hypothesis\" for depression, a growing basic science literature suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) directly modulate neurotransmitter- and voltage-gated neuronal ion channels. In addition, biosynthesis of neurosteroids (themselves promiscuous ion channel modulators), is activated by SSRIs. These non-canonical effects are entirely independent of serotonin signaling, and they occur in the range of SSRI concentrations reported in the brains of treated patients (1-10 microM). The protean impact of these diverse channel targets on neuronal excitability raises interesting and potentially testable hypotheses about depression pathophysiology and treatment. Specifically, emerging network theories are embracing the non-linearity and complexity of brain circuitry and its oscillatory behavior, with clinical correlations in psychiatry and neurology. Is it possible that certain brain dysfunction (such as depression) may be more amenable to a poly-pharmacy approach? The promiscuity of SSRIs suggests that such poly-pharmacy can emerge from a single agent."}, {"Title": "Making sense of neuroimaging in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders has increased exponentially in the last decade; however, much of the uptake thus far has been in the realm of research.

Novel neuroimaging applications with potential clinical utility are rapidly emerging and the accessibility and use of these technologies will increase in coming years. Clinically meaningful findings have begun to emerge in mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and dementia. Coupling multimodal imaging with genetics and pharmacotherapeutic studies will further assist in understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.\nIt is important that clinicians understand the benefits and limitations of modern neuroimaging techniques and are also suitably equipped to appraise future developments. The use of neuroimaging in evaluating psychopathology is likely to impact upon the future nosology of psychiatric disorders, and assist in diagnosis and clinical management. The integrated use of neuroimaging in conjunction with clinical assessments promises to improve clinical care and markedly alter psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Treatment of aggression with topiramate in male borderline patients, part II: 18-month follow-up.", "Abstract": "We previously tested topiramate, an anticonvulsant, in the treatment of aggression in men with borderline personality disorder (BPD) (Nickel M, Nickel C, Kaplan P, Lahmann C, M\u00fchlbacher M, Tritt K, et al.

The objective of the current study was to replicate the [Mill et al.

Participants were 1081 children and adolescents with a research-confirmed combined type ADHD diagnosis and 1300 unaffected siblings who took part in the International Multi-centre ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) project. They were recruited from multiple settings from across Europe: Belgium, Britain, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. The results were that ADHD was associated with reduced IQ. However, there was no association between the two dopamine-related risk polymorphisms and IQ in either the probands or their siblings. Furthermore, other selected genetic markers previously demonstrated to be associated with ADHD in this sample were not associated with IQ. This large scale study with a clinically ascertained and regorously diagnosed sample failed to replicate the association between genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine system and IQ in ADHD. We also observed no association of other SNPs with IQ in ADHD."}, {"Title": "The coming of age of a joint elderly medicine-psychiatric ward: 18 years' experience.", "Abstract": "There is a large population of elderly medical inpatients with co-existent medical and mental health disorders who pose a significant management challenge for medical, nursing and allied staff. Our hospital has a joint elderly medicine-psychiatry unit to cater for this patient group; this article reviews how this unit was set up and presents a representative sample of inpatients.\nThe mean age was 81 years with a female preponderance. The mean length of stay was 44 days. The commonest medical conditions were cerebrovascular disease, urinary tract infections, chest infections and falls. The commonest mental health diagnoses were cognitive impairment, delirium and depression. The mortality rate was 21%; of the remainder, 55% were discharged to long-term care, 40% returned home and 5% were transferred to the local psychiatric hospital.\nThis cohort of elderly patients has complex medical, nursing and therapy needs in addition to complex discharge planning needs. Our unit has a shared care approach, with joint responsibility shared by a consultant in Medicine for the Elderly and a Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry. This, in combination with a multidisciplinary team approach, provides an effective means of delivering care to this patient group.\nA joint elderly medicine-old age psychiatry ward provides a high standard of care for elderly patients with co-existent physical and mental health needs.

One of the mental disorders that was heavily disputed was amentia occulta (hidden madness) first described by the well-known Leipzig doctor and philosopher Ernst Platner. This publication (1797) preluded several other diagnoses to refer to non-obvious, \"hidden mental derangements\". Regardless of the differences in arguments as developed by the experts in question (E. T. A. Hoffmann, Merzdorff, E. Horn, J. C. A. Clarus), two case studies from the early 19 (th) century (D. Schmolling, J. C. Woyzeck) will exemplify the process of medicine, and psychiatry in particular, becoming more and more influential in everyday jurisdictional practice. The above-mentioned Ernst Platner, the author of manifold forensic studies and of \"De amentia occulta\", was one of the pioneers and promoters of this process. By emphasising the importance of mental states being evaluated by medical professionals he contributed a great deal to the establishment of forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Oswald Bumke in Leipzig. Beyond Kraepelin, Freud and R\u00fcdin's Entartungslehre].", "Abstract": "Oswald Bumke is a central figure in twentieth-century German psychiatry, having had a considerable influence on its development as one of its best-known representatives. His time in Leipzig from 1921 to 1924 and subsequently in Munich up to the mid-1930s saw the second major phase in his scientific work, during which he laid the basis for the renown he still enjoys as a result of his specialist encyclopaedic textbooks and manuals summarising the current knowledge of his time. At the beginning of the 1920s he made his stand on the burning issues of the day and thus influenced the conceptional history of the subject. For instance, he proposed his own philosophical psychology, rejecting the experimental psychological approach of Emil Kraepelin. By challenging the libido theory and the dynamic unconscious he weakened the impact of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis on German scientific psychiatry. Moreover, Bumke strongly opposed the prevailing concept of degeneration and its main protagonist Ernst R\u00fcdin. Owing to the political and social developments at the time, however, he was not able to raise much support among his colleagues."}, {"Title": "Low-level neonatal thimerosal exposure: further evaluation of altered neurotoxic potential in SJL mice.", "Abstract": "Ethylmercury in thimerosal-preserved childhood vaccines has been suggested to be neurotoxic and to contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. Immune system function may be an important factor influencing vulnerability of the developing nervous system to thimerosal. This possibility is based in part on a report by Hornig et al. (2004, Mol. Psychiatry 9, 833-845) of neurodevelomental toxicity in SJL/J mice that develop autoantibodies when exposed to organic mercury. The present study reexamined this possibility by injecting neonatal SJL/J mice with thimerosal, with and without combined HiB and DTP vaccines. Injections modeled childhood vaccination schedules, with mice injected on postnatal days 7, 9, 11, and 15 with 14.2, 10.8, 9.2, and 5.6 mug/kg mercury from thimerosal, respectively, or vehicle. Additional groups received vaccine only or a 10 times higher thimerosal + vaccine dose. Low levels of mercury were found in blood, brain, and kidneys 24 h following the last thimerosal injection. Survival, body weight, indices of early development (negative geotaxis, righting) and hippocampal morphology were not affected. Performance was unaffected in behavioral tests selected to assess behavioral domains relevant to core deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (i.e., social interaction, sensory gating, anxiety). In an open-field test the majority of behaviors were unaffected by thimerosal injection, although thimerosal-injected female mice showed increased time in the margin of an open field at 4 weeks of age. Considered together the present results do not indicate pervasive developmental neurotoxicity following vaccine-level thimerosal injections in SJL mice, and provide little if any support for the hypothesis that thimerosal exposure contributes to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Encephalization, emergent properties, and psychiatry: a minicolumnar perspective.", "Abstract": "The focus of the authors' attention is the consequence of brain growth understood in terms of the development of networks of cortical cell minicolumns, the elemental information-processing units of the brain.

A custom-designed survey was mailed to these urologists with a cover letter and a return-address envelope. Responses were compared with the AUA 2004 guidelines for the treatment of PE.\nThe survey assessed several practice-related factors and asked questions of how the subject would handle various presentations of PE in their practice.\nResponses from practicing urologists totaled 207 (21%). Eighty-four percent of the respondents were in private practice and 11% were in academics. Most urologists (73%) saw less than one PE patient per week. On-demand selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy was the most commonly selected first line treatment (26%), with daily dosing a close second (22%). Combination SSRI therapy, the \"stop/start\" technique, the \"squeeze\" technique, and topical anesthetics were favored by 13, 18, 18, and 11% of the respondents, respectively. If primary treatment failed, changing dosing of SSRIs, topical anesthetics, and referral to psychiatry were increasingly popular options. Ten percent of urologists would treat PE before erectile dysfunction (ED) in a patient with both conditions, with the remainder of the respondents treating ED first, typically with a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (78% of total).

Their relevance to psychiatry and medicine.", "Abstract": "Social and emotional support is an important construct, which has been associated with a reduced risk of mental illness, physical illness, and mortality. Despite its apparent relevance to health, there have been no recent state or national population-based U.S. studies regarding social and emotional support. In order to better address this issue, we examined health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health behaviors by level of social and emotional support in community-dwelling adults in the United States and its territories.\nData were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, an ongoing, state-based, random digit telephone survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged > or =18 years. In 2005, one social and emotional support question, four HRQOL questions, two disability questions, one life satisfaction question, and four health behavior questions were administered in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An additional five HRQOL questions were administered in two states.\nAn estimated 8.6% of adults reported that they rarely/never received social and emotional support; ranging in value from 4.2% in Minnesota to 12.4% in the U.S. Virgin Islands. As the level of social and emotional support decreased, the prevalence of fair/poor general health, dissatisfaction with life, and disability increased, as did the mean number of days of physical distress, mental distress, activity limitation, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, insufficient sleep, and pain. Moreover, the prevalence of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and heavy drinking increased with decreasing level of social and emotional support. Additionally, the mean number of days of vitality slightly decreased with decreasing level of social and emotional support; particularly between those who always/usually received social and emotional support and those who sometimes received support.\nThese findings indicate that the assessment of social and emotional support is highly congruent with the practice of psychiatry. Assessment of social and emotional support, both in psychiatric and medical settings, may identify risk factors germane to adverse health behaviors, and foster interventions designed to improve the mental and physical health of at risk segments of the population."}, {"Title": "Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S): psychometric properties of a brief scale for cognitive evaluation in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP) is a brief scale designed for detecting cognitive deficits in several psychotic and affective disorders.

It includes a heterogeneous group of clinical conditions, ranging from genetic to nutritional, infectious, metabolic or neurotoxic conditions. The ID metasyndrome is characterized by a deficit in cognitive functioning prior to the acquisition of skills through learning. The intensity of the deficit is such to interfere in a significant way with individual normal functioning as expressed in limitations in activities and restriction in participation (disabilities).\nThe name 'developmental cognitive impairment' is here suggested to coexist with ID for naming the metasyndrome previously called MR following a polysemic-polynomious approach."}, {"Title": "Pattern classification of sad facial processing: toward the development of neurobiological markers in depression.", "Abstract": "Methods of analysis that examine the pattern of cerebral activity over the whole brain have been used to identify and predict neurocognitive states in healthy individuals.

We sought to examine the sensitivity and specificity of whole brain pattern classification of implicit processing of sad facial expressions in depression.\nNineteen medication-free patients with depression and 19 healthy volunteers had been recruited for a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving serial scans. The fMRI paradigm entailed incidental affective processing of sad facial stimuli with modulation of the intensity of the emotional expression (low, medium, and high intensity).

Telemedicine allows for the remote assessment of study patients, which could be done by a centralized, highly calibrated, and impartial cohort of raters independent of the study site. This study examined the comparability of remote administration of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) by videoconference and by telephone to traditional face-to-face administration. Two parallel studies were conducted: one compared face-to-face with videoconference administration (N=35), and the other compared face-to-face with telephone administration (N=35). In each study, depressed patients were interviewed independently twice: once in the traditional face-to-face manner, and the second time by either videoconference or teleconference. A counterbalanced order was used. The mean MADRS score for interviews conducted remotely by videoconference was not significantly different from the mean MADRS scores conducted by face-to-face administration (mean difference=0.51 points), P=.388, intraclass correlation (ICC)=.94, P<0001. Similarly, the mean MADRS score for interviews conducted by telephone was not significantly different from the mean MADRS score conducted by face-to-face administration (mean difference=0.74 points), P=.270, ICC=.93, P<0001. Results of the study support the comparability of remote administration of the MADRS, by both telephone and videoconference, to face-to-face administration.

In an initial preliminary high dose study, clozapine at 6 and 12 mg/kg (i.p., b.i.d.) was found to induce weight loss. In a subsequent intermediate dose study, we obtained no evidence for clozapine-induced weight gain despite using identical procedures and doses of clozapine (1-4 mg/kg, i.p., b.i.d.) with which we have observed olanzapine-induced weight gain, hyperphagia, enhanced adiposity and metabolic changes [Cooper G, Pickavance L, Wilding J, Halford J, Goudie A (2005). A parametric analysis of olanzapine-induced weight gain in female rats. Psychopharmacology; 181: 80-89.]. Instead, clozapine induced weight loss without alteration in food intake and muscle mass or changes in levels of glucose, insulin, leptin and prolactin. However, these intermediate doses of clozapine enhanced visceral adiposity and elevated levels of adiponectin. In a final study, low doses of clozapine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, i.p, b.i.d.) induced weight loss. These data demonstrate that clozapine-induced weight gain can be much more difficult to observe in female rats than olanzapine-induced weight gain. Moreover, these findings contrast with clinical findings with clozapine, which induces substantial weight gain in humans. Clozapine-induced enhanced adiposity appears to be easier to observe in rats than weight gain. These findings, along with other preclinical studies, suggest that enhanced adiposity can be observed in the absence of antipsychotic-induced weight gain and hyperphagia, possibly reflecting a direct drug effect on adipocyte function independent of drug-induced hyperphagia [e.g. Minet-Ringuet J, Even P, Valet P, Carpene C, Visentin V, Prevot D, Daviaud D, Quignard-Boulange A, Tome D, de Beaurepaire R (2007). Alterations of lipid metabolism and gene expression in rat adipocytes during chronic olanzapine treatment. Molecular Psychiatry; 12: 562-571.]. These and other findings which show that the results of studies of antipsychotic treatment in animals do not always mimic clinical findings have important implications for the use of animal models of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. With regard to weight gain the results obtained appear to depend critically on the experimental procedures used and the specific drugs studied. Thus such models are not without limitations. However, they do consistently demonstrate the ability of various antipsychotics to enhance adiposity."}, {"Title": "The diagnostic validity of the criteria for binge eating disorder.", "Abstract": "This paper considers whether the criteria currently used to classify the diagnosis of binge eating disorder (BED) are valid and appropriate.\nWe review evidence that reflects on the validity of the current criteria for binge eating episodes and BED, using literature retrieved through major psychology and psychiatry search engines (e.g., PsycInfo, PubMed).\nEvidence from experimental research points to the relative importance of episode frequency, the amount of food consumed at episodes, the subjective sense of loss of control over eating, and several additional criteria associated with binge episodes in BED. Evidence on the differences in psychopathology between BED and bulimia nervosa and between BED and obesity without binge eating, as related to diagnostic criteria, is reviewed.\nAlthough evidence concerning the diagnostic criteria of BED is mixed, broadening certain diagnostic criteria for binge eating episodes and BED might more accurately reflect the research literature and increase the number of individuals eligible for inclusion in treatment programs."}, {"Title": "How lithium treatment generates neutrophilia by enhancing phosphorylation of GSK-3, increasing HIF-1 levels and how this path is important during engraftment.", "Abstract": "Lithium is commonly used in psychiatry for mood stabilization. Lithium treatment results in neutrophilia, increased platelets and increased circulating CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, HSC. This paper outlines the newly discovered mechanism by which this occurs. Glycogen synthase kinase-3, GSK-3, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates hypoxia-induced factor-1, HIF-1. HIF-1 is a transcription factor triggering transcription of multiple genes related to adaptation to hypoxia, among which is CXCL12. CXCL12 forms the primary homing gradient for CD34+ HSCs towards the hypoxic, trophic bone marrow niche to which they must go to thrive. Lithium inhibits GSK-3 thereby increasing active HIF-1 that results in a stronger CXCL12 homing gradient. Trophic niche function is enhanced, ultimately resulting in increased production of neutrophils, platelets and CD34+ cells. Sitagliptin is a new drug to treat diabetes that coincidentally inhibits destruction of CXCL12. Thus, lithium and sitagliptin enhance CXCL12 by different paths, potentially increasing trophic niche function. Awareness of this path is important in HSC transplantation."}, {"Title": "Questioning an axiom: better prognosis for schizophrenia in the developing world?", "Abstract": "That schizophrenia has a better course and outcome in developing countries has become an axiom in international psychiatry.

We found moderate correlations between CGI-CogS global ratings and PANSS positive (r's=.36 to .49) and SANS negative symptoms (r=.41 to .61), but not with BPRS depression (r's=.11 to .13).\nAn interview-based measure of cognition demonstrated high internal consistency, good inter-rater reliability, and high test-retest reliability. Caregiver ratings appear to add important clinical information over patient-only ratings. The CGI-CogS showed moderate validity with respect to neurocognitive performance and functional outcome, and correlations of CGI-CogS with functional outcomes were stronger than correlations of objective neurocognitive performance with functional outcomes. The CGI-CogS appears to offer a reliable and valid method for clinical rating of cognitive deficits and their impact on everyday functioning in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Oral risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine versus haloperidol in psychotic agitation.", "Abstract": "Acute agitation is a common presentation in emergency departments and is often secondary to an underlying psychotic condition. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of three second generation antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine) versus haloperidol in the treatment of psychotic agitation for up to 72 h.\nWe recruited 101 patients with acute psychosis who were admitted at the Mental Health Department 1 South of Turin, Psychiatric Emergency Service of San Giovanni Battista Hospital, from June 2004 to June 2005.\nAggressive behavior, as measured by Modified Overt Aggression Scale and Hostility-suspiciousness factor derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, significantly improved in all groups, with no significant between-group differences. Extrapyramidal symptoms were more common in haloperidol treated patients compared with patients receiving risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine.\nOur results show that in the clinical practice setting of emergency psychiatry olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol and better tolerated."}, {"Title": "[Folie \u00e0 deux - mental infection or individual psychosis].", "Abstract": "The phenomenon of folie \u00e0 deux has been a topical issue in psychiatry for more than a century.

Especially antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs are prescribed more often outside approved indications. Main problems with Off-Label Use are drug safety, lack of reimbursement by health care providers and insufficient coordination between clinics and primary care psychiatrists. Many, especially older psychotropic drugs are approved for psychopathologic phenomena rather than on ICD-10 categories. According to current judication of the German supreme court for social issues, specific criteria for Off-Label Use have been defined. Now, in social legislation, under particular circumstances Off-Label Use is feasible. Recommendations of expert groups for psychiatry are currently lacking, but are expected in next future for Methylphenidate in treatment of adult attention-deficit-hyperactive disorder (ADHS). Especially important for all psychiatrists is to receive informed consent of the patient before initiation of a drug therapy Off-Label."}, {"Title": "Statistical choices can affect inferences about treatment efficacy: a case study from obsessive-compulsive disorder research.", "Abstract": "Longitudinal clinical trials in psychiatry have used various statistical methods to examine treatment effects. The validity of the inferences depends upon the different method's assumptions and whether a given study violates those assumptions. The objective of this paper was to elucidate these complex issues by comparing various methods for handling missing data (e.g., last observation carried forward [LOCF], completer analysis, propensity-adjusted multiple imputation) and for analyzing outcome (e.g., end-point analysis, repeated-measures analysis of variance [RM-ANOVA], mixed-effects models [MEMs]) using data from a multi-site randomized controlled trial in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The trial compared the effects of 12 weeks of exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP), clomipramine (CMI), their combination (EX/RP&CMI) or pill placebo in 122 adults with OCD. The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. For most comparisons, inferences about the relative efficacy of the different treatments were impervious to different methods for handling missing data and analyzing outcome. However, when EX/RP was compared to CMI and when CMI was compared to placebo, traditional methods (e.g., LOCF, RM-ANOVA) led to different inferences than currently recommended alternatives (e.g., multiple imputation based on estimation-maximization algorithm, MEMs). Thus, inferences about treatment efficacy can be affected by statistical choices. This is most likely when there are small but potentially clinically meaningful treatment differences and when sample sizes are modest. The use of appropriate statistical methods in psychiatric trials can advance public health by ensuring that valid inferences are made about treatment efficacy."}, {"Title": "The frequency of sexual dysfunctions in male partners of women with vaginismus in a Turkish sample.", "Abstract": "The aim of this investigation is to determine the sexual history traits, sexual satisfaction level and frequency of sexual dysfunctions in men whose partners have vaginismus. The study included 32 male partners of vaginismic patients, who presented at a psychiatry department. Subjects were evaluated by a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by researchers for assessing sexually dysfunctional patients and included detailed questions with regard to socio-demographic variables, general medical and sexual history. All participants also received the Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS). According to DSM-IV-TR criteria, 65.6% of the investigated males were diagnosed with one or more sexual dysfunctions. The most common problem was premature ejaculation (50%) and the second one was erectile dysfunction (28%). The transformed GRISS subscale scores provided similar data. It is concluded that the assessment of sexual functions of males who have vaginismic partners should be an integral part of the management procedure of vaginismus for optimal outcome."}, {"Title": "How best to identify a bipolar-related subtype among major depressive patients without spontaneous hypomania: superiority of age at onset criterion over recurrence and polarity?", "Abstract": "History of high depressive recurrence (without history of mania/hypomania) has been proposed as a mood subtype close to bipolar disorders.

Optimizing the detection of bipolar II disorder in outpatient private practice: toward a systematization of clinical diagnostic wisdom. J. Clin. Psychiatry 66, 914-921]). We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses on such putative bipolar validators as early age at onset of first major depressive episode (before 21 years), high recurrence, family history for bipolar disorders, and depressive mixed states (mixed depression, i.e. depression plus concurrent hypomanic symptoms), in order to identify an MDD subgroup close to BP-II.\nAll bipolar validators were independent predictors of BP-II. Early onset was the only variable which identified an MDD subgroup significantly associated with all bipolar validators. This MDD subgroup was similar to BP-II on age at onset and bipolar family history, and had a high frequency of mixed depression. A dose-response relationship was found between number of bipolar validators present in MDD, and bipolar family history loading among MDD relatives.\nStudy limited to outpatients.\nFrom among the bipolar validators, early age at onset of first major depression (<21 years) was superior to high recurrence (>4 depressive episodes) in identifying an MDD subgroup close to BP-II, which might be subsumed under the broad bipolar spectrum.

Contemporary movement disorder surgery on the brain has evolved from empiric observations on movement behavior after neurological lesions. So too has the development of psychiatric surgical procedures followed the observation of lesions in the brain on cognitive and affective behavior. Just as deep brain stimulation (DBS) has revolutionized the practice of movement disorder surgery, its application to psychiatric illness has become the cutting edge of functional and restorative neurosurgery. The fundamental concept of the cortico-striatal-pallido-thalamocortical loop will be explored in the context of psychiatric disorders. DBS targeting this circuitry appears from initial evidence in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to be a promising option for patients with neuropsychiatric illness resistant to conventional therapies. Further exploring the anatomic interconnectivity of the physiologically relevant cortical and subcortical areas will inevitably lead to better applications of DBS for the treatment of OCD, major depression (MD) and potentially for other psychiatric disorders. Implementing such therapies optimally will require the creation of treatment centers with specialized expertise in the psychiatric, neurosurgical, and ethical issues that arise with these populations."}, {"Title": "Adverse drug events and medication errors in psychiatry: methodological issues regarding identification and classification.", "Abstract": "Abstract Adverse drug events and medication errors have received extensive study recently in a variety of clinical populations, though compared to many other areas relatively little work has focused on this area in psychiatry, especially with respect to the contribution of error to harm. The goal of this paper is to discuss methodological issues around measurement of medication safety in psychiatric patients. Against the background of a systems approach, a modern perspective of error management is discussed, and a multidimensional procedure for detection and classification of incidents related to the medication process is presented. This method has proven successful in non-psychiatric settings yielding the current best estimate of error rates and providing insight into the underlying causes. While this general approach can be adapted to the psychiatric setting, a number of issues make measurement especially challenging in psychiatry. These include the fluctuating course of psychiatric disorders, reduced patient adherence to the medication process, adverse effects which are often similar to symptoms of the underlying disorder, the frequent use of wide dose intervals depending on the clinical situation, and the presence of many drug-drug interactions. Data collected by means of the presented approach provide a basis for the development of effective strategies to reduce the risk of medication errors and thus improve patient safety in psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "The DEBIT trial: an intervention to reduce antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing in adult psychiatry wards - a cluster randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "Clinical guidelines advise against prescribing more than one antipsychotic with limited exceptions.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention in reducing prescribing of antipsychotic polypharmacy on general adult psychiatry wards, compared with guidelines alone.\nA pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial recruited 19 adult psychiatric units (clusters) from the South West of England. Participants were all ward doctors and nurses. The multi-faceted intervention comprised: an educational/CBT workbook; an educational visit to consultants; and a reminder system on medication charts.\nThe odds of being prescribed antipsychotic polypharmacy in those patients prescribed antipsychotic medication was significantly lower in the intervention than control group when adjusted for confounders (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.90, p=0.028). There was considerable between-unit variation in polypharmacy rates and in the change in rates between baseline and follow-up (5 months after baseline).\nThe intervention reduced levels of polypharmacy prescribing compared to guidelines alone although the effect size was relatively modest.

However, its diagnostic validity and bipolar nature are still not firmly supported. A bipolar nature could have significant treatment impacts.\nThe aim was to psychometrically validate the concept of, and the bipolar nature, of mixed depression, by using (for the first time) tetrachoric factor analysis of its hypomanic symptoms.\nConsecutive 441 Bipolar II Disorder (BP-II), and 289 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) outpatients were cross-sectionally assessed for Major Depressive Episode (MDE) and concurrent hypomanic symptoms (as binary variables) when presenting for treatment of depression, by a mood disorder specialist psychiatrist (FB), using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (as modified by [Akiskal HS, Benazzi F. Optimizing the detection of bipolar II disorder in outpatient private practice: toward a systematization of clinical diagnostic wisdom. J Clin Psychiatry 2005; 66: 914-921.]) in a private practice. Consecutive 275 remitted BP-II were also assessed for past hypomania. Mixed depression was defined as co-occurrence of MDE and 3 or more, usually subthreshold, hypomanic symptoms.\nIn multivariable logistic regression, BP-II independent predictor variables were young onset age, MDE recurrences, mixed depression, and bipolar family history. Factor analysis of past hypomania symptoms found three factors: an \"irritable mental overactivity\" factor, an \"elevated mood\" factor, and a \"motor overactivity\" factor. Factor analysis of intradepression hypomanic symptoms in BP-II, and in MDD, found two similar mental and motor overactivity factors. Multivariate regression of the intradepression hypomanic factors versus bipolar validators, such as bipolar family history and young onset age, found significant associations.\nFindings could support the diagnostic validity, and the bipolar nature, of mixed depression, on the basis of the close similarities found between the factor structure of inter-depression hypomania and intra-depression hypomanic symptoms. Impacts on treatment of a bipolar nature of mixed depression may be significant (e.g. more use of mood stabilising agents, less/no use of antidepressants)."}, {"Title": "[A short questionnaire for assessing the social climate on forensic psychiatric wards].", "Abstract": "To examine statistical properties and the validity of a ward climate questionnaire for forensic psychiatric institutions.

There is little information, however, about how such hospitalization is viewed by the patients themselves. While users' views are increasingly seen as important for the evaluation of mental health services and for improving outcomes, the views of older patients are less likely to be sought. In this study, former patients were asked about their experience of admission, which aspects were helpful and which were not. Negative experiences have been described in an earlier paper. This paper focuses on what study participants considered to be the positive aspects of their time in hospital.\nFifty former patients from three Melbourne hospitals were interviewed in their own homes using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire.\nForty-six percent expressed an overall favorable view of their hospital stay; 34% had some reservations; and 20% had a poor overall view. Favorable views did not necessarily preclude distressing incidents or complaints but were associated with the ward environment, experienced as a safe haven; the re-evaluation of negative experiences; and, in most but not all cases, recovery.\nRetrospective accounts are useful for understanding the ways in which hospital experience is processed. Remembering the experience as positive is, in itself, a good therapeutic outcome. In addition, it may influence readiness to seek future treatment, help prevent relapse, and, indirectly, be helpful to others with similar problems."}, {"Title": "Panic, suffocation false alarms, separation anxiety and endogenous opioids.", "Abstract": "This review paper presents an amplification of the suffocation false alarm theory (SFA) of spontaneous panic [Klein DF (1993). False suffocation alarms, spontaneous panics, and related conditions. An integrative hypothesis. Arch Gen Psychiatry; 50:306-17.]. SFA postulates the existence of an evolved physiologic suffocation alarm system that monitors information about potential suffocation. Panic attacks maladaptively occur when the alarm is erroneously triggered. That panic is distinct from Cannon's emergency fear response and Selye's General Alarm Syndrome is shown by the prominence of intense air hunger during these attacks. Further, panic sufferers have chronic sighing abnormalities outside of the acute attack. Another basic physiologic distinction between fear and panic is the counter-intuitive lack of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation in panic. Understanding panic as provoked by indicators of potential suffocation, such as fluctuations in pCO(2) and brain lactate, as well as environmental circumstances fits the observed respiratory abnormalities. However, that sudden loss, bereavement and childhood separation anxiety are also antecedents of \"spontaneous\" panic requires an integrative explanation. Because of the opioid system's central regulatory role in both disordered breathing and separation distress, we detail the role of opioidergic dysfunction in decreasing the suffocation alarm threshold. We present results from our laboratory where the naloxone-lactate challenge in normals produces supportive evidence for the endorphinergic defect hypothesis in the form of a distress episode of specific tidal volume hyperventilation paralleling challenge-produced and clinical panic."}, {"Title": "Stress-induced changes in sleep in rodents: models and mechanisms.", "Abstract": "Psychological stressors have a prominent effect on sleep in general, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in particular.

The studies are also in Table 1, summarizing the effects of stress in 4-h blocks in both the light and dark phases. Although mild stress procedures have sometimes produced increases in REM sleep, more intense stressors appear to model the human condition by leading to disruptions in sleep, particularly REM sleep. We also discuss work conducted by our group and others looking at conditioning as a factor in the temporal extension of stress-related sleep disruptions. Finally, we attempt to describe the probable neural mechanisms of the sleep disruptions.

NCS-1 is a neuronal calcium sensor that can inhibit dopamine receptor D2 internalization and is upregulated in PFC of schizophrenic subjects. It is well known that dopamine D2 receptor is the main target of antipsychotic. Therefore, our purpose was to study if chronic treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotics induced alterations in DARPP-32 and NCS-1 expression in five brain regions: prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cortex and cerebellum.

Pre-clinical studies of modafinil suggest a complex profile of neurochemical and behavioral effects, distinct from those of amphetamine. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction may be a particularly important emerging treatment target for modafinil, across these and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed to comprehensively review the empirical literature on neurochemical actions of modafinil, and effects on cognition in animal models, healthy adult humans, and clinical populations. We searched PubMed with the search term 'modafinil' and reviewed all English-language articles for neurochemical, neurophysiological, cognitive, or information-processing experimental measures. We additionally summarized the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil and clinical efficacy in psychiatric patients. Modafinil exhibits robust effects on catecholamines, serotonin, glutamate, gamma amino-butyric acid, orexin, and histamine systems in the brain. Many of these effects may be secondary to catecholamine effects, with some selectivity for cortical over subcortical sites of action. In addition, modafinil (at well-tolerated doses) improves function in several cognitive domains, including working memory and episodic memory, and other processes dependent on prefrontal cortex and cognitive control. These effects are observed in rodents, healthy adults, and across several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, modafinil appears to be well-tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events and a low liability to abuse. Modafinil has a number of neurochemical actions in the brain, which may be related to primary effects on catecholaminergic systems. These effects are in general advantageous for cognitive processes. Overall, modafinil is an excellent candidate agent for remediation of cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "A study of affective temperaments in Hungary: internal consistency and concurrent validity of the TEMPS-A against the TCI and NEO-PI-R.", "Abstract": "TEMPS-A (Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego - Autoquestionnaire) is a new self-assessed temperament 110-item scale with depressive (D), cyclothymic (C), hyperthymic (H), irritable (I) and anxious (A) subscales. To date, it has been translated into 25 languages, and validated in 10. The present Hungarian version provides the most complete external validation across the Beck Depression Scale (BDI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), the BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (BarOn EQ-i), Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the NEO Personality Inventory - Revised (NEO-PI-R). We were particularly interested in concurrent validation against the TCI and the NEO-PI-R, the most important of the new personality instruments.\n1132 clinically-well subjects (27% male) from the general population and university students (16-81 years) were administered the above scales and instruments. The data were tested with standard psychometric batteries.\nFactor analysis revealed 5 factors approximating the original D, C, I, H, and A subscales, which in their superfactor confirmed an Emotional (D, C, I, A) vs. Hyperthymic structure. Except for the D (a=0.65), the Cronbach alpha for the remainder temperaments ranged from 0.75-0.81. Dominant temperaments ranged from the I (2.7%) to the C (4.2%); the highest prevalence was observed among men with C=6% and H=5.4%. The BDI and POMS correlated significantly with the relevant subscales, as did the BarOn. Of the many significant possible correlations with the TCI, the most noteworthy were novelty seeking and harm avoidance with D, A, C, as well as C, and persistence with H. As for the NEO-PI-R, we were struck by the positive correlation of openness with C, and conscientiousness negatively with C; most other positive correlations such as neuroticism with all temperaments but the hyperthymic were expected and strongly supportive of concurrent validity.\nHigher educational background of the subjects studied relative to that of the general population of Hungary. The distribution of the data may have in some instances deviated somewhat from the underlying assumptions for the standard psychometric tests for normality. We did not conduct test-retest reliability.\nThe factorial structure of the TEMPS-A shows good reliability and internal consistency. Although the superstructure is reminiscent of neuroticism-extraversion, within it are embedded discernible classical affective temperaments. A provocative finding is the high prevalence of cyclothymia in Hungarian males (6%), which is rather unique when compared with the other 10 countries studied to date. This finding, coupled with high male hyperthymia (5.4%), may explain the high lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorders reported from Hungary. Inter alia, our psychometric data along with the foregoing epidemiologic considerations, are very much in line with the cyclothymic-bipolar spectrum model proposed by the senior author [Akiskal, H.S., Djenderedjian, A.H., Rosenthal, R.H., Khani, M.K., 1977.

Strategies have been introduced to attempt to identify individuals in the prepsychotic or prodromal phase. The most widely used of these approaches is the ultra-high risk (UHR) approach, which combines known trait and state risk factors for psychotic disorder. However, researchers guided by phenomenological theory have argued that modern psychiatry's neglect of subjective experience has compromised researchers' understanding of psychotic disorder and has thereby limited efforts at prospective and early identification. Phenomenological research indicates that disturbance of the basic sense of self may be a core marker of psychotic vulnerability, particularly of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It is argued that identifying self-disturbance in the UHR population may provide a means of further \"closing in\" on individuals truly at high risk of psychotic disorder, thus supplementing the UHR identification approach. This would be of practical value in the sense of reducing inclusion of \"false-positive\" cases in UHR samples and of theoretical value in the sense of shedding light on core features of psychotic pathology. The strong explanatory power and empirical findings to date invite further research into the role of self-disturbance as a phenotypic vulnerability marker for psychotic disorder."}, {"Title": "[Therapeutic drug monitoring in epileptology and psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Experts from epileptology and psychiatry reviewed the current significance of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs and psychiatric drugs in a workshop at Bethel Epilepsy Centre in December 2005.

Studies using mice devoid of functional P-gp have revealed that P-gp at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) can exert a profound effect on the ability of some drugs to enter the brain, e.g. cardiovascular drugs (digoxin, quinidine), opioids (morphine, loperamide, methadone), HIV protease inhibitors, the new generation of antihistamines, and some antidepressants and antipsychotics. Among the latter group, risperidone is strongly influenced having about 10 times higher cerebral concentration in P-gp knock-out mice than in control mice. Taking into account that polytherapy is commonplace in psychiatry, theoretically there is a risk of drug-drug interactions with regard to P-gp at the BBB. Here we review the evidence for a role of P-gp with regard to psychoactive drugs from in vitro studies and experiments in knock-out mice devoid of functional P-gp. Moreover, the evidence for significant drug-drug interactions involving psychotropic drugs in rodents is considered. Clinical observations suggesting a role for P-gp in relation to drug-drug interactions at the BBB are sparse, and a definite conclusion awaits further studies.

In suicide attempters with mood disorder, the non-suppressor status in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is associated with suicide indicating that HPA-axis hyperactivity is a biological risk factor for suicide and may be a useful predictor. The threshold of 5 microg/dl for cortisol levels measured at 08:00 a.m. or 4:00 p.m. following dexamethasone at 11:00 p.m. to define the DTS nonsuppression was derived as being optimal for the separation of melancholia and nonmelancholic conditions rather than the prediction of suicide. A different threshold may offer a better identification of suicide. The aim of this study was to find the optimal threshold level of post DST plasma cortisol at 4 p.m. for suicide prediction using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A cohort of 106 depressed inpatients with an index suicide attempt admitted to the department of Psychiatry at the Karolinska University Hospital between 1980 and 2000, were submitted to DST and followed up for causes of death.

Older subjects exhibited significantly more depressive symptoms, and nonsignificantly greater prevalences of major depression, severe depression, and ultradian cycling than did younger subjects. The number of depressive symptoms was significantly correlated with ultradian cycling.\nThis study relied upon retrospective as well as current reports of symptoms. The study results cannot be generalized to community samples.\nWe propose two testable hypotheses: (1) that the recurrent, or chronic, simultaneous presence of any two of the symptoms elation, grandiosity, and racing thoughts and a total of five DSM-IV manic symptoms (without specific cardinal symptom, duration, or episodicity requirements) will identify nearly all clinic-referred bipolar children and adolescents; and (2) that a comprehensive classification of pediatric bipolar phenotypes based upon pattern of manic symptom episodicity or chronicity and degree of depression will identify subtypes of pediatric bipolar disorder that have greater correspondence with treatment response than do those of the DSM-IV classification. Problematic distractibility-inattention and explosive irritability-rage are highly prevalent; their presences should be specified when indicated."}, {"Title": "[Health care analysis of eating disorders in Valladolid].", "Abstract": "One of the aims of epidemiological research is to provide some information that makes it possible to adapt and structure health care services. There is an open debate on the need and/or adequacy of the specific units for care given to eating behavior disorders (EBD) and a proper health care model. One way to contribute some ideas in this debate is to make a critical analysis of the reality of the care given for eating behavior disorders, observing the activity of the different health care levels, in our case in the province of Valladolid. The existence of several epidemiological studies, coinciding in space and time, makes it possible to conclude that 23% of new cases treated in the Community are detected in primary health care, while the percentage of those seen by the child-adolescent psychiatry departments is reduced to 2.56%, 16% of which are referred from hospital admission. The regional proposal of promoting a reference hospital admission unit for eating behavior disorders for all of the region of Castilla y Leon is considered ineffective according to this reality, the creation of specific functional units being proposed."}, {"Title": "[Multiprofessional family-system training programme in psychiatry--effects on team cooperation and staff strain].", "Abstract": "How does the interdisciplinary cooperation of psychiatric staff members change after a multiprofessional family systems training programme?\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 49 staff members.

Silicon, the third most abundant trace element in humans as well as antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) play important roles in organism. The disturbance of their level can cause severe disorders. The aim of our work was to evaluate the influence of Li2CO3 administration in drinking water for a period of 4 weeks on Si content and GPx activity in the tissues of liver, kidney, brain and femoral muscle in rats. The concentrations of provided solutions were 0.7, 1.4, 2.6, 3.6, 7.1 and 10.7 mmol Li+ x dm-3. GPx activity was decreased versus control as a consequence of Li treatment, particularly in kidney and brain. This effect could be suggested to contribute to renal abnormalities which could occur during Li therapy. Si tissue level was significantly enhanced versus control in liver and femoral muscle in groups receiving high Li doses. In brain no well-marked changes were observed, whereas in kidney we observed the depletion in low-Li-groups, restoration of Si level in higher-Li-groups and unexpected decrease in the highest-Li-group. Positive correlations between Si content and GPx activity in the tissues of kidney (r = 0.677) and brain (r = 0.790) as well as negative correlation (r = -0.819) in femoral muscle were found. We consider that our results give some reason for suggesting that monitoring of silicon level in patients undergoing Li therapy could be recommended. However, more investigations should be performed, particularly regarding the relationships between Si and GPx in blood and urine Si excretion during lithium administration."}, {"Title": "Effects of the dopamine D3 receptor (DRD3) gene polymorphisms on risperidone response: a pharmacogenetic study.", "Abstract": "Previous observations of the anatomical distribution and pharmacological profile of the dopamine D(3) receptor (DRD3) have indicated its potential role in antipsychotic drug action. Risperidone, an effective first-line atypical antipsychotic agent, exhibits a relatively high affinity for this receptor. Recent studies have reported an association of the Ser9Gly polymorphism in the DRD3 gene with therapeutic response to risperidone, but the results were inconsistent. We therefore postulated that the Ser9Gly polymorphism might be in linkage disequilibrium with an undetected variant that exerts a direct influence on risperidone efficacy. The present study genotyped eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the DRD3 gene and examined five of these for association with treatment outcome, following an 8-week period of risperidone monotherapy in 130 schizophrenic patients from mainland China. Clinical symptoms were assessed before and after the treatment period, using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale (BPRS). The confounding effects of non-genetic factors were estimated and the baseline symptom score was included as a covariate for adjustment. Neither was any association observed between the five polymorphisms and improvement in total BPRS scores nor was any combined effect of these variants detected in the haplotype analysis. The current results indicate that genetic variations within the DRD3 gene may not contribute significantly to interindividual differences in the therapeutic efficacy of risperidone."}, {"Title": "No association found between the promoter variants of ADRA1A and schizophrenia in the Chinese population.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatry disorder with a strong genetic component.

We were interested in the two positive sites reported and selected five variants among the promoter region of ADRA1A, namely -563G/A, -9625G/A, -2760C/A, -4155G/C and a new substitution we detected between -508bp and -530bp upstream of the translation initiation site. Our sample consisted of 480 schizophrenia and 480 control subjects. All recruits were Han Chinese in Shanghai origin.
