[{"Title": "Patients and carers as teachers in psychiatric education: a literature review and discussion.", "Abstract": "The direct involvement of patients and carers in psychiatric education is driven by policy in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The benefits of this involvement are well known, however, it is important to consider the ethical aspects. This paper suggests how further research could explore and potentially mitigate adverse outcomes.\nA literature search evaluating the role of patients and carer involvement in psychiatric education was undertaken to summarise existing evidence relating to the following: methods of involvement, evidence of usefulness, patient's/carer's views and learners' views.\nThe Medline search produced 231 articles of which 31 were included in the literature review based on the key themes addressed in the paper.\nThe available evidence is generally positive regarding the use of patients and carers in psychiatric education. However, available research is varied in approach and outcome with little information on the ethical consequences. More research is required to inform policies on teaching regarding potential adverse effects of service user involvement."}, {"Title": "A comparison of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry across medical schools in the Republic of Ireland.", "Abstract": "To examine the delivery and assessment of psychiatry at undergraduate level in the six medical schools in the Republic of Ireland offering a medical degree programme.\nA narrative description of the delivery and assessment of psychiatry at undergraduate level by collaborative senior faculty members from all six universities in Ireland.\nPsychiatry is integrated to varying degrees across all medical schools. Clinical experience in general adult psychiatry and sub-specialities is provided by each medical school; however, the duration of clinical attachment varies, and the provision of some sub-specialities (i.e. forensic psychiatry) is dependent on locally available resources. Five medical schools provide 'live' large group teaching sessions (lectures), and all medical schools provide an array of small group teaching sessions. Continuous assessment encompasses 10-35% of the total assessment marks, depending on the medical school. Only one medical school does not provide a clinical examination in the form of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination with viva examinations occurring at three medical schools.\nMany similarities exist in relation to the delivery of psychiatry at undergraduate level in Ireland. Significant variability exists in relation to assessment with differences in continuous assessment, written and clinical exams and the use of vivas noted. The use of e-learning platforms has increased significantly in recent years, with their role envisaged to include cross-disciplinary teaching sessions and analysis of examinations and individual components within examinations which will help refine future examinations and enable greater sharing of resources between medical schools."}, {"Title": "[Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in patients attending a psychiatry outpatient service: a case series].", "Abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a condition associated with multiple negative outcomes.

Part 1.", "Abstract": "The paper sets out to recall the profile of Karol de Beaurain, a psychiatrist who belonged to the circle of first Poles who used psychoanalysis in treatment. So far, dr Beaurain has been known from brief references in publications relating to the life and works of Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy) whose psychoanalytic sessions he conducted between 1912 and 1913. De Beaurain was born in 1867 and studied medicine at Swiss universities (Zurich, Berne, Geneva) where he defended his doctoral thesis as well. He was prepared for the career of a health resort physician and when he returned to Poland, he settled down in Poronin where except for working as a district physician, he also engaged in social and cultural activities. Around 1910 his professional interest shifted towards psychiatry and psychotherapy. In the final months of 1911 he relocated to Zakopane where he opened a private practice for \"neu-rotic diseases\". At the same time he started treating patients with the use of psychoanalytic methods.

It is suggested that there could be interactions between \u03b1-synuclein and tau in cytoskeletal disorganization and synaptic dystrophy. Therefore, we aim to determine the serum levels of neurodegenerative molecules such as \u03b1-synuclein and tau in children with ADHD. The study group consisted of 25 children, aged 6-10, diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria and who appeared at Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine, and Department of Child Psychiatry in Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey. 25 children, having no psychiatric disorders and medical illnesses, were selected as healthy control group. Serum \u03b1-synuclein and tau concentrations were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. The \u03b1-synuclein levels of ADHD were not significantly different than those of controls. The tau levels of ADHD were found to be statistically significantly higher than those of controls. Moreover, \u03b1-synuclein levels showed a statistically significantly positive correlation with tau levels in children with ADHD. The results of our preliminary study can suggest that ADHD might possibly share a common disease mechanism with other diseases in terms of tau pathology. Increased serum tau level may be an indication of disturbance of microtubule transportation in the brains of children with ADHD."}, {"Title": "Perceived burden of care and reported coping strategies and needs for family caregivers of people with mental disorders in Zimbabwe.", "Abstract": "Mental health service resources are inadequate in low-income countries, and families are frequently expected to provide care for their relative with a mental disorder.

Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 16) was used for descriptive quantitative data analysis.\nCaregivers experienced physical, psychological, emotional, social and financial burdens associated with caregiving. They used both emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies, depending on the ill family members' behaviours. Seeking spiritual assistance emerged as their most common way of coping. Twenty-one (68%) of the caregivers were at risk of CMDs (including three participants who were suicidal) and were referred to a psychiatrist for further management. Caregivers required support from healthcare professionals to help them cope better.\nCaregivers of patients attending psychiatry hospitals in Zimbabwe carry a substantial and frequently unrecognised burden of caring for a family member with a mental disorder.

Within a family system, there are oscillatory phenomena and synchronization of the emotional, behavioral and relational rhythms of each member of the family system as well as synchronization of this system with others. A disruption of family synchronies, consisting of successive desynchronizations and resynchronizations, can take place in order for a change to occur. We created a mobile team for preadolescents and adolescents with psychological difficulties and their families; this mobile team enables to trigger a change by acting on the family synchronies like a 'social zeitgeber', i.e. an external factor synchronizing social and biological rhythms. The mobile team acts by disrupting the synchronies of the family system and this disruption is facilitated by a state of crisis experienced by the family. More specifically, the mobile team intervention provokes changes in the family representations associated with changes in the family emotional climate, measured by expressed emotion, due to disruptions in the synchronization of certain rhythms (desynchronization and then resynchronization of these rhythms), and could therefore be considered as a 'social zeitgeber'. It creates an experience that becomes part of the individual's and family's history and could be reactivated in the future if necessary. Finally, it allows the family and the adolescent with difficulties to reach new perspectives and representations which participates to the process of change, but also to benefit at the same time from a secure basis and frame created by the (re)synchronization of family emotions through the intervention of the mobile team following a ritualized procedure."}, {"Title": "[Suicide and mental institutions, the Lausanne example].", "Abstract": "Suicide in the mental hospital is first a human tragedy that affects the patients' families and relatives but also touches all medical staff involved.

Patient with OCD often suffer from one or more co-morbid disorders. Major depression has been the most common co-morbid syndrome. Comorbid Axis I disorders along with increased severity of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, increased severity of obsessions, feelings of hopelessness and past history of suicide attempts have been associated with worsening levels of suicidality in OCD (Angelakis I, Gooding P., 2015). As per data Thirty-six percent of the patients of OCD report lifetime suicidal thoughts and 11% have a history of attempted suicide(Torres AR, Ramos-Cerqueira AT, <i>et al</i>, 2011). There is a reasonable probability that the patient of OCD have suicidal thoughts, plans or actually attempt suicide.\nTo assess depression and suicidality in OCD patients.\nThis study was conducted on 50 patients diagnosed with OCD as per ICD 10 criteria, both outpatient & indoor, from department of psychiatry, Dayanand Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana, Punjab, India.

Methods A 25-year-old man, with prior history of dysthymia, was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and started on adalimumab. He gradually developed manic symptoms over seven to eight months, while maintained on adalimumab. As his condition did not improve with outpatient management, the patient was admitted to the Psychiatry inpatient unit. Results Valproate and aripiprazole were initiated, and adalimumab was substituted with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Mood symptoms resolved within days, and the patient was discharged.

Previous studies had recruited older (63-65 years) patients with mild renal impairment (serum creatinine, 1.3-1.4 mg/dl). A 2012 report in the <i>Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry</i> described tolvaptan as a \"lifesaving drug\". A major outcome concern in the treatment of chronic hyponatremia is potentially fatal pontine demyelination from over-rapid correction of serum sodium >0.5 mEq/dL/h. The maximum reported correction of serum sodium within 24 hours was 13 mEq/L in a case of SIADH.

An efficient referral system is, therefore, important to offering quality care to such patients. Communication between physicians is often sub-optimal and referral letters to specialists sometimes provide inadequate information.

The question arises whether psychiatrists require a separate set of ethical guidelines.\nTo examine the positions of Israeli psychiatrists with regard to ethics in general and professional ethics in particular, and to explore opinions regarding a code of ethics or ethical guidelines for psychiatry.\u00a0 Methods: A specially designed questionnaire was compiled and completed by psychiatrists recruited for the study.\nA specially designed questionnaire was compiled and completed by psychiatrists recruited for the study.\nMost participants reported low levels of perceived knowledge regarding ethics, professional ethics, and the general code of ethics. Older and more experienced professionals reported a higher level of knowledge. Most psychiatrists agreed or strongly agreed with the need for a distinct code of ethics/ethical guidelines for psychiatrists. This support was significantly higher among both psychiatrists under 50 years and residents.\nOur findings suggest that the existing code of ethics and position papers may not be sufficient, indicating a potential need to develop and implement a process to create the ethical code itself. In addition, the findings highlight the importance of ethics education, suggesting that the need for a code of ethics is more urgent in the early stages of professional training, as younger professionals may be more exposed to advanced media technology. While some may fear that a distinct code of ethics will distance psychiatry from modern medicine, others assert that the profession combines aspects from the humanities and social sciences that require a unique sort of management and thus this profession requires a distinct code of ethics."}, {"Title": "Improving Mental Health in the Community: Outcome Evaluation of a Geriatric Mental Health Day Treatment Service.", "Abstract": "This program evaluation reviewed the outcomes of a new 10-week multi-modal mental health day treatment program for elderly clients with mood and anxiety disorders.\nA retrospective chart review of clients admitted during the first 3 years of the program (N = 255) was conducted. Paired sample t-tests were used to compare admission and discharge data. Focus groups were run with clients who attended the program during the previous months, to delineate the strengths of the program and to identify areas for improvement.\nAnalyses showed statistically and clinically significant improvements in client symptomatology, as evidenced by reductions on the Geriatric Depression Scale and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure in clients who completed the program. Focus group participants overwhelmingly described the program as very beneficial, but the desire for on-going follow-up was clearly articulated.\nA practice model employing group-based cognitive-behavioural and interpersonal strategies that emphasizes behavioral activation and socialization is associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms and psychological distress in a large sample of elderly adults in a day treatment service with mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.\nIn the future, a mechanism for on-going mental health support should be included.

However, the management of such patients still poses great therapeutic challenges to medical professionals.\nBased on a synthesis of the available guidelines published in Europe, Canada, and the United States, coupled with more recent therapeutic developments, the authors provide a pragmatic guide to aid clinicians in deciding when and how to treat patients who have primary tic disorders.\nAfter a systematic assessment of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (primarily attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first step in treatment is a comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families that addresses the protean phenomenology of tics and associated behaviors, coping mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options. When more active intervention beyond watchful monitoring is indicated, hierarchical evaluation of treatment targets (i.e., tics vs. comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial. Behavioral treatments for tics are restricted to older children and are not readily available to all centers, mainly due to the paucity of well-trained therapists. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and \u03b12A-agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety monitoring must be provided. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches, as well as neuromodulation strategies, remain under-investigated in this population of patients.\nThe treatment of children with tics and Tourette syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and pediatrics may be helpful to address the complex needs of these children."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Quality Indicators of Integrated Care in a Regional Psychiatry Budget - A Pre-Post Comparison by Secondary Data Analysis.", "Abstract": "The Regional Psychiatry Budget (RPB), as a special arrangement within the German Federal Hospital Refund Regulation, is based on the capitation principle.

Under this model, the provider is free to offer all forms of treatment and to construct individual models of integrated care that specifically suit the region and the needs of community members. The present study aimed to evaluate selected aspects that represent a change in the psychiatric health status of patients in the covered region under the conditions of the RPB. We performed a secondary data analysis of administrative data of 19,913 cases generated by the hospital in a pre-post comparison of the periods before and under RPB conditions.

Modern neurology, for example, benefits from the interpretation of the graphic features of writing and drawing for the diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and disorders. This article examines how handwriting analysis can be used, and has been used historically, as a methodological tool for the assessment of medical conditions and how this enhances our understanding of historical contexts of writing. We analyze handwritten material, writing tests and letters, from patients in an early 20th-century psychiatric hospital in southern Germany (Irsee/Kaufbeuren). In this institution, early psychiatrists assessed handwriting features, providing us novel insights into the earliest practices of psychiatric handwriting analysis, which can be connected to Berkenkotter's research on medical admission records. We finally consider the degree to which historical handwriting bears semiotic potential to explain the psychological state and personality of a writer, and how future research in written communication should approach these sources."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatry and occupational diseases act in Chile: historical and critical review of a complex relationship].", "Abstract": "The Work Accidents and Occupational Diseases Act exists in Chile since 1968. It uses a single model for the understanding and management of both somatic diseases like silicosis and psychiatric disorders. During the last decade in Chile, the consultation rates due to psychiatric conditions of probable labor origin has rose over 1,000%, a factor that underscored the deficiencies of this model. The aim of this paper is to analyze the consequences of the application of this act in the psychiatric field for almost 50 years after its promulgation. This article contains an historical overview and an epistemological debate based on the authors\u0092 experience dealing with clinical and administrative work both in occupational psychiatry departments and in regulatory entities. The development of occupational mental health in Chile is examined as part of an historical process that initially did not consider the relationship between work and mental suffering as relevant.

Mindfulness-based interventions have been tried out in a wide range of mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for use in depression and anxiety. Mindfulness operates by changing the person's relationship with unhelpful thoughts and emotions. The need for home practice is both a strength and a weakness. Some find home practice too demanding and a barrier to effective utilisation of mindfulness. Others discover a set of practical tools that, once learnt, can be applied to ongoing life difficulties; in this way mindfulness may have a place in promoting recovery beyond the acute treatment of a disorder.

We prepared and implemented a 3-item questionnaire constructed by our team, which probed the patients' thoughts on these occupational activities. The Interpersonal Functioning Scale (IFS) and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) were applied to both groups on hospital admission and discharge; variations in scale scores were evaluated on par with sociodemographic variables, and the study and control groups were compared.\nIn total, 91% of the study group provided positive feedback regarding the aforementioned interventions. When comparing the study and control groups, the IFS variance score of the study group did not show a significant difference with respect to that of the control group. A statistically significant difference (p<0.0001) was observed in the PSP scores. Evaluation of the PSP of the occupational activities, focusing on sociodemographics and diagnostic labels, revealed a significant improvement in nonpsychotic patients (p=0.002) compared with psychotic patients, in females (p=0.001) compared with males, in unemployed patients (p=0.0001) compared with employed patients, in single patients (p=0.002) compared with married patients, in less-educated patients (p=0.004) compared with high school graduates, and in patients younger than 45 years (p=0.002) compared with those older than 45 years.\nThe findings of our study showed coherence with the literature regarding similar studies conducted on psychotic subgroups. The results demonstrated significantly positive repercussions, specifically in the treatment of nonpsychotic patients; both groups benefited from occupational activities, as shown by improvements in all psychiatric inpatients' PSP scores in comparison with scores of the control group.

Eligible were patients with severe mental illnesses: psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder of more than two years' duration. A total of 216 patients were recruited through in- and out-patient services from four hospitals in Hamburg, Germany, with 114 allocated to the intervention group and 102 to the control group. The intervention was one-to-one peer support, delivered by trained peers and according to a defined role specification, in addition to treatment as usual over the course of six months, as compared to treatment as usual alone. Primary outcome was self-efficacy measured on the General Self-Efficacy Scale at six-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, social functioning, and hospitalisations.\nPatients in the intervention group had significantly higher scores of self-efficacy at the six-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences on secondary outcomes in the intention to treat analyses.\nThe findings suggest that one-to-one peer support delivered by trained peer supporters can improve self-efficacy of patients with severe mental disorders over a one-year period. One-to-one peer support may be regarded as an effective intervention.

As is the case in most fields of medicine, substantial advancements in detecting, treating and preventing AD will likely evolve from the generation and implementation of a systematic precision medicine strategy. This approach will likely be based on the success found from more advanced research fields, such as oncology. Precision medicine will require integration and transfertilization across fragmented specialities of medicine and direct reintegration of Neuroscience, Neurology and Psychiatry into a continuum of medical sciences away from the silo approach. Precision medicine is biomarker-guided medicine on systems-levels that takes into account methodological advancements and discoveries of the comprehensive pathophysiological profiles of complex multi-factorial neurodegenerative diseases, such as late-onset sporadic AD. This will allow identifying and characterizing the disease processes at the asymptomatic preclinical stage, where pathophysiological and topographical abnormalities precede overt clinical symptoms by many years to decades. In this respect, the uncharted territory of the AD preclinical stage has become a major research challenge as the field postulates that early biomarker guided customized interventions may offer the best chance of therapeutic success. Clarification and practical operationalization is needed for comprehensive dissection and classification of interacting and converging disease mechanisms, description of genomic and epigenetic drivers, natural history trajectories through space and time, surrogate biomarkers and indicators of risk and progression, as well as considerations about the regulatory, ethical, political and societal consequences of early detection at asymptomatic stages. In this scenario, the integrated roles of genome sequencing, investigations of comprehensive fluid-based biomarkers and multimodal neuroimaging will be of key importance for the identification of distinct molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways in subsets of asymptomatic people at greatest risk for progression to clinical milestones due to those specific pathways. The precision medicine strategy facilitates a paradigm shift in Neuroscience and AD research and development away from the classical \"one-size-fits-all\" approach in drug discovery towards biomarker guided \"molecularly\" tailored therapy for truly effective treatment and prevention options. After the long and winding decade of failed therapy trials progress towards the holistic systems-based strategy of precision medicine may finally turn into the new age of scientific and medical success curbing the global AD epidemic."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Canadian psychiatry residents if mentally ill: awareness, barriers to disclosure, and help-seeking preferences.", "Abstract": "The medical culture is defined by mental illness stigma, non-disclosure, and avoidance of professional treatment.

Folk mental health traditions, based in religious lifeways and etiologies of supernatural affliction, are overwhelmingly sought by Indians in times of mental ill-health. This is despite the fact that the postcolonial Indian state has historically considered the popularity of these indigenous treatments regressive, and claimed Western psychiatry as the only mental health system befitting the country's aspirations as a modern nation-state. In the last decade however, as global mental health concerns for scaling up psychiatric interventions and instituting bioethical practices in mental health services begin to shape India's mental health policy formulations, the state's disapproving stance towards traditional healing has turned to vehement condemnation. In present-day India, traditional treatments are denounced for being antithetical to global mental health tenets and harmful for the population, while biomedical psychiatry is espoused as the only legitimate form of mental health care. Based on ethnographic research in the Hindu healing temple of Balaji, Rajasthan, and analysis of India's mental health policy environment, I demonstrate how the tenor of the global mental health agenda is negatively impacting the functioning of the country's traditional healing sites. I argue that crucial changes in the therapeutic culture of the Balaji temple, including the disappearance of a number of key healing rituals, are consequences of global mental health-inspired policy in India which is reducing the plural mental health landscape."}, {"Title": "Ethnographic perspectives on global mental health.", "Abstract": "The field of Global Mental Health (GMH) aims to influence mental health policy and practice worldwide, with a focus on human rights and access to care. There have been important achievements, but GMH has also been the focus of scholarly controversies arising from political, cultural, and pragmatic critiques. These debates have become increasingly polarized, giving rise to a need for more dialogue and experience-near research to inform theorizing. Ethnography has much to offer in this respect. This paper frames and introduces five articles in this issue of Transcultural Psychiatry that illustrate the role of ethnographic methods in understanding the effects and implications of the field of global mental health on mental health policy and practice. The papers include ethnographies from South Africa, India, and Tonga that show the potential for ethnographic evidence to inform GMH projects. These studies provide nuanced conceptualizations of GMH's varied manifestations across different settings, the diverse ways that GMH's achievements can be evaluated, and the connections that can be drawn between locally observed experiences and wider historical, political, and social phenomena. Ethnography can provide a basis for constructive dialogue between those engaged in developing and implementing GMH interventions and those critical of some of its approaches."}, {"Title": "Exploring the use of Routine Outcome Monitoring in the treatment of patients with a psychotic disorder.", "Abstract": "Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) has become part of the treatment process in mental health care. However, studies have indicated that few clinicians in psychiatry use the outcome of ROM in their daily work. The aim of this study was to explore the degree of ROM use in clinical practice as well as the explanatory factors of this use.\nIn the Northern Netherlands, a ROM-protocol (ROM-Phamous) for patients with a psychotic disorder has been implemented. To establish the degree of ROM-Phamous use in clinical practice, the ROM results of patients (n=204) were compared to the treatment goals formulated in their treatment plans. To investigate factors that might influence ROM use, clinicians (n=32) were asked to fill out a questionnaire about ROM-Phamous.\nCare domains that were problematic according to the ROM-Phamous results were mentioned in the treatment plan in 28% of cases on average (range 5-45%). The use of ROM-Phamous in the treatment process varies considerably among clinicians. Most of the clinicians find ROM-Phamous both useful and important for good clinical practice. In contrast, the perceived ease-of-use is low and most clinicians report insufficient time to use ROM-Phamous.\nMore frequent ROM use should be facilitated in clinicians. This could be achieved by improving the fit with clinical routines and the ease-of-use of ROM systems. It is important for all stakeholders to invest in integrating ROM in clinical practice.

For this purpose 13 and 15, respectively, stakeholders of the change management were interviewed between 2012 (T1) and 2014 (T2). Moreover, patients and staff were asked to complete a German version of the Recovery Self Assessment (RSA) questionnaire. The main result of the first investigation (T1) was that nursing staff fostered the projected transformation, while physicians and psychologists focused on risk management and worried about losing their role. The patients' and staff's questionnaire ratings of the recovery orientation of the department were surprisingly positive. However, most of the staff members were not correctly informed about patients' rights to see their files. In the second investigation (T2), many of the interviewees were under the impression that either their participation had decreased and/or that the reorganisation, from their point of view, had already been completed. Nevertheless, staff assessed the recovery orientation of their work as significantly improved, while the patients' evaluation of the recovery orientation of the department was unchanged.

Psychiatry has learned that diseases with strong genetic predisposition, such as schizophrenia, show a concordance of around 50% between monozygotic twins, thus evidencing the importance of the genetic background and the presence of environmental variables that stimulate or block phenotypic development. The interest in epigenetics has increased during the last few years due to fundamental discoveries made in molecular and behavioral genetics, although within this framework factual knowledge coexists with fictional expectations and wrong concepts. Is it possible that epigenetic variants modify temperament and human behavior? May abused or neglected children develop long-lasting epigenetic marks in their DNA?

Recently, this insight has been leveraged to link phenomenological and biological levels of understanding in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, results have been mixed, possibly due to small sample sizes. Here we present results from two studies with relatively large Ns to assess VS RPE in schizophrenia.\nIn the current study we analyzed data from two independent studies, involving a total of 87 chronic medicated schizophrenia patients and 61 controls. Subjects completed a probabilistic reinforcement-learning task in conjunction with fMRI scanning. We fit each participant's choice behavior to a Q-learning model and derived trial-wise RPEs. We then modeled BOLD signal data with parametric regressor functions using these values to determine whether patient and control groups differed in prediction-error-related BOLD signal modulations.\nBoth groups demonstrated robust VS RPE BOLD activations. Interestingly, these BOLD activation patterns did not differ between groups in either study. This was true when we included all participants in the analysis, as well as when we excluded participants whose data was not sufficiently fit by the models.\nThese data demonstrate the utility of computational methods in isolating/testing underlying mechanisms of interest in psychiatric disorders. Importantly, similar VS RPE signal encoding across groups suggests that this mechanism does not drive task deficits in these patients.

The second objective is to apply the criteria of causation for ECT, to focus on the dose-effect relationship criteria, and thus to analyze the conditions of application of these criteria for ECT.\nA literature review exploring the use of electricity, ECT and electroencephalography (EEG) in psychiatry was conducted. The publications were identified from the Pubmed and GoogleScholar electronic databases. The scientific literature search of international articles was performed in July 2016.\nIn 1784, a Royal commission established in France by King Louis XVI tested Mesmer's claims concerning animal magnetism. By doing that, the commission, including such prominent scientists as the chemist Anton Lavoisier and the scientist and researcher on electricity and therapeutics Benjamin Franklin, played a central role in establishing the criteria needed to assess the level of evidence of electrical therapeutics in psychiatry. Surprisingly, it is possible to identify the classical Bradford Hill criteria of causation in the report of the commission, except the dose-effect relationship criteria. Since then, it has been conducted blinded randomized controlled trials that confirmed the effectiveness of ECT against ECT placebos for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. At present, the dose-effect relationship criteria can be analyzed through an EEG quality assessment of ECT-induced seizures.\nEEG quality assessment includes several indices: TSLOW (time to onset of seizure activity \u22645Hz, seconds), peak mid-ictal amplitude (mm), regularity (intensity or morphology of the seizure (0-6)), stereotypy (global seizure patterning, 0-3) and post-ictal suppression (0-3). A manual rating sheet is needed to score theses indices. Such manual rating with example of EEG segments recording is proposed in this article.

Yet, the accumulation of data in neurosciences suggests the next emergence of biomarkers, whose interest is that they are closely associated to the biological disturbances underlying psychiatric illnesses, and that they are accessible by means of technological tools such as imaging devices. These tools allow to explore the effects on brain of psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers, in relation to their therapeutic action. The obtained results allow to consider the use of such biomarkers in clinical trials in addition to more conventional approaches. In particular, they could be used as targets to measure brain response to treatment in association with clinical response, to predict a therapeutic response from the neurofunctional characteristics of patients, or to establish the safety profile of drugs on the nervous system.

Most clinical trials rely on the hypothesis of equivalent placebo response rates in both placebo and specific drug arms (\"additive model\"). But contrary to this dominant and rarely questioned hypothesis, several aspects may influence placebo response. A few recent meta-analyses and reviews have shown evidence for several clinical and methodological factors, which are able to modulate placebo response. In psychiatry research, placebo response has been mainly explored through antidepressant trials. In early clinical trials, drug-placebo differences were initially significant and robust. However, more recent clinical trials have not yielded similar results, and rather show narrowed antidepressant-placebo differences. Several factors may be involved in this absence of comparability: intrinsic properties of new antidepressants, changes in clinical criteria and classifications, symptomatic remission rather than global remission criteria, industrial and institutional constraints. Moreover, results from antidepressant trials (laboratory conditions) remain hardly fully transposable to clinical routine (ecological conditions)."}, {"Title": "[Inclusion criteria and rating scales for RCTs in Psychiatry.

Taking into account the formal constraints of industrial, questioning the cultural differences of the methodological approach of the tests, meeting the requirements of feasibility and ever increasing security, frequent cumbersome procedure often contrasts with the modest nature of the results. A better definition to include patients in randomized trials is desirable and it asks to return to the clinic studying the expectations of patients and their response to the therapeutic situation. Excessive standardization otherwise required for ensuring the objective nature of the assessment hampers the collection of original and varied clinical features of importance in the further definitions of indications. On the way to a resumption of the single case study, we can expect from qualitative methods applied to small groups of subjects, optimization principles of patient selection for the upcoming randomized trial and greater chance to address the relevant details of clinical response to the therapeutic situation. This is what has led to the discovery of psychotropic drugs and which is involved in the various modalities of the qualitative approach. For example, and beyond the exploration of clinical drug effects, the study of the experience of psychiatric inpatient care in the Healing Garden, conducted on a small group and on the basis of the narrative analysis of their experience, notes several operating thematic dimensions: a reduction in the perception of symptoms of the disease, the impression of regaining a foothold into reality, the interest of a differently perceived doctor-patient relationship, the advantage of renewed power to act and the recognition of the importance of support from others, patients recovering somehow \u00ab vitality \u00bb of touch with reality.

Since the early works of Ey and Jaspers until recent work of Berrios it has been in question the position psychopathology has in the field of medicine in general, and in the field of psychiatry in particular, especially if it should follow the principles of natural science or if it has an autonomous position between them. This debate has led to two opposing positions facing two different models of psychopathology: the biomedical model and the socio-constructionist model. In this work it is proposed to review the scope and difficulties involved in each model following two central axes: diagnostic reasoning and mental illness conceptual problem. Later, as a synthesis of the analysis proposed they are identified central concepts of each model that could allow the development of a hybrid model in psychopathology; in between them the comprehensive framework employed in symptoms recognition and the social component that characterizes it are highlighted. As a conclusion, these concepts are proposed as central aspects for conceptual and methodological clarification of the research field of diagnostic reasoning in psychopathology."}, {"Title": "Mental Health Disorders Associated with Foodborne Pathogens.", "Abstract": "Human infections with foodborne pathogenic organisms are relatively well described in terms of their overt physical symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, fever, and associated sequelae. Indeed, some of these are key for diagnosis and treatment, although it should be noted that, for some foodborne pathogens, the physical symptoms might be more diffuse, particularly those associated with some of the foodborne parasites. In contrast, the impact of these pathogens on mental health is less well described, and symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and general malaise are usually ignored when foodborne infections are recorded. Despite this, it is generally accepted that there are several psychiatric disorders of unknown etiology that may be associated with microbial pathogens. Depression, autism, hypochondriasis and anxiety, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome probably have multiple contributing causes, among which foodborne pathogens may play a decisive or contributory role, possibly sharing pathophysiological pathways with other environmental triggers. This review focuses on foodborne parasites and bacterial pathogens. Some foodborne parasites, such as metacestodes of Taenia solium and tissue cysts (bradyzoites) of Toxoplasma gondii , may affect mental health by directly infecting the brain. In contrast, bacterial infections and other parasitic infections may contribute to mental illness via the immune system and/or by influencing neurotransmission pathways. Thus, cytokines, for example, have been associated with depression and schizophrenia. However, infectious disease models for psychiatry require a more complete understanding of the relationship between psychiatric disorders and microbial triggers. This article reviews the current state of knowledge on the role of foodborne parasitic and bacterial pathogens in mental illness and identifies some of the gaps that should be addressed to improve diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues that are not solely related to psychiatric factors."}, {"Title": "Staff and caregiver attitude to coercion in India.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess attitudes of Indian psychiatrists and caregivers toward coercion.\nMethods: The study was conducted at the Department of Psychiatry, Krishna Rajendra Hospital, Mysore, India. Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale (SACS), a 15-item questionnaire, was administered to self-selected psychiatrists across India and caregivers from Mysore to measure attitudes on coercion. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and investigating differences in subgroups by means of Chi-square test, Student's <i>t</i>-test, and analysis of variance. Reliability of the SACS was tested in this Indian sample.\nA total of 210 psychiatrists and 210 caregivers participated in the study. Both groups agreed that coercion was related to scarce resources, security concerns, and harm reduction. Both groups agreed that coercion is necessary, but not as treatment. Older caregivers and male experienced psychiatrists considered coercion related to scarce resources to violate patient integrity. All participants considered coercion necessary for protection in dangerous situations. Professionals and caregivers significantly disagreed on most items. The reliability of the SACS was reasonable to good among the psychiatrists group, but not in the caregiver group (alpha 0.58 vs. 0.07).\nCaregivers and psychiatrists felt that the lack of resources is one of the reasons for coercion. Furthermore, they felt that the need on early identification of aggressive behavior, interventions to reduce aggressiveness, empowering patients, improving hospital resources, staff training in verbal de-escalation techniques is essential. There is an urgent need in the standardized operating procedure in the use of coercive measure in Indian mental health setting."}, {"Title": "Filicide in the United States.", "Abstract": "In the United States the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education determines the curriculum required for fellows in forensic psychiatry to become board certified as a subspecialist.

Yet even though some consider Kronfeld to be perhaps the most outstanding theoretician of psychological psychiatry, psychiatrists from the 1930s to the present day have manifested a peculiar reluctance to deal with the concept of intentionality. This article will illustrate Kronfeld's scientific individuality through a survey of some important aspects of his biography, his philosophical background, and his psychiatric work."}, {"Title": "Use of physical restraint in hospital patients: A descriptive study in a tertiary hospital in South Africa.", "Abstract": "The use of physical restraint in patient management is a common and emotive issue, and has legal and ethical dimensions.\nTo document the prevalence of physical restraint use, patient characteristics associated with physical restraint use, and nurses' and doctors' knowledge and perceptions towards the practice.\nA cross-sectional study of 572 patients, of whom 132 were physically restrained, was conducted in acute wards of a tertiary hospital. Data were collected on the 132 physically restrained patients. Fifty-nine doctors and 159 nurses completed a specially constructed questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were derived and expressed as numbers and percentages.\nPrevalence of restraint use was 23% (132/572). The distribution in acute wards was: medical 54.5%; surgical 44.7%; maternity 0.8%; psychiatry none. Mean age (SD) of the restrained patients was 49 years (20.5); 53.8% were male. The commonest types of restraints used were bed rails 93% and wrist belts 12%. Restraints were used largely to protect medical devices and as protection from harm. Less than 15% of the nurses reported having received training and 36% of the doctors reported having received some guidance on the use of restraints. Only a minority of nurses and doctors knew of a hospital policy on restraint use. Documentation on the prescription and indication for the use of restraint was poor.\nPrevalence of restraint use is high and poorly coordinated. A policy on the use of restraint and comprehensive guidelines should be developed to guide health care practitioners in the management of patients where restraint cannot be avoided."}, {"Title": "The role of the affective temperament in the treatment adherence in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Adherence to psychotropic medications is affected by factors related to the treatment, to the physician, to the environment and to the patient himself. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of affective temperaments on treatment adherence.\nThirty six stabilized outpatients were recruited from the aftercare consultation of Psychiatry to perform Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A) for affective temperaments and the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) for treatment adherence.\nThe total MARS score was negatively correlated with the irritable temperament score. The MARS's score relative to the attitude of patients to psychotropic medications and their negative side effects was negatively correlated with the cyclothymic, the irritable and anxious temperaments. Patients having a diagnosis of psychotic disorder had a significantly greater medication adherence and behaviour toward medication score compared to those having a diagnosis of affective disorder. A greater MARS's score for the negative side effects and attitudes to psychotropic medication was associated with medication by neuroleptics with prolonged action.\nThe results of the present study suggest that patients with irritable temperament may have more difficult to follow psychotropic medications, and that patients with cyclothymic, irritable and anxious temperaments may be more attentive and sensitive toward psychotropic medications and their negative side effects."}, {"Title": "Plasma Chemokines in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders: Association of CCL11 (Eotaxin-1) with Psychiatric Comorbidity.", "Abstract": "Recent studies have linked changes in peripheral chemokine concentrations to the presence of both addictive behaviors and psychiatric disorders. The present study further explore this link by analyzing the potential association of psychiatry comorbidity with alterations in the concentrations of circulating plasma chemokine in patients of both sexes diagnosed with alcohol use disorders (AUD). To this end, 85 abstinent subjects with AUD from an outpatient setting and 55 healthy subjects were evaluated for substance and mental disorders. Plasma samples were obtained to quantify chemokine concentrations [C-C motif (CC), C-X-C motif (CXC), and C-X<sub>3</sub>-C motif (CX<sub>3</sub>C) chemokines]. Abstinent AUD patients displayed a high prevalence of comorbid mental disorders (72%) and other substance use disorders (45%). Plasma concentrations of chemokines CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1 (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and CX<sub>3</sub>CL1/fractalkine (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) were lower in AUD patients compared to controls, whereas CCL11/eotaxin-1 concentrations were strongly decreased in female AUD patients (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). In the alcohol group, CXCL8 concentrations were increased in patients with liver and pancreas diseases and there was a significant correlation to aspartate transaminase (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009+0.456, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (<i>r</i>\u2009=\u2009+0.647, <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001). Focusing on comorbid psychiatric disorders, we distinguish between patients with additional mental disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200961) and other substance use disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200938). Only CCL11 concentrations were found to be altered in AUD patients diagnosed with mental disorders (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) with a strong main effect of sex. Thus, patients with mood disorders (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200942) and/or anxiety (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200916) had lower CCL11 concentrations than non-comorbid patients being more evident in women. The alcohol-induced alterations in circulating chemokines were also explored in preclinical models of alcohol use with male Wistar rats. Rats exposed to repeated ethanol (3\u2009g/kg, gavage) had lower CXCL12 (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) concentrations and higher CCL11 concentrations (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.001) relative to vehicle-treated rats. Additionally, the increased CCL11 concentrations in rats exposed to ethanol were enhanced by the prior exposure to restraint stress (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Concordantly, acute ethanol exposure induced changes in CXCL12, CX<sub>3</sub>CL1, and CCL11 in the same direction to repeated exposure. These results clearly indicate a contribution of specific chemokines to the phenotype of AUD and a strong effect of sex, revealing a link of CCL11 to alcohol and anxiety/stress."}, {"Title": "Buprenorphine prescribing practice trends and attitudes among New York providers.", "Abstract": "Buprenorphine office-based opioid maintenance is an increasingly common form of treatment for opioid use disorders. However, total prescribing has not kept pace with the current opioid and overdose epidemic and access remains scarce among the underserved. This study sought to assess current provider attitudes and clinical practices among a targeted sample of primarily New York City public sector buprenorphine prescribers. A cross-sectional online survey purposefully sampled buprenorphine prescribers in NYC with a focus on those serving Medicaid and uninsured patient populations. Expert review of local provider networks, snowball referrals, and in-person networking generated an email list, which received a survey link. A brief 25-question instrument queried provider and practice demographics, prescribing practices including induction approaches and attitudes regarding common hot topics (e.g., buprenorphine diversion, prescriber patient limits, insurance issues, ancillary treatments). Of 132 email invitations, N=72 respondents completed (n=64) or partially completed (n=8) the survey between January and April 2016. Most (79%) were Medicaid providers in non-psychiatric specialties (72%), working in a hospital-based or community general practice (51%), and board-certified in addiction medicine or psychiatry (58%). Practice sizes were generally 100 patients or fewer (71%); many providers (64%) individually prescribed buprenorphine <25% of total practice time to a median 23 patients (mean 31, range 0-102). Unobserved (home) induction for new patients was a common practice: 49% predominantly prescribed unobserved induction; 16% mixed unobserved and observed inductions. Adjunctive psychosocial counseling was routinely recommended (46%) or considered on a case-by-case basis (17%) versus mandated (37%). Medication prior authorization requirements were the highest rated barriers to practice, followed by inadequate clinic space, limited clinic time and/or support staff, and inadequate psychiatric services for dual diagnoses. Buprenorphine diversion was not rated as an important practice barrier. In conclusion, this targeted survey of buprenorphine prescribers in NYC treating primarily underserved populations showed a consistent pattern of part-time prescribing to modest volumes of patients, routine use of unobserved buprenorphine induction, and primarily elective referrals to psychosocial counseling. Barriers to prescribing included prior authorization requirements, lack of clinical resources (space, staff) and psychiatric services. Federal and local efforts to reduce such barriers may improve buprenorphine access among the underserved."}, {"Title": "Side-of-onset of Parkinson's disease in relation to neuropsychological measures.", "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) usually emerges with a unilateral side-of-onset (left-onset: LOPD; right-onset: ROPD; Marinus & van Hilten, 2015) due to an asymmetrical degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons (Donnemiller et\u00a0al., <i>Brain</i>, 135, 2012, 3348). This has led to a body of research exploring the cognitive, neuropsychological, and clinical differences between LOPD and ROPD (e.g., Verreyt et\u00a0al., <i>Neuropsychology Review</i>, 21, 2011, 405).\nThirty ROPD and 14 LOPD cases were drawn from a Boston clinic specializing in PD. Various cognitive and neuropsychological measures were used in an attempt to discover if there were indeed any differences between LOPD and ROPD in this cohort.\nFor LOPD, duration of illness was found to be significantly greater than that of ROPD. However, further testing was able to confirm that despite this difference, it was not the cause of the other significant differences found. Furthermore, this increased duration was consistent with a previous study (Munhoz et\u00a0al., <i>Parkinsonism and Related Disorders</i>, 19, 2013, 77). Performance on the Digit Span Backward (DSB) was found to be significantly poorer in LOPD than ROPD, suggesting compromised executive function in LOPD. Additionally, LOPD had significantly greater anxiety on the DASS Anxiety scales than ROPD. However, unlike Foster et\u00a0al (<i>Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology</i>, 23, 2010, 4), this increased anxiety could not account for the poorer performance on the DSB for LOPD. Finally, ROPD had significantly greater magical ideation than LOPD, which can be explained by the theory put forth by Brugger and Graves (<i>European Archives of Psychiatry</i>, 247, 1997, 55).\nClear and significant differences between LOPD and ROPD were found within our cohort. LOPD showed greater impairment of working memory, greater anxiety, and greater duration of illness-all independent of one another; whereas, those with ROPD had greater magical ideation, also independent of any other variables."}, {"Title": "Trajectories of Substance Use Disorder in Youth After Detention: A 12-Year Longitudinal Study.", "Abstract": "To identify trajectories of substance use disorders (SUDs) in youth during the 12 years after detention and how gender, race/ethnicity, and age at baseline predict trajectories.\nAs part of the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1,829 youth randomly sampled from detention in Chicago, Illinois from 1995 through 1998, participants were reinterviewed in the community or correctional facilities up to 9 times over 12 years. Independent interviewers assessed SUDs using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children 2.3 (baseline) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule IV (follow-ups). Primary outcome was a mutually exclusive 5-category typology of disorder: no SUD, alcohol alone, marijuana alone, comorbid alcohol and marijuana, or \"other\" illicit (\"hard\") drug. Trajectories were estimated using growth mixture models with a 3-category ordinal variable derived from the typology.\nDuring the 12-year follow-up, 19.6% of youth did not have an SUD. The remaining 81.4% were in 3 trajectory classes. Class 1 (24.5%), a bell-shaped trajectory, peaked 5 years after baseline when 42.7% had an SUD and 12.5% had comorbid or \"other\" illicit drug disorders. Class 2 (41.3%) had a higher prevalence of SUD at baseline, 73.8%. Although prevalence decreased over time, 23.5% had an SUD 12 years later.

Carers underwent a clinical interview based upon the neuropsychiatric inventory. Patients were assessed at ForeFront, the Frontotemporal Dementia Research Group at Neuroscience Research Australia or at the Brain and Mind Centre, between January 2008 and December 2013. An index of psychosis was calculated, taking into account the degree and severity of psychosis in each case. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were used to explore relationships between the psychosis index and grey matter changes.\nThirty-four percent of frontotemporal dementia patients showed psychotic features. <i>C9orf72</i> expansion cases were more likely to exhibit psychotic symptoms than non-carriers (64% vs. 26%; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.006), which were also more severe (psychotic index 23.1 vs. 8.1; <i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Delusions comprised persecutory, somatic, jealous and grandiose types and were present in 57% of <i>C9orf72</i> carriers and 19% of non-carriers (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Auditory, visual or tactile hallucinations were present in 36% of <i>C9orf72</i> carriers and 17% of non-carriers (<i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.13). Increased psychotic symptoms in <i>C9orf72</i> expansion carriers correlated with atrophy in a distributed cortical and subcortical network that included discrete regions of the frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, as well as the thalamus, striatum and cerebellum.\nThis study underlines the need to consider and assess for psychotic symptoms in the frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis continuum particularly in those with <i>C9orf72</i> gene expansions. The network of brain regions identified in this study is strikingly similar to that identified in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, which suggests that treatment strategies in psychiatry may be beneficial for the management of psychotic symptoms in frontotemporal dementia."}, {"Title": "Management of psychiatric complications in unrelated donor before unrelated peripheral hematopoietic stem cell collections.", "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can efficiently treat patients with severe hematological diseases.

The occurrence of unexpected acute severe diseases in a donor can compromise the feasibility of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, when a severe health problem occurs in a donor while the recipient has already received a conditioning regimen, hematologists have to find the best solutions for the recipient, while the team in charge of the donor has to find the best medical solutions for the donor.

This painful fact has been known since time immemorial but in spite of this it has not worked in an avertive way to the desired extent. What has the mental health community done towards this direction? Not much, unfortunately. The reasons must be sought in the notion that preservation of peace is considered as self-evident, in the fear that supporting peace may be perceived as a political action or may be just in simple inertia. It must be pointed out, however, that the World Health Organization has indeed included the preservation of peace within the targets of Mental Health Promotion. This is important because it justifies the involvement and intervention of mental health professionals in an area which (at first glance) appears unrelated to mental health and may raise suspicions of political motives. On the basis of the above, the Society of Preventive Psychiatry, the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, the Psychiatric Association for Eastern Europe and the Balkans and the Serbian Psychiatric Association have decided to approach various mainly mental health organizations and ask them to support a Declaration for peace and against the war, the Athens Anti-War Declaration. The basis for the argumentation in favor of this Declaration lies in the fact that War has catastrophic consequences for the mental health of survivors and society as a whole. Additionally, we consider that it is linked with the waves of refugees that follow war and for the mental health consequences for them and for the citizens of the host countries, especially when they are unprepared for this role. The response of the organizations that were asked to support the Declaration has been pleasantly surprising. More that 100 organizations have co-signed the Declaration that was subsequently sent to various international organizations, governments etc and was uploaded on the websites of the organizations that have co-signed the Declaration. There has already been a very encouraging response on behalf of the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker. What do we expect from this Declaration? It would certainly be unrealistic to believe that due to our intervention the wars will stop here and now. Our voice is not all that strong to make us hope for such an effect. Besides, we are fully aware of the fact that in addition to the ever and everywhere present aggression and its societal enhancers there are powerful political, economic and lately religious purposes that are served by war and unfortunately move towards the opposite direction than that of our Declaration. In spite of the above reservations, however, we believe it is a right and an obligation of the international mental health community to speak with a loud voice and towards all directions and state that mental health in our world is at risk because of War, no matter where and by whom it is produced. We also hope that with voices like ours we plant the seed that may grow and flourish in the generations to come.

While 96% (n=218) had positive attitudes towards psychotherapy, 93.1% (n=215) thought psychotherapy was less available than pharmacotherapy. Psychiatrists from peripheral institutions prefer cognitive behavioral therapy, while psychiatrists from central institutions prefer dynamic psychotherapy. Psychiatrists from mental health centers use more dynamic psychotherapy compared to psychiatrists from medical centers. The number of dynamic psychotherapy treatments psychiatrists delivered during their residencies has been decreasing over time, meaning residents today deliver fewer dynamic psychotherapy treatments compared to the number of treatments specialists delivered during their residencies. Additionally, 97.4% (n=225) believed psychotherapy training should be included in the psychiatric residency and 87.3% thought that the training should be improved to a great extent.\nThe survey demonstrates mixed but overall positive attitudes towards psychotherapy among psychiatrists in Israel.

Two subtypes of the syndrome have been identified. Catatonia of the retarded type is characterized by immobility, mutism, staring, rigidity, and a host of other clinical signs. Excited catatonia is a less common presentation in which patients develop prolonged periods of psychomotor agitation. Once thought to be a subtype of schizophrenia, catatonia is now recognized to occur with a broad spectrum of medical and psychiatric illnesses, particularly affective disorders. In many cases, the catatonia must be treated before any underlying conditions can be accurately diagnosed. Most patients with the syndrome respond rapidly to low-dose benzodiazepines, but electroconvulsive therapy is occasionally required. Patients with longstanding catatonia or a diagnosis of schizophrenia may be less likely to respond. The pathobiology of catatonia is poorly understood, although abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate signaling have been suggested as causative factors. Because catatonia is common, highly treatable, and associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated, physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for this complex clinical syndrome. Since 1989, we have systematically assessed patients presenting to our psychiatry service with signs of retarded catatonia.

We studied the biological alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is a region that is highly implicated in the neurobiology of MDD, and the blood cells (BCs) of ovariectomized (OVX) mice subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS), which represents a mouse model of depression during menopause.\nThe mPFC and the BCs were obtained from the same individuals. Gene expression levels were analyzed by microarray. The data were used for the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the Gene Ontology analysis.\nThe gene expression alterations (GEAs) induced by OVX were mainly associated with ribosomal and mitochondrial functions in both the mPFC and the BCs. Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR) was identified as a possible upstream regulator of the OVX-induced GEAs in both tissues. The CMS-induced GEAs were associated with retinoic acid receptor signaling, inflammatory cytokines and post-synaptic density in the mPFC, but not in the BCs.\nOVX and CMS independently affect biological pathways in the mPFC, which is involved in the development of the depression-like phenotype. Because a subset of the OVX-induced GEAs in the mPFC also occurred in the BCs, the GEAs in the BCs might be a useful probe to predict biological pathways in the corresponding brain tissue under specific conditions such as OVX in females."}, {"Title": "Co-morbidity in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Clinical Study from India.", "Abstract": "To assess the prevalence of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric co-morbidities in children and adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder at a tertiary care child and adolescent psychiatry centre.\nA total of 63 children and adolescents who were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and fulfilled the inclusion criteria were comprehensively assessed for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric co-morbidities. The tools used included the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS), Children's Global Assessment Scale, Clinical Global Impression Scale, Vineland Social Maturity Scale, and Childhood Autism Rating Scale.\nAll except 1 subject had neurodevelopmental and / or psychiatric disorder co-morbid with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 66.7% had both neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Specific learning disability was the most common co-existing neurodevelopmental disorder and oppositional defiant disorder was the most common psychiatric co-morbidity. The mean baseline ADHD-RS scores were significantly higher in the group with psychiatric co-morbidities, especially in the group with oppositional defiant disorder.\nCo-morbidity is present at a very high frequency in clinic-referred children diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

However, these experiences may be common in the non-help-seeking population, leading some to propose the existence of a continuum of psychosis from health to disease. Thus far, research on this continuum has focused on what is impaired in help-seeking groups. Here we focus on protective factors in non-help-seeking voice-hearers. We introduce a new study population: clairaudient psychics who receive daily auditory messages. We conducted phenomenological interviews with these subjects, as well as with patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who hear voices, people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder who do not hear voices, and matched control subjects (without voices or a diagnosis). We found the hallucinatory experiences of psychic voice-hearers to be very similar to those of patients who were diagnosed. We employed techniques from forensic psychiatry to conclude that the psychics were not malingering. Critically, we found that this sample of non-help-seeking voice hearers were able to control the onset and offset of their voices, that they were less distressed by their voice-hearing experiences and that, the first time they admitted to voice-hearing, the reception by others was much more likely to be positive. Patients had much more negative voice-hearing experiences, were more likely to receive a negative reaction when sharing their voices with others for the first time, and this was subsequently more disruptive to their social relationships. We predict that this sub-population of healthy voice-hearers may have much to teach us about the neurobiology, cognitive psychology and ultimately the treatment of voices that are distressing."}, {"Title": "A review of a national training initiative to increase provider use of MAT to address the opioid epidemic.", "Abstract": "The Providers' Clinical Support System for Medication Assisted Treatment (PCSS-MAT) initiative focuses on training and mentoring health professionals in the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD) using pharmacological strategies. Led by the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP), PCSS-MAT is a consortium representing four of the five national professional organizations authorized by DATA 2,000-AAAP, American Osteopathic Academy of Addiction Medicine, American Psychiatric Association, and American Society of Addiction Medicine. DATA organizations are authorized to train physicians to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD treatment. The primary aim of PCSS-MAT is to substantially increase evidence-based practices with medications for OUD.\nThis review describes the development of PCSS-MAT, an ongoing national initiative funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to address the training needs posed by this critical public health problem. Core initiatives include: (1) Training and mentoring activities for primary care physicians; (2) Outreach to multidisciplinary professional organizations, (3) Creating a resource portal for families, patients, and communities for OUD treatment.\nEducational outreach to providers addresses the needs of patients with OUD and common co-occurring psychiatric and medical disorders.\nThe overall scope of PCSS-MAT is to increase access to evidence-based treatment of substance use disorders as a public health priority. Recently enacted legislation requires office-based opioid treatment programs to offer all Food and Drug Administration-approved (FDA) forms of MAT.\nWorking with health care providers to effectively deliver MAT is key to integrating behavioral and physical medicine.

The aim of this work was to examine its functioning and to analyze the parents' perceptions about the unit services. Methods - We gathered the parental satisfaction about the unit by the means of a hetero-questionnaire. Results - Fifty-two parents of children evaluated within the unit were included.\u00a0 Patients had received the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specified and Asperger Syndrome in accordance with DSM IV criteria, and than that of Autism Spectrum Disorder after DSM 5 publication. The overall satisfaction rate was 63%. Most parents (84.6%) rated the Psycho Educative Profile examination positively, 75% appreciated the neurological examination and the final report steps, 55.8% appreciated step of the Autism Diagnostic Interview revised and 42.3% the genetic exploration. 67% of the parents reported an improvement of their child following the evaluation. This improvement was attributed to the unit in 57.7% of cases. Parents whose children did not have associated disorders such as intellectual disability (p = 0.02), aggressive behavior (p = 0.04), affective disorder (p = 0.01) and sleep-related disorders (p = 0.03) were the most satisfied. Parents of children with epilepsy comorbidity were the least satisfied (p <10-3). 96% of parents suggested repeating the assessment once a year. Conclusion - Assessment units are based on international recommendations. However, it would be interesting to adapt assessments and orientation to the parents' expectations."}, {"Title": "[Feeling of Liberty and Internalized Stigma: Comparison of Inpatient and Outpatient Cases Receiving Psychiatric Treatment].", "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated whether liberty-restricting and other factors can predict internalized stigma among psychiatric inpatients and outpatients.\nThe study sample comprised of 129 inpatients, admitted at least once to psychiatry ward, and 100 outpatients who have never been hospitalized, receiving psychiatric treatment. In addition to demographic and clinical features, patients were evaluated for perceived deprivation of liberty and internalized stigma levels.\nPatients stated that their liberty was restrained mostly due to involuntary treatment, communication problems, side effects of medical treatment and inability to choose their treatment team. Regression analysis showed that internalized stigma was predicted by perceived deprivation of liberty, marital status and number of admissions to ward. Stigma was related to marital status and admissions to the psychiatry ward. Perceived deprivation of liberty predicts stigma regardless of the disease severity CONCLUSION: Perception of stigma leads to self-isolation, behavioral avoidance and refusal of aid-seeking. Our study indicated that perceived deprivation of liberty is one of the most important factors that lead to increased stigma. Based on our findings, we can say that as patients experience less perceived deprivation of liberty, they would have less stigma and thus, their compliance would increase."}, {"Title": "A pragmatic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of mixed features in adults with mood disorders.", "Abstract": "Mixed features specifier (MFS) is a new nosological entity defined and operationalized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th Edition. The impetus to introduce the MFS and supplant mixed states was protean, including the lack of ecological validity, high rates of misdiagnosis, and guideline discordant treatment for mixed states. Mixed features specifier identifies a phenotype in psychiatry with greater illness burden, as evidenced by earlier age at onset, higher episode frequency and chronicity, psychiatric and medical comorbidity, suicidality, and suboptimal response to conventional antidepressants. Mixed features in psychiatry have historical, conceptual, and nosological relevance; MFS according to DSM-5, is inherently neo-Kraepelinian insofar as individuals with either Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) may be affected by MFS. Clinicians are encouraged to screen all patients presenting with a major depressive episode (or hypomanic episode) for MFS. Although \"overlapping symptoms\" were excluded from the diagnostic criteria (eg, agitation, anxiety, irritability, insomnia), clinicians are encouraged to probe for these nonspecific symptoms as a possible proxy of co-existing MFS. In addition to conventional antidepressants, second generation antipsychotics and/or conventional mood stabilizers (eg, lithium) may be considered as first-line therapies for individuals with a depressive episode as part of MDD or BD with mixed features."}, {"Title": "Forgotten but not gone: new developments in the understanding and treatment of tardive dyskinesia.", "Abstract": "The broad use of atypical antipsychotics was expected to dramatically reduce the prevalence and incidence of tardive dyskinesia (TD), but data show that TD remains an important challenge due the persistent nature of its symptoms and resistance to numerous treatment modalities, including antipsychotic discontinuation. Recent insights on genetic risk factors and new concepts surrounding pathophysiology have spurred interest in the possibility of targeted treatment for TD. As will be reviewed in this article, the number of evidence-based strategies for TD treatment is small: only clonazepam, amantadine, ginkgo biloba extract, and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor tetrabenazine have compelling data. Using new insights into the metabolism of tetrabenazine and the properties of its active metabolites, 2 modifications of tetrabenazine have been synthesized to improve the kinetic profile, and are currently involved in double-blind placebo controlled studies aimed at U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval. The possible availability of these new agents, deuterated tetrabenazine and valbenazine, significantly widens the range of treatment choices for patients with TD. For clinicians with patients at risk for TD due to dopamine antagonist exposure, experience has shown that the problem of TD will be an ongoing issue in modern psychiatry, and that an appreciation of new developments in the pathophysiology of, risk factors for, and treatment of TD is crucial to managing this condition."}, {"Title": "Cross-Disorder Psychiatric Genomics.", "Abstract": "The following review provides some description of the movement in cross-disorder psychiatric genomics toward addressing both comorbidity and polygenicity.\nWe attempt to show how dimensional approaches to the phenotype have led to further addressing the problem of comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses.

However, the use of neurofeedback as a therapeutic tool for psychiatric disorders remains controversial. The aim of this review is to summarize and to comment the level of evidence of electroencephalogram (EEG) neurofeedback and real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback for therapeutic application in psychiatry.\nLiterature on neurofeedback and mental disorders but also on brain computer interfaces (BCI) used in the field of neurocognitive science has been considered by the group of expert of the Neurofeedback evaluation & training (NExT) section of the French Association of biological psychiatry and neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN).\nResults show a potential efficacy of EEG-neurofeedback in the treatment of attentional-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, even if this is still debated. For other mental disorders, there is too limited research to warrant the use of EEG-neurofeedback in clinical practice. Regarding fMRI neurofeedback, the level of evidence remains too weak, for now, to justify clinical use. The literature review highlights various unclear points, such as indications (psychiatric disorders, pathophysiologic rationale), protocols (brain signals targeted, learning characteristics) and techniques (EEG, fMRI, signal processing).\nThe field of neurofeedback involves psychiatrists, neurophysiologists and researchers in the field of brain computer interfaces. Future studies should determine the criteria for optimizing neurofeedback sessions. A better understanding of the learning processes underpinning neurofeedback could be a key element to develop the use of this technique in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Opportunities and Challenges for Psychiatry in the Connectomic Era.", "Abstract": "Most major psychiatric disorders arise from disturbances of anatomically distributed neural systems rather than isolated dysfunction of circumscribed brain regions. The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in our capacity to measure, map, and model neural connectivity in diverse species and at different resolution scales, from the level of individual neurons and synapses to large-scale systems spanning the entire brain. In this review, we consider how these techniques, when grounded in the theory and methods of network science, can contribute to a biological understanding of mental illness. We focus in particular on attempts to accurately map brain network disturbances in clinical populations and to model the mechanistic causes of these changes. This work suggests that pathology within highly connected hub regions is a consistent finding across a broad array of phenotypically diverse disorders, and that disparate changes in brain network organization can sometimes be explained by a surprisingly small and simple set of mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Strategies for Advancing Disease Definition Using Biomarkers and Genetics: The Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes.", "Abstract": "It is critical for psychiatry as a field to develop approaches to define the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of its brain diseases, especially for serious mental illnesses, and then to use these definitions to generate biologically based disease categories, as well as to explore disease mechanisms and illness etiologies. Our current reliance on phenomenology is inadequate to support exploration of molecular treatment targets and disease formulations, and the leap directly from phenomenology to disease biology has been limiting because of broad heterogeneity within conventional diagnoses. The questions addressed in this review are formulated around how we can use brain biomarkers to achieve disease categories that are biologically based. We have grouped together a series of vignettes as examples of early approaches, all using the Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) biomarker database and collaborators, starting off with describing the foundational statistical methods for these goals. We use primarily criterion-free statistics to identify pertinent groups of involved genes related to psychosis as well as symptoms, and finally, to create new biologically based disease cohorts within the psychopathological dimension of psychosis. Although we do not put these results forward as final formulations, they represent a novel effort to rely minimally on phenomenology as a diagnostic tool and to fully embrace brain characteristics of structure, as well as molecular and cellular characteristics and function, to support disease definition in psychosis."}, {"Title": "Predictors of response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, consists of applying series of magnetic impulses to the cerebral cortex so as to modulate neurone activity in a target zone. This technique, still experimental, could prove promising in the field of psychiatry, in particular for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It is important for the clinician to be able to assess the response potential of a given patient to rTMS, and this among other things requires relevant predictive factors to be available. This review of the literature aims to determine and analyse reported predictive factors for therapeutic response to rTMS treatment in major depressive disorder. Different parameters are studied, in particular age, the severity of the depressive episode, psychological dimensions, genetic factors, cerebral blood flows via cerebral imagery, and neuronavigation. The factors found to be associated with better therapeutic response were young age, low level of severity of the depressive episode, motor threshold intensity over 100%, more than 1000 stimulations per session, more than 10 days treatment, L/L genotype on the 5-HTTLPR transporter gene, C/C homozygosity on the promotor regions of the 5-HT1A receptor gene, Val/Val homozygosity on the BDNF gene, cordance analyses by EEG, and finally the accurate localisation provided by neuronavigation.

In psychiatry, low vitamin D levels have been associated with schizophrenia, depression, psychotic symptoms, and, more recently, alcohol use disorders. Alcohol use disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the association between alcohol use and vitamin D serum levels. The PubMed, SCIELO, and Lilacs databases were searched for this systematic review. We assessed all articles published from 1976 to December 2015, and we examined the associated reference lists to retrieve articles that appeared to fulfill our criteria. Of 932 articles, 49 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the papers (71.4%) were cross-sectional studies. Alcohol intake was found to be positively associated with vitamin D status in 15 articles and negatively associated with vitamin D in 18 articles; no association was found in 16 articles. Heterogeneous results were found in our review, with a similar number of papers indicating a positive association, a negative association or the absence of any association between alcohol use and vitamin D levels. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the studies in which a positive association was found were more recent papers that involved considerably larger sample sizes than those in other studies. The older studies compared vitamin D levels in alcoholic and non-alcoholic patients, in contrast to more recent studies, which focused on more specific populations. In addition, most of the selected papers were from high latitude countries, where exposure to sunlight tends to be lower than in tropical countries. The data concerning vitamin D levels in patients with alcohol use disorders remain controversial. Additional research using a standardized methodology is necessary to demonstrate the real impact of alcohol consumption on vitamin D serum levels as well as on the health status of alcohol users."}, {"Title": "[Effect of culture to delusions: Introduction of the Truman Show delusion].", "Abstract": "\"People accepts the reality of the unfolded world\" - says Peter Weir in his writing from 1998.

Three hundred seventy-six pregnant women were evaluated using a range of tools to collect data on socio-economic and demographic factors, social support, life events, interpersonal violence and mental health diagnoses. We examined the significant risk factors for SIB using univariate, bivariate and logistic regression analyses (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The 1-month prevalence of SIB was 18%. SIB was associated with psychiatric illness, notably major depressive episode (MDE) and any anxiety disorder.

Factors associated with SIB included lower socio-economic status, food insecurity, interpersonal violence, multiparousity, and lifetime suicide attempt. These findings focus attention on the importance of socio-economic and contextual factors in the aetiology of SIB and lend support to the idea that suicide risk should be assessed independently of depression and anxiety among pregnant women."}, {"Title": "Intrinsic functional connectivity of fronto-temporal networks in adolescents with early psychosis.", "Abstract": "Adults with psychotic disorders have abnormal connectivity of fronto-temporal networks.

Mean fractional anisotropy was measured in clusters showing between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC). For the language network, there was a group effect within the right middle/inferior frontal gyrus, explained by reduced iFC in patients with an FEP relative to healthy controls, while in participants with a psychosis risk syndrome values of iFC were intermediate. In this region, values of iFC were positively correlated with mean fractional anisotropy in patients with an FEP. No group differences were observed in the salience network.

While depression and hopelessness are important factors for suicide in psychiatric patients, the role of psychotic symptoms is unclear. We examine the comparative differences in the clinical correlates of suicide in SSD and AD patients with suicidal risk.\nOne hundred and twenty suicidal psychiatric patients (aged between 17-60 years) were evaluated for depression severity, hopelessness, past attempts, and reasons for wanting to commit suicide at the emergency psychiatry centre. Of these 29% had SSD, 65% AD, and 6% other disorders.\nLifetime history of suicide attempts and suicide attempts in previous month were higher in SSD patients. Mean Beck Depression scores, Hopelessness, and Suicide Intention scores were significantly lower in patients with SSD as compared to AD (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.05). More than 60% patients with SSD attributed psychotic symptoms as a reason for wanting to commit suicide, while more than 50% patients with AD attributed it to family and personal stressors (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.001).\nFactors associated with suicidal ideations were significantly different between SSD and AD patients.

Suicide, a complex phenomenon, is a final common pathway for a variety of causal etiologies. Nevertheless, psychiatry continues to argue for curative solutions based on the reductionistic biomedical model, rather than support public health measures to manage the larger sociocultural, economic, and political context. While psychiatry and curative medicine help many people in distress, specific mental health interventions are unlikely to impact secular trends in the rates of suicide. The reduction of population rates of suicide requires a range of public health measures."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric/ psychological forensic report writing.", "Abstract": "Approaches to forensic report writing in psychiatry, psychology, and related mental health disciplines have moved from an organization, content, and stylistic framework to considering ethical and other codes, evidentiary standards, and practice considerations. The first part of the article surveys different approaches to forensic report writing, including that of forensic mental health assessment and psychiatric ethics. The second part deals especially with psychological ethical approaches. The American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles and Code of Conduct (2002) provide one set of principles on which to base forensic report writing. The U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence (2014) and related state rules provide another basis. The American Psychological Association's Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology (2013) provide a third source. Some work has expanded the principles in ethics codes; and, in the third part of this article, these additions are applied to forensic report writing. Other work that could help with the question of forensic report writing concerns the 4 Ds in psychological injury assessments (e.g., conduct oneself with Dignity, avoid the adversary Divide, get the needed reliable Data, Determine interpretations and conclusions judiciously). One overarching ethical principle that is especially applicable in forensic report writing is to be comprehensive, scientific, and impartial. As applied to forensic report writing, the overall principle that applies is that the work process and product should reflect integrity in its ethics, law, and science. Four principles that derive from this meta-principle concern: Competency and Communication; Procedure and Protection; Dignity and Distance; and Data Collection and Determination. The standards or rules associated with each of these principles are reviewed."}, {"Title": "Computerized physical activity training for persons with severe mental illness - experiences from a communal supported housing project.", "Abstract": "To study the effectiveness of Exergames in communal psychiatry for persons with severe mental illness, a randomized cluster study was performed. The hypothesis was to increase physical activity habits to improve somatic health. To identify factors promoting or impeding the use of the Exergames.\nAssessments of BMI, blood pressure, physical fitness, SF36, GAF and social interactions were studied at baseline and 10 months. An integrated methods design using content analysis of focus group interviews was integrated with a statistical analysis. Forty-three persons were randomized to the intervention and 30 to the control group. The qualitative interviews included 18 users, 11 staffs and one technical assistant.\nThere were no significant between-group changes in physical activity behaviours or somatic health parameters after 10 months. Only 5% of the intervention group made systematic use of the intervention. Technological difficulties and staff attitudes were found to be barriers. The Exergames were perceived as technically complicated. The staff did not see playing TV games as important and negative attitudes were found.\nExergames was not a successful intervention to increase physical activity behaviours in persons with severe mental illness in the community. Exergames and motivation for physical activity in this group is problematic. Implications for rehabilitation There are difficulties to change passive physical activity habits for persons with severe mental illness, living in sheltered housing conditions in the community due to negative symptoms with depression, low motivation and bad self -confidence. An exergame intervention was not successful in this group of persons. No somatic health benefits were found. Simple physical activities and offering different choices meeting different user needs should be offered.

They exhibit lower levels of mindfulness and coping skills and higher levels of depression symptoms, fatigue, worry, and stress. These preliminary findings should encourage programs to initiate and study curricula that combine mindfulness and self-awareness coping strategies to enhance or protect against burnout as well as cognitive behavioral coaching strategies to offset symptoms of burnout when present."}, {"Title": "Tonsillectomy remains a questionable option for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).", "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) is a disease attributed to children with obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) or tic disorders associated with streptococcal infections. Because otolaryngologists examine a large number of pediatric patients with recurrent streptococcal infections, tonsillectomy (TE) is a common option of therapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of TE in patients presenting with verified PANDAS. <b>Material and methods:</b> A PubMed review was performed using search terms \"tonsillectomy\" and \"PANDAS\", \"OCD\", \"compulsive\" \"pediatric autoimmune\", \"chorea\" and \"tic\" limited by publication date of January 1, 1995, to July 31, 2015. Reviews without patients were not included in the review. <b>Results:</b> Nine papers matched our search criteria, including 6 case reports with 8 patients and 3 case series. Most case reports were in favor of TE, but this was by far not supported by the findings in the case series. The follow-up ranged from 2 to 36 months in case reports and from 24 to 36 in case series. <b>Conclusion:</b> Establishing the diagnosis of PANDAS is complicated because of underlying comorbidities in the field of neurology-psychiatry and the lack of a reliable biomarker. The positive outcome after TE as reported in case studies may be influenced by the postoperative medication and is not supported by the results of large-scale studies. In the light of the considerable postoperative morbidity rate, it appears wise to indicate TE for PANDAS only in supervised clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Sexual homicide: Brief review of the literature and case report involving rape, genital mutilation and human arson.", "Abstract": "The objective of the current paper is to report a new case of sexual murder involving human arson and summarize the literature on the phenomenon of sexual homicide. The present case study is unprecedented in Greece and a rarity in international literature due to the fact that the victim suffered genital mutilation and incineration while still alive. The evaluation consisted of 176 articles; 53 were reviewed by the authors. The results revealed sparse, but significant, research findings. The authors discuss the limitations regarding research, incidence of the phenomenon, crime-scene patterns, offender characteristics (killing methods, motive inferences, sociodemographic data, classifications, psychopathology, modus operandi), and victim selection. The incidence of the phenomenon is unclear (1-4%) due to non-standardized criteria. It is an expression of displaced anger or sexual sadism and/or a way to elude detection (ancillary benefit). Most offenders (in their first kill) and victims were in their late 20s to early 30s and belong to Caucasian populations. Personal weapons were commonly used against women, strangulation is the prevalent killing method against children, and firearms against men. Most of the sexual homicide perpetrators are non-psychotic at the time of the attack, but experience personality pathology, primitive defenses, pathological object relations, and withdrawal into fantasy in order to deal with social isolation."}, {"Title": "Clinical Validation of Reduced Alcohol Consumption After Treatment for Alcohol Dependence Using the World Health Organization Risk Drinking Levels.", "Abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent public health problem associated with considerable individual and societal costs. Abstinence from alcohol is the most widely accepted target of treatment for AUD, but it severely limits treatment options and could deter individuals who prefer to reduce their drinking from seeking treatment. Clinical validation of reduced alcohol consumption as the primary outcome of alcohol clinical trials is critical for expanding treatment options. One potentially useful measure of alcohol treatment outcome is a reduction in the World Health Organization (WHO, International Guide for Monitoring Alcohol Consumption and Related Harm. Geneva, Switzerland, 2000) risk levels of alcohol use (very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, and low risk). For example, a 2-shift reduction in WHO risk levels (e.g., high risk to low risk) has been used by the European Medicines Agency (2010, Guideline on the Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Alcohol Dependence. UK) to evaluate nalmefene as a treatment for alcohol dependence (AD; Mann et\u00a0al. 2013, Biol Psychiatry 73, 706-13).\nThe current study was a secondary data analysis of the COMBINE study (n\u00a0=\u00a01,383; Anton et\u00a0al., ) to examine the association between reductions in WHO risk levels and reductions in alcohol-related consequences and mental health symptoms during and following treatment in patients with AD.\nAny reduction in WHO risk drinking level during treatment was associated with significantly fewer alcohol-related consequences and improved mental health at the end of treatment and for up to 1\u00a0year posttreatment. A greater reduction in WHO risk drinking level predicted a greater reduction in consequences and greater improvements in mental health.\nChanges in WHO risk levels appear to be a valid end point for alcohol clinical trials. Based on the current findings, reductions in WHO risk drinking levels during treatment reflect meaningful reductions in alcohol-related consequences and improved functioning."}, {"Title": "A Roadmap for the Development of Applied Computational Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Computational psychiatry is a burgeoning field that utilizes mathematical approaches to investigate psychiatric disorders, derive quantitative predictions, and integrate data across multiple levels of description. Computational psychiatry has already led to many new insights into the neurobehavioral mechanisms that underlie several psychiatric disorders, but its usefulness from a clinical standpoint is only now starting to be considered.\nExamples of computational psychiatry are highlighted, and a phase-based pipeline for the development of clinical computational-psychiatry applications is proposed, similar to the phase-based pipeline used in drug development. It is proposed that each phase has unique endpoints and deliverables, which will be important milestones to move tasks, procedures, computational models, and algorithms from the laboratory to clinical practice.\nApplication of computational approaches should be tested on healthy volunteers in Phase I, transitioned to target populations in Phase IB and Phase IIA, and thoroughly evaluated using randomized clinical trials in Phase IIB and Phase III. Successful completion of these phases should be the basis of determining whether computational models are useful tools for prognosis, diagnosis, or treatment of psychiatric patients.\nA new type of infrastructure will be necessary to implement the proposed pipeline.

In teaching hospitals, PS may influence the clinical learning environment for trainees.\nWe assessed whether resident physicians believe they are psychologically safe, and if PS is associated with how they rate satisfaction with their clinical learning experience.\nData were extracted from the Learners' Perceptions Survey (LPS) of residents who rotated through a Department of Veterans Affairs health care facility for academic years 2011-2014. Predictors of PS and its association with resident satisfaction were adjusted to account for confounding and response rate biases using generalized linear models.\nThe 13\u200a044 respondents who completed the LPS (30% response rate) were comparable to nonpediatric, non-obstetrics-gynecology residents enrolled in US residency programs.

This systematic review aimed to summarize literature on attitudes toward informal coercion, its prevalence, and clinical effects.\nA systematic search of PubMed, Embase, PsycINF, and Google Scholar was conducted. Publications were included if they reported original data describing patients' and clinicians' attitudes toward and prevalence rates or clinical effects of informal coercion.\nTwenty-one publications out of a total of 162 articles met the inclusion criteria. Most publications focused on leverage and inducements rather than persuasion and threat. Prevalence rates of informal coercion were 29-59%, comparable on different study sites and in different settings. The majority of mental health professionals as well as one-third to two-third of the psychiatric patients had positive attitudes, even if there was personal experience of informal coercion. We found no study evaluating the clinical effect of informal coercion in an experimental study design.\nCultural and ethical aspects are associated with the attitudes and prevalence rates. The clinical effect of informal coercion remains unclear and further studies are needed to evaluate these interventions and the effect on therapeutic relationship and clinical outcome. It can be hypothesized that informal coercion may lead to better adherence and clinical outcome but also to strains in the therapeutic relationship. It is recommendable to establish structured education about informal coercion and sensitize mental health professionals for its potential for adverse effects in clinical routine practice."}, {"Title": "Toward a better understanding on the role of prediction error on memory processes: From bench to clinic.", "Abstract": "Experimental psychology defines Prediction Error (PE) as a mismatch between expected and current events.

Considering the role of stress as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders, it is not surprising that cortisol stress reactivity has frequently been investigated in patients versus healthy individuals. However, the large heterogeneity in measures of the cortisol stress response has hampered a systematic evaluation of the evidence. We here report of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on cortisol reactivity to psychosocial stress across psychiatric disorders. Original data from authors were obtained to construct standardized cortisol outcomes (the areas under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi) and ground (AUCg)) and to examine the influence of sex and symptomatic state on cortisol stress reactivity. Fourteen studies on major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=1129), 9 on anxiety disorders (n=732, including social anxiety disorder (SAD), posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and mixed samples of anxiety disorders) and 4 on schizophrenia (n=180) were included that used the Trier Social Stress Test or an equivalent psychosocial stress task. Sex-dependent changes in stress reactivity were apparent in MDD and anxiety disorders. Specifically, women with current MDD or an anxiety disorder exhibited a blunted cortisol stress response, whereas men with current MDD or SAD showed an increased cortisol response to psychosocial stress. In individuals with remitted MDD, altered cortisol stress reactivity was less pronounced in women and absent in men. For schizophrenia, cortisol stress reactivity was blunted in both men and women, but the number of studies was limited and showed evidence for publication bias. These findings illustrate that sharing individual data to disentangle the effects of sex, symptom levels and other factors is essential for further understanding of the alterations in cortisol stress reactivity across psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Locating Risk in the Adolescent Brain: Ethical Challenges in the Use of Biomarkers for Adolescent Health and Social Policy.", "Abstract": "Technological developments in neuroscience over the last 20 years have generated excitement about the potential of neuroscientific insights for the understanding of and intervention in children's and adolescents' behavior.

Psychiatry and Law in the Court of Protection-Expert Discourses of 'Insight' (and 'Compliance').", "Abstract": "A finding that 'P' (as the person who is subject to Court of Protection proceedings is known) lacks mental capacity is the trigger for exposing them to decision-making by others and the powers of the Court of Protection (CoP) which, in the words of Justice Hedley, can be 'invasive and draconian' (Hedley J in PC v City of York Council cited in [2013] EWCA Civ 478 [13]). Whilst the law asserts the upper hand in the assessment of mental capacity for persons who come before the CoP, it is the discipline of psychiatry, which dominates expert witness testimony in these proceedings. There are a number of implications of allowing psychiatry to dominate this terrain, not least that, as will be argued in this article, clinical discourse, which makes reference to non-statutory terminology such as 'lack of insight' and 'non-compliance' are imported into the business of capacity assessment. This terminology, if used lazily and without clear reference to the statutory criteria, has the potential to muddy the waters of assessing P's capacity. At its worst, it can mask value judgements, which threaten to undermine the law's 'autonomy promoting' provisions set out in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Whilst it is not intended to discredit 'insight' as a concept in psychiatry, this article concludes that it has a proper context and that in the mental capacity context, decision-makers, lawyers, and advocates should exercise careful scrutiny of its use, and CoP judgments should carefully interrogate the language imported by expert witnesses."}, {"Title": "Guidelines for biological treatment of substance use and related disorders, part 1: Alcoholism, first revision.", "Abstract": "These practice guidelines for the biological treatment of alcohol use disorders are an update of the first edition, published in 2008, which was developed by an international Task Force of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP).

Simply training more forensic psychiatrists will not both meet the psychiatric needs of incarcerated patients and fulfill the essential roles forensic psychiatrists play in the justice system. Therefore, it is essential that all psychiatry residency programs include time allotted to forensic psychiatry just as time is allotted to the other major subspecialties, including child and adolescent psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and psychosomatic medicine.

Another per-protocol dataset will contain all data time-stamped according to the date of intervention received at each cluster site. Qualitative interviews with GPs and patients at three and nine months post-training will investigate experiences and challenges related to implementing recovery-oriented practice in primary care.\nRecovery-oriented practice is gaining increasing prominence in mental health service delivery and the outcomes of such an approach within the primary care sector for the first time will be evaluated in this project. If findings are positive, the intervention has the potential to extend recovery-oriented practice to GPs throughout the community.\nAustralian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ( ACTRN12614001312639 ).

Psychiatric examination, self-report questionnaires, legal documents, and witness reports have been reviewed in evaluation of the case. Evidence pointed to total denial of pregnancy, that is, until delivery. The diagnoses of an acute dissociative reaction to stress (remitted) and a subsequent PTSD were established in a follow-up examination conducted 7\u00a0months after the delivery. Notwithstanding the inherently dissociative nature of total denial of pregnancy, no other evidence has been found about pre-existing psychopathology. For causing the newborn's death, the patient faced charges for \"aggravated murder,\" which were later on reduced into \"involuntary manslaughter.\" Given the physical incapacity to perform voluntary acts due to the loss of control over her actions during the delivery, and the presence of an acute dissociative reaction to unexpected delivery, the legal case represents an intricate overlap between \"insanity\" and \"incapacitation\" defenses. The rather broad severity spectrum of acute dissociative conditions requires evaluation of the limits and conditions of appropriate legal defenses by mental health experts and lawyers. Denial of pregnancy as a source of potential stress has attracted little interest in psychiatric literature although solid research exists which documented that it is not infrequent. Arguments are presented to introduce this condition as a diagnostic category of female reproductive psychiatry with a more neutral label: \"unperceived pregnancy.\""}, {"Title": "Exposure to violence, a risk for suicide in youths and young adults. A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.", "Abstract": "To assess the association and magnitude of the effect of early exposure to different types of interpersonal violence (IPV) with suicide attempt and suicide death in youths and young adults.\nWe searched six databases until June 2015. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) assessment of any type of IPV as risk factor of suicide attempt or suicide: (i) child maltreatment [childhood physical, sexual, emotional abuse, neglect], (ii) bullying, (iii) dating violence, and (iv) community violence; (2) population-based case-control or cohort studies; and (3) subjects aged 12-26 years. Random models were used for meta-analyses (Reg: CRD42013005775).\nFrom 23 682 articles, 29 articles with 143 730 subjects for meta-analyses were included. For victims of any IPV, OR of subsequent suicide attempt was 1.99 (95% CI: 1.73-2.28); for child maltreatment, 2.25 (95% CI: 1.85-2.73); for bullying, 2.39 (95% CI: 1.89-3.01); for dating violence, 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40-1.94); and for community violence, 1.48 (95% CI: 1.16-1.87). Young victims of IPV had an OR of suicide death of 10.57 (95% CI: 4.46-25.07).\nEarly exposure to IPV confers a risk of suicide attempts and particularly suicide death in youths and young adults. Future research should address the effectiveness of preventing and detecting early any type of IPV exposure in early ages."}, {"Title": "Use of Electronic Resources for Psychiatry Clerkship Learning: A Medical Student Survey.", "Abstract": "The primary aim of this study is to examine medical students' use patterns, preferences, and perceptions of electronic educational resources available for psychiatry clerkship learning.\nEligible participants included medical students who had completed the psychiatry clerkship during a 24-month period. An internet-based questionnaire was used to collect information regarding the outcomes described above.\nA total of 68 medical students responded to the survey. Most respondents reported high utilization of electronic resources on an array of devices for psychiatry clerkship learning and indicated a preference for electronic over print resources. The most commonly endorsed barriers to the use of electronic resources were that the source contained irrelevant and non-specific content, access was associated with a financial cost, and faculty guidance on recommended resources was insufficient. Respondents indicated a wish for more psychiatry-specific electronic learning resources.\nThe authors' results suggest that a demand exists for high-quality electronic and portable learning tools that are relevant to medical student education in psychiatry. Psychiatry educators are usefully positioned to be involved in the development of such resources."}, {"Title": "Psychometric properties of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): measurement invariance between athletes and non-athletes and construct validity.", "Abstract": "Although Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, Cohen, Kamarack & Mermelstein, 1983) has been validated and widely used in many domains, there is still no validation in sports by comparing athletes and non-athletes and examining related psychometric\u00a0indices.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the measurement invariance of PSS between athletes and non-athletes, and examine construct validity and reliability in the sports contexts.\nStudy 1 sampled 359 college student-athletes (males = 233; females = 126) and 242 non-athletes (males = 124; females = 118) and examined factorial structure, measurement invariance and internal consistency.

Being as how the syndrome is caused by multiple factors, it is important to recognize each risk factor affecting the patient in order to anticipate and prevent it. In case of diagnosis, identifying and treating the root cause that triggered is important, given that it has a high rate of comorbidity and an elevated cost of medical care. We describe a case where a patient with hypothyroidism began suffering from delirium due to an abrupt discontinuation of levothyroxine treatment. Previously, the patient was seemingly healthy. After the medical treatment was interrupted, sensory processing and behavior were altered, and symptoms fluctuated, for a short period of time, showing disorientation and memory and language impairment."}, {"Title": "A Case of Mania Presenting with Hypersexual Behavior and Gender Dysphoria that Resolved with Valproic Acid.", "Abstract": "Hypersexuality and gender dysphoria have both been described in the literature as symptoms of mania.

Evidence about interventions of adults with ADHD is growing rapidly and clinicians need a reliable summary of all the best available information in order to better inform their daily practice. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases until 31 May 2016 for systematic reviews about pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in adults with ADHD and carried out a meta-review to address clinically relevant questions. We identified a total of 40 papers. Psychostimulants-such as methylphenidate, dexamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts and lisdexamfetamine-and non-psychostimulants-such as atomoxetine-were the most studied agents. Overall, pharmacological treatments were significantly more efficacious than placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.45, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.52), albeit less well accepted (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.36) and tolerated (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.97 to 2.66). The effects of pharmacological treatment for individuals with co-occurring ADHD and substance use disorder are still uncertain. The evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD in adults, as well as the combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, is only preliminary. In conclusion, while available evidence addressed mainly the efficacy and tolerability of psychostimulants and non-psychostimulants for ADHD core symptoms in the short term, we still need further empirical support for the non-pharmacological and multimodal treatments. A comprehensive evidence-informed hierarchy of ADHD drugs based on their efficacy and tolerability is not yet available but it should be the next research priority in the field."}, {"Title": "[Prevalence and Associated Factors of Mental Disorders in Colombian Child Population, the 2015 National Mental Health Survey].", "Abstract": "The 2015 National Mental Health Survey aimed to expand our knowledge about the real mental state of children in Colombia, taking into account the fact that most mental disorders in adults begin during childhood or adolescence. It is essential to have an improved knowledge of the magnitude of this issue and to design timely interventions that reduce long term complications.\nThe aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the disorders in the last 12 months and 30 days according to the DSM-IV, as well as to collect data about social and demographic variables.\nThe structured Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-P), which provides DSM-IV diagnoses, was applied to carers of non-institutionalised children between 7 and 11 years old. The disorders evaluated included: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in its three kinds (mixed, inattentive, and hyperactive), oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. The instrumentation was computer-assisted.\nPrevalences of the disorders are present both in the last 30 days and in the last 12 months. In general, there is a prevalence of any of the disorders of 3% (95% CI, 2.2-4.0) in the last 30 days, and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6-6.2) in the last 12 months. When evaluated individually, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the most frequent disorder, with a prevalence of 2.3% and 3.0% in the last 30 days and the last 12 months, respectively. In addition, the disorders that are known to frequently begin during childhood are the most common disorders in the age group studied, with a prevalence of 2.5% in the last 30 days and 3.2% in the last year.\nThe 2015 National Mental Health Survey provides precise information about the real mental situation in children between the ages of 7 and 11 years in Colombia, compared with past epidemiological studies in the country, which were restricted to specific populations.

The time after World War II passed in Poland in two directions: coping with the finished war trauma and simultaneously the experience of communist persecution trauma. First scientific publications appeared in the fifties and were focused on the research of former concentration camps prisoners (KZ-Syndrome). Between 1962 and 1989 a special edition of Przegl\u0105d Lekarski, which concentrated entirely on war trauma research, was published. The journal was nominated for the Peace Nobel Prize twice.

However, more than two-thirds of all depressed patients experience insufficient improvement. Therefore, a better understanding of what patients, carers and professionals perceive as most helpful in the treatment of depression is needed.\nConcept mapping, a mixed-method design, was used to identify the patients (n = 33), carers (n = 22) and professionals (n = 50) perspectives. In six brainstorm sessions, the patients, carers and professionals generated 795 ideas, which were condensed into 55 unique statements. Subsequently, 100 participants prioritized and sorted these statements, which were analysed by multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis and visualized as a two-dimensional map.\nThe 55 statements were clustered in 10 factors and further grouped into four main-factors (meta-clusters): 'Professional therapist', 'Treatment content', 'Structured treatment process' and 'Treatment organisation'. Patients and carers prioritized 'Treatment organisation' higher than professionals, but overall there was considerable agreement about the factors of treatment the participants perceived as most helpful including factors related to the therapeutic relationship and the 'creation of hope'.\nOur study identified factors of depression treatment perceived as helpful according to patients, carers and professionals. Findings suggest that in a scientific era with emphasis on biological psychiatry, not only patients and carers, but also professionals consider aspecific factors the most helpful. Further studies might show that factors we found to be helpful in the treatment for depression, can be generalized to mental health treatment in general."}, {"Title": "Psychosis and schizophrenia: effects of changes in psychiatric classifications on clinical and theoretical approaches to mental illness.", "Abstract": "This article discusses changes in the diagnostic classification systems for mental illness, especially the conceptual weakening of the \"psychosis\" category while schizophrenia became the only psychosis.

Consequently, conditions that previously were associated with neurosis and subjectivity are being medicalized, conditions previously recognized as psychotic are relocated under the heading of personality disorders, and psychosis has been reduced to schizophrenia and considered a deficit of psychic functions.

Autonomous choices undeniably are rights of patients. However, emphasizing rights for a mentally-ill patient could jeopardize the chances of the patient receiving care or endanger the public. Conversely, the beneficial effects of coercion are difficult to predict. Thus, applying coercion in psychiatric care requires delicate balancing of individual-rights, individual well-being and public safety, which has not been achieved by current frameworks. Two current frameworks may be distinguished: the civil liberty approach and the Stone model. Both frameworks are restrictive, and not respectful of human dignity. In a civil liberty approach, individuals who are severely mentally-ill but not dangerous would be denied care because they do not meet the dangerousness threshold or because the use of coercion will not lead to rebirthing of autonomy. This is unsatisfactory. Albeit involuntary interventions such as talk therapies, peer-support etc., may not always lead to rebirthing of autonomy or free patients from mental illness; they can however help to maintain the dignity of each mentally ill patient. In place of these frameworks, this study proposes a new ethical framework for applying coercion in psychiatric care that is respectful of human dignity. Specifically, it draws on insights from the African ethico-cultural system by using the Yoruba concept Omo-olu-iwabi to develop this new framework. This way, the study shows that only a more respectful approach for applying coercion in psychiatric care can lead to the careful balancing of the competing interests of individual's rights, individual's well-being and public safety."}, {"Title": "Factitious Disorder in a Patient Claiming to be a Sexually Sadistic Serial Killer.", "Abstract": "Factitious disorder involves the conscious simulation of psychological or physiological symptoms of illness, for the purpose of fulfilling the unconscious desire to be taken care of or to assume the \"sick role.\" Typically patients with factitious disorder simulate conditions that are designed to arouse feelings of empathy in care providers with the intention to engage them in caretaking.

However, the strength of the association between suicidal ideation and subsequent completed suicide has not been firmly established in different populations. Furthermore, the absolute suicide risk after expression of suicidal ideation is unknown. In this meta-analysis, we examined whether the expression of suicidal ideation predicted subsequent completed suicide in various populations, including both psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations.\nA meta-analysis of cohort and case-control studies that assessed suicidal ideation as determinant for completed suicide in adults. Two independent reviewers screened 5726 articles for eligibility and extracted data of the 81 included studies.

Clinical descriptions of mania appearing in 18 textbooks published between 1899 and 1956 were reviewed and compared to the criteria for mania from six modern operationalized diagnostic systems. Twenty-two prominent symptoms and signs were reported by five or more authors. Two symptoms (elevated mood and grandiosity) and four signs (hyperactivity, pressured speech, irritability, and new activities with painful consequences) were reported by every author. A strong relationship was seen between the frequency with which the clinical features were reported and the likelihood of their inclusion in modern diagnostic systems. However, many symptoms and signs including impulsivity, hypersexuality, mood lability, altered moral standards, increased humor, hypergraphia, and a vigorous physical appearance were not included in any modern criteria. Indeed, DSM-5 contains only eight of the historically noted clinical features. We conclude that modern operationalized criteria for mania well reflect symptoms and signs frequently reported by historical experts. This suggests that the clinical construct of mania has been relatively stable in western Psychiatry since the turn of the 20th century. However, many useful clinical features of mania described in these textbooks are missing from these criteria thereby illustrating the limitations of clinical evaluations restricted to the assessment of only current diagnostic criteria. The disorders we study and treat are considerably richer clinically than is reflected in the DSM criteria which we use to diagnose them."}, {"Title": "Recent Developments in Molecular Brain Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Molecular imaging with PET or SPECT has been an important research tool in psychiatry for as long as these modalities have been available.

We discuss the use of pharmacologic probes to induce changes in levels of neurotransmitters that can be inferred through their effects on outcome measures of imaging experiments, from their historical origins focusing on dopamine transmission through recent developments involving serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Next, we examine imaging of neuroinflammation in the context of psychiatry. Imaging markers of neuroinflammation have been studied extensively in other areas of brain research, but they have more recently attracted interest in psychiatry research, based on accumulating evidence that there may be an inflammatory component to some psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, new probes are under development that would allow unprecedented insights into cellular processes.

Researchers have called for investigation into service use with respect to clinically recommended interventions.\nTo examine intervention recommendations for children with FASD/PAE and subsequent access to these recommended interventions.\nIntervention recommendations following FASD assessment were examined for children (1-17 years). Recommendations were compared according to diagnostic status and demographic and environmental variables. Subsequent access to several interventions was examined for 45 participants.\nA variety of recommendations were given. Children with FASD received more recommendations overall and received more education, anticipatory guidance, family support, and safety recommendations than undiagnosed children with PAE. Undiagnosed children received more mental health and reassessment recommendations. Older children received fewer family support and developmental therapy recommendations but more mental health recommendations than younger age groups. Many families accessed modified school programming, developmental therapy, psychiatry, child counseling, and parent support as recommended.\nChildren with FASD and PAE have extensive needs and should receive individualized recommendations. An assessment is valuable even without an FASD diagnosis.

We defined long stays as those 21 days or longer and evaluated characteristics and outcomes of those hospitalizations, including discharge disposition and length of stay and trends in hospital characteristics. We excluded patients under 18 years of age and those with primary psychiatry, obstetric, or rehabilitation diagnoses, and weighted estimates to the US population.\nProlonged hospitalizations represented only 2% of hospitalizations, but approximately 14% of hospital days and incurred estimated charges of over $20 billion dollars annually. Over time, patients with prolonged hospitalizations were increasingly younger, male, and of minority status, and these hospitalizations occurred more frequently in urban, academic hospitals. In-hospital mortality for patients with prolonged stays progressively decreased over the 10-year period from 14.5% to 11.6% (P <.001 for trend in grouped years), even accounting for changes in demographics and comorbidity.\nThe profile of patients with prolonged hospitalizations in the US has changed, although their impact remains large, as they continue to represent 1 of every 7 hospital days. Their large number of hospital days and expense increasingly falls upon urban academic medical centers, which will need to adapt to this vulnerable patient population."}, {"Title": "Computational approaches to schizophrenia: A perspective on negative symptoms.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous spectrum disorder often associated with detrimental negative symptoms. In recent years, computational approaches to psychiatry have attracted growing attention. Negative symptoms have shown some overlap with general cognitive impairments and were also linked to impaired motivational processing in brain circuits implementing reward prediction. In this review, we outline how computational approaches may help to provide a better understanding of negative symptoms in terms of the potentially underlying behavioural and biological mechanisms. First, we describe the idea that negative symptoms could arise from a failure to represent reward expectations to enable flexible behavioural adaptation. It has been proposed that these impairments arise from a failure to use prediction errors to update expectations. Important previous studies focused on processing of so-called model-free prediction errors where learning is determined by past rewards only. However, learning and decision-making arise from multiple cognitive mechanisms functioning simultaneously, and dissecting them via well-designed tasks in conjunction with computational modelling is a promising avenue. Second, we move on to a proof-of-concept example on how generative models of functional imaging data from a cognitive task enable the identification of subgroups of patients mapping on different levels of negative symptoms. Combining the latter approach with behavioural studies regarding learning and decision-making may allow the identification of key behavioural and biological parameters distinctive for different dimensions of negative symptoms versus a general cognitive impairment. We conclude with an outlook on how this computational framework could, at some point, enrich future clinical studies."}, {"Title": "Relative Impact of Risk Factors, Thwarted Belongingness, and Perceived Burdensomeness on Suicidal Ideation in Veteran Service Members.", "Abstract": "We tested the associations between individualized risk factors, empirically validated constructs specific to suicide risk (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, and two methods for conceptualizing suicidal ideation based on Suicide Index Score (SIS) and overall severity score of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation [BSS]).\nThe current study included a sample of 134 suicidal Veterans who were recruited from an inpatient psychiatry unit of a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

We used a qualitative, descriptive approach and conducted focus group interviews with nurses, nurse assistants and social and healthcare assistants. The results show that a pre-established personal clinician-patient alliance formed the basis for entering into, and weighing the quality of, the alliance during mechanical restraint. In consideration of the patient's psychiatric condition, the clinicians observed and assessed two quality parameters for the alliance: 'the patient's insight into or understanding of present situation' (e.g. the reasons for mechanical restraint and the behaviour required of the patient to discontinue restraint) and 'the patient's ability to have good and stable contact and cooperation with and across clinicians. These assessments were included, as a total picture of the quality of the alliance with the patient', in the overall team assessment of the patient's readiness to be released from mechanical restraint.

Of the six included studies, practitioner impact was assessed in four. Overall, risk of bias was rated as low or unclear, and all evidence in the 'Summary of findings' tables was graded as low or very low quality.

Hobart Mowrer.", "Abstract": "O. Hobart Mowrer had one of the most productive and curious careers of any psychologist in the 20th century, despite struggling with severe mental illness and anxiety about his sexuality. Early in his career, he was one of the country's leading experimental psychologists. During the mid-1940s, he became interested in religion and argued that anxiety was caused by repressed guilt that came from real wrongdoing. By the late 1950s, he had abandoned mainstream psychology, arguing that religion had been corrupted by its embrace of psychology and psychiatry. He claimed that sin was responsible for nearly all psychological problems and that ethical living and confession of wrongdoing could prevent mental illness. During his religious period, Mowrer received an astonishing amount of fawning press attention and was embraced by a public desirous of a path to mental health that did not require jettisoning traditional conceptions of sin, guilt, and human nature. This article examines Mowrer's life and career and situates him among other mid-century skeptics of psychology and psychiatry. Other historians have argued that by the 1950s, the conflict between religion and psychiatry/psychology in the United States had largely abated, with both sides adapting to each other. Mowrer's life and the reception of his work demonstrate that this narrative is overly simplistic; widespread conservative and religious distrust of psychology persisted even into the 1960s.

The intra-extra-dimensional (IED) set-shifting task assessed executive function. Lower IED scores indicated better performance. High and low BDNF subgroups were defined by median split.\nIED Z-scores were impaired in the BD group compared to controls, whereas biomarker levels were not significantly different between groups. LPH-BDNF correlations were significantly different between BD and controls (Z\u00a0=\u00a02.046, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041).

Using Allan Beveridge's claims in 1993 about the relative lack of research on the history of psychiatry in Scotland, the paper reviews a range of contributions that have emerged since then, loosely distinguishing between 'overviews' - work addressing longer-term trends and broader periods and systems - and more detailed studies of particular 'individuals and institutions'.

Traditionally drugs acting on CNS receptors have been classified as either agonists or antagonists. Recently a new class of ligand, the inverse agonist, has been identified in some receptor systems. Inverse agonists have opposite actions to those of agonists but the effects of both of these can be blocked by antagonists. Pimavanserin is a new 5-HT2A receptor acting drug that has been given market authorization for psychosis in Parkinson\u05f3s disease. The FDA have termed it an inverse agonist, but this conclusion is based on in-vitro data. In this paper we discuss the evidence for such a claim being made for pimavanserin in the human brain and conclude that this is not currently sufficient. It is therefore premature to conclude that the actions of pimavanserin in humans are due to inverse agonism, and we are of the opinion that it should be called a 5-HT2A antagonist until better evidence emerges."}, {"Title": "Association between non-compliance with psychiatric treatment and non-psychiatric service utilization and costs in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.", "Abstract": "The relationship between medication non-compliance in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders, and increased psychiatric service utilization and costs are well documented; however, non-psychiatric service utilization and costs are not. Therefore, we investigated the association of non-compliance with psychiatric treatment and the utilization and costs of non-psychiatric services.\nData on South Korean individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related disorder, who were treated in a psychiatric clinic at least twice during 2011, were selected among national data collected for the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Patients Sample between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011.

However, the rise of psychosomatic syndromes and disease patterns as well as an increase of specific integrated psychosomatic wards is a clear indication for the growing importance of interdisciplinary approaches to psychosomatic disorders. The study presents data from an 8-week inpatient treatment at a psychosomatic facility and investigates whether patients improved in their subjective symptom experience. A complex treatment approach, ranging from pharmacological treatment and group and individual psychotherapy to physiotherapy and ergotherapy was integrated into this intervention. In essence, containment of intrapsychic aggression derivatives played a central role in the treatment of psychosomatic symptoms. A significant factor contributing to a successful treatment is the doctor-patient relationship.

The authors hypothesized that showing head movement during a scanning session may help subjects learn how to keep their head still. The authors scanned subjects and displayed in real time a plot of head movement that had three regions. The authors found, in a limited sample, that the improvements were marginal and inconsistent.

Here, the concept of experience is used to ascertain whether a different understanding of psychiatry is viable, that is to say, to understand it as a personal life-story and as a social fact. Could we, by dint of the psychiatric archives produced by medical institutions, go beyond institutional and medical issues, so as to understand how those placed in a psychiatric institution lived through their mental illness? The objective of this article is also to prepare several methodological markers with respect to issues of interpretation, of individual experience and of emotion.

These works thus display both a search for subjective expression and for objectivity. Some artists recognized this subjectivity in the sick persons: either in their portrayals of the ill as autonomous individuals; in portraits of psychiatrists, which infer the presence of the sick persons under the scrutiny of the doctor; and in the asylum architecture that addressed itself to the sick individual's sensibility and cognition."}, {"Title": "Cognitive Dysfunctions in Patients with Alcohol Dependence Syndrome in a Tertiary Hospital in Kathmandu.", "Abstract": "Alcohol dependence is a chronic disorder, accompanied by neuropsychological deficits.

Understanding the factors that drive the current inpatient treatment provision is essential. We investigated how the MHS service structure (diversity of services and balance of personnel resources) and indicators of service need (mental health index, education, single household, and alcohol sales) correlated with acute and semi-acute inpatient treatment provision. The European Service Mapping Schedule-Revised (ESMS-R) tool was used to classify the adult MHS structure in southern Finland (population 1.8 million, 18+ years). The diversity of MHS in terms of range of outpatient and day care services or the overall personnel resourcing in inpatient or outpatient services was not associated with the inpatient treatment provision. In the univariate analyses, sold alcohol was associated with the inpatient treatment provision, while in the multivariate modeling, only a general index for mental health needs was associated with greater hospitalization. In the dehospitalization process, direct resource re-allocation and substituting of inpatient treatment with outpatient care per se is likely insufficient, since inpatient treatment is linked to contextual factors in the population and the health care system.

Previous research showed high rates of medication nonadherence among both adolescents with medical disorders and adult patients with psychiatric disorders.\nThe present review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines and evaluates existing scientific literature concerning adherence to psychotropic medication among adolescents. The goal was to determine rates of nonadherence in this age group as well as the factors associated with it. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed from its inception until 15 September 2015 using the keywords \"adherence,\" \"compliance,\" \"adolescent,\" and \"psychotropic medication.\"\nA total of 607 pertinent articles were collected and screened; 15 publications were selected for detailed review. The studies differed, among other things, regarding sample characteristics, medication type, and indications. Furthermore, the definitions of what constitutes nonadherence and the methods used to assess it varied widely. Nonadherence rates ranged from 6 % to 62 % (median 33 %).\nNonadherence to psychotropic medication is a clinically relevant problem among adolescents. Because of the methodological heterogeneity across studies and partially contradictory results, no conclusions could be drawn concerning the influence of factors such as psychopathology, medication type, side effects, the effectiveness of treatment, or family-related factors. Well-designed long-term studies of large patient samples and a consensus regarding definitions are therefore warranted. Such research would facilitate the design of tailored strategies to improve adherence in these patients."}, {"Title": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: impact on quality of life of carers.", "Abstract": "The quality of life (QoL) of informal caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) (PwP) can be affected by the caring role. Because of cognitive symptoms and diminished activities of daily living, in addition to the management of motor symptoms, carers of PwP and cognitive impairment may experience increased levels of burden and poorer QoL compared with carers of PwP without cognitive impairment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of cognitive impairment in PD upon QoL of carers.\nApproximately 36\u2009months after diagnosis, 66 dyadic couples of PwP and carers completed assessments. PwP completed a schedule of neuropsychological assessments and QoL measures; carers of PwP completed demographic questionnaires and assessments of QoL. Factor scores of attention, memory/executive function and global cognition, as derived by principal component analysis, were used to evaluate cognitive domains.\nHierarchical regression analysis found lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment was a significant independent predictor of poorer carer QoL, in addition to number of hours spent caregiving, carer depression and PD motor severity. Attentional deficits accounted for the largest proportion of variance of carer QoL. Carers of PwP and dementia (n\u2009=\u20099) had significantly poorer QoL scores compared with PwP and mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u200918) or normal cognition (n\u2009=\u200939) carers (p\u2009<\u20090.01).\nAttentional deficits were the strongest predictor of carer QoL compared with other cognitive predictors. Carers for those with PD dementia reported the poorest QoL. Interventions such as respite or cognitive behavioural therapy to improve mood and self-efficacy in carers may improve carer QoL. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Real-time monitoring of mood, sleep and physical and social activity in a substantial portion of the affected population in a naturalistic setting is unprecedented in psychiatry. We propose that digital footprints can provide these measurements from real world setting unobtrusively and in a longitudinal fashion. In this perspective article, we outline the concept of digital footprints and the services and devices that create them, and present examples where digital footprints have been successfully used in research. We then critically discuss the opportunities and fundamental challenges associated digital footprints in psychiatric research, such as collecting data from different sources, analysis, ethical and research design challenges."}, {"Title": "Predictors of self-esteem in adolescents with a psychiatric referral.", "Abstract": "In the literature self-esteem is found to be lower in clinically referred adolescents compared to adolescents without any psychiatric disorder. The aim of this study is to examine self-esteem and associated socio-demographical and psychological factors in clinically referred adolescents in Turkey. Three hundred forty-nine adolescents aged between 12 and 18 years admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry with a psychiatric complaint were enrolled. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Parenting Style Scale (PSS) and Sense of Identity Assessment Form (SIAF) were used for the evaluation. Self-esteem was lower in: girls, adolescents without siblings, living in non-nuclear families, with a past suicide attempt, and with history of a non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (NSSI). Self-esteem was negatively correlated with identity confusion on SIAF and positively correlated with acceptance/involvement on PSS. Significant predictors of self-esteem were gender, presence of a sibling, history of a NSSI and SIAF scores. Interactions between self-esteem and gender, psychiatric symptoms, parenting and identity development are complex in clinically referred adolescents. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through which these characteristics modify self-esteem will be necessary to guide families and clinicians to help adolescents to maintain high self-esteem levels."}, {"Title": "Trichotillomania in Celiac Disease.", "Abstract": "Trichotillomania is an underreported and underdiagnosed condition associated with significant impairments in social and functional relationships.

We measured Grey Matter (GM) cortical thickness in 20 participants with BDD and 20 healthy control participants matched on age, gender, estimated IQ and handedness. We observed cortical thinning in BDD patients compared with healthy control participants within the left middle temporal and left inferior parietal gyrus.

Information on the value of this program for its cost is now called for. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the cost-utility of the SC program compared with care-as-usual (CAU) in patients with head and neck cancer or lung cancer who have psychological distress. Patients and Methods In total, 156 patients were randomly assigned to SC or CAU. Intervention costs, direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, productivity losses, and health-related quality-of-life data during the intervention or control period and 12 months of follow-up were calculated by using Trimbos and Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry, Productivity and Disease Questionnaire, and EuroQol-5 Dimension measures and data from the hospital information system. The SC program's value for the cost was investigated by comparing mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results After imputation of missing data, mean cumulative costs were -\u20ac3,950 (95% CI, -\u20ac8,158 to -\u20ac190) lower, and mean number of QALYs was 0.116 (95% CI, 0.005 to 0.227) higher in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention group had a probability of 96% that cumulative QALYs were higher and cumulative costs were lower than in the control group. Four additional analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of this finding, and they found that the intervention group had a probability of 84% to 98% that cumulative QALYs were higher and a probability of 91% to 99% that costs were lower than in the control group. Conclusion SC is highly likely to be cost-effective; the number of QALYs was higher and cumulative costs were lower for SC compared with CAU."}, {"Title": "Resting-state connectivity biomarkers define neurophysiological subtypes of depression.", "Abstract": "Biomarkers have transformed modern medicine but remain largely elusive in psychiatry, partly because there is a weak correspondence between diagnostic labels and their neurobiological substrates. Like other neuropsychiatric disorders, depression is not a unitary disease, but rather a heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses varied, co-occurring symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a large multisite sample (n = 1,188), we show here that patients with depression can be subdivided into four neurophysiological subtypes ('biotypes') defined by distinct patterns of dysfunctional connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal networks. Clustering patients on this basis enabled the development of diagnostic classifiers (biomarkers) with high (82-93%) sensitivity and specificity for depression subtypes in multisite validation (n = 711) and out-of-sample replication (n = 477) data sets. These biotypes cannot be differentiated solely on the basis of clinical features, but they are associated with differing clinical-symptom profiles. They also predict responsiveness to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy (n = 154). Our results define novel subtypes of depression that transcend current diagnostic boundaries and may be useful for identifying the individuals who are most likely to benefit from targeted neurostimulation therapies."}, {"Title": "Prison break: Karl Menninger's The Crime of Punishment and its reception in U.S. psychology.", "Abstract": "In 1968, Karl Menninger, a highly visible and vocal U.S. psychiatrist, published a call to action on prison reform, The Crime of Punishment (Menninger, 1966/1968). This widely circulated book's central idea is that punishment as practiced in penal settings is an injustice amounting to a crime. At the outset, The Crime of Punishment quickly achieved national attention. Within mainstream psychology, its antipunishment message encountered a changed climate in which punishment, thought ineffective during the period 1930 through 1960, was redefined as an effective component in learning. It also met competition from the contemporaneous Stanford Prison Experiment (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973), which quickly rose to equivalent media presence and superior disciplinary prominence. Both the Stanford Prison Experiment and The Crime of Punishment survived in the antireform era of hyperincarceration after 1974 as parallel examples of reform activism, one secular and one religious in character, illustrating some convergences of aim between psychology and psychiatry outside of specifically clinical issues.

Although some researchers have shown that recognizing facial expressions may be important in the interaction between doctors and patients, there are no studies concerning facial emotion recognition in nurses. Here, we aimed to investigate facial emotion recognition ability in nurses and compare the abilities between nurses from psychiatry and other departments.\nIn this cross-sectional study, sixty seven nurses were divided into two groups according to their departments: psychiatry (n=31); and, other departments (n=36). A Facial Emotion Recognition Test, constructed from a set of photographs from Ekman and Friesen's book \"Pictures of Facial Affect\", was administered to all participants.\nIn whole group, the highest mean accuracy rate of recognizing facial emotion was the happy (99.14%) while the lowest accurately recognized facial expression was fear (47.71%). There were no significant differences between two groups among mean accuracy rates in recognizing happy, sad, fear, angry, surprised facial emotion expressions (for all, p>0.05). The ability of recognizing disgusted and neutral facial emotions tended to be better in other nurses than psychiatry nurses (p=0.052 and p=0.053, respectively) Conclusion: This study was the first that revealed indifference in the ability of FER between psychiatry nurses and non-psychiatry nurses.

In keeping with this view, the targeting of interleukin-6 with the human monoclonal antibody sirukumab may represent a possible treatment and disease modification approach, for adults with brain-based disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder). A PubMed/Medline database search was performed using the following search terms: sirukumab; anti-IL-6; IL-6; major depressive disorder; inflammation. A systematic review was conducted of both preclinical and clinical trials reporting on the pharmacology of sirukumab or investigating the efficacy of targeting IL-6 signaling. Overall, sirukumab has been reported to be a safe and well-tolerated agent, capable of modulating the immune response in healthy populations as well as in subjects with inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Sirukumab's effects on cytokine networks as part of the innate immune system provide a coherent rationale for possible application in neuropsychiatric disorders with possible benefits across several domains of the biobehavioral Research Domain Criteria matrix (e.g., general cognitive processes, positive valence systems). Amongst individuals with complex brain-based disorders (e.g., mood disorders), the dimensions/domains most likely to benefit with sirukumab are negative valence disturbances (e.g., anxiety, depression, rumination), positive valence disturbances (e.g., anhedonia) as well as general cognitive processes.

The present study focuses on social motivation, a dimension of behavior that is central to a range of psychiatric conditions but for which a particularly small number of assays currently exist.\nIn Study 1 (N = 48), healthy adults completed a monetary reward task and a social reward task, followed by completion of the Chapman Physical and Social Anhedonia Scales. In Study 2 (N = 26), an independent sample was recruited to assess the robustness of Study 1's findings.\nThe reward tasks were analyzed using signal detection theory to quantify how much reward cues bias participants' responses. In both Study 1 and Study 2, social anhedonia scores were negatively correlated with change in response bias in the social reward task but not in the monetary reward task. A median split on social anhedonia scores confirmed that participants with high social anhedonia showed less change in response bias in the social reward task compared to participants with low social anhedonia.\nThis study confirms that social anhedonia selectively affects how much an individual changes their behavior based on the presence of socially rewarding cues and establishes a tool to quantify social reward responsiveness dimensionally."}, {"Title": "Mental Health Emergencies in Paediatric Services: Characteristics, Diagnostic Stability and Gender differences.", "Abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatric emergencies have increased in recent years. The main objective of our study is to analyze sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of psychiatric emergencies under 18 years old that came to our hospital. Secondary objectives were to study diagnostic stability made in the emergency department and undertake a gender analysis.\nDescriptive cross-sectional study of patients attending the pediatric emergency department who required consultation to psychiatry service during 2010 and 2011, comparing data with two previous cross-sectional cuts (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). Then we track the diagnoses assigned during a year. Statistical analysis was descriptive. We also include a gender analysis.\nWe analyzed 328 episodes corresponding to 179 different patients (average age 14.48). We detected a progressive increase of prevalence of psychiatric emergencies from 2002 to 2011. Diagnostic distribution showed a significant association of Behavioral Disorders with males and an association of Self-injured Behaviors and Eating Disorders with females. The admission rate was 18.5%. One-year diagnostic outcomes showed differences comparing to emergency diagnosis.\nIncrease and complexity of psychiatric consultations in Pediatric Emergency Department requires a greater coordination and training of these services to enhance patients care.

The GAF scale is often used in both research settings and in the clinic. The scale ranges from 1 to 100 and is subdivided into ten 10-point intervals, each with verbal rating instructions called anchor points and examples. GAF is an instrument that needs improvement. Studying clinicians' experiences with this rating system may be important for developing improvements. The aim of this study was to collect information from clinicians about their experiences with the GAF instrument, and to collect their ideas on how the GAF scale can be improved, particularly in the area of verbal instructions (i.e., anchor points and examples). Qualitative interviews were performed with 25 clinicians. Through this interview process, several weaknesses of the GAF scale were revealed. We found that clinicians have unique experiences that can be important for the development of a better GAF scale. Rating with the GAF scale also requires sufficient collection of patient information."}, {"Title": "Effect of cognitive behavioral stress management program on psychosomatic patients' quality of life.", "Abstract": "Level of stress and its management affects the dimensions of psychosomatic patients' quality of life (QoL), which is an important psychological issue. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive behavioral stress management program on psychosomatic patients' QoL. In cognitive behavioral method, patients discover thought and behavioral mistakes and recover them. The criterion to evaluate the success of the present study was measurement of the patients' QoL and its notable improvement after intervention.\nThis is a before-and-after clinical trial with a control group. The study participants comprised 70 psychosomatic patients referred to subspecial psychiatry clinic in Isfahan who were selected through convenient sampling and allocated to the study and control groups. Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF36) was adopted to collect the data. The questionnaire was completed by the participants in three stages of before-and-after up to a month after intervention. Cognitive behavioral stress management program was administrated in study group for eight straight sessions, two month, and a month after intervention. Along with this, conventional medical treatments were conducted for both the groups. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. The significance level was <i>P</i> < 0.001.\nThere was no significant difference in QoL mean scores between the two groups before intervention (44, 43.1), but mean scores of QoL were significantly higher in intervention G (55.7, 59.1), compared to control (39.8, 35.7), after intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and one month after intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.001).\nCognitive behavioral stress management, conducted in the present study, had a notable effect on QoL.

Subjective experience of mood is one of the valuable sources of information about the state of an integrated mind/brain system. During the past century, psychiatry and psychology moved away from subjectivity, emphasizing external observation, precise measurement, and laboratory techniques. This shift, however, provided only a limited improvement in the understanding of mood disorders, and it appears that self-monitoring of mood has the potential to enrich our knowledge, particularly when combined with the advances in technology. Modern technology, with its ability to transfer information from the individual directly to the researcher via electronic applications, enables us now to study mood regulation more thoroughly. Frequent subjective ratings can be helpful in identifying individualized treatment with effective mood stabilizers and recognizing subtypes of mood disorders. The variability of subjective ratings may also help us estimate the increased risk of recurrence and guide a tailored treatment."}, {"Title": "The Relationship of Undergraduate Major and Housing with Depression in Undergraduate Students.", "Abstract": "Past literature has shown that college undergraduates are particularly vulnerable to depression.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of Japanese male AN patients, with the aim of achieving early interventions.\nA total of 2015 AN patients, 60 males and 1955 females, were extracted from 4606 eating disorder patients who consulted Osaka City University Hospital for 34.5 years. The sex ratio was examined, and clinical features, mainly those related to consultation behavior, were compared between males and females. The rate of early drop-outs from outpatient treatments was also determined in male AN patients.\nThe male ration in AN patients was 3.0%, which was markedly lower than generally considered. No significant sex difference was noted in the mean age at the time of consultation or delays in treatment. The rate of weight loss from the premorbid to lowest body weight was similar between males and females. Regarding social backgrounds, the employment rate was higher in males than in females. Male AN patients were more likely to initially consult the psychiatry department. Furthermore, the rate of early drop-outs from outpatient treatments appeared to be higher among males than females.\nThe male ratio in Japanese clinical AN patients was low. Consultation between may be restricted in males more than in other countries because eating disorders are considered to be female diseases. Male AN is physically severe, similar to female AN; therefore, early interventions were considered important. Educational programs for eating disorders not only in the general public, but also in school and companies may promote early interventions. Treatments that considered sex differences need to be developed in order to prevent early drop-outs."}, {"Title": "Beneficence and non-maleficence: confidentiality and carers in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The editorial considers how psychiatrists can deal with concerns relating to confidentiality that are prominent in patients and their carers.

Formal guidelines for the care and management of dementia in the UK state that antipsychotics should only be prescribed where fully justified. This is because inappropriate use, particularly problematic in care-home settings, can produce severe side effects including death. The aim of this study was to explore the use of fallacious arguments in professionals' deliberations about antipsychotic prescribing in dementia in care-home settings. Fallacious arguments have the potential to become unremarkable discourses that construct and validate practices which are counter to guidelines.\nThis qualitative study involved interviews with 28 care-home managers and health professionals involved in caring for patients with dementia. Potentially fallacious arguments were identified using qualitative content analysis and a coding framework constructed from existing explanatory models of fallacious reasoning.\nFallacious arguments were identified in a range of explanations and reasons that participants gave for in answer to questions about initiating, reducing doses of and stopping antipsychotics in dementia. The dominant fallacy was false dichotomy. Appeal to popularity, tradition, consequence, emotion, or fear, and the slippery slope argument was also identified.\nFallacious arguments were often formulated to present convincing cases whereby prescribing antipsychotics or maintaining existing doses (versus not starting medication or reducing the dose, for example) appeared as the only acceptable decision but this is not always the case. The findings could help health professionals to recognise and mitigate the effect of logic-based errors in decisions about the prescribing of antipsychotics in dementia."}, {"Title": "Allostatic Self-efficacy: A Metacognitive Theory of Dyshomeostasis-Induced Fatigue and Depression.", "Abstract": "This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behavior), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalized belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue and depression in the future."}, {"Title": "Prescription preferences in antipsychotics and attitude towards the pharmaceutical industry in Belgium.", "Abstract": "The number of antipsychotic prescriptions are increasing rapidly worldwide, a trend which is mainly driven by the steep rise in second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) prescriptions. However, the success of SGA, compared with the older first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), cannot be explained by evidence. Several studies concluded on equal efficacy of FGA and SGA on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Next to that, the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on prescription behaviour has drawn considerable interest. Therefore, the relationship between antipsychotic prescription patterns and exposure to information directly provided by pharmaceutical companies was studied.\nA cross-sectional online survey, addressing psychiatrists, general practitioners (GPs) and trainees in Flanders, was carried out. Respondents were questioned about their prescription behaviour, opinion about efficacy of SGA versus FGA and the nature and frequency of their contact with the pharmaceutical industry.

Depression confers worse outcomes, including non-adherence to treatment and increased mortality in the oncology setting. Advances in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of depression have revealed shared biobehavioral mechanisms may contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, psychosocial stressors in cancer promote: (1) inflammation and oxidative/nitrosative stress; (2) a decreased immunosurveillance; and (3) a dysfunctional activation of the autonomic nervous system and of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis. Consequently, the prompt recognition of depression among patients with cancer who may benefit of treatment strategies targeting depressive symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue and sleep disturbances, is a public health priority. Moreover, behavioral strategies aiming at reducing psychological distress and depressive symptoms, including addressing unhealthy diet and life-style choices, as well as physical inactivity and sleep dysfunction, may represent important strategies not only to treat depression, but also to improve wider cancer-related outcomes.

Impairments of individual layers of social competencies are frequently described in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), who have high risk of schizophrenia. It is unclear whether and to what extent social impairments associate with subclinical negative and positive symptoms in 22q11.2DS, and which layer of social impairments are more correlated with schizophrenia-related symptoms. The aims of this study were to conduct a comprehensive investigation of social impairments at three different levels (function, skill, and cognition) and their interrelationship and to determine to what degree the social impairments correlate to subclinical levels of negative and positive symptoms, respectively, in a young cohort of 22q11.2DS not diagnosed with schizophrenia.\nThe level of social impairment was addressed using questionnaires and objective measures of social functioning (The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System), skills (Social Responsiveness Scale), and cognition (The Awareness of Social Inference Test and CANTAB Emotional Recognition Task), and the presence of subclinical symptoms of schizophrenia were evaluated using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes in a cross-sectional case-control study of 29 cases and 29 controls, aged 12 to 25\u00a0years.

Additional studies of larger samples with cognitive phenotypes will be needed to further clarify the role of CSMD1 in cognitive phenotypes in health and disease."}, {"Title": "Towards a multidisciplinary approach to understand and manage obesity and related diseases.", "Abstract": "Overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle result in overweight or obesity defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health. According to the WHO, the worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly doubled between 1980 and 2008. In 2008, over 50% of both men and women in the WHO European Region were overweight, and approximately 23% of women and 20% of men were obese. Comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches should include nutritional treatment to favor the best metabolic and nutritional outcome, as well as to induce potential disease-specific benefits from selected nutritional regimens. Obesity is usually accompanied by an increased muscle mass. This might explain why obesity, under particular circumstances such as cancer or high age, might have protective effects, a phenomenon named the 'obesity paradox'. However, loss of muscle mass or function can also occur, which is associated with poor prognosis and termed 'sarcopenic obesity'. Therefore, treatment recommendations may need to be individualized and adapted to co-morbidities. Since obesity is a chronic systemic disease it requires a multidisciplinary approach, both at the level of prevention and therapy including weight loss and maintenance. In the present personal review and position paper, authors from different disciplines including endocrinology, gastroenterology, nephrology, pediatrics, surgery, geriatrics, intensive care medicine, psychology and psychiatry, sports medicine and rheumatology, both at the basic science and clinical level, present their view on the topic and underline the necessity to provide a multidisciplinary approach, to address this epidemic."}, {"Title": "[Towards a transcultural approach to eating disorders].", "Abstract": "Anorexia must not be considered as a syndrome specific to a culture but as being linked to fast-moving sociocultural changes.

The sample in the present study included 647 individuals (89.1\u00b14.4 years (Mean\u00b1SD), range 85-103). After five years, 216 were alive and agreed to a follow-up (92.6\u00b13.4 years, range 90-104). The Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS) was used to assess morale. The depressive disorder diagnosis was determined according to DSM-IV based on medical records and interview data including assessment scales for depressive disorders. A number of sociodemographic, functional and health-related variables were analysed as possible confounders.Results For those with no depressive disorders at baseline, the only baseline variable significantly associated with depressive disorders five years later was the PGCMS score. A logistic regression model showed lower risk of depressive disorders five years later with higher baseline PGCMS scores (odds ratio 0.779 for one point increase in PGCMS, p<0.001). The association remained after adjusting for social isolation (p<0.1 association with depressive disorders five years later).Conclusion Our results indicate that the higher the morale, the lower the risk of depressive disorders five years later among very old people. The PGCMS seems to identify those very old individuals at increased risk of depressive disorders five years later. Preventive measures could befocused on this group."}, {"Title": "Neuromodulation Treatments for Geriatric Mood and Cognitive Disorders.", "Abstract": "There is increasing evidence for the efficacy of neuromodulation in the treatment of resistant mood disorders and emerging data supporting the use of neuromodulation in cognitive disorders. A significant minority of depressed elders do not respond to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. This has led clinicians to recommend the increasing use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of medication-resistant or life-threatening geriatric depression. Multiple studies have supported the safety and efficacy of ECT in the elderly, yet ECT is associated with side effects including cardiovascular and cognitive side effects. Neuromodulation therapies have the potential for providing effective treatment for treatment-resistant older adults with reduced side effects and this review will outline the risks and benefits of neuromodulation treatment in geriatric psychiatry. There is also emerging evidence of the efficacy of neuromodulation devices in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective in changing the course of neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia and other treatments are clearly needed. This review will outline the available evidence for neuromodulation in the treatment of mood and cognitive disorders in the elderly."}, {"Title": "Wards in Opinion of Patients - A Comparative Study on the Quality of Nursing Care.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of nursing care in psychiatric wards and compare it between hospitals of different types.\nSignificant differences between hospitals were found in: personnel benevolence (p=0,006219) and response to patient needs (p=0,011446) as well as patients' sense of safety (p=0,020042).

Relationships with senior doctors were crucial to learning but bias was perceived to make these relationships more problematic for BME UKGs and IMGs. IMGs also had to deal with cultural differences and lack of trust from seniors, often looking to IMG peers for support instead. Workplace-based assessment and recruitment were considered vulnerable to bias whereas examinations were typically considered more rigorous. In a system where success in recruitment and assessments determines where in the country you can get a job, and where work-life balance is often poor, UK BME and international graduates in our sample were more likely to face separation from family and support outside of work, and reported more stress, anxiety or burnout that hindered their learning and performance. A culture in which difficulties are a sign of weakness made seeking support and additional training stigmatising.\nBME UKGs and IMGs can face additional difficulties in training which may impede learning and performance. Non-stigmatising interventions should focus on trainee-trainer relationships at work and organisational changes to improve trainees' ability to seek social support outside work."}, {"Title": "[Mindfulness-based interventions in obsessive-compulsive disorder: Mechanisms of action and presentation of a pilot study].", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent and severe disease, potentially inducing a major impairment for the patient and burden for their family. Recent research in psychiatry and neuroscience have led to better comprehension of the disease's mechanisms and helped to improve its treatment. However, a large proportion of patients have refractory symptoms, including for traditional cognitive and behavioral therapy by exposure and response prevention (ERP), leading clinicians to look for new treatments. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) are a new type of approach, initially based on Buddhist meditation, which aims to provide better consciousness of the present moment. It has been successfully developed in some psychiatric diseases and other general medical conditions such as chronic pain. The two main programs using mindfulness meditation, Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), have shown effectiveness for the reduction of depressive and anxiety symptoms and relapses of depressive episodes in unipolar depression. It has no side effects and is well tolerated by patients. Its action relies on the specific correction of cognitive deficits in attention, emotion regulation and executive functions which are shared by OCD, GAD and depression. For OCD, we make the hypothesis that Mindfulness-Based Interventions could reduce the cognitive bias specifically existing in this pathology, such as dysfunctional beliefs, and therefore improve the symptoms. This article first reviews the existing literature on clinical trials involving Mindfulness-Based Interventions in OCD which comprises a small number of clinical studies based on very different types of protocols. At this time, and due to the lack of gold-standard studies with a large number of patients, no proof of the efficiency of mindfulness-based interventions in OCD has been shown. In a second section, following our hypothesis on the mechanisms of specific and non-specific action of this therapy in OCD, we propose a cognitive model of mindfulness-based therapy action in OCD involving the correction of OCD's cognitive bias. In this model, mindfulness-based therapy is supposed to treat specifically the cognitive aspects of the disease, while ERP is focused on its behavioral part. Then we present a clinical study aiming to prove the feasibility and the interest of the use of mindfulness in OCD, carried out in two different clinical centers. One of them used MBCT while the second used MBSR. Its results show the feasibility of mindfulness-based therapy in OCD patients and tend to prove that it could be more effective in young patients suffering from less severe forms of OCD. In parallel, attention tests and fMRI scans were done at the beginning and at the end of the therapy. Their results will be published separately. We also discuss the putative role of a specific form of MBCT adapted for OCD, specifically for its benefits in psychoeducation, which could reduce the dysfunctional beliefs present in OCD patients. Finally, we propose a therapeutic strategy in which the MBCT could complement the classical ERP therapy, as a \"maintenance\" treatment, aiming to extend the relapse of OCD symptoms. This article is a step further in the use of mindfulness-based therapy for OCD which could be added to the existing treatments reducing the patient's symptoms and improving their quality of life."}, {"Title": "Handling clinical comorbidity in randomized clinical trials in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to a) outline the importance of including patients with clinical comorbidities in Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) of psychiatric treatments; and b) to propose a specific approach for best handling, analyzing and interpreting the data on clinical comorbidities in terms of their impact on treatment outcomes. To do this we first define and describe clinical comorbidity and differentiate it from other forms of comorbidity. We then describe the methodological and analytical problems associated with excluding patients with clinically comorbid conditions from RCTs, including the impact on the outcomes of RCTs in psychiatry and the impact on evidence-based clinical decision-making. We then address the challenges inherent to including patients with clinical comorbidities in RCTs.

Engagement of students in these simulation-based methodologies is a key determinant of their success in learning. Thus, the authors conducted a systematic review to (1) identify simulation methods in use within the undergraduate psychiatry curriculum and (2) assess learner engagement using these methods.\nFollowing a PRISMA methodology, the authors searched MEDLINE, ERIC, and PsychINFO databases from 1977 to 2015. Studies applying simulation in undergraduate psychiatric education were reviewed. The depth of learner engagement was assessed using Kolb's four-stage learning cycle.\nOf 371 publications identified, 63 met all the inclusion criteria: 48 used standardized patients and 16 used online or virtual learning case modules. Only one study used high fidelity mannequins. Three studies satisfied multiple stages in Kolb's Learning Cycle, including a single study that addressed all four domains.\nDespite the varied uses of simulation across other health disciplines, there were few novel or innovative uses of simulation in undergraduate psychiatric education since the last review in 2008. Expanding on the use of simulation to improve communication, build empathy, and decrease stigma in psychiatry is essential given the relevance to all facets of medical practice. Given the complexity of psychiatry, simulation interventions should extend beyond communication scenarios. Medical students need more opportunities to reflect and debrief on simulation experiences and integrate learning into new contexts. Faculty development should focus on these novel approaches to simulation to deeply engage learners and enhance outcomes."}, {"Title": "App Use in Psychiatric Education: A Medical Student Survey.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study is to understand and appraise app use by medical students during their clerkships.\nFollowing Creighton University IRB approval, a voluntary and anonymous paper-based, 15-question survey was distributed to third-year medical students. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel.\nOf 112 medical students available, 76.7% (86) participated in the survey. All participants owned a smartphone or tablet with 84.9% using Apple iOS, followed by 12.8% using Android platform. Students reported using the fewest number of apps during surgery, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology clerkships. The largest number of apps were used during the internal medicine rotation (70.3%). The three most popular apps were Epocrates, UpToDate, and UWorld. The most common uses for these apps were as references during the clerkship, followed by improving knowledge, and test taking. Perceived major benefits included accessibility (96% of student respondents) and interactivity (39.5%). Common apps used during the psychiatry clerkship included UpToDate (71%), Epocrates (51%), and Medscape (43%). Despite less frequent app use during their psychiatry clerkship, 90% felt there was a utility for educational apps in psychiatric education.\nConsistent with the previous literature on medical students preferring educational apps, students suggest developers focus on question bank-type apps, followed by clinical support-focused and self-directed case-based learning apps for psychiatry clerkship learning. Educators should factor these modes of educational delivery into future educational app development. This survey shows a high degree of smartphone and tablet use among medical students, and they attest to mobile phone app utility in psychiatric education."}, {"Title": "Integration of Basic and Clinical Science in the Psychiatry Clerkship.", "Abstract": "Integration of basic and clinical science is a key component of medical education reform, yet best practices have not been identified.

Per domain, the FQL item that correlated most highly with the mean domain score and Overall QoL was selected. Internal consistency was investigated by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity was examined by investigating the relationship with the WHOQOL-Bref and EssenCES.\nThe original division into 15 QoL domains was retained, while the number of items per domain was reduced to one or two. The amount of subjective items was shortened from 114 items to 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.79). Content validity was assured because the FQL-SV is based on the items of the original FQL that was derived from LFPC patient's and staff's opinions.

Man has same fundamental needs to live as animals but modern man's life-style compels him to acquire certainty of resources for all his needs in a complex social network. Today money has become the sole life essential need. Contrarily none of the animals needs to earn money. Brain is also an organ of the human body with a unique thought process to define logical actions to achieve a person's goals. This way life is a flow of desires followed by logical actions. The person struggles to attain desired goals via the allostatic load but a perceived insurmountable threat can make his flow of life stalled to freeze him. Published data from varied branches of medical science indicates role of hormones in overall homeostasis. Particularly multifaceted role of serotonin is well documented. Adrenalin being the primary mediator of Cori cycle is also well known. From the integration of observations from published data with reference to common human's modern lifestyle, it is hypothesized that a perceived trapped situation in life creates acute chaos of thoughts in brain, which results in acute excess of stress hormones and concurrent depletion of resting hormones, which in turn triggers MS. In global terms, MS indicates an acute imbalance of a few hormones and implies psychosomatic roots of the disorder.

Focusing on this class of pharmacological agents, we aim to answer the following questions: in which indications and according to which modalities should mood stabilizers be prescribed during adolescence?\nInformation was sought from the websites of the French Haute Autorit\u00e9 de sant\u00e9 (HAS) and Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9 (ANSM), the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) were also reviewed. Additional articles were found using PubMed and Google Scholar. We assumed that guidelines published by a national institute were the most relevant, second information from medical academies, then literature reviews, and finally single studies. Practical prescription data were also sought from the French Vidal Drug Dictionary.\nFor bipolar disorder in adolescents, lithium has been the first drug licensed in France (from the age of 16) and in the USA (from the age of 12), with indications for acute mania and preventive treatment. Benefits for impulsive and self-aggressive behaviour disorders (especially relevant in case of borderline personality disorder) have also been documented, although lithium has not been licensed in any country for those indications. Extended-release tablets are usually used, at doses targeting for a lithiemia between 0.8 and 1.2mEq/L 12hours after last intake. Because of a narrow therapeutic window and potential side effects (especially nephrotoxicity), lithium prescription requires regular blood tests and good treatment compliance. None of the anticonvulsants has been licensed by a national drug administration as a mood stabilizer in adolescents. However, the AACAP recommends valproate as a first line treatment for mania, even though the NICE and the ANSM caution that valproate should not be used by women of child bearing age. Besides its teratogenic and endocrine side effects, valproate exposes one to the risk of hepatic toxicity. That is why regular liver function tests should be prescribed when valproate is chosen. According to the AACAP, carbamazepine (which is licensed for the treatment of mania in adults) is not a first line treatment for adolescents. Indeed, no clinical study has demonstrated its efficacy on manic episodes in adolescents. Moreover, carbamazepine exposes one to the risk of agranulocytosis. Lamotrigine has not been approved for adolescents, but some studies suggest its efficacy for bipolar depression (often a treatment-resistant phase) in this age group. Major side effects are the risk of Lyell or Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (which usually occur within the first eight weeks of treatment). There is no need for biological tests, just clinical monitoring. Pharmacological interactions between lamotrigine and oral contraceptives require caution. Finally, the use of some second generation antipsychotics for bipolar disorder in adolescents has been approved by national drug administrations. In France, only aripiprazole is licensed for acute mania (from the age of 13). In the USA, aripiprazole is licensed from the age of 10 for acute mania and preventive treatment, while risperidone and quetiapine are licensed from the age of 10 for acute mania, and olanzapine is licensed from the age of 13 for acute mania. The AACAP recommends second generation antipsychotics as a first line treatment for bipolar disorder. Moreover, the AACAP and the NICE recommend second generation antipsychotics for behavioural disorders in adolescents. Recommended doses are usually lower and titration slower than for adults. As in adults, adverse effects are metabolic, motor and cognitive disorders. Moreover, hyperprolactinemia, sedation and weight gain are more frequent than in adults.\nEpidemiologic data for prescription of mood stabilizers in adolescents only partially concord with recommendations from drug administrations and scientific societies. On the one hand, there is a trend toward preferential prescription of second generation antipsychotics, on the other hand lithium is hardly prescribed to adolescents, less often than anticonvulsants. Thus, without approval from any drug administration, the anticonvulsants are often preferred to lithium (because of lithium's potential risks due to noncompliance or voluntary poisoning) and to second generation antipsychotics (because of their tolerance profile). Nevertheless, for prescribers it is a complex matter to compare side effects: the frequency and intensity of adverse effects is quite variable from one mood stabilizer to another, and such a thing as an expected value is therefore hard to define. Regardless of the medication chosen, compliance and therapeutic alliance are major issues. Compliance is especially low during adolescence (less than 40% according to a study on bipolar disorder). This lack of compliance has multiple determinants: poor acceptance or misunderstanding of the psychiatric disorder, indirect effects of bad relationships with parents and more generally adults, but also reckless behaviour or death wishes. Improving therapeutic alliance appears as a major challenge for health practitioners dealing with youth. One interesting path of research could be the therapeutic education programs using humanistic communication techniques (addressing both adolescents and their parents) which have already produced encouraging results."}, {"Title": "[Work satisfaction and exhaustion among psychiatrists in psychiatric emergency services].", "Abstract": "Psychiatric emergency services (PES) have recently occupied a new and growing place in the landscape of mental health services. However, few data are available on the way psychiatrists practice in the PES. Our aim was to survey psychiatrists working in PES, focusing on their job satisfaction and the theoretical models they use in their everyday practice.\nWe sent a survey to a sample of 508 psychiatrists working in PES in France.\nTwo hundred and thirty-seven psychiatrists returned the survey, yielding a response rate of 47%. On a 0 to 10 scale, the mean level of job satisfaction was 6.7 (SD: 1.92). Participants reported that facing a variety of clinical situations and playing a key-coordinating role in the mental health system were the two most specific features of emergency psychiatry. The main sources of dissatisfaction were organizational issues and stressful clinical experiences, including violence or hostility. Sixty-three percent (n=150) of participants reported using more than two theoretical models in their practice, while the use of crisis models was reported by almost 40% of them. When assessed for suggestions to improve the PES, the majority of participants indicated that efforts should be focused on organizational factors.\nWhile emergency psychiatry could appear as an ungrateful practice, the majority of psychiatrists who responded to our survey reported satisfaction with their work and highlighted its unique particularities. Future research and collaborations are needed to identify organizational models of PES and their better integration in mental health networks."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal monitoring of heartbeat dynamics predicts mood changes in bipolar patients: A pilot study.", "Abstract": "Recent research indicates that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is affected in Bipolar Disorders (BD) patients. To determine whether such alterations are a mere expression of the current mood state or rather contain longitudinal information on BD course, we examined the potential influence of states adjacent in time upon HRV features measured in a target mood state.\nLongitudinal evaluation of HRV was obtained in eight BD patients by using a wearable monitoring system developed within the PSYCHE project. We extracted time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear HRV-features and trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify HRV-features according to mood state. To evaluate the influence of adjacent mood states, we trained SVM with different HRV-feature sets: 1) belonging to each mood state considered alone; 2) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from the preceding mood state; 3) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from the preceding and subsequent mood states; 4) belonging to each mood state and normalized using information from two randomly chosen states.\nSVM classification accuracy within a target state was significantly greater when HRV-features from the previous and subsequent mood states were considered.\nAlthough preliminary and in need of replications our results suggest for the first time that psychophysiological states in BD contain information related to the subsequent ones. Such characteristic may be used to improve clinical management and to develop algorithms to predict clinical course and mood switches in individual patients."}, {"Title": "Nonverbal behaviors are associated with increased vagal activity in major depressive disorder: Implications for the polyvagal theory.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in nonverbal behaviors (NVBs) and vagal activity. The polyvagal theory proposes that vagal activity regulates heart rate and NVBs by modulating a common anatomically and neurophysiologically discrete social engagement system. However, the association between these putative endophenotypes has not yet been explored. We hypothesize that in MDD, NVBs indicating positive affects and social interest and those indicating negative feelings and social disinterest could be associated with different patterns of vagal activity.\nFor this cross-sectional study we recruited 50 antidepressant-free participants with moderate-to-severe MDD. Vagal activity was indexed by heart rate variability (HRV) measures, and positive and negative nonverbal behaviors (NVBs) by a validated ethogram. Associations between NVBs and HRV were explored by bivariate analyses and multivariable models were adjusted by age, gender, depression severity, and self-reported positive and negative affects.\nHRV measures indicative of higher vagal activity were positively correlated with positive NVBs exhibited during the clinical interview. Conversely, NVBs related to negative affects, low energy and social disinterest were not associated with HRV.\nAbsence of a control group.\nThe findings highlight that the examined depression endophenotypes (nonverbal behaviors and vagal activity) are related, shedding light on MDD pathophysiology in the context of the polyvagal theory."}, {"Title": "Dry Eye Disease in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric conditions and not just the treatments themselves might be involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease (DED). The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between depression and DED using objective and subjective tests in patients with newly diagnosed depressive disorder who were not using any medication which may help us to determine the sole effect of depression on dry eye.\nThirty-six patients from the psychiatry clinic with a new diagnosis of depressive disorder and 32 controls were included in the study. All met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria for depression. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to measure depression severity and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Stai1, Stai2) for concomitant anxiety symptoms. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Visual Functioning Questionnaires (VFQ25) were completed and used to confirm diagnosis of DED in conjunction with the tear break up time (TBUT), ocular surface vital dye staining, and Schirmer's test.\nThe comparison of depressive and control groups revealed significantly lower Schirmer (20.3 \u00b1 9.9 vs. 25.7 \u00b1 9.3 mm) and TBUT (7.8 \u00b1 5.7 vs. 12.5 \u00b1 7.8 s) scores with a consistently higher Oxford score (1.8 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 0.2 \u00b1 0.4) in the depressive group. Although the parameters were affected in the depressive group, this did not influence OSDI (86.1 \u00b1 13.6 vs. 86.6 \u00b1 13.3) and VFQ25 (30.8 \u00b1 21.6 vs. 38.5 \u00b1 29.1) scores. In both groups, the three psychological test scores (Stai1-2 and BDI) were correlated to each other but none of these tests were correlated to OSDI, VRQL, Schirmer, TBUT, and Oxford staining scores.\nOur study shows a definite association between depression and DED.

Our previous study confirmed that autonomic activity and reactivity in depression revealed by HRV during rest and mental task (MT) conditions can be used as diagnostic measures and in clinical evaluation. In this study, logistic regression analysis (LRA) was utilized for the classification and prediction of MDD based on HRV data obtained in an MT paradigm.\nPower spectral analysis of HRV on R-R intervals before, during, and after an MT (random number generation) was performed in 44 drug-na\u00efve patients with MDD and 47 healthy control subjects at Department of Psychiatry in Shizuoka Saiseikai General Hospital. Logit scores of LRA determined by HRV indices and heart rates discriminated patients with MDD from healthy subjects. The high frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio of the low frequency (LF) component to the HF component (LF/HF) correspond to parasympathetic and sympathovagal balance, respectively.\nThe LRA achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0 and 79.0%, respectively, at an optimum cutoff logit score (0.28). Misclassifications occurred only when the logit score was close to the cutoff score. Logit scores also correlated significantly with subjective self-rating depression scale scores (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05).\nHRV indices recorded during a MT may be an objective tool for screening patients with MDD in psychiatric practice. The proposed method appears promising for not only objective and rapid MDD screening but also evaluation of its severity."}, {"Title": "New directions for psychiatric rehabilitation in the USA.", "Abstract": "American researchers have led the world in developing, evaluating, and disseminating evidence-based psychiatric rehabilitation practices for people with serious mental illness.

A cumulative meta-analysis was conducted for each and trial sequential analysis applied to determine when in the course of evidence accrual evidence was found sufficient to reach a reliable conclusion.

Physicians often do not address SA with patients, although SA survivors describe a desire to talk to physicians to obtain additional help. Little information exists on how providers perceive their roles regarding caring for women SA survivors and what barriers they face in providing this care.\nWe performed a qualitative study using semistructured one-on-one interviews with 16 faculty physicians from five specialties: obstetrics and gynecology (n = 4), internal medicine (n = 4), family medicine (n = 1), emergency medicine (n = 3), and psychiatry (n = 4). Interviews were conducted between July 2011 and July 2012, transcribed verbatim, and coded using a constant comparative approach. Once a final coding scheme was applied to all transcripts, we identified patterns and themes related to perceived roles and barriers to caring for SA survivors.\nPhysicians described two main categories of roles: clinical tasks (e.g., testing and treating for sexually transmitted infections, managing associated mental health sequelae) and interpersonal roles (e.g., providing support, acting as patient advocate). Physician barriers fell into three main categories: 1) internal barriers (e.g., discomfort with the topic of SA), 2) physician-patient communication, and 3) system obstacles (e.g., competing priorities for time).\nAlthough physicians describe key roles in caring for SA survivors, several barriers hinder their ability to fulfill these roles.

Patients with chronic neuropathic pain often have comorbidities like depression and sleep problems. Through functional connectivity, rTMS of M1 and S2 may activate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target for treating depression with rTMS. Thus, the analgesic effect of rTMS could be mediated indirectly via improvement of psychiatric comorbidities or sleep. We examined whether rTMS has an independent analgesic effect or whether its clinical benefits depend on effects on mood or sleep. We also evaluated if comorbid psychiatric or sleep disorders predict the treatment outcome.\nSixteen patients with chronic drug-resistant neuropathic orofacial pain participated in this randomized controlled crossover rTMS study. Patients' psychiatric history was evaluated by a specialist in psychiatry. Intensity and interference of pain, mood, and the quality of sleep and life were evaluated at baseline and after 2 active (primary somatosensory cortex [S1]/M1 and S2) and placebo rTMS treatments. A logistic regression analysis was done to investigate predictors of treatment outcome.\nThe analgesic effect of the right S2 stimulation was not associated with improvement of psychiatric conditions or sleep, whereas S1/M1 stimulation improved sleep without significant analgesic effect (P\u200a=\u200a0.013-0.046 in sleep scores). Psychiatric and sleep disorders were more common in patients than in the general population (P\u200a=\u200a0.000-0.001 in sleep scores), but these comorbidities did not predict the rTMS treatment outcome.\nWe conclude that rTMS to the right S2 does not exert its beneficial analgesic effects in chronic neuropathic orofacial pain via indirect improvement of comorbid psychiatric or sleep disorders."}, {"Title": "Bipolar disorder in the digital age: new tools for the same illness.", "Abstract": "\"Nothing is more difficult than to ascertain the length of time that a maniacal patient can exist without sleep.\"-Dr. Sutherland (Br J Psychiatry 7(37):1-19, 1861).

However, service-users have argued that recovery should be defined as the process of overcoming mental illness, regaining self-control and establishing a meaningful life (customer-based recovery). Here, we aimed to compare customer-based and service-based recovery and clarify their differential relationship with other constructs, namely needs and quality of life. The study was conducted in 101 patients suffering from SMI, recruited from a rural community mental health setting in Portugal. Customer-based recovery and function-related service-based recovery were assessed, respectively, using a shortened version of the Mental Health Recovery Measure (MHRM-20) and the Global Assessment of Functioning score. The Camberwell Assessment of Need scale was used to objectively assess needs, while subjective quality of life was measured with the TL-30s scale. Using multiple linear regression models, we found that the Global Assessment of Functioning score was incrementally predictive of the MHRM-20 score, when added to a model including only clinical and demographic factors, and that this model was further incremented by the score for quality of life. However, in an alternate model using the Global Assessment of Functioning score as the dependent variable, while the MHRM-20 score contributed significantly to the model when added to clinical and demographic factors, the model was not incremented by the score for quality of life. These results suggest that, while a more global concept of recovery from SMI may be assessed using measures for service-based and customer-based recovery, the latter, namely the MHRM-20, also provides information about subjective well-being. Pending confirmation of these findings in other populations, this instrument could thus be useful for comprehensive assessment of recovery and subjective well-being in patients suffering from SMI."}, {"Title": "Long term pharmacotherapy by methylfenidate or atomoxetine DAT 1 10/10 ADHD children in correlation with results of the imaging methods.", "Abstract": "ADHD is one of the most significant diagnostic units in child and adolescent psychiatry.

Moreover, direct cueing had a stronger sustained effect on their amount of eye-looking than on that of typically developing children. When presented with implicit social cues for eye-looking, 2-year-olds with autism neither shifted their gaze away nor more subtly averted their gaze to peripheral locations.\nThe results falsify the gaze aversion hypothesis; instead, at the time of initial diagnosis, diminished eye-looking in autism is consistent with passive insensitivity to the social signals in others' eyes."}, {"Title": "Prostitution as a Psychiatric Situation: Ethical Aspects.", "Abstract": "This paper presents the morally controversial phenomenon of prostitution.

In favor of that, we stress the importance of the presence, position and role of psychiatrists within an indispensable multidisciplinary team, which is complementary despite its heterogeneousness, synergistically and simultaneously dealing with psychological, physical and social health-problems of women engaged in prostitution. We propose peer education as a way of promoting healthy and safer behaviors among the subculture of prostitutes, where we see another important role of psychiatrists in selecting/recruiting, training and motivating peer educators among them."}, {"Title": "Subjective anger and overt aggression in psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "The attention given to anger and aggression in psychiatric patients pales in comparison to the attention given to depression and anxiety. Most studies have focused on a limited number of psychiatric disorders, and results have been inconsistent. The present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project sought to replicate and extend prior findings examining which psychiatric disorders and demographic characteristics were independently associated with elevated levels of anger and aggression.\n3800 individuals presenting to the Rhode Island Hospital Department of Psychiatry outpatient practice underwent a semi-structured interview to determine current Axis I (N=3800) and Axis II (N=2151) pathology. Severity of subjective anger and overt aggression within the past week were also assessed for each patient, and odds ratios were determined for each disorder. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine which diagnoses independently contributed to increased levels of anger and aggression.\nAlmost half of the sample reported moderate-to-severe levels of current subjective anger, and more than 20% endorsed moderate-to-severe levels of current overt aggression. The frequency of anger was similar to the frequencies of depressed mood and psychic anxiety. Anger and aggression were elevated across all diagnoses except adjustment disorder. Anger and aggression were most elevated in patients with major depressive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and cluster B personality disorders.\nAnger is as common as depressed mood and psychic anxiety amongst psychiatric outpatients, and problems with anger cut across diagnostic categories. Given the high prevalence of problems with anger in psychiatric patients, more research should be directed towards its effective treatment."}, {"Title": "Perspectives from Patients and Healthcare Providers on the Practice of Maternal Placentophagy.", "Abstract": "Placentophagy (maternal consumption of the placenta) has become increasingly prevalent in the past decade among women seeking to promote health and healing during the postpartum period. The purpose of this study was to assess patient and provider familiarity with and attitudes toward placentophagy, as well as patients' willingness to try placentophagy.\nTwo cross-sectional surveys with questions regarding placentophagy practice were distributed to healthcare providers and patients. The provider survey was distributed via email listservers to international perinatal professional organizations and to obstetrics and gynecology, nurse midwifery, family medicine, and psychiatry departments at three urban hospitals. Patient surveys were administered in person at an urban hospital in Chicago, Illinois.\nApproximately two thirds (66%; n\u2009=\u2009100) of patients and most (89%; n\u2009=\u2009161) of providers were familiar with placentophagy. Patients with a history of a self-reported mental health disorder were more likely to be willing to consider placentophagy and to believe that healthcare providers should discuss it with their patients.\nMost providers and patients have heard of placentophagy but are unsure of its benefits and/or risks.

There is a need for robust, standardised handover systems. Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation (SBAR) is a communication and empowerment tool for standardised communication in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the educational impact of a simulation-based educational session in clinical handover for trainees in psychiatry, using SBAR.\nA 3-hour session for trainees in psychiatry was designed with the North West Simulation Education Network and took place at the North Western Deanery School of Psychiatry. Presession and postsession questionnaires were completed, followed by a 6-week follow-up questionnaire.\nA significant improvement in participants' confidence and skills was demonstrated following the teaching session. Qualitative feedback also highlighted improved clinical application of the SBAR tool. Following the session, trainees reported an improvement in their appreciation of the role of other professionals in the handover process and a sense of empowerment when liaising with senior colleagues.\nThe training session potentially improved patient care by giving trainees structure, confidence and empowerment when talking to other colleagues while handing over.

We performed a systematic review aiming to give a detailed overview of the available evidence of the efficacy of VNS for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Data derived from animal models, experimental trials without health-related outcomes, case reports, single-session studies, and reviews were excluded. From 1292 publications, 33 records were included for further analyses: 25 focused on VNS as treatment of unipolar or bipolar major depressive disorder and one investigated the neurocognitive improvement after VNS in major depressive disorder. Seven focused on the improvement of cognitive function in Alzheimer\u00b4s disease, improvement of schizophrenia symptoms, treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), treatment resistant rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, treatment of fibromyalgia, and Prader-Willi syndrome. A total of 29 studies used invasive VNS, while four studies used non-invasive, transcutaneous VNS. Only 7 out of 33 studies investigated conditions other than affective disorders. The efficacy data of VNS in affective disorders is promising, whereas more in controlled and naturalistic studies are needed. In other conditions like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, OCD, PD, PTSD, and fibromyalgia, either no effects or preliminary data on efficacy were reported. At this point, no final conclusion can be made regarding the efficacy of VNS to improve symptoms in psychiatric disorders other than in affective disorders."}, {"Title": "Perceived coercion to enter treatment among involuntarily and voluntarily admitted patients with substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "Perceived coercion is a sense of pressure related to the experience of being referred to treatment. The sense of pressure arises from the patient's internal perception of coercion. The sources of coercion may be the legal system, the family, the health system, or self-criticism (internal sources). Here, we studied patients diagnosed with substance use disorders that were involuntarily admitted to hospital, pursuant to a social services act. We sought to determine whether these patients perceived coercion differently than patients that were admitted voluntarily.\nThis study included patients admitted to combined substance use disorder and psychiatry wards in three publicly funded treatment centres in Norway in the period 2009-2011. Participants included 63 patients that were admitted involuntarily, pursuant to the Norwegian Public Health Act, and 129 patients that were admitted voluntarily. All participants completed the Perceived Coercion Questionnaire. Sociodemographic variables were determined with the European Addiction Severity Index. The range of psychopathological symptoms was evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-90-R. Independent sample t-tests, the chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test were used to detect statistically significant differences between groups.\nScores on the Perceived Coercion Questionnaire showed that patients admitted voluntarily and those admitted involuntarily experienced similar levels of perceived coercion. Those admitted voluntarily reported higher levels of perceived coercion from internal sources, and those admitted involuntarily perceived significantly higher coercion from legal sources. No differences between groups were found with the other tests.\nOur results suggested that assumptions about involuntary admissions should be evaluated carefully to determine how best to alleviate counterproductive feelings of coercion when a coerced admission is planned. Informing and collaborating with the patient will most likely facilitate a better experience during admission and treatment. Moreover, the patient is more likely to experience a better recovery process."}, {"Title": "Transformation to a recovery-oriented model of care on a veterans administration inpatient unit.", "Abstract": "Recovery-oriented care is among the highest treatment priorities for the Veteran Health Administration, which has endorsed organizational change of mental health care to reflect recovery values.

Frequent users were more likely to have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, personality disorder, or alcohol use disorder. Service provider groups (for example, physicians, nurses, and assistants) described similar groups of frequent users and noted that frequent use was related to lack of social supports outside the hospital and feelings of belonging within it. The most frequently cited challenges were managing intoxicated service seekers, managing expectations for admission, and dealing with threats of self-harm.\nThe profiles of frequent ED users in Singapore resembled those reported in other large urban centers.

In modern medicine, the word \"melancholia\" only refers to mental and affective symptoms of depression. However, historically, it could have physical symptoms as well as mental symptoms and the atrabilious situations were categorized according to their common reasons rather than their specific characteristics. This study aimed to enlighten the history of this disease.\nThis is a review article concerned with cerebral diseases by collecting data from medical electronic databases including PUBMED and SID, historical psychiatry books and traditional medicine manuscripts.\nThe first known physician to have scientifically looked at the mental diseases was Hippocrates (370-460 B.C), who should be accredited as the father of medicine. While physicians in the time of Hippocrates seriously believed in the metaphysics power in health and diseases, Hippocrates believed in natural laws. Plato (348-428 B.C) believed that human behavior is affected by his physical needs and instincts. In the course of Hippocrates's theory about bodily humors, Aristotle considered a range of mental characteristics for each. Finally, Galen believed that cerebral disease causes mental diseases or disorders based on his own theories of anatomy. Persian physicians involved in this area were Rabban al-Tabari (838-870 A.D), Razes (865-925 A.D), Ali-Ibn Abbas Ahvazi (944-982 A.D), Al-ikhwan al bukhari the physician of the ninth century, Ibn Sina (980-1037 A.D), Gorgani (1040-1136 A.D) and Khaje Nasireddin Tousi (1201-1274 A.D). They considered cerebral diseases and health as a part of equality process; different organs accommodate a physical system and mutual dependence with the society and environment.\nMental health has been reviewed from various aspects in view of ancient physicians.

The authors assessed the extent to which mental health outcomes after disaster are associated with social network structures.\nIn a community-based cohort study of survivors of a major bushfire disaster, participants (N=558) were assessed for probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and probable depression. Social networks were assessed by asking participants to nominate people with whom they felt personally close. These nominations were used to construct a social network map that showed each participant's ties to other participants they nominated and also to other participants who nominated them. This map was then analyzed for prevailing patterns of mental health outcomes.\nDepression risk was higher for participants who reported fewer social connections, were connected to other depressed people, or were connected to people who had left their community. PTSD risk was higher if fewer people reported being connected with the participant, if those who felt close to the participant had higher levels of property loss, or if the participant was linked to others who were themselves not interconnected. Interestingly, being connected to other people who in turn were reciprocally close to each other was associated with a lower risk of PTSD.\nThese findings provide the first evidence of disorder-specific patterns in relation to one's social connections after disaster. Depression appears to co-occur in linked individuals, whereas PTSD risk is increased with social fragmentation. These patterns underscore the need to adopt a sociocentric perspective of postdisaster mental health in order to better understand the potential for societal interventions in the wake of disaster."}, {"Title": "Fetal Origins of Mental Health: The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis.", "Abstract": "The quality of fetal growth and development predicts the risk for a range of noncommunicable, chronic illnesses. These observations form the basis of the \"developmental origins of health and disease\" hypothesis, which suggests that the intrauterine signals that compromise fetal growth also act to \"program\" tissue differentiation in a manner that predisposes to later illness. Fetal growth also predicts the risk for later psychopathology. These findings parallel studies showing that antenatal maternal emotional well-being likewise predicts the risk for later psychopathology. Taken together, these findings form the basis for integrative models of fetal neurodevelopment, which propose that antenatal maternal adversity operates through the biological pathways associated with fetal growth to program neurodevelopment. The authors review the literature and find little support for such integrated models. Maternal anxiety, depression, and stress all influence neurodevelopment but show modest, weak, or no associations with known stress mediators (e.g., glucocorticoids) or with fetal growth. Rather, compromised fetal development appears to establish a \"meta-plastic\" state that increases sensitivity to postnatal influences. There also remain serious concerns that observational studies associating either fetal growth or maternal mental health with neurodevelopmental outcomes fail to account for underlying genetic factors. Finally, while the observed relation between fetal growth and adult health has garnered considerable attention, the clinical relevance of these associations remains to be determined. There are both considerable promise and important challenges for future studies of the fetal origins of mental health."}, {"Title": "Teaching Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Twenty-First Century: A Reflection on the Role of Technology in Education.", "Abstract": "Technology has become an integral part of everyday life and is starting to shape the landscape of graduate medical education.

Its neurotoxic potential is highly significant but its secure blood level concentration remains unknown. The aim of this study was to approach the above issue from the perspective of social psychiatry. A systematic search was made of Dialog and Datastar interfaces for data regarding the neuropsychiatric complications of direct or chronic exposure to lead, and a review of the relevant literature was conducted using the databases Medline, Embase, CAB Global Health and Cochrane. Lead affects the cholinergic, dopaminergic and gloutamergic systems, thus intervening in the normal function of neurotransmion. The consequence of neurotoxicity in the central nervous system includes apoptosis and excitotoxicity. Direct as well as chronic exposure causes serious neurological symptoms and possibly constant cognitive impairment. Acute encephalopathy, the most serious expression of lead poisoning, occurs in blood level concentrations over 100 \u03bcg/dL in adults and 80-100 \u03bcg/dL in children. Early symptoms of lead neurotoxicity include irritability, headaches and difficulties in concentration in both children and adults. Continuous exposure in children produces neurobehavioral symptoms, such as decreased concentration, inability to follow instructions, difficulty to play games and low IQ, which are associated with concentrations of 10-35 \u03bcg/dL. However, some studies claim that cognitive decline and low IQ can occur in concentrations <10 \u03bcg/dL. The commonest symptom in adults is peripheral neuropathy with foot drop. Prenatal exposure to lead has been correlated with antisocial behavior and schizophrenia. Long-term lead exposure causing low and medium lead concentration in blood has been linked to depression as well as generalized anxiety disorder and other behavioral disorders. High blood level concentrations correlate with psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations but more rarely with psychotic syndromes. Despite the fact that lead has been banned from gasoline, paint and water pipes, quite significant quantities of lead still exist, particularly in deprived areas of modern cities, in transition zones and city centers, and there are also great concentrations around lead mines and in developing countries, but even for the remaining areas there is no safe threshold.\nLead was and still is an environmental factor that increases neurologic and psychiatric morbidity. It also causes developmental disorders, especially in deprived areas. Prevention should be the single most important way of dealing with lead poisoning."}, {"Title": "The importance of the patients deemed not guilty by reason of insanity for the psychiatric reform.", "Abstract": "According to the Greek Penal Law if someone \"because of a morbid disturbance of his mental functioning\" (article 34) is acquitted of a crime or misdemeanour that the law punishes with more than 6 months imprisonment, then the court orders that this individual should be kept in a public psychiatric institution if the court reaches the conclusion that this person poses a threat to public safety.1 Individuals who have broken the law and deemed \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" are treated in psychiatric units of Psychiatric Hospitals according to the article 69 of the Penal Code. In Athens, in the Psychiatric Hospital of Athens and the Dromokaiteion Psychiatric Hospital, and in Thessaloniki in the Unit for \"Not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI)\". The person who is deemed not guilty by reason of insanity following a crime is facing double stigmatisation and marginalisation from both the legal and the health system. He/she is usually treated initially with fear and later since there is no therapeutic aim but only the court instruction for \"guardianship\", with indifference. The patient who is committed by the courts in a psychiatric unit for being \"NGRI\" is facing a unique legal and psychiatric status.2 In this respect he/she is disadvantaged when compared to either convicted criminals or psychiatric inpatients. If the patient was not found \"NGRI\" (ie innocent as far as sentencing is concerned) he would have been punished with loss of liberty for a certain (specific) amount of time, and like all individuals convicted in court he/she would have the right to appeal and reduce his/her sentence in a higher court and maybe released from prison earlier for good behaviour etc. In this respect the individual found to be \"NGRI\" is disadvantaged when compared to a convicted felon since he/she is kept for an undefined period of time. Additionally, he/she will be allowed to leave the psychiatric unit following a subjective assessment of a judge with no psychiatric knowledge who will decide that this certain individual has \"ceased to be dangerous\". These problems are accentuated by the difficulties that the Greek justice system is facing. On the other side, from the psychiatric point of view, the \"NGRI\" patient who is an inpatient is not receiving the holistic, (bio psycho social) treatment and assessment of needs he/she requires. The psychiatric team looking after him, once the acute symptomatology is controlled is just getting used to a patient who will not be discharged in the immediate future. These patients form the \"new chronic asylum psychiatric inpatients\" for whom the treating psychiatrists are not allowed to discharge back into the community whilst it is unclear whether they can be transferred to supported rehabilitation units. It is a medical but also legal paradox to assign to contemporary psychiatric units aiming mainly to treat patients in the community to \"keep and guard\" inpatients whilst these psychiatric units should focus on care and rehabilitation of the patients (including the \"NGRIs\").3 Keeping patients like these in psychiatric units creates problems in the functioning of the units. These patients are \"kept\" in acute beds for long periods of time (5 to 6 years minimum) with patients treated voluntarily or against their will and cannot be discharged without a court's decision. The problems are obvious if one realises that the average time of hospitalisation is not exceeding 2 months for the vast majority of psychiatric patients. With the prolonged stay patients of the \"article 69\" (NGRIs) they not only burden the already limited resources (there is an established lack of psychiatric beds nationwide) but also this prolonged hospitalisation increases their stigmatisation and marginalisation. Thus the prolonged hospitalisation for \"safety\" reasons according to the court decision leads to the absence of a therapeutic aim other than maintaining the patient on the ward. Greece has agreed that there is an urgent need in developing community psychiatry services and closure/transformation of the big psychiatric hospitals (asylums). It is impossible to close hospitals where \"NGRIs\" are kept. The decision to move them into the community is not a medical-psychiatric but a legal one. In this respect it is imperative to establish a Forensic Psychiatric Unit for these patients. In our country as the \"Psychargos\" external evaluation highlighted, there are great gaps in the provision of Forensic psychiatric services.3 It must be emphasised that these gaps affect negatively psychiatric reform and social reintegration not only for the forensic psychiatric patients but for the whole of mentally ill individuals. Given that forensic Psychiatric services are developed in Athens and Thessaloniki and that training in Forensic Psychiatry has moved forward, it is imperative that the state should build upon the existing knowledge and experience and create specialist forensic units aiming to treat and rehabilitate this special and important group of patients.4 Only when the patients found \"not guilty by reasons of insanity\" have their own (safe for the society and them) therapeutic and rehabilitative services the aim of de-institutionalisation will be visible and realistic to implement."}, {"Title": "Catatonia Education: Needs Assessment and Brief Online Intervention.", "Abstract": "There are no studies investigating physicians' knowledge of catatonia.

As neurons differentiate and the neuronal circuitry is established, several mRNAs undergo alternative splicing and other posttranscriptional changes that expand the variety of protein isoforms produced. Recent advances are beginning to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate isoform switching during neurogenesis and the role played by specific RNA binding proteins in this process. Neurogenesis and neuronal wiring were recently shown to also be regulated by RNA degradation through nonsense-mediated decay. An additional layer of regulatory complexity in these biological processes is the interplay between alternative splicing and long noncoding RNAs. Dysregulation of posttranscriptional regulation results in defective neuronal differentiation and/or synaptic connections that lead to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "L Ron Hubbard's science fiction quest against psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Layfayette Ronald Hubbard (1911-1986) was a colourful and prolific American writer of science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.

Given the life-altering scope of these incidents, forensic child psychiatrists may be asked to opine on the effects of a permanent perinatal injury on normal human development. Whether forensic child psychiatrists can assess risk of future psychiatric effects from such incidents is an important question. This paper is spurred by two separate cases, each involving a male infant having a portion of their genitals accidentally amputated by an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB/GYN) during a routine circumcision. In each case, the genitals were repaired, but permanent defects remained. The question arises how such injuries would affect these children as they matured. An analysis of the literature supported that there are risks of psychiatric effects of such birth-related injuries. Such predictions are made with reference to what is already known about human development, and by an exploration of the literature on the psychiatric effects of comparable injuries to children."}, {"Title": "Violence in the Emergency Department.", "Abstract": "Violence is common in the emergency department (ED).

Most of our psychopharmacological agents are not approved by the federal institutions for persons under 18 years old. However, severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and bipolar disorder frequently require pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents. We also see a wide range of rather unspecific emotional and behavioral disturbances up to excitation crises or suicidal acts in this young population, so that we see the necessity for standardized and valid psychopharmacological treatment regimens based on meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and guidelines 2.

A major shift in psychiatry, embodied in the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative of National Institute of Mental Health, recognizes the pitfalls of categorizing mental illnesses using diagnostic criteria. Instead, RDoC encourages researchers to use a dimensional approach, focusing on narrower domains of psychopathology to characterize brain-behavior relationships. Our aim in this multidisciplinary pilot study was to use computer vision tools to record OCD behaviors and to cross-validate these behavioral markers with standard clinical measures.\nEighteen youths with OCD and 21 healthy controls completed tasks in an innovation laboratory (free arrangement of objects, hand washing, arrangement of objects on contrasting carpets). Tasks were video-recorded. Videos were coded by blind raters for OCD-related behaviors. Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) and other scales were administered. We compared video-recorded measures of behavior in OCD versus healthy controls and correlated video measures and clinical measures of OCD.\nBehavioral measures on the videos were significantly correlated with specific CY-BOCS dimension scores. During the free arrangement task, more time spent ordering objects and more moves of objects were both significantly associated with higher CY-BOCS ordering/repeating dimension scores. Longer duration of hand washing was significantly correlated with higher scores on CY-BOCS ordering/repeating and forbidden thoughts dimensions. During arrangement of objects on contrasting carpets, more moves and more adjustment of objects were significantly associated with higher CY-BOCS ordering/repeating dimension scores.\nPreliminary data suggest that measurement of behavior using video recording is a valid approach for quantifying OCD psychopathology. This methodology could serve as a new tool for investigating OCD using an RDoC approach. This objective, novel behavioral measurement technique may benefit both researchers and clinicians in assessing pediatric OCD and in identifying new behavioral markers of OCD.

Given the complexity of social interactions, studying the interactive behavior of BPD patients is challenging. One way to implement both tight experimental control and realistic, externally valid settings is to use game-theoretical experiments. This review discusses findings from economic exchange studies in BPD against the background of game-theoretical literature. BPD patients do not seem to derive utility from mutual cooperation with others and appear not to \"forgive\" a partner's unfairness. By pursuing a strategy of negative reciprocity, BPD patients seem to act mostly \"rationally\" and in their own self-interest. Their \"grim trigger strategy\" resembles the theoretical ideal of the rational and self-interested agent homo economicus. Finally, we summarize how research findings from economics and clinical psychiatry may be mutually enriching and propose new research ideas in this fascinating field."}, {"Title": "A pharmacological overview of lamotrigine for the treatment of epilepsy.", "Abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting about 2% of the population worldwide. Lamotrigine (LTG) is a second generation anti-epileptic drug (AED) with broad spectrum of activity, a favourable side-effect profile, simpler dosing than earlier drugs and efficacious in diverse epilepsy syndromes. Areas covered: The present review focuses on pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of LTG and its effect on cognition, psychiatry, quality of life, women and pregnancy along with effect of enzyme inducing and enzyme inhibiting drugs over LTG and their effect on serum level fluctuations by collecting data from various studies over the years until 2016. Expert commentary: Results from various studies and clinical trials indicate that LTG possessed a favourable profile of anticonvulsant activity and good tolerability as a monotherapy/or add-on therapy in children and adult patients against several types of seizures and syndromes. It has wide clinical dose range with favourable pharmacokinetic properties making it an excellent therapeutic option in epilepsy."}, {"Title": "An Introduction From the New Psychotherapy Columnist.", "Abstract": "Despite psychiatry's shift toward a biomedical model, emerging research suggests that psychosocial factors make major contributions to the etiology of mental disorders of all kinds and that several types of psychotherapy have been shown to be effective forms of treatment for a range of disorders.

Urgent requirement of objective tools for screening high-risk patients is postulated by prominent authors because long-term set up time, serious side effects or ineffectiveness of psychiatric agents mean a great challenge for clinicians to find optimal therapy on time. Unwanted suffering from inaccurate medicine, progression of the disorder and mistrust or in adherence of the patients are dramatic consequences of the delay of adequate therapy which is linked with irreversible health and mental damages and financial loss. On the other hand, a growing body of data are published on pharmacogenomic studies in association with psychiatric conditions. Although several pharmacogenetic tests are commercially available, accurate use of these tools are absent from clinical protocols. Here we give a short review on the most important pharmacogenomic results and a discussion on possible conflict of interests around pharmacogenetic tests.

However, knowledge about how environmental and health system characteristics affect readmission rates is scarce. This paper systemically reviews and discusses the impact of health and social systems as well as environmental characteristics for readmission after discharge from inpatient care for patients with a psychiatric diagnosis.\nComprehensive literature searches were conducted in the electronic bibliographic databases Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest Health Management and OpenGrey. In addition, Google Scholar was utilised. Relevant publications published between January 1990 and June 2014 were included. No restrictions regarding language or publication status were imposed. A qualitative synthesis of the included studies was performed. Variables describing system and environmental characteristics were grouped into three groups: those capturing regulation, financing system and governance; those capturing capacity, organisation and structure; and those capturing environmental variables.\nOf the 734 unique articles identified in the original search, 35 were included in the study. There is a limited number of studies on psychiatric readmissions and their association with environmental and health system characteristics. Even though the review reveals an extensive list of characteristics studied, most characteristics appear in a very limited number of articles. The most frequently studied characteristics are related to location (local area, district/region/country). In most cases area differences were found, providing strong indication that the risk of readmission not only relates to patient characteristics but also to system and/or environmental factors that vary between areas. The literature also points in the direction of a negative association of institutional length of stay and community aftercare with readmission for psychiatric patients.\nThis review shows that analyses of system level variables are scarce. Furthermore they differ with respect to purpose, choice of system characteristics and the way these characteristics are measured. The lack of studies looking at the relationship between readmissions and provider payment models is striking. Without the link to provider payment models and other health system characteristics related to regulation, financing system and governance structure it becomes more difficult to draw policy implications from these analyses."}, {"Title": "World Health Organization disability assessment schedule 2.0: An international systematic review.", "Abstract": "This systematic review examines research and practical applications of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) as a basis for establishing specific criteria for evaluating relevant international scientific literature.

The WHODAS 2.0 shows strong correlations with several other measures of activity limitations; probably due to the fact that it shares the same disability latent variable with them. Implications for Rehabilitation WHODAS 2.0 seems to be a valid, reliable self-report instrument for the assessment of disability. The increasing interest in use of the WHODAS 2.0 extends to rehabilitation and life sciences rather than being limited to psychiatry.

AMPA receptors are important for excitatory synaptic transmission, and their antagonists are antiepileptic. Although efficacious, AMPA-receptor antagonists, including perampanel (Fycompa), the only approved antagonist for epilepsy, induce dizziness and motor impairment. We hypothesized that blockade of forebrain AMPA receptors without blocking cerebellar AMPA receptors would be antiepileptic and devoid of motor impairment. Taking advantage of an AMPA receptor auxiliary protein, TARP \u03b3-8, which is selectively expressed in the forebrain and modulates the pharmacological properties of AMPA receptors, we discovered that LY3130481 selectively antagonized recombinant and native AMPA receptors containing \u03b3-8, but not \u03b3-2 (cerebellum) or other TARP members. Two amino acid residues unique to \u03b3-8 determined this selectivity. We also observed antagonism of AMPA receptors expressed in hippocampal, but not cerebellar, tissue from an patient with epilepsy. Corresponding to this selective activity, LY3130481 prevented multiple seizure types in rats and mice and without motor side effects. These findings demonstrate the first rationally discovered molecule targeting specific neural circuitries for therapeutic advantage."}, {"Title": "[\"Nicht von schlechten Eltern - NischE\": A Family Orientated Collaborative Care Approach to Support Children in Families with Mentally Ill Parents].", "Abstract": "\"Nicht von schlechten Eltern - NischE\": A Family Orientated Collaborative Care Approach to Support Children in Families with Mentally Ill Parents The present work describes the setting- and multi-professional offer \"NischE\" in G\u00fctersloh, a systemic approach for the care of children and their mentally ill parents.

The CBI profiles of four groups of patients were compared, these being grouped according to their main clinical characteristics, psychometric data, imaging tests and the clinical judgement of the professional requesting the neuropsychological study.\nMost of the scales (10 out of 13) of the CBI yielded acceptable internal consistency values, and the memory and attention/orientation scales showed high correlations with objective measures of memory and time orientation. The CBI profiles of the groups of patients with different conditions (organic memory disorder, functional memory disorder, behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease) were consistent with their main features.\nThe CBI is a psychometrically reliable instrument with adequate convergent and discriminant validity that can be useful in the process of neuropsychological assessment.

Patients were classified into schizophrenia (n=70) and mood disorders (n=26) by psychiatric diagnoses with DSM-IV-TR criteria.\nThe incidence of brain damage [symptomatic and silent brain infarctions (SBIs) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)] was correlated more with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. It has been previously shown that the concentrations of protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in plasma of brain infarction patients together with C-reactive protein (CRP). The concentration of PC-Acro was significantly higher in patients with mood disorders than in those with schizophrenia. The concentration of IL-6 in both groups was nearly equal to that in the control group, but that of CRP in both groups, especially in mood disorders, was higher than that in the control group. Accordingly, the relative risk value for brain infarction was higher in patients with mood disorders than with schizophrenia. Medication with atypical antipsychotics reduced PC-Acro significantly in all psychiatric patients and reduced IL-6 in mood disorder patients.\nMeasurement of 3 biomarkers (CRP, PC-Acro and IL-6) are probably useful for judgement of severity of brain damage and effectiveness of medication in psychiatric patients."}, {"Title": "Forward psychiatry\u00a0-\u00a0early intervention for mental health problems among UK armed forces in Afghanistan.", "Abstract": "This observational study examined return to duty (RTD) rates following receipt of early mental health interventions delivered by deployed mental health practitioners.\nIn-depth clinical interviews were conducted among 975 UK military personnel referred for mental health assessment whilst deployed in Afghanistan.

Indeed, many investigators have compared the blood cytokine levels in psychiatric patients with those of healthy controls or monitored their levels in patients during disease progression to identify biomarkers. Nevertheless, very few studies have confirmed that such cytokines remain stable in healthy individuals through periods of weeks and months. This is an important issue to consider before using blood cytokine levels as biomarkers of disease traits, disease state, or treatment response. Although multiplex assay technology represents an advance in identifying biomarkers because it allows simultaneous examination of large panels of analytes from a small volume of sample, it is necessary to verify whether these assays yield enough sensitivity and reproducibility when applied to the blood from neuropsychiatric patients. Therefore, we compared two multiplex immunoassays, the bead-based Luminex<sup>\u00ae</sup> (Bio-Rad) and the electro-chemiluminescence-based V-plex<sup>\u00ae</sup> (MesoScaleDiscovery), for the detection and quantification of 31 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in both the sera and plasma of patients with major depressive episodes (MDE) and age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects during a 30-week period. Although both platforms exhibited low coefficients of variability (CV) between the duplicates in the calibration curves, the linearity was better in general for the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. However, neither platform was able to detect the absolute values for all of the tested analytes. Among the 16 analytes that were detected by both assays, the intra-assay reproducibility was in general better with the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. Although it is not a general rule that the results from sera and plasma will be correlated, consistent results were more frequent with the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> platform. Furthermore, the V-PLEX<sup>\u00ae</sup> results were more consistent with the gold standard ELISA simplex assay for IL-6 in both sera and plasma.

Competing risk regression models, adjusted by potential confounders, were used to test the hypothesised association between MMSE levels and dementia risk.\nOut of the 4057 participants followed up, 607 (14.9%) were classified as 'normal' (no cognitive impairment), 2672 (65.8%) as 'questionable' cognitive impairment, 732 (18.0%) had 'mild' cognitive impairment, 38 (0.9%) had 'moderate' cognitive impairment and eight (0.2%) had 'severe' impairment. Cognitive impairment was associated with risk of dementia, the risk increasing in parallel with the level of impairment (hazard ratio: 2.72, 4.78 and 8.38 in the 'questionable', 'mild' and 'moderate' level of cognitive impairment, respectively).\nThe documented gradient of increased risk of dementia associated with the severity level of cognitive impairment supports the validity of the simple staging model based on the MMSE assessment."}, {"Title": "Graphic Depictions: Portrayals of Mental Illness in Video Games.", "Abstract": "Although studies have examined portrayals of mental illness in the mass media, little attention has been paid to such portrayals in video games. In this descriptive study, the fifty highest-selling video games in each year from 2011 to 2013 were surveyed through application of search terms to the Wikia search engine, with subsequent review of relevant footage on YouTube. Depiction categories were then assigned based on the extent of portrayal and qualitative characteristics compared against mental illness stereotypes in cinema. Twenty-three of the 96 surveyed games depicted at least one character with mental illness. Forty-two characters were identified as portraying mental illness, with most characters classified under a \"homicidal maniac\" stereotype, although many characters did not clearly reflect cinema stereotypes and were subcategorized based on the shared traits. Video games contain frequent and varied portrayals of mental illness, with depictions most commonly linking mental illness to dangerous and violent behaviors."}, {"Title": "Institutional Pathology and the Death of Dan Markingson.", "Abstract": "In the spring of 2015, 11\u00a0years after a mentally ill young man named Dan Markingson stabbed himself to death in an industry-sponsored drug study, officials at the University of Minnesota suspended recruitment of subjects into drug trials in its Department of Psychiatry.

For inclusion in the study, articles had to assess the older population (60\u2009years or older), assess both depressive and resilience symptoms, and investigate the association between these two variables. Articles not employing validated resilience and depression scales or assessing populations younger than 60\u2009years were excluded. The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.\nA total of 1094 articles were retrieved from the three databases, 367 of which were duplicates and therefore excluded, giving 727 articles for analysis. Of these articles, seven met the eligibility criteria. All of the included articles were observational and cross-sectional, found an inverse relationship between depression and resilience, and were conducted in three countries: the USA, China, and Belgium. A moderate inverse correlation was found on the meta-analysis (r\u2009=\u2009-0.35, 95% confidence interval: -0.41 to -0.28).\nFew studies were found on this subject in the older population. An association between greater resilience and less depressive symptomatology was identified, albeit based on cross-sectional studies. These results highlight the need for further studies in the area and the importance of fostering the use of interventions to promote resilience in older adults as a means of preventing and managing depressive symptoms in this population.

Elucidation of the molecular structure of the active sites of the enzymes has enabled a precise determination of the way in which substrates and inhibitor molecules are metabolized, or inhibit metabolism of substrates, respectively. Despite the knowledge of the strong antidepressant efficacy of irreversible MAO inhibitors, their clinical use has been limited by their side effect of potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of dietary amines (\"cheese effect\"). A number of reversible MAO-A inhibitors which are devoid of cheese effect have been described in the literature, but only one, moclobemide, is currently in clinical use. The irreversible inhibitors of MAO-B, selegiline and rasagiline, are used clinically in treatment of Parkinson's disease, and a recently introduced reversible MAO-B inhibitor, safinamide, has also been found efficacious. Modification of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of selegiline by transdermal administration has led to the development of a new drug form for treatment of depression.

Rodger's contribution has been largely neglected within the history of Scottish psychiatry. This paper amends this neglect through situating Rodger's eclecticism in relation to both the biopsychosocial approach of his mentors, Adolf Meyer and David Henderson, and psychiatry's de-institutionalization in the 1950s and 1960s. It is posited that Rodger's eclecticism was a considered response to the pressures of this transitional phase to balance physical, psychological and social approaches, and a critical acknowledgement of the instability of contemporary psychiatric therapeutics. More psychodynamic than his predecessors, the importance of social relations for Rodger led him to acknowledge psychiatry's limitations."}, {"Title": "Physical activity and anxiety: A perspective from the World Health Survey.", "Abstract": "Despite the known benefits of physical activity (PA) among people with anxiety, little is known about PA levels in people with anxiety at the population level.

Prevalence of anxiety was estimated for 237,964 individuals (47 countries). PA was categorized as low, moderate, and high based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form). The association between PA and anxiety was assessed by multivariable logistic regression.\nThe overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4% (47 countries). Across 38 countries with available data on PA, 62.5%, 20.2%, and 17.3% of the sample engaged in high, moderate, and low levels of PA respectively. The prevalence of low physical activity in those with and without anxiety was 22.9% vs. 16.6% (p<0.001) (38 countries, n=184,920). In the pooled model adjusted for socio-demographics, depression, and country, individuals engaging in low PA (vs. high PA) had 1.32 (95% CI=1.17-1.47) times higher odds for anxiety than those with high PA. Female sex, older age, lower education and wealth, and depression were also associated with low PA.

The rationale for the administration of NAC in psychiatric conditions is based on its role as a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, and its action as a modulating agent of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways. Areas covered: This study reviews the available data regarding the use of NAC in different psychiatric disorders including substance use disorders, autism, obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder. Promising results were found in trials testing the use of NAC, mainly as an add-on treatment, in cannabis use disorder in young people, depression in bipolar disorder, negative symptoms in schizophrenia, and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Despite initial optimism, recent findings regarding NAC efficacy in autism have been disappointing.

There is an urgent need for a clinician-administered tool that produces dimensional measures, in addition to categorical diagnoses. The Standard for Clinicians' Interview in Psychiatry (SCIP) is a method of assessment of psychopathology for adults. It is designed to be administered by clinicians and includes the SCIP manual and the SCIP interview. Clinicians use the SCIP questions and rate the responses according to the SCIP manual rules. Clinicians use the patient's responses to questions, observe the patient's behaviors and make the final rating of the various signs and symptoms assessed. The SCIP method of psychiatric assessment has three components: 1) the SCIP interview (dimensional) component, 2) the etiological component, and 3) the disorder classification component. The SCIP produces three main categories of clinical data: 1) a diagnostic classification of psychiatric disorders, 2) dimensional scores, and 3) numeric data. The SCIP provides diagnoses consistent with criteria from editions of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)</i> and <i>International Classification of Disease (ICD).</i> The SCIP produces 18 dimensional measures for key psychiatric signs or symptoms: anxiety, posttraumatic stress, obsessions, compulsions, depression, mania, suicidality, suicidal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, disorganized behavior, negativity, catatonia, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, attention, and hyperactivity. The SCIP produces numeric severity data for use in either clinical care or research. The SCIP was shown to be a valid and reliable assessment tool, and the validity and reliability results were published in 2014 and 2015.

One area that has been especially successful is research on how the brain detects and responds to threats. Such studies have demonstrated comparable patterns of brain-behavior relationships underlying threat processing across a range of mammalian species, including humans. This would seem to be an ideal body of information for advancing our understanding of disorders in which altered threat processing is a key factor, namely, fear and anxiety disorders. But research on threat processing has not led to significant improvements in clinical practice. The authors propose that in order to take advantage of this progress for clinical gain, a conceptual reframing is needed. Key to this conceptual change is recognition of a distinction between circuits underlying two classes of responses elicited by threats: 1) behavioral responses and accompanying physiological changes in the brain and body and 2) conscious feeling states reflected in self-reports of fear and anxiety. This distinction leads to a \"two systems\" view of fear and anxiety. The authors argue that failure to recognize and consistently emphasize this distinction has impeded progress in understanding fear and anxiety disorders and hindered attempts to develop more effective pharmaceutical and psychological treatments.

The main purpose of this study was to examine a value-based approach in clinical psychiatry when evaluating a process improvement initiative. This was accomplished by using the relatively new time driven activity based costing (TDABC) method within the more widely adopted cost-effectiveness analysis framework for economic evaluation of healthcare technologies. The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of allowing psychologists to perform post-treatment assessment previously performed by psychiatrists at an outpatient clinic treating depression using internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT).\nData was collected from 568 adult patients treated with ICBT for depression during 2013-2014. The TDABC methodology was used to estimate total healthcare costs, including development of process maps for the complete cycle of care and estimation of resource use and minute costs of staff, hospital space and materials based on their relative proportions used. Clinical outcomes were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9) before and after treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) was performed and the results presented as incremental net benefits (INB), cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) and confidence ellipses to demonstrate uncertainty around the value of the organizational intervention.\nTaking into account the complete healthcare process (from referral to follow-up assessment), treatment costs decreased from $709 (SD = $130) per patient in 2013 to $659 (SD = $134) in 2014 while treatment effectiveness was maintained; 27% had achieved full remission from depression after treatment (PHQ-9 < 5) during both 2013 and 2014 and an additional 35% and 33% had achieved partial remission in 2013 and 2014, respectively. At follow-up, 42% were in full remission after treatment during both 2013 and 2014; an additional 35% and 33% were in partial remission during 2013 and 2014, respectively. Confidence ellipses occupied the south-east (SE) and south-west (SW) quadrants of the incremental cost-effectiveness plane at both post-treatment and at follow-up, indicating that the ICBT treatment was less costly and equally effective after staff reallocation.\nTreating patients to the target of full remission using psychologists instead of medical specialists for post-treatment assessment is cost-saving and consequently a more valuable use of limited resources. TDABC may be a useful tool for measuring resource costs, identifying quality improvement opportunities and evaluating the consequences of such initiatives. Combining TDABC with clinical outcome measures in CEA is potentially a useful approach in mental healthcare to estimate the value of process improvement initiatives."}, {"Title": "Behavioral and Neural Signatures of Reduced Updating of Alternative Options in Alcohol-Dependent Patients during Flexible Decision-Making.", "Abstract": "Addicted individuals continue substance use despite the knowledge of harmful consequences and often report having no choice but to consume. Computational psychiatry accounts have linked this clinical observation to difficulties in making flexible and goal-directed decisions in dynamic environments via consideration of potential alternative choices. To probe this in alcohol-dependent patients (n = 43) versus healthy volunteers (n = 35), human participants performed an anticorrelated decision-making task during functional neuroimaging. Via computational modeling, we investigated behavioral and neural signatures of inference regarding the alternative option. While healthy control subjects exploited the anticorrelated structure of the task to guide decision-making, alcohol-dependent patients were relatively better explained by a model-free strategy due to reduced inference on the alternative option after punishment. Whereas model-free prediction error signals were preserved, alcohol-dependent patients exhibited blunted medial prefrontal signatures of inference on the alternative option. This reduction was associated with patients' behavioral deficit in updating the alternative choice option and their obsessive-compulsive drinking habits. All results remained significant when adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., neuropsychological measures and gray matter density). A disturbed integration of alternative choice options implemented by the medial prefrontal cortex appears to be one important explanation for the puzzling question of why addicted individuals continue drug consumption despite negative consequences.\nIn addiction, patients maintain substance use despite devastating consequences and often report having no choice but to consume. These clinical observations have been theoretically linked to disturbed mechanisms of inference, for example, to difficulties when learning statistical regularities of the environmental structure to guide decisions. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate disturbed inference on alternative choice options in alcohol addiction. Patients neglecting \"what might have happened\" was accompanied by blunted coding of inference regarding alternative choice options in the medial prefrontal cortex. An impaired integration of alternative choice options implemented by the medial prefrontal cortex might contribute to ongoing drug consumption in the face of evident negative consequences."}, {"Title": "Applied investigation of person-specific and context-specific factors on postoperative recovery and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery: multicentre European study.", "Abstract": "Cancer treatments have greatly advanced over the past two decades causing survival improvements and reduced complications from cancer surgery.

Special courses and forums for specialists have recently started to meet the growing interest of physicians in learning how to manage dual disorders. The Indian health care system grapples with a large treatment gap for mental disorders, and while some treatment services for dual disorders exist, specific research and training efforts on dual disorders are just beginning. Israel has both public- and private sector services for patients with dual disorders, with specialized inpatient and emergency care for the acutely ill as well as day care and therapeutic communities for long-term management. Interest by researchers is growing, but training and education efforts in dual disorders are, however, minimal. Similar to the other countries, addiction and psychiatry disciplines are governed by separate divisions within the National Health System in Spain. There are some dual disorders services available, but they are limited in scope. While medical professionals clearly recognize the importance of dual disorders, there is no such recognition by the national and regional governing bodies.\nThe common thread in various aspects of dual disorder management in each of these four countries is that there is a lower-than-desirable level of attention to dual disorders in terms of care, policy, research, and training. There are growing opportunities for training and continuing education in dual disorders management.

Point of departure is the fact that both psychoanalysis and bioethics are practices of language, combining diagnostics with therapy. Subsequently, I will point out how Lacanian linguistics may help us to elucidate the dynamics of both psychoanalytical and bioethical discourse, using the movie One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest and Sophocles' tragedy Antigone as key examples. Next, I will explain the 'topology' of the bioethical landscape with the help of Lacan's three dimensions: the imaginary, the symbolical and the real. This will culminate in an assessment of the dynamics of bioethical discourse with the help of Lacan's theorem of the four discourses. Bioethics, I will argue, is not a homogeneous discourse. Rather, four modalities of bioethical discourse can be distinguished, all of them displaying specific weaknesses and strengths, opportunities and threats. This will be elucidated with the help of two case studies, namely the debates on human reproductive technologies and on the use of animals as biomedical research models."}, {"Title": "Does environmental exposure to the greenhouse gas, N<sub>2</sub>O, contribute to etiological factors in neurodevelopmental disorders? A mini-review of the evidence.", "Abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasing in prevalence worldwide. Previous work suggests that exposure to the environmental air pollutant and greenhouse gas - nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) - may be an etiological factor in neurodevelopmental disorders through the targeting of several neural correlates.\nWhile a number of recent systematic reviews have addressed the role of general anesthesia in the surgical setting and neurodevelopmental outcomes, a narrative mini-review was conducted to first define and characterize the relevant variables (i.e., N<sub>2</sub>O, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and autism spectrum disorders [ASD]) and their potential interactions into a coherent, hypothesis-generating work. The narrative mini-review merges basic principles in environmental science, anesthesiology, and psychiatry to more fully develop the novel hypotheses that neurodevelopmental impairment found in conditions like ADHD and ASD may be due to exposure to the increasing air pollutant, N<sub>2</sub>O.\nThe results of the present mini-review indicate that exposure to N<sub>2</sub>O, even at non-toxic doses, may modulate central neurotransmission and target many neural substrates directly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including the glutamatergic, opioidergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems. Epidemiological studies also indicate that early and repeated exposure to general anesthesia, including N<sub>2</sub>O, may contribute to later adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.\nThe current evidence and subsequent hypotheses suggest that a renewed interest be taken in the toxicological assessment of environmental N<sub>2</sub>O exposure using validated biomarkers and psychiatric endpoints. Given the relevance of N<sub>2</sub>O as a greenhouse gas, societies may also wish to engage in a more robust monitoring and reporting of N<sub>2</sub>O levels in the environment for climactic benefit as well."}, {"Title": "Clinical and biological predictors of response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a review.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), developed in the 30's by Bini and Cerletti, remains a key element of the therapeutic armamentarium in psychiatry, particularly for severe and life-threatening psychiatric symptoms. However, despite its well-established clinical efficacy, the prescription of ECT has declined constantly over the years due to concerns over its safety (cognitive side effects) and an increasingly negative public perception. As for other treatments in the field of psychiatry, ECT is well suited to a personalized approach that would increment its efficacy, as well as reducing the impact of side effects. This should be based on the priori identification of sub-populations of patients sharing common clinical and biological features that predict a good response to ECT. In this review we have selectively reviewed the evidence on clinical and biological predictors of ECT response. Clinical features such as an older age, presence of psychotic and melancholic depression, a high severity of suicide behavior, and speed of response, appear to be shared by ECT good responders with depressive symptoms. In mania, a greater severity of the index episode, and a reduction of whole brain cortical blood flow are associated with ECT good response. Biological determinants of ECT response in depressive patients are the presence of pre-treatment hyperconnectivity between key areas of brain circuitry of depression, as well as of reduced glutamine/glutamate levels, particularly in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC). Furthermore, pre ECT high plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, as well as of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and low pre-ECT levels of S-100B protein, appear to predict ECT response. Finally, polymorphisms within the genes encoding for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the dopamine 2 receptor gene (DRD2), the dopamine receptor 3 gene (DRD3), the cathechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), the serotonin-transporter (5-HTT), the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>), and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), appear to predict a good response to ECT.

There is growing interest in the role of the intestinal microbiota as a basis for the intestinal and possibly behavioral manifestations of this condition. Molecular-based microbial profiling has revealed compositional changes in the microbiota of at least a subset of IBS patients but the data are often conflicting and no microbial signature for this condition has yet been defined. Animal studies in which a previously stable intestinal microbiota is perturbed, by antibiotics or dietary change, results in alterations in intestinal function reminiscent of that seen in IBS patients. These include visceral sensitivity to painful stimuli, altered motility and intestinal barrier function as well as immune activation, and low-grade inflammation. More recent studies have shown that perturbation of the microbial composition of the gut alters brain chemistry and behavior. In a step toward establishing a causal link between an altar microbiota and gut-brain manifestations of IBS, colonization of germ-free mice with microbiota from IBS patients results in an IBS-like phenotype, including alterations and behavior if the donor exhibited psychiatric comorbidity, such as high levels of anxiety. This model provides an opportunity for exploring the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions relevant to the pathogenesis of IBS and for developing novel therapeutic targets."}, {"Title": "The effect of comorbid depression on facial and prosody emotion recognition in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum.", "Abstract": "Comorbid depression is common in first-episode schizophrenia spectrum (FES) disorders. Both depression and FES are associated with significant deficits in facial and prosody emotion recognition performance. However, it remains unclear whether people with FES and comorbid depression, compared to those without comorbid depression, have overall poorer emotion recognition, or instead, a different pattern of emotion recognition deficits. The aim of this study was to compare facial and prosody emotion recognition performance between those with and without comorbid depression in FES.\nThis study involved secondary analysis of baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of vocational intervention for young people with first-episode psychosis (N=82; age range: 15-25 years).\nThose with comorbid depression (n=24) had more accurate recognition of sadness in faces compared to those without comorbid depression. Severity of depressive symptoms was also associated with more accurate recognition of sadness in faces. Such results did not recur for prosody emotion recognition.\nIn addition to the cross-sectional design, limitations of this study include the absence of facial and prosodic recognition of neutral emotions.\nFindings indicate a mood congruent negative bias in facial emotion recognition in those with comorbid depression and FES, and provide support for cognitive theories of depression that emphasise the role of such biases in the development and maintenance of depression. Longitudinal research is needed to determine whether mood-congruent negative biases are implicated in the development and maintenance of depression in FES, or whether such biases are simply markers of depressed state."}, {"Title": "The whole versus the sum of some of the parts: toward resolving the apparent controversy of clitoral versus vaginal orgasms.", "Abstract": "The nature of a woman's orgasm has been a source of scientific, political, and cultural debate for over a century.

These diseases can affect the quantity and quality of saliva leading to multiple oral diseases. Although many researchers have evaluated xerostomia in general population, its prevalence is not been assessed in patients suffering from different psychological disorders.\nTo investigate the prevalence of xerostomia and to assess the correlation between xerostomia and dryness of lip and mucosa in different psychological disorders.\nA cross-sectional observational study was conducted over a period of six months in Department of Psychiatry and Department of Oral Medicine. Patients with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as diagnosed by an experienced psychiatrist, were given a questionnaire to evaluate the xerostomia. Patients with symptoms of xerostomia were subjected to oral examination by a skilled oral diagnostician to check for dryness of lips and mucosa. One hundred patients from each group of psychiatric diseases were included in the study using a consecutive sampling technique. An equal number of healthy individuals reporting to oral medicine department for routine oral screening were included as control group after initial psychiatric evaluation.\nIn this study statistically significant increase in the xerostomia in psychiatric patients was recorded when compared to the control group (p<0.01). Xerostomia was significantly higher in anxiety patients (51%) followed by depression (47%), bipolar disorder (41%), schizophrenia (39%) and control group (27%). The majority of the psychiatric patients had 'moderate' to 'severe' xerostomia whereas the control group had 'mild' xerostomia. Xerostomia was significantly higher in younger age group (18-49 years) than in older age group and females patients had higher xerostomia than male patients. Psychiatric patients had significantly more dryness of lip and mucosa than healthy controls.

Further, strategies to reduce seclusion have been identified as a potential method of improving cost-effectiveness of psychiatric services. However, developing alternative strategies to seclusion can be difficult. Interventions to reduce seclusion do not lend themselves to evaluation using randomized controlled trials (RCTs), though comprehensive literature reviews have demonstrated considerable non-RCT evidence for interventions to reduce seclusion in psychiatric facilities. In the UK, a recent 5-year evaluation of seclusion practice in a high secure UK hospital revealed reduced rates of seclusion without an increase in adverse incidents. To assess the effect of a novel intervention strategy for reduction of long-term segregation on a high secure, high dependency forensic psychiatry ward in the UK, we introduced a pilot program involving stratified levels of seclusion (\"long-term segregation\"), multidisciplinary feedback and information sharing, and a bespoke occupational therapy program. Reduced seclusion was demonstrated and staff feedback was mainly positive, indicating increased dynamism and empowerment on the ward. A more structured, stratified approach to seclusion, incorporating multidisciplinary team-working, senior administrative involvement, dynamic risk assessment, and bespoke occupational therapy may lead to a more effective model of reducing seclusion in high secure hospitals and other psychiatric settings.

Empirical studies employing these models are also reviewed. While theories often agree on how ADHD should be reflected in model parameters, each theory implies a unique combination of predictions. Empirical studies agree with the theories' assumptions of a lowered DDM drift rate in ADHD, while findings are less conclusive for boundary separation.

Whole-brain neural activations in healthy women, women with AN and women in long-term weight recovery following AN were compared using two functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks probing different aspects of self-perception. The Social Identity-V2 task involved consideration about oneself and others using socially descriptive adjectives. Both the ill and weight-recovered women with AN engaged medial prefrontal cortex less than healthy women for self-relevant cognitions, a potential biological trait difference. Weight-recovered women also activated the inferior frontal gyri and dorsal anterior cingulate more for direct self-evaluations than for reflected self-evaluations, unlike both other groups, suggesting that recovery may include compensatory neural changes related to social perspectives. The Faces task compared viewing oneself to a stranger. Participants with AN showed elevated activity in the bilateral fusiform gyri for self-images, unlike the weight-recovered and healthy women, suggesting cognitive distortions about physical appearance are a state rather than trait problem in this disease. Because both ill and recovered women showed neural differences related to social self-perception, but only recovered women differed when considering social perspectives, these neurocognitive targets may be particularly important for treatment."}, {"Title": "Physician Warnings in Psychiatry and the Risk of Road Trauma: An Exposure Crossover Study.", "Abstract": "To determine if physician warnings to psychiatric patients alter the subsequent frequency of a motor vehicle crash.

However, for one particularly striking and frequent symptom of schizophrenia, thought insertion, no plausible account has been proposed in terms of the predictive-coding framework. Here we propose that thought insertion is due to an altered experience of thoughts as coming from \"nowhere\", as is already indicated by the early 20th century phenomenological accounts by the early Heidelberg School of psychiatry. These accounts identified thought insertion as one of the self-disturbances (from German: \"Ichst\u00f6rungen\") of schizophrenia and used mescaline as a model-psychosis in healthy individuals to explore the possible mechanisms. The early Heidelberg School (Gruhle, Mayer-Gross, Beringer) first named and defined the self-disturbances, and proposed that thought insertion involves a disruption of the inner connectedness of thoughts and experiences, and a \"becoming sensory\" of those thoughts experienced as inserted. This account offers a novel way to integrate the phenomenology of thought insertion with the predictive coding framework. We argue that the altered experience of thoughts may be caused by a reduced precision of context-dependent predictions, relative to sensory precision. According to the principles of Bayesian inference, this reduced precision leads to increased prediction-error signals evoked by the neural activity that encodes thoughts. Thus, in analogy with the prediction-error related aberrant salience of external events that has been proposed previously, \"internal\" events such as thoughts (including volitions, emotions and memories) can also be associated with increased prediction-error signaling and are thus imbued with aberrant salience. We suggest that the individual's attempt to explain the aberrant salience of thoughts results in their interpretation as being inserted by an alien agent, similarly to the emergence of delusions in response to the aberrant salience of sensory stimuli."}, {"Title": "Smoking, alcohol, and substance use and rates of quitting during pregnancy: is it hard to quit?", "Abstract": "Alcohol and substance use is a major health challenge in Turkey, as it is worldwide.

The potential predictive factors of the efficacy of mirtazapine and the tolerability based on the incidence of oversedation and jitteriness/anxiety syndrome were evaluated.\nPatients with major depressive disorder were retrospectively investigated. Study subjects comprised 68 patients with depression who received mirtazapine as an initial antidepressant at the Department of Psychiatry of the Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital from September 2009 to March 2013. The efficacy of mirtazapine monotherapy was evaluated based on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement score. Clinical characteristics were compared between remission and nonremission groups to determine the factors predicting the efficacy. Moreover, discontinuation rates due to adverse effects, including oversedation and jitteriness/anxiety syndrome, were examined, and the effects of confounding factors were evaluated.\nThe remission rate of mirtazapine monotherapy was 36.8% among the 68 enrolled subjects. The mean final doses in the remission and nonremission groups were 27.6\u00b113.5 mg and 26.0\u00b114.1 mg, respectively, and there was no significant difference between them. Multiple logistic analyses revealed that the absence of guilt (odds ratio [OR] =0.15; 95% CI [1.66-37.24], <i>P</i>=0.006) and the presence of psychomotor retardation (OR =4.30; 95% CI [1.30-16.60], <i>P</i>=0.016) were significantly related to the efficacy of mirtazapine monotherapy. The discontinuation rates due to oversedation and jitteriness/anxiety syndrome were 13.2% and 11.8%, respectively. Age did not differ significantly between patients with or without oversedation or jitteriness/anxiety syndrome (<i>P</i>=0.078 and <i>P</i>=0.579, respectively).\nThe absence of guilt and the presence of psychomotor retardation may predict the efficacy of mirtazapine, and mirtazapine may be tolerable for all ages."}, {"Title": "Toward understanding thalamocortical dysfunction in schizophrenia through computational models of neural circuit dynamics.", "Abstract": "The thalamus is implicated in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, and multiple modalities of noninvasive neuroimaging provide converging evidence for altered thalamocortical dynamics in the disorder, such as functional connectivity and oscillatory power. However, it remains a challenge to link these neuroimaging biomarkers to underlying neural circuit mechanisms. One potential path forward is a \"Computational Psychiatry\" approach that leverages computational models of neural circuits to make predictions for the dynamical impact dynamical impact on specific thalamic disruptions hypothesized to occur in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here we review biophysically-based computational models of neural circuit dynamics for large-scale resting-state networks which have been applied to schizophrenia, and for thalamic oscillations. As a key aspect of thalamocortical dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is its regional specificity, it is important to consider potential sources of intrinsic heterogeneity of cellular and circuit properties across cortical and thalamic structures."}, {"Title": "Hoarding symptoms among psychiatric outpatients: confirmatory factor analysis and psychometric properties of the Saving Inventory - Revised (SI-R).", "Abstract": "The growing interest in problematic hoarding as an independent clinical condition has led to the development of the Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R) to assess hoarding phenomenology. The SI-R is one of the most widely used instruments to measure hoarding symptoms; however, it lacks validation in non-Western samples.\nThe current study examined the construct, convergent, and discriminant validity of the SI-R among 500 outpatients at a psychiatric hospital in Singapore. The three-factor structure solution of the SI-R was fitted in a confirmatory factor analysis.\nThe final model achieved mediocre fit (\u03c72\u2009=\u20091026.02, df\u2009=\u2009186; RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.095, SRMR\u2009=\u20090.06; CFI\u2009=\u20090.86; NNFI\u2009=\u20090.85). Two reverse-coded items (items 2 and 4) were removed due to insufficient factor loadings, resulting in the modified 21-item SI-R (SIR-21). Our findings indicate the need to further examine the construct validity of the SI-R, particularly in non-Western samples. Nonetheless, correlations with other hoarding-related constructs, such as anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the SIR-21 in our sample.\nFindings in our current majority Chinese sample were consistent with previous observations from other Chinese samples. Implications were discussed from a cross-cultural perspective, such as cultural emphasis on saving for future use and overlap between the concepts of discarding and acquiring in Chinese samples. Future studies should also examine differences among other ethnic groups (e.g., Malay, Indian)."}, {"Title": "Relationship between xerostomia and psychotropic drugs in patients with schizophrenia: evaluation using an oral moisture meter.", "Abstract": "Patients with schizophrenia are most commonly treated with antipsychotic medications, often with the addition of anxiolytics. This study used an oral moisture meter to evaluate xerostomia in patients with schizophrenia taking typical and atypical antipsychotics, anxiolytics and non-psychotropic medications.\nPatients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to ICD-10 criteria in the Department of Psychiatry, Kitasato University East, and affiliated hospitals were studied. All patients were on psychotropic medications. Patients with diseases associated with xerostomia, such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome I, were excluded.\nA total of 127 patients were enrolled. Mean oral moisture was 27\u00b781 \u00b1 2\u00b727% (normal, \u226530\u00b70%). A significant association was observed between objective oral moisture and the subjective sense of dry mouth. Multivariate analysis revealed a negative correlation between the number of antipsychotics and, especially, anxiolytics, and the degree of oral moisture. Drug dosages themselves were not significantly correlated with dry mouth. These findings suggest that objective oral moisture measurements show decreased moisture in patients on these medications and that the degree of moisture shows a greater negative correlation with the number, as opposed to the dosages, of psychotropic drugs administered.\nWhen patients with schizophrenia visit a dental clinic, it is important for the dentist to accurately assess the degree of oral moisture and to determine the medications being taken. Based on these findings of the association of polypharmacy with xerostomia, dentists are encouraged to inform the psychiatrist of the need to actively manage patients' xerostomia."}, {"Title": "Effects of Direct-To-Consumer Advertising on Patient Prescription Requests and Physician Prescribing: A Systematic Review of Psychiatry-Relevant Studies.", "Abstract": "To systematically analyze the effects of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) on patient requests for medication and physician prescribing across psychiatry-relevant studies.\nMEDLINE, PsycINFO, Thomson Reuters' ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar were searched (1999-2014) using variations of the terms direct-to-consumer advertising and psychiatric. Reference lists and an online repository of DTCA manuscripts were also scrutinized.\nEnglish-language studies collecting data at the point of service, focusing on or including psychiatric medication, and assessing the effects of DTCA on patient and/or physician behavior were included. Of 989 articles identified, 69 received full-text review. Four studies across 5 manuscripts met inclusion criteria.\nData were extracted on participants, study design, methodological quality, and results. Methodological quality of individual studies was assessed using adapted criteria from the Effective Public Health Practice Project. Confidence in conclusions across studies was determined using principles from the well-established GRADE system.\nDue to lack of replication across strong randomized controlled trials (RCTs), no conclusions merited high confidence. With moderate confidence, we concluded that DTCA requests (1) are granted most of the time (1 RCT, 3 observational), (2) prompt higher prescribing volume (1 RCT, 1 observational), (3) promote greater adherence to minimally acceptable treatment guidelines for patients with depression (1 RCT), and (4) stimulate overprescribing among patients with an adjustment disorder (1 RCT).\nFindings suggest that DTCA requests are typically accommodated, promote higher prescribing volume, and have competing effects on treatment quality.

As bvFTD in patients will deteriorate, psychiatric disorders are treatable. To date, misdiagnosis often occurs due to an overlap of symptoms and lack of specific biomarkers. The aim of our study was to investigate whether specific symptoms could separate bvFTD from psychiatric disorders.\nIn a naturalistic, prospective, multicenter study, 137 patients (aged 45-75 years, 72% male) with a late-onset frontal lobe syndrome were included based on their scores on the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (SRI) from April 2011 to June 2013. In a multidisciplinary consensus meeting, diagnoses were established based on elaborate neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical examination by a neurologist and a psychiatrist based on the International bvFTD Criteria Consortium for bvFTD and DSM-IV-TR criteria for psychiatric disorders.\nForty-four subjects (32.8%) were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, 10 (7.3%) with possible bvFTD, and 45 (32.8%) with probable bvFTD. A logistic regression analysis was performed with \"psychiatry or bvFTD\" as dependent variable and clinical variables (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], SRI, FBI) and demographics as independent variables. A positive history of psychiatric illness, male gender, lower SRI scores and higher MADRS scores were predictive of psychiatric disorders, explaining 65.2% of the variance in diagnosis of psychiatry versus bvFTD (\u03c7\u00b2\u2085 = 60.04, P < .001). On the FBI, symptom level verbal apraxia/aphasia and impulsivity were predictive of bvFTD, whereas irritability was predictive of psychiatric disorders.\nIn daily clinical practice, specific subtyping of clinical symptoms in patients with late-onset frontal lobe syndrome may aid in differentiating bvFTD patients from psychiatric patients and may provide guidance in patient management."}, {"Title": "Emotional Rejection of the Infant: Status of the Concept.", "Abstract": "Emotional rejection of the infant is a morbid, clinical phenomenon, central to mother-infant psychiatry.

Early maltreatment was assessed by the Childhood Experiences of Care and Abuse Questionnaire, attachment was assessed using the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System, and mentalization was coded with the Reflective Functioning Scale from Adult Attachment Interviews. Potential for violence was operationalized using the Reactive-Proactive Aggression Questionnaire, and the presence of conduct disorder was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview. Using structural equation modeling, reflective functioning and attachment were tested as mediators on the direct effect of early maltreatment on potential for violence.\nThere was a direct effect of early maltreatment on potential for violence. Furthermore, this direct effect was partially mediated by reflective functioning but not by attachment representations.\nThe results contribute to the idea that mentalization serves as a protective factor that may suspend the pathway from early maltreatment to violence in adolescence. Because of the transformation of attachment patterns into generalized cognitive models of attachment, attachment in adolescence may have a less pronounced effect on violence in this specific developmental phase. Future studies should test for further group differences in community and clinical groups, which was not possible in the present study due to the limited sample size."}, {"Title": "Characterizing the pain score trajectories of hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients: a retrospective cohort study.", "Abstract": "Pain care for hospitalized patients is often suboptimal. Representing pain scores as a graphical trajectory may provide insights into the understanding and treatment of pain. We describe a 1-year, retrospective, observational study to characterize pain trajectories of hospitalized adults during the first 48 hours after admission at an urban academic medical center. Using a subgroup of patients who presented with significant pain (pain score >4; n = 7762 encounters), we characterized pain trajectories and measured area under the curve, slope of the trajectory for the first 2 hours after admission, and pain intensity at plateau. We used mixed-effects regression to assess the association between pain score and sociodemographics (age, race, and gender), pain medication orders (opioids, nonopioids, and no medications), and medical service (obstetrics, psychiatry, surgery, sickle cell, intensive care unit, and medicine). K-means clustering was used to identify patient subgroups with similar trajectories. Trajectories showed differences based on race, gender, service, and initial pain score. Patients presumed to have dissimilar pain experiences (eg, sickle vs obstetrical) had markedly different pain trajectories. Patients with higher initial pain had a more rapid reduction during their first 2 hours of treatment. Pain reduction achieved in the 48 hours after admission was approximately 50% of the initial pain, regardless of the initial pain. Most patients' pain failed to fully resolve, plateauing at a pain score of 4 or greater. Visualizing pain scores as graphical trajectories illustrates the dynamic variability in pain, highlighting pain responses over a period of observation, and may yield new insights for quality improvement and research."}, {"Title": "Time Trends in Lifetime Incidence Rates of First-Time Diagnosed Bipolar and Depressive Disorders Across 16 Years in Danish Psychiatric Hospitals: A Nationwide Study.", "Abstract": "There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the incidences of affective disorders are on the rise.

Time trends were most pronounced for individuals up to 29 years of age. A sizeable part of the increase in incidence rates could be attributed to an increase in the total number of persons diagnosed in psychiatry.\nTime trends in incidence rates showed an increase for bipolar disorder and depressive disorders across 16 years, but found that some of the observed increase in incidence rates was related to a more widespread trend in Danish society of seeking and receiving psychiatric assistance."}, {"Title": "A support vector machine model provides an accurate transcript-level-based diagnostic for major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a critical cause of morbidity and disability with an economic cost of hundreds of billions of dollars each year, necessitating more effective treatment strategies and novel approaches to translational research. A notable barrier in addressing this public health threat involves reliable identification of the disorder, as many affected individuals remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. An objective blood-based diagnostic test using transcript levels of a panel of markers would provide an invaluable tool for MDD as the infrastructure-including equipment, trained personnel, billing, and governmental approval-for similar tests is well established in clinics worldwide. Here we present a supervised classification model utilizing support vector machines (SVMs) for the analysis of transcriptomic data readily obtained from a peripheral blood specimen. The model was trained on data from subjects with MDD (n=32) and age- and gender-matched controls (n=32). This SVM model provides a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% for the diagnosis of MDD using a panel of 10 transcripts. We applied a logistic equation on the SVM model and quantified a likelihood of depression score. This score gives the probability of a MDD diagnosis and allows the tuning of specificity and sensitivity for individual patients to bring personalized medicine closer in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Cooperation and client perspective are the terms for success; reflection on the cost-effectiveness of psychiatry].", "Abstract": "There is a growing interest in the cost-effectiveness of psychiatry in general.

One complication is that the societal benefits of psychiatry are being reduced to mere economic efficacy and another complication is that there is less concern about the benefits to the patient in terms of reduced psychiatric suffering and speedier recovery. Yet another problem is the increasing involvement of ethical issues.<br/> CONCLUSION: The cost-efficiency of psychiatry can never be assessed in isolation, i.e. as a separate issue; it depends totally on effective cooperation with the patient, his or her immediate environment and partners and fellow-citizens.

However, there is a large variation in efficacy within the two treatment areas. The variation is even larger in the treatment results for individual patients. The main objective of 'personalised medicine' is to tailor the type of treatment to the particular symptoms of the individual patient so that he or she will not be exposed to types of treatment that are not strictly relevant to the patient's symptoms or illness.

We discussed the likely applications of group music therapy in psychiatry and the possible contribution of music therapy in improving the psychopathological condition of adult outpatients. In addition, the implications for the patient-centered perspective were also discussed."}, {"Title": "[Reconciliating neurology and psychiatry: The prototypical case of frontotemporal dementia].", "Abstract": "Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) in its behavioral variant (bvFTD) is probably one of the conditions that best illustrates the links between psychiatry and neurology. It is indeed admitted that between a third and half of patients with this condition, especially in early-onset forms, receive an initial diagnosis of psychiatric disorder (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and are then referred to a psychiatric ward. BvFTD can thus be considered a neurological disorder with a psychiatric presentation. Among psychiatric symptoms reported in this disease, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, especially of persecution), which have long been underestimated in bvFTD and are not part of the current diagnostic criteria, are present in about 20% of cases and may be inaugural. They are particularly common in the genetic forms related to a mutation in the C9orf72 gene (up to 50%), and to a lesser extent in the GRN gene (up to 25%). C9orf72 gene mutation is often associated with a family history of dementia or motor neuron disease but also of psychiatric disorders. It has also been described in sporadic presentation forms. Sometimes, the moderate degree of brain atrophy on MRI described in patients carrying this mutation may complicate the differential diagnosis with late-onset psychiatric diseases. In the present article, we underline the importance of considering that psychiatric -\u00a0especially psychotic\u00a0- symptoms are not rare in bvFTD, which should lead to a revision of the diagnostic criteria of this disease by taking greater account of this fact. We also propose a diagnostic chart, based on concerted evaluation by neurologists and psychiatrists for cases of atypical psychiatric symptoms (late-onset or pharmacoresistant troubles) leading to consider the possibility of a neurological disorder, in order to shed a new light on these difficult clinical situations. In the field of research, bvFTD may constitute a model to explore the neural basis of certain psychiatric disorders, and a possible molecular link between bvFTD and psychoses, which could eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches, has been recently suggested. Thus, bvFTD illustrates how the links between neurology and psychiatry are close and tend to evolve with the progress of scientific knowledge. It is necessary to strengthen collaboration between the two disciplines both to improve the care -\u00a0diagnosis and management of these patients\u00a0- and to promote the emergence of innovative clinical research."}, {"Title": "Postoperative Delirium Following Orthognathic Surgery in a Young Patient.", "Abstract": "Delirium is an organic mental syndrome with acute onset characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction and neural activity disorganization. It is usually related to cognition and perception changes, decreased level of consciousness, and disorganization of thoughts that are unrelated to previous dementia. Occurrence is more frequent in patients with previous degenerative disease and elderly patients, especially those older than 85\u00a0years. Although the pathophysiology is not totally known, studies have shown that, among the main factors that lead to delirium, the drugs used for general anesthesia induction are the most relevant (hypnotics, anticholinergic drugs, and H<sub>2</sub> receptor blockers), especially those used in long surgical procedures. This report describes the case of a 24-year-old woman with a noncontributory medical and psychological history. She underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with a total general anesthesia time of 7\u00a0hours. Postoperatively, she developed agitation, confusion, and delirium. After a psychiatry consult and discussion with the anesthesia team, the diagnosis of psychotic break owing to late postoperative delirium was established."}, {"Title": "Analyzing Confabulations in Schizophrenia and Healthy Participants.", "Abstract": "Confabulations occur in schizophrenia and certain severe neuropsychiatric conditions, and to a lesser degree in healthy individuals. The present study used a forced confabulation paradigm to assess differences in confabulation between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.\nSchizophrenia patients (n=60) and healthy control participants (n=19) were shown a video with missing segments, asked to fill in the gaps with speculations, and tested on their memory for the story. Cognitive functions and severity of symptoms were also evaluated.\nSchizophrenia patients generated significantly more confabulations than healthy control participants and had a greater tendency to generate confabulations that were related to each other. Schizophrenic confabulations were positively associated with temporal context confusions and formal thought disorder, and negatively with delusions.\nOur findings show that the schizophrenia patients generate more confabulations than healthy controls and schizophrenic confabulations are associated with positive symptoms.

Hazardous drinking can worsen depression and anxiety symptoms (and vice versa), yet less is known about whether reductions in hazardous drinking improve symptom outcomes.\nThree hundred and seven psychiatry outpatients were interviewed (baseline, 3-, 6-months) for hazardous drinking (drinking over recommended daily limits), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (GAD-7) as part of a hazardous drinking intervention trial. Longitudinal growth models tested associations between hazardous drinking and symptoms (and reciprocal effects between symptoms and hazardous drinking), adjusting for treatment effects.\nAt baseline, participants had moderate anxiety (M=10.81; SD=10.82) and depressive symptoms (M=13.91; SD=5.58); 60.0% consumed alcohol at hazardous drinking levels. Over 6-months, participants' anxiety (B=-3.03, p<.001) and depressive symptoms (B=-5.39, p<.001) improved. Continued hazardous drinking led to slower anxiety (B=0.09, p=.005) and depressive symptom (B=0.10, p=.004) improvement; reductions in hazardous drinking led to faster anxiety (B=-0.09, p=.010) and depressive (B=-0.10, p=.015) symptom improvement. Neither anxiety (B=0.07, p=.066) nor depressive (B=0.05, p=.071) symptoms were associated with hazardous drinking outcomes.\nParticipants were psychiatry outpatients, limiting generalizability.\nReducing hazardous drinking can improve depression and anxiety symptoms but continued hazardous use slows recovery for psychiatry patients.

In order to ensure that our nation's physicians embed this aspect of practice into their work, there also is a growing expectation for effective integration of QIPS training into graduate medical education. This exploratory pilot study was conducted to identify how residents' personal and residency program characteristics might be related to their perceived confidence to develop and conduct prospective QIPS projects.\nA total non-probability convenience sample of 43 DO resident physicians from five residency programs (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry) at Authority Health were surveyed from 09/28/2015 to 01/06/2016 using online Survey Monkey software. A 38-item survey asked residents about their personal and residency program characteristics, as well as their current overall perceived confidence to develop and conduct QIPS projects.\nTwo model terms that proved non-significant during analyses were residents' age category and year in residency training. In the final stepwise multinomial regression model, however, three covariates including: a) sex (p=0.045), b) being in a primary care residency program (p=0.038) and c) having had prior QIPS project experience (p=0.049) were each found to be statistically significant predictors of respondents' perceived comfort level categories. Male residents and those who were in a primary care residency program (i.e., Family Medicine, Internal Medicine or Pediatrics), and/or reported having had prior QIPS project experience, reported significantly higher confidence levels.\nSomewhat similar to earlier studies, these results suggest the need to incorporate QIPS education for resident trainees across the nation. Ideally, the findings from larger resident studies will enable GME leaders to develop and deliver evidence-based QIPS curricula that are better oriented to resident physicians' personal characteristics and preferences."}, {"Title": "Developing the language of futility in psychiatry with care.", "Abstract": "In psychiatric practice, treatment success is, in many instances, not an achievable goal. Psychiatrists may often not acknowledge treatment failure in their patients and seldom consider that patients may be in situations that share similarities with end-of-life dilemmas in general somatic medicine. In such instances, futile treatment may be continued and patient suffering may be prolonged. Doctors should play a leading role in patient education, diagnosis, promoting best treatment options, motivation and support, but patients should be given the opportunity to take ownership of their illness and their future. In the discipline of psychiatry, physician-assisted suicide may be an option but warrants careful consideration. Contemporary psychiatrists may act paternalistically, refusing to accept the limitations of their scientific skills and/or struggle with the moral good of 'letting go' when required. It is arguably the seeming complexity of gauging patients' understanding (competency, capacity) to make informed decisions that perpetuates futile treatment. Most patients, even in the presence of ongoing serious psychiatric illness, are able to give consent. Psychiatrists should be aware of the difference between <i>being alive</i> and <i>living</i>. Ongoing suffering cannot be condoned. The <i>personhood</i> of every patient and his/her bio-psycho-social and spiritual needs should, as far as possible, be respected. Psychiatrists should embrace the realisation of treatment futility and, in some cases, end-of-life decisions and take on the challenge as well as the responsibility of serving patients with mental illness in the best way possible."}, {"Title": "Copeptin levels and blood lipid profile in borderline patients with or without self-mutilation.", "Abstract": "Self-mutilation, known as self-harming behaviour of an individual without the intention of suicide, is commonly observed in individuals with borderline personality disorder.

However, whether specific patient groups are more likely to be subjected to these coercive measures is unclear. Using robust methodological and statistical techniques, we aimed to determine the demographic, clinical and behavioural predictors of both PICU and seclusion.\nData were extracted from an anonymised database comprising the electronic medical records of patients within a large South London mental health trust. Two cohorts were derived, (1) a PICU cohort comprising all patients transferred from general adult acute wards to a non-forensic PICU ward between April 2008 and April 2013 (N = 986) and a randomly selected group of patients admitted to general adult wards within this period who were not transferred to PICU (N = 994), and (2) a seclusion cohort comprising all seclusion episodes occurring in non-forensic PICU wards within the study period (N = 990) and a randomly selected group of patients treated in these wards who were not secluded (N = 1032). Demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, admission status and time since admission) and behavioural precursors (potentially relevant behaviours occurring in the 3 days preceding PICU transfer/seclusion or random sample date) were extracted from electronic medical records. Mixed effects, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed with all variables included as predictors.\nPICU cases were significantly more likely to be younger in age, have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and to be held on a formal section compared with patients who were not transferred to PICU; female sex and longer time since admission were associated with lower odds of transfer. With regard to behavioural precursors, the strongest predictors of PICU transfer were incidents of physical aggression towards others or objects and absconding or attempts to abscond. Secluded patients were also more likely to be younger and legally detained relative to non-secluded patients; however, female sex increased the odds of seclusion. Likelihood of seclusion also decreased with time since admission. Seclusion was significantly associated with a range of behavioural precursors with the strongest associations observed for incidents involving restraint or shouting.\nWhilst recent behaviour is an important determinant, patient age, sex, admission status and time since admission also contribute to risk of PICU transfer and seclusion.

A convenience sample of 700 non-psychiatrist medical practitioners based in six hospitals in Lahore was approached to participate in the survey.\nSix hundred and one (86\u00a0%) of the doctors approached consented to participate; almost all respondents (99\u00a0%) endorsed one of various biopsychosocial causes of depression (38 to 79\u00a0% for particular causes), and 37\u00a0% (between 13 and 19\u00a0% for particular causes) noted that supernatural forces could be responsible. Supernatural causes were more commonly held by female doctors, those working in rural settings, and those with greater psychiatry specialist education. Attitudes to depression were mostly less confident or optimistic and less inclined to a generalist perspective than those of clinicians in the UK or European nations, and deterministic perspectives that depression is a natural part of aging or due to personal failings were particularly common. However, there was substantial confidence in the efficacy of antidepressants and psychological therapy. More confident and therapeutically optimistic views and a more generalist perspective about depression management were associated with a rejection of supernatural explanations of the origin of depression.\nNon-psychiatrist medical practitioners in Pakistan hold a range of views about the causes of depression, with supernatural explanations held by more than a third. Depression attitudes appear less positive than among UK and European clinicians, with the notions that depression is due to a lack of stamina and will-power and a natural part of growing old being especially commonly held; more positive attitudes appear to be associated with a rejection of supernatural explanatory models of depression."}, {"Title": "Predicting the functional states of human iPSC-derived neurons with single-cell RNA-seq and electrophysiology.", "Abstract": "Human neural progenitors derived from pluripotent stem cells develop into electrophysiologically active neurons at heterogeneous rates, which can confound disease-relevant discoveries in neurology and psychiatry.

Such a 'material history' of electroshock therapy reveals that the technical make-up of electroshock devices and what they were used for was relative to the changing interests of physicians, industrial companies and mental health politics; it makes an intriguing case for the Social Construction of Technology theory (Bijker et al., The social construction of technological systems: new directions in the sociology and history of technology.

This use exposes patients to an unknown additional risk of ineffective or even harmful treatment. In addition, treatment with psychotropic drugs during a period of life when the patient undergoes marked developmental hormonal and neurobiological changes often requires different dosing regimes in later life and may result in adverse drug reactions, which are either not seen in adults at all or not in the same frequency. Areas covered: Given these critical safety issues, efficient pharmacovigilance methods as part of routine practice are essential for the improvement of patient care. The purpose of this article is to introduce methods to increase the safety of psychotropic drug use in youngsters. In particular, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as a routine measure of proactive pharmacovigilance is discussed. Expert opinion: Given the special features of psychopharmacological therapy in children and adolescents in day-to-day clinical practise, proactive surveillance by using a close standardized 'patient monitoring' and long-term follow-up with TDM is very important. This approach could minimize the risk of exposing paediatric patients to ineffective treatments of uncertain or unknown risks."}, {"Title": "Psychoradiology: The Frontier of Neuroimaging in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Unlike neurologic conditions, such as brain tumors, dementia, and stroke, the neural mechanisms for all psychiatric disorders remain unclear. A large body of research obtained with structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography, and optical imaging has demonstrated regional and illness-specific brain changes at the onset of psychiatric disorders and in individuals at risk for such disorders. Many studies have shown that psychiatric medications induce specific measurable changes in brain anatomy and function that are related to clinical outcomes. As a result, a new field of radiology, termed psychoradiology, seems primed to play a major clinical role in guiding diagnostic and treatment planning decisions in patients with psychiatric disorders. This article will present the state of the art in this area, as well as perspectives regarding preparations in the field of radiology for its evolution. Furthermore, this article will (a) give an overview of the imaging and analysis methods for psychoradiology; (b) review the most robust and important radiologic findings and their potential clinical value from studies of major psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia; and (c) describe the main challenges and future directions in this field. An ongoing and iterative process of developing biologically based nomenclatures with which to delineate psychiatric disorders and translational research to predict and track response to different therapeutic drugs is laying the foundation for a shift in diagnostic practice in psychiatry from a psychologic symptom-based approach to an imaging-based approach over the next generation. This shift will require considerable innovations for the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of brain images, all of which will undoubtedly require the active involvement of radiologists. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article."}, {"Title": "The Growing Regulation of Conversion Therapy.", "Abstract": "Conversion therapies are any treatments, including individual talk therapy, behavioral (e.g. aversive stimuli), group therapy or milieu (e.g. \"retreats or inpatient treatments\" relying on all of the above methods) treatments, which attempt to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. However these practices have been repudiated by major mental health organizations because of increasing evidence that they are ineffective and may cause harm to patients and their families who fail to change. At present, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, DC, and the Canadian Province of Ontario have passed legislation banning conversion therapy for minors and an increasing number of US States are considering similar bans. In April 2015, the Obama administration also called for a ban on conversion therapies for minors. The growing trend toward banning conversion therapies creates challenges for licensing boards and ethics committees, most of which are unfamiliar with the issues raised by complaints against conversion therapists. This paper reviews the history of conversion therapy practices as well as clinical, ethical and research issues they raise. With this information, state licensing boards, ethics committees and other regulatory bodies will be better able to adjudicate complaints from members of the public who have been exposed to conversion therapies."}, {"Title": "Functional dystonia and the borderland between neurology and psychiatry: New concepts.", "Abstract": "Mind-brain dualism has dominated historical commentary on dystonia, a dichotomous approach that has left our conceptual grasp of it stubbornly incomplete. This is particularly true of functional dystonia, most diagnostically challenging of all functional movement disorders, in which the question of inherent psychogenicity remains a focus of debate. Phenomenological signs considered in isolation lack the specificity to distinguish organic and nonorganic forms, and dystonia's variability has frustrated attempts to develop objective laboratory-supported standards. Diagnostic criteria for functional dystonia that place emphasis on psychiatric symptoms perform poorly in studies of reliability, partly explained by the high frequency of psychopathology in organic dystonia. Novel approaches from the cognitive neurosciences may offer a way forward. Theory on Bayesian statistical prediction in cognitive processing is supported by sufficient experimental evidence for this model to be taken seriously as a way of reconciling contradictory notions about voluntary and unconscious motor control in functional movement disorders. In a Bayesian formulation of functional dystonia, misallocation of attention and abnormal predictive beliefs generate movements that are executed without a sense of agency. Building on this framework, there is a consensus that a biopsychosocial approach is required and that a unified philosophy of brain and mind is the best way to locate dystonia in the neurology-psychiatry borderland. At a practical level, movement disorder neurologists are best placed to differentiate organic from functional dystonia.

General linear models were used to estimate service costs and the likelihood of institutional admission.\nPatients supported by high integration teams received services costing an estimated 44% more than comparable patients in low integration teams. However, after controlling for case mix, no significant differences were found in the likelihood of admission to mental health inpatient wards or care homes between team types.\nIntegrated mental health and social care teams appeared to facilitate greater access to community care services, but no consequent association was found with community tenure.

This paper argues first, that an experienced-based approach, moving beyond epidemiology, is needed in order to enable more fine-grained understandings of the city/psychosis nexus. The second part of the paper presents preliminary fieldwork results based on video-elicitation sessions with first-episode patients with psychotic disorders. These results lead to the generation of a series of hypotheses for further research on the role of density, sensory overload and social interaction as factors in the onset of non-affective psychoses. The conclusion discusses the insights gained from viewing the city as an experiential milieu rather than as a set of substances. We argue that such insights enable, on the one hand, observation of the role of specific places and situations - and thus to unpack 'the city'; and, on the other, to envisage the urban milieu as a nexus of possible sites of recovery."}, {"Title": "Changes in psychiatry residents' attitudes towards individuals with substance use disorders over the course of residency training.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry residents provide care for individuals diagnosed with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders (SUDs). Small studies have shown that clinicians in general possess negative attitudes towards these dually diagnosed individuals. This is a serious concern, as clinicians' stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with mental illnesses may have a particularly potent adverse impact on treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the attitudes of psychiatry residents towards individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia, multiple SUDs, co-occurring schizophrenia and SUDs, and major depressive disorder.\nA questionnaire was sent to psychiatry residents (N\u2009=\u2009159) around the country. It was comprised of two sections: (i) demographic information, which included information about level of training; and (ii) the 11-item Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) for individuals with the four different diagnoses.\nPsychiatry residents had more stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with diagnoses of SUDs with and without schizophrenia than towards those individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder alone. Senior residents possessed more negative attitudes towards individuals with SUDs than junior residents.\nThe attitudes of psychiatry residents' towards individuals with SUDs with and without schizophrenia were negative and were worse among senior residents. There were many potential reasons for these findings, including repeat negative experiences in providing care for these individuals.\nThe negative attitudes of psychiatry residents towards individuals with SUDs are worrisome. Future work is needed to better understand these attitudes and to develop interventions to improve them.

We compare the prescriptions of antipsychotics in terms of percentage of subjects under antipsychotics. For these patients, we measure average number of different antipsychotics prescribed during the hospital stay or on the exit prescription, the average daily dosage per patient, the presence or the absence of association of antipsychotics.\nWe show that the percentage of subjects under antipsychotics increased between 2008\u00a0and 2013\u00a0while the average dosage decreased in adult wards except in the geriatric psychiatry ward where the average dosage increased. There is no difference in the average number of different antipsychotics prescribed.

Fifty-four patients with severe mental disorders were included. The patients in the SRIT group could admit themselves as inpatients for up to 5 days for each admission with at least a 2 weeks pause between the admittances.\nTwenty out of 26 participants (77%) in the SRIT group used the SRIT for a median of 1.5 admissions and 5 inpatient days. With the exception of a somewhat larger number of admissions at the CMHC in the SRIT group, no significant differences were found between the two groups in days as inpatients, admissions, outpatient contacts or coercion. Both groups reduced their inpatients days by 40%.\nBoth the SRIT and the TAU groups reduced their use of services during the 12 months intervention period.

We examined whether continuing donepezil, or commencing memantine, is cost-effective for community-dwelling, moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease patients.\nCost-effectiveness analysis was based on a 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial. A total of 295 community-dwelling patients with moderate/severe Alzheimer's disease, already treated with donepezil, were randomised to: (i) continue donepezil; (ii) discontinue donepezil; (iii) discontinue donepezil and start memantine; or (iv) continue donepezil and start memantine.\nContinuing donepezil for 52\u2009weeks was more cost-effective than discontinuation, considering cognition, activities of daily living and health-related quality of life. Starting memantine was more cost-effective than donepezil discontinuation. Donepezil-memantine combined is not more cost-effective than donepezil alone.\nRobust evidence is now available to inform clinical decisions and commissioning strategies so as to improve patients' lives whilst making efficient use of available resources. Clinical guidelines for treating moderate/severe Alzheimer's disease, such as those issued by NICE in England and Wales, should be revisited. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

It is one of the most frequent chronic childhood disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of behavioural problems in children with enuresis.\nThe research compared 30 children aged between 7 and 11 years who had consulted to Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Prof. Dr. Mazhar Osman Mental Health and Neurological Diseases Training and Research Hospital, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics and diagnosed with enuresis with their 30 peers who were randomly selected from a state elementary school. The Child Behaviour Checklist was applied to both groups.\nThe subdimension scores of both groups were compared, it was observed that children with enuresis had higher scores compared to their peers in all sub-tests except for the Sluggish Cognitive Tempo, Anxiety Disorders, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder sub-tests. Enuretic children had higher scores in externalizing (p<0.001), internalizing (p=0.001) and total problem (p<0.001) scales.\nThe results of this study indicate that children with enuresis exhibit behavioral problems with a higher rate compared to their healthy peers. The results are in line with the literature. Moreover, compered to the results of the studies conducted in different countries, significantly higher scores in internalizing problems were obtained. It was thought is possible that this might be related with cultural factors.

Probably Not, But Caution Required.", "Abstract": "Paroxetine, also known by the trade names Aropax, Paxil, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin and Brisdelle, was first marketed in the U.S. in 1992. Effective for major depression and various anxiety disorders, it quickly gained a sizable share of the antidepressant prescription market. By the late 1990s, paroxetine frequently was being associated with serious drug interactions and medication side effects. Most significantly, in a major Canadian epidemiological study examining the relationship between antidepressants and diseases, paroxetine was associated with a 620 percent increase in the rate of breast cancer in women who had taken it over a four-year period. Though re-analyses of this investigation discounted the magnitude of these findings, other studies have associated paroxetine with numerous side effects and adverse events not reported in clinical trials. Among these are effects on male fertility, birth defects, gestational hypertension, prolonged QT interval in infants, hyperprolactinemia, cognitive impairment in the elderly, autism, sexual side effects, weight gain, and suicidality, aggression, and akathisia in children and adolescents. Paroxetine has the highest inhibitory constant for the P450 2D6 isoenzyme of all antidepressants (Ki = 0.065-4.65 micromoles). This high affinity explains its high inhibitory interaction profile with substrates for 2D6. Paroxetine's potent 2D6 inhibition also implies that significant inhibition of the metabolism of 2D6 carcinogen substrates occurs which implies an increased probability of oncogenesis. Through 2D6 inhibition, tamoxifen metabolism is inhibited, which has been found to increase the risk of dying from breast cancer over a five-year period in women on both medications. Paroxetine also is a potent inhibitor of 3A4 with multiple 3A4 substrate interactions. Paroxetine has the highest known affinity for the serotonin transporter (0.13 nanomoles) of any currently used antidepressant. These characteristics and their potential negative consequences along with other adverse effects are considered and weighed against paroxetine's efficacious antidepressant and anxiolytic effects."}, {"Title": "A Prospective Surveillance of Pharmacovigilance of Psychotropic Medicines in a Developing Country.", "Abstract": "Psychotropic drugs are associated with significant short-term and long-term safety issues which may affect patients' mental health, physical health and cost of care.\nThis was a prospective study conducted in psychiatry department of a tertiary care hospital.

For other common disorders or psychopathological phenomena like disruptive behavior, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or autism, data on efficacy and safety are much scarcer. This selective review aims to provide an overview about current psychopharmacological interventions in child and adolescent psychiatry. The literature indicates either a lower efficacy than other interventions or less beneficial effects compared to possible adverse events in these cases. Most guidelines recommend psychopharmacotherapy in children to be embedded in a psychosocial or therapeutic intervention plan. Decision for medication depends on the severity of symptoms, chronicity, and, most important, impairment of the child in academic performance, family relationships, and everyday life. The high rates of off-label use in the age group of children are often due to a lack of market authorization studies less indicative of low efficacy.

A consensus paper of the German Association of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGPPN) explains four possible scenarios of manifestation of such kind of damage, corresponding to somatic illnesses: evidence of structural brain lesions (rare), subjective suffering (sufficient, but not necessary), impairment of functioning in important areas of life, and severe impairment of social participation (e.\u200ag. by dangerous behaviour against others).

Although LAIs are typically used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia, recent research has suggested that they may also provide an effective treatment strategy for patients with early-phase or first-episode disease. In October 2015, a group of 8 experts on the management of schizophrenia and LAIs met to evaluate the evidence surrounding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of LAIs and to develop practical recommendations regarding the clinical use, education, and unmet needs related to LAIs. Participants were also asked to rate the importance of several patient characteristics when choosing an LAI versus an oral antipsychotic, from the perspectives of 4 different stakeholder groups: patients, health care professionals, families, and payers. The evidence review demonstrated that LAIs are superior to placebo for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and, in general, appear to be similar to one another in terms of schizophrenia relapse prevention. Study design impacts the demonstrated efficacy of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics, but recent database and randomized controlled studies favor the use of LAIs in early-phase schizophrenia patients. LAIs vary considerably in their propensity to cause certain adverse effects, including weight gain, metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, and prolactin elevation, and these differences can be used to help guide LAI selection. Some studies, but not all, have demonstrated significant reductions in health care utilization or overall costs with LAIs. The expert panel identified several barriers to LAI use in current practice, including clinician lack of knowledge, negative attitudes about LAIs, and resource and cost issues. The participants also identified a number of additional factors that should be considered when weighing the use of LAI therapy, including medication adherence, relapse risk and severity, cognitive impairment, ease of use, substance misuse, access and cost, stigma, social support, patient autonomy, control over medication dosing, fear of needles, and the potential for patient harm due to relapses and associated loss of functioning. This evidence review, discussion, and summary recommendations may help clinicians, patients, families, payers, and other stakeholders to better characterize the role of LAIs in the treatment of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "\"Psychosis-predictive value of self-reported schizotypy in a clinical high-risk sample\": Correction to Fl\u00fcckiger et al.

Schimmelmann, Joachim Klosterk\u00f6tter and Frauke Schultze-Lutter (<i>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</i>, Advanced Online Publication, Sep 1, 2016, np). In the article, there was an error in the Author Note. The affiliation of Daniela Hubl was incorrectly listed as \"University Hospital of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern.\" It should have been listed as \"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern.\" All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-41994-001.) Schizotypy is considered an indicator of psychosis-proneness and therefore, a precursor to schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis. In the early detection of psychosis, the widely used ultra high-risk criteria refer to the positive features of schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorders (SPD). In clinical high risk (CHR) samples, self-reported or clinically assessed SPD, notably the lack of close friends, has been suggested to facilitate the prediction of psychosis. In community samples, self-reported schizotypy has mainly been assessed psychometrically using the 4 Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales (WSS; Chapman, Chapman, Kwapil, Eckbald, & Zinser, 1994), and the positive schizotypy dimension was consistently predictive of psychosis (Debban\u00e9 et al., 2015). However, psychometrically assessed schizotypy has not yet been studied as a potential predictor of psychosis in CHR samples. To bridge this gap, we studied the psychosis-predictive value of 3 of the WSSs and their association with CHR state in a clinical sample. One hundred 28 patients (23 \u00b1 7 years; 81% considered CHR) from 2 early detection services were followed for 12 to 101 months. Within 48 months, 36 (28.1%) converted to psychosis. Only physical anhedonia was associated with CHR state, and high scores for physical anhedonia were predictive of conversion in conjunction with the CHR state. Physical anhedonia rather than positive schizotypy scales might separate future converters from nonconverters in clinical samples already presenting a phenomenologically more extreme range on the psychosis continuum. Given their reported psychosis-predictive value in nonclinical samples, psychometric schizotypy measures in general might be useful for the initial screening of psychosis-proneness in the community, whereas physical anhedonia might be particularly useful in CHR samples."}, {"Title": "Workplace violence in different settings and among various health professionals in an Italian general hospital: a cross-sectional study.", "Abstract": "Workplace violence (WPV) against health professionals is a global problem with an increasing incidence.

Within the penological context, cases such as Washington v. Harper, Riggins v. Nevada, and Sell v. United States established the framework for determining when antipsychotic medication may be forcibly administered. Medication decisions under the Sell and Riggins cases are to be approved at judicial hearings; whereas, administrative hearings are sufficient for Harper cases. Forensic psychiatrists are also given responsibility in making the legal decision of whether or not to forcibly treat a patient with psychotropic medication against his will. In making this critical decision, a significant factor that is often minimized is the cultural background of the patient. The purpose of this paper is to present cultural factors to be considered in forced medication. Focusing on the culture defense argument, a review of how the legal system has dealt with cultural implications of a case will be presented. This paper will then discuss cultural issues embedded in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric patients by forensic psychiatrists who are called upon to make the decision of whether or not to force medicate a patient against his will. Lastly, recommendations and a framework for providing a culturally sensitive assessment during the decision to forcibly medicate a patient with psychotropic medication will be offered."}, {"Title": "Gender Distribution Among American Board of Medical Specialties Boards of Directors.", "Abstract": "Since 1995, women have comprised more than 40% of all medical school graduates.

Gender representation among the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) boards of directors (BODs) has not previously been evaluated. Our objective was to determine the relative representation of women on ABMS BODs and compare it with the in-training and in-practice gender composition of the respective specialties. The composition of the ABMS BODs was obtained from websites in March 2016 for all Member Boards. Association of American Medical Colleges and American Medical Association data were utilized to identify current and future trends in gender composition. Although represented by a common board, neurology and psychiatry were evaluated separately because of their very different practices and gender demographic characteristics. A total of 25 specialties were evaluated. Of the 25 specialties analyzed, 12 BODs have proportional gender representation compared with their constituency. Seven specialties have a larger proportion of women serving on their boards compared with physicians in practice, and 6 specialties have a greater proportion of men populating their BODs. Based on the most recent trainee data (2013), women have increasing workforce representation in almost all specialties. Although women in both training and practice are approaching equal representation, there is variability in gender ratios across specialties.

In psychiatry, major challenges include the relative subtlety by which neural circuits are perturbed, and the limited understanding of how basic circuit functions relate to thought and behavior. Neurodevelopmental disorders offer a window to addressing the first challenge given their strong genetic underpinnings, which can be linked to biological mechanisms. Such links have benefited from genetic modeling in the mouse, and in this review we highlight how this small mammal is now allowing us to crack neural circuits as well. We review recent studies of mouse thalamus, discussing how they revealed general principles that may underlie human perception and attention. Controlling the magnitude (gain) of thalamic sensory responses is a mechanism of attention, and the mouse has enabled its functional dissection at an unprecedented resolution. Further, modeling human genetic neurodevelopmental disease in the mouse has shown how diminished thalamic gain control can lead to attention deficits. This breaks new ground in how we untangle the complexity of psychiatric diseases; by making thalamic circuits accessible to mechanistic dissection; the mouse has not only taught us how they fundamentally work, but also how their dysfunction can be precisely mapped onto behavioral and cognitive deficits. Future studies promise even more progress, with the hope that principled targeting of identified thalamic circuits can be uniquely therapeutic."}, {"Title": "Spontaneous neural activity in the right superior temporal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus is associated with insight level in obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Insight into illness is an important issue for psychiatry disorder.

LLD showed a trend of lower thickness in the left insular region (p < 0.001 uncorrected). In addition, the structural network of LLD was characterized by greater segregation, particularly showing higher transitivity (i.e., measure of clustering) and modularity (i.e., tendency for a network to be organized into subnetworks). It was also less robust against random failure and targeted attacks. Despite relative cortical preservation, the topology of the LLD network showed significant changes particularly in segregation. These findings demonstrate the potential for graph theoretical approaches to complement conventional structural imaging analyses and provide novel insights into the heterogeneous etiology and pathogenesis of LLD."}, {"Title": "Connectome Disconnectivity and Cortical Gene Expression in Patients With Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified several common risk loci for schizophrenia (SCZ). In parallel, neuroimaging studies have shown consistent findings of widespread white matter disconnectivity in patients with SCZ.\nWe examined the role of genes in brain connectivity in patients with SCZ by combining transcriptional profiles of 43 SCZ risk genes identified by the recent genome-wide association study of the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with data on macroscale connectivity reductions in patients with SCZ. Expression profiles of 43 Psychiatric Genomics Consortium SCZ risk genes were extracted from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, and their average profile across the cortex was correlated to the pattern of cortical disconnectivity as derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of patients with SCZ (n = 48) and matched healthy controls (n = 43).\nThe expression profile of SCZ risk genes across cortical regions was significantly correlated with the regional macroscale disconnectivity (r = .588; p = .017). In addition, effects were found to be potentially specific to SCZ, with transcriptional profiles not related to cortical disconnectivity in patients with bipolar I disorder (diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data; 216 patients, 144 controls). Further examination of correlations across all 20,737 genes present in the Allen Human Brain Atlas showed the set of top 100 strongest correlating genes to display significant enrichment for the disorder, potentially identifying new genes involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ.\nOur results suggest that under disease conditions, cortical areas with pronounced expression of risk genes implicated in SCZ form central areas for white matter disconnectivity."}, {"Title": "Freud's hysteria and its legacy.", "Abstract": "Though Freud was himself interested in neurologic disorders, the model of hysteria he developed - of the repression of painful experiences, and their conversion into physical symptoms - made the disorder psychiatric, as the increasingly complex explanations came to rely on the \"meaning\" of events, which could not easily be understood neurologically. This evolved to become a prototype for psychiatric illness more broadly, a model which, though challenged by the First World War, enjoyed great success, notably in the USA, dominating psychiatric thinking for most of the 20th century. Concerns about the empiric basis for his ideas latterly led to a rapid decline in their importance, however, exemplified by 1980's \"etiologically neutral\" DSM-III. Hysteria, now renamed conversion disorder, retained its Freudian explanation for another 30 years, but as psychiatry lost its faith in Freud, so psychiatrists stopped seeing the disorder he had made theirs, and returned it once more to neurology."}, {"Title": "Functional auditory disorders.", "Abstract": "There are a number of auditory symptom syndromes that can develop without an organic basis. Some of these, such as nonorganic hearing loss, affect populations similar to those presenting with functional somatosensory and motor symptoms, while others, such as musical hallucination, affect populations with a significantly different demographic and require different treatment strategies. Many of these conditions owe their origin to measurably abnormal peripheral sensory pathology or brain network activity, but their pathological impact is often due, at least in part, to overamplification of the salience of these phenomena. For each syndrome, this chapter briefly outlines a definition, demographics, investigations, putative mechanisms, and treatment strategies. Consideration is given to what extent they can be considered to have a functional basis. Treatments are in many cases pragmatic and rudimentary, needing more work to be done in integrating insights from behavioral and cognitive psychology to auditory neuroscience. The audiology literature has historically equated the term functional with malingering, although this perception is, thankfully, slowly changing. These disorders transcend the disciplines of audiology, otorhinolaryngology, neurology and psychiatry, and a multidisciplinary approach is often rewarding."}, {"Title": "Neurologic approaches to hysteria, psychogenic and functional disorders from the late 19th century onwards.", "Abstract": "The history of functional neurologic disorders in the 20th century from the point of view of the neurologist is U-shaped. A flurry of interest between the 1880s and early 1920s gave way to lack of interest, skepticism, and concern about misdiagnosis. This was mirrored by increasing professional and geographic divisions between neurology and psychiatry after the First World War. In the 1990s the advent of imaging and other technology highlighted the positive nature of a functional diagnosis. Having been closer in the early 20th century but later more separate, these disorders are now once again the subject of academic and clinical interest, although arguably still very much on the fringes of neurology and neuropsychiatry. Revisiting older material provides a rich source of ideas and data for today's clinical researcher, but also offers cautionary tales of theories and treatments that led to stagnation rather than advancement of the field. Patterns of treatment do have a habit of repeating themselves, for example, the current enthusiasm for transcranial magnetic stimulation compared to the excitement about electrotherapy in the 19th century. For these reasons, an understanding of the history of functional disorders in neurology is arguably more important than it is for other areas of neurologic practice."}, {"Title": "Independent or Integrated?

Nevertheless, the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is still poorly understood. This study investigated differences in the functional connectivity of intrinsic amygdala-based networks of participants with and without AD. Resting state fMRI data were obtained from 18 participants with an AD and 19 healthy comparison individuals. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed using standardized structured interviews. The comparison between groups was carried out using functional connectivity maps from six seed regions defined using probabilistic maps bilaterally within the amygdala (basolateral, superficial and centromedial amygdala). We found significant between-group differences in five clusters, which showed aberrant functional connectivity with the left basolateral amygdala: right precentral gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, bilateral precuneus, and right superior frontal gyrus in subjects with AD as compared with the comparison subjects. For the comparison subjects, the correlations between the amygdala and the five clusters were either non-significant, or negative. The present study suggests there is an intrinsic disruption in the communication between left basolateral amygdala and a network of brain regions involved with emotion regulation, and with the default mode network in adolescents and young adults with anxiety disorders."}, {"Title": "Subthreshold and threshold attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in childhood: psychosocial outcomes in adolescence in boys and girls.", "Abstract": "To examine the association between different levels of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and sex differences in psychosocial outcomes during adolescence.\nSwedish children (n = 4635) were screened for neuropsychiatric symptoms at age 9 or 12. ADHD symptoms were divided into three levels: screen-negative, screen-intermediate, and screen-positive. At follow-up (age 15), parents and teenagers filled out questionnaires regarding (i) hyperactivity/inattention, (ii) peer problems, (iii) school problems, (iv) internalizing problems, (v) antisocial behaviour, (vi) alcohol misuse, and (vii) drug misuse. All outcomes were controlled for symptoms of diagnostic categories other than ADHD.\nIncreasing levels of ADHD symptoms in childhood were associated with higher proportions of adolescents who displayed negative psychosocial outcomes. More girls than boys reported internalizing problems (all levels) and risky drug use (screen-intermediate and screen-positive only). More boys reported antisocial behaviour at the screen-negative and screen-intermediate levels, but at the screen-positive level, similar proportions of girls and boys displayed antisocial behaviour.\nThe findings support the view that ADHD symptoms, as well as their negative outcomes, are dimensionally distributed in the population and that adolescent girls and boys display different risk profiles.

This review provides both quantitative and qualitative synthesis of research conducted since the last comprehensive review in 2006, with the aim of identifying reasons for these discrepancies that might provide fruitful avenues for future exploration. Meta-analysis found a small but significant association between SCCs and objective cognitive function, although it was limited by large heterogeneity between studies and evidence of potential publication bias. Often, assessments of SCCs and objective cognitive function were brief or not formally validated. However, studies that employed more comprehensive SCC measures tended to find that SCCs were associated independently with both objective cognitive function and depressive symptoms. Further explicit investigation of how assessment measures relate to reports of SCCs, and the validity of the proposed 'compensation theory' of SCC aetiology, is recommended."}, {"Title": "Reversible Valproic Acid-Induced Parkinsonism and Cognitive Impairment in an Elderly Patient With Bipolar Disorder I.", "Abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. VPA is also used off-label to treat other conditions in psychiatry such as impulse control disorders, major depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although VPA is mostly well-tolerated, common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neurological symptoms (sedation, ataxia, tremor), weight gain, and alopecia. Less common adverse effects include VPA-induced parkinsonism and cognitive impairment. We describe a patient who developed parkinsonism and cognitive impairment eight years after starting divalproex sodium for bipolar disorder, type I. Over time, the patient's parkinsonian symptoms progressed, and the motor symptoms were partially responsive to carbidopa/levodopa. Her mild cognitive impairment was, for the most part, stable on donepezil. Rapid discontinuation of divalproex sodium resolved the parkinsonian symptoms as well as the cognitive impairment. A brief review of the literature regarding VPA-induced parkinsonism and cognitive impairment in adults is included. Given the reversible nature and potential severity of VPA-induced parkinsonism, improved recognition in psychiatric populations is critical, particularly after extended VPA exposure.

This constitutes a maj\u00f6r obstacle for those patients in coping with their disease, managing their care, and hence regulating their lives. Although studies carried out in Turkey document the presence of stigma, they provide limited information about the ways for solving this problem. Drawing on the litrature, the present study investigated the effect of medical education on stigmatization.\nDuring 2008/2009 academic year, 106 freshmen who were majoring in the Medical School at Celal Bayar University volunteered to participate in the present study. Participants have not yet received any theoretical or practical training on psychiatry. At the beginning of the study, they were informed about the purpose of the study and accordingly requested to fill a consent form. The 32-item schizophrenia subscale of the Attitude Questionnaire developed by Psychiatric Investigations and Education Center (PAREM) was administered to the participants. Along with the questionnaire, they were also requested demographic information. After 5 years, the participants who completed their psychiatry internship were reassessed with the same instrument.\n106 volunteers participated in the present study. The majority of the participants were females (54.7%) with equal balance of income and expidentures (65.1%) having a mental disease percentage of 5.6%. Findings showed that students' attitudes towards schizophrenic patients changed significantly positive as they proceed from first year to the fifth year. Results demonstrated that as students move through the years they report more positive attitudes in the areas of etiology of schizophrenia (p<0.01), treatment options (p<0.01), approach to schizophrenic patients (p<0.01), and social interactions (p<0.01).\nWe claim that the development of positive attitudes should be integrated in to the mental health curriculum not only in particular years but also throughout the whole years of education. Along this continuum, we believe that students would become more aware of the needs of the schizophrenic patients and gain an on going intuition toward the difficulties that the patients encounter. Viewed together, at the stage of acquiring medical/psychological skills students should be given the opportunity to have direct contact with patients in order to give adequate response to patients' needs and thus observe the improvement at the end of the treatment."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Changes in Anxiety and Depression Symptoms, and Sexual Functions in Patients Receiving Antidepressants: 3 Months-Long Naturalistic Follow-Up Study.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to study the change in sexual functions within 3 months period following the initiation of antidepressant treatment in psychiatry outpatients, and its relationship with the change in anxiety and depression symptoms.\nEighty two patients, who consecutively applied to the psychiatry outpatient clinic and who were prescribed antidepressants, were included in the study. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, General Assessment of Functioning Scale and Arizona Sexual Experience Questionnaire (ASEC) were administered to the patients at the first interview, then repeated on a monthly basis during 3 months.\nFifty seven of the patients (69.50 %) has been diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions prior to the antidepressant treatment. During the third month after the antidepressant treatment, 24 patients in this group (42.11%) showed no impairment in ASEC scores, whereas 33 patients' (57.89%) scores were still at impairment level. Eight patients out of 25 (32%) who weren't diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions prior to the treatment were later diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions. Sexual dysfunctions correlated with patients' level of functioning, separately from anxiety and depression symptoms.\nOur study results show that the sexual dysfunction rate is quite high in psychiatric patients population. However, sexual dysfunctions rate which can be related to antidepressant treatment is 36%. It would be appropriate for clinicians to determine benefit-loss balance by considering patients' mental syndromes together with sexual functions."}, {"Title": "Common epigenetic variation in a European population of mentally healthy young adults.", "Abstract": "DNA methylation represents an important link between structural genetic variation and complex phenotypes.

We specifically addressed the challenge of defining the best location for the recording of P3a and P3b components and selecting the best reference to use by investigating the effect of an o\ufb04ine re-reference procedure on recorded bimodal P3a and P3b. Forty young and healthy subjects were submitted to a bimodal (synchronized and always congruent visual and auditory stimuli) three-stimulus oddball task in which 140 frequent bimodal stimuli, 30 deviant \"target\" stimuli and 30 distractors were presented. Task consisted in clicking as soon as possible on the targets, and not paying attention to frequent stimuli and distractors. This procedure allowed us to record, for each individual, the P3a component, referring to the novelty process related to distractors processing, and the P3b component, linked to the processing of the target stimuli. Results showed that both P3a and P3b showed maximal amplitude in Pz. However, P3a displayed a more central distribution. Nose reference was also shown to give maximal amplitudes compared with average and linked mastoids references. These data were discussed in light of the necessity to develop multi-site recording guidelines to furnish sets of ERPs data comparable across laboratories."}, {"Title": "Social neuroscience: undoing the schism between neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Multiple disorders once jointly conceived as \"nervous diseases\" became segregated by the distinct institutional traditions forged in neurology and psychiatry. As a result, each field specialized in the study and treatment of a subset of such conditions. Here we propose new avenues for interdisciplinary interaction through a triangulation of both fields with social neuroscience. To this end, we review evidence from five relevant domains (facial emotion recognition, empathy, theory of mind, moral cognition, and social context assessment), highlighting their common disturbances across neurological and psychiatric conditions and discussing their multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. Our proposal is anchored in multidimensional evidence, including behavioral, neurocognitive, and genetic findings. From a clinical perspective, this work paves the way for dimensional and transdiagnostic approaches, new pharmacological treatments, and educational innovations rooted in a combined neuropsychiatric training. Research-wise, it fosters new models of the social brain and a novel platform to explore the interplay of cognitive and social functions.

Seventy-three patients were admitted with recent or previous nasal trauma or nasal deformity. The first group of 32 were children and adolescents from 6-14 years old who were admitted to our hospital because of recent nasal trauma. The second group of 41 children and adolescents from 6-14 years old were admitted to our hospital because of previous nasal trauma, which was not treated on time, or it was not treated properly. They were admitted to our clinic for surgical intervention septo/rhinoplasty. The second group of patients fills the brief psychological questioner prepared by Clinical psychiatrist from University Clinic of Psychiatry, in Skopje, and their psychological reactions were taken into consideration.\nEleven of the children and adolescents who had nasal fracture without dislocation, who have no symptoms, minimal swelling, and no septal deviation or hematoma, were observed with a specific follow-up: 3 days after nasal fracture, then every week in the first month, after 1 month, and after 3 months period. Sixteen of children and adolescents who had a nasal fracture with subluxation of nasal septum were operated with closed reduction (repositio nasi) under general anaesthesia. The others with septal hematomas and subperichondrial abscess were treated as in adults' patients. The second group of 41 children and adolescents from 6-14 years old consisted with with the previous nasal trauma which was not treated on time or it was improperly treated. In 24 (58.54%) of these patients septoplasty was performed and in 17 (41.46%) was performed rhino septoplasty.\nOften, difficult septal deformations in children are followed with deformation of the nasal pyramid (rhino scoliosis, rhino lordosis). In those cases, we cannot solve septal pathology without nasal pyramid intervention in the same time and opposite. Clinical reports have not produced solid evidence for the statement that septal surgery has no negative effect on nasal growth or can serve for correcting abnormal growth.

The baseline characteristics of the patients (age, sex, Global Assessment of Functioning score, Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness score, education, occupation, marital status, duration of treatment, and prior treatment history), treating psychiatrist experience in years, and sex concordance between the patients and their treating psychiatrists were analyzed using Cox regression models.\nFrom among 1,626 eligible new patients during the study period, 532 patients were enrolled in the study (F3: n=176; F4: n=356). The dropout rate was 35.7%, which was similar to that of previous studies. Higher educational level, being married, and lower Global Assessment of Functioning scores were associated with a lower dropout rate. Although psychiatrist experience was not significantly associated with patient dropout in the multivariate analysis, patients treated by less experienced psychiatrists had a higher hazard ratio for dropout (1.31; 95% confidence interval: 0.94-1.85).\nIn order to reduce the dropout rate, special focus should be placed on patients with the factors identified in this study, and young psychiatrists should undergo further education to foster adherence."}, {"Title": "Socio-demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients who Attempt Suicide: A Hospital-based Study from Eastern India.", "Abstract": "Suicide has become an important public health concern with a high number of deaths and increasing number of attempted suicides every year.

There are well-known risk factors for criminal behaviour in the general population, yet knowledge of what predicts reconviction in the Swedish forensic population in the long-term perspective is still insufficient.\nThe study aims to (1) describe background and clinical characteristics of forensic psychiatric patients in a 10-year follow-up, (2) analyse risk factors associated with recidivism, and (3) test the predictive validity of risk factors for general and violent criminality.\nDetailed information on all offenders from the Malm\u00f6 University Hospital catchment area sentenced to forensic psychiatric in-patient treatment from 1999-2005 (n\u2009=\u2009125) was collected. Court decisions were collected up until the end of 2008 (median follow-up time\u2009=\u20096.2 years, range\u2009=\u20090.6-9.7 years).\nRelapse in general crime (n\u2009=\u200930) was predicted by low educational attainment, mental disorder in a first degree relative, and low age at first sentenced crime. Relapse in violent crime (n\u2009=\u200916) was predicted by low educational attainment and low GAF scores. Patients with a restriction order were less likely to relapse in both crime categories.\nSigns of childhood adversities together with early debut in criminality appeared as important risk factors for general and violent recidivism. Forensic psychiatric treatment combined with a restriction order was demonstrated as a protective factor against recidivism, suggesting that the risk of recidivism is strongly related to the level of supervision. Although the low number of recidivism cases is highly desirable, it unfortunately reduces the power of the analyses in this paper."}, {"Title": "Kappa-Opioid Antagonists for Psychiatric Disorders: From Bench to Clinical Trials.", "Abstract": "Kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists are currently being considered for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including depressive, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. A general ability to mitigate the effects of stress, which can trigger or exacerbate these conditions, may explain their putative efficacy across such a broad array of conditions. The discovery of their potentially therapeutic effects evolved from preclinical research designed to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which experience causes neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key element of brain reward circuitry. This research established that exposure to drugs of abuse or stress increases the activity of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) in the NAc, which leads to elevated expression of the opioid peptide dynorphin that in turn causes core signs of depressive- and anxiety-related disorders. Disruption of KORs-the endogenous receptors for dynorphin-produces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like actions in screening procedures that identify standard drugs of these classes, and reduces stress effects in tests used to study addiction and stress-related disorders. Although interest in this target is high, prototypical KOR antagonists have extraordinarily persistent pharmacodynamic effects that complicate clinical trials. The development of shorter acting KOR antagonists together with more rapid designs for clinical trials may soon provide insight on whether these drugs are efficacious as would be predicted by preclinical work. If successful, KOR antagonists would represent a unique example in psychiatry where the therapeutic mechanism of a drug class is understood before it is shown to be efficacious in humans."}, {"Title": "Methylene Blue: The Long and Winding Road From Stain to Brain: Part 2.", "Abstract": "Methylene blue was the first synthetic drug ever used in medicine, having been used to treat clinical pain syndromes, malaria, and psychotic disorders more than one century ago. Methylene blue is a cationic thiazine dye with redox-cycling properties and a selective affinity for the nervous system. This drug also inhibits the activity of monoamine oxidase, nitric oxide synthase, and guanylyl cyclase, as well as tau protein aggregation; increases the release of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine; reduces amyloid-beta levels; and increases cholinergic transmission. The action of methylene blue on multiple cellular and molecular targets justifies its investigation in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Investigations of methylene blue were instrumental in the serendipitous development of phenothiazine antipsychotic drugs. Although chlorpromazine is heralded as the first antipsychotic drug used in psychiatry, methylene blue is a phenothiazine drug that had been used to treat psychotic patients half a century earlier. It has also been studied in bipolar disorder and deserves further investigation for the treatment of unipolar and bipolar disorders.

This approach can reconcile psychiatry's perspective with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities. Coercive treatment can be justified only when a patient's capacity to consent is substantially impaired and severe danger to health or life cannot be prevented by less intrusive means. In this case, withholding treatment can violate the principle of justice. In the case of danger to others, social exclusion and loss of freedom can be seen as harming psychosocial health, which can justify coercive treatment. Considerable efforts are required to support patients' informed decisions and avoid allowing others to make substitute decisions. Mental disorder alone without impaired capacity does not justify involuntary treatment, which can be considered a misuse of psychiatry.

Patients with PNES are high utilizers of health care and can have disability levels similar to those of patients with epilepsy. PNES is a common, complex neuropsychiatric somatoform disorder at the interface of neurology and psychiatry disciplines and is largely overlooked and avoided by mental health providers. Despite advances in establishing accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatments, recent knowledge about PNES has not been well translated into clinical practice. Long diagnostic delays have been associated with poor prognosis. Recent advances in possible neurophysiological biomarkers include functional MRI studies that show abnormalities in emotional, cognitive, executive, and sensorimotor neurocircuits. Although the gold standard for diagnosis is video electroencephalograph, this test is underused by psychiatrists. The International League Against Epilepsy proposed a staged approach to PNES diagnosis using history, semiologic features, and EEG. Thorough psychiatric assessment can identify relevant biopsychosocial and predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors, as well as assess the comorbid psychiatric disorders, which can inform a treatment plan. Clear and thoughtful delivery of diagnosis is the first step in treatment. Regular follow-up with the patient's neurologist, in addition to treatment by mental health professionals familiar with somatic symptom disorders, is recommended. Psychotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, and randomized clinical trials using cognitive-behavioral therapies reveal significant reduction in seizures and other psychiatric symptoms. After centuries, mental health providers now have access to the tools to diagnose and effectively treat PNES and other conversion disorders."}, {"Title": "[Using the cumulative odds Logit model to explore the application of the questionnaire derived from PANSS].", "Abstract": "Currently, aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone are three anti-psychiatry agents commonly used in the treatment of schizophrenia.

This paper reviews the four new principles in DSM-5: 1) A spectrum (also called \"dimensional\") approach to the definition of mental illness; 2) recognition of the role played by environmental risk factors related to stress and trauma in predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating mental illness; 3) cultural relativism in diagnosis and treatment of mental illness; and 4) recognizing the adverse effects of psychiatric medications on patients. Each of these four principles will be addressed in detail. In addition, four major implications for health care organizations and mental health policy are identified as: 1) prevention; 2) client-centered psychiatry; 3) mental health workers retraining; and 4) medical insurance reform. We conclude that DSM- 5's new approach to diagnosis and treatment of mental illness will have profound implications for health care organizations and mental health policy, indicating a greater emphasis on prevention and cure rather than long-term management of symptoms."}, {"Title": "Patterns of Psychiatric Outpatient Practice in Taiwan: A Nationwide Survey.", "Abstract": "(1) Background: Limited studies have utilized nationwide data to assess the patterns of psychiatric practice in other countries.

The neuro-developmental processes that underpin the performance of neuro-psychomotor functions have not been widely explored, nor is it clear whether there are neuro-psychomotor functions specifically affected in ASD. Our objective was to focus on the semiology of motor disorders among children with ASD using a neuro-developmental assessment tool.\nThirty-four children with ASD, with or without intellectual deficit (ID) were recruited in a child psychiatry department and Autism Resource Centers. Initial standard evaluations for diagnosis (psychiatric; psychological; psychomotor) were supplemented by a standardized assessment battery for neuro-developmental psychomotor functions (NP-MOT).\nThe results of some NP-MOT tests differed between children with ASD with ID and those without. However, on the NP-MOT battery, neither of the two groups did well in the bi-manual and finger praxia tests (36 and 52% respectively failed). Manual and digital gnosopraxia showed some deficit (63 and 62% respectively failed). Postural deficits were found in tests for both static equilibrium (64%) and dynamic (52%). There were also difficulties in coordination between the upper and lower limbs in 58% of children. We found 75% failure in motor skills on the M-ABC test. Concerning muscular tone, significant laxity was observed in distal parts of the body (feet and hands), but hypertonia was observed in the proximal muscles of the lower limbs (reduced heel-ear angle).\nThe results of manual and digital gnosopraxia tests point to a planning deficit in children with autism. A gesture programming deficit is also highlighted by the poor results in manual praxis, and by failures in the M-ABC tests despite prior training of the child. However, concerning global motor function, a significant difference was observed between children with and without ID. Our findings suggest a semiology of tone deregulation between proximal versus distal muscles, indeterminate tonic laterality, postural control deficit (proprioceptive), impairment of inter-hemispheric coordination (corpus callosum), and neurological soft signs such asdysdiadochokinesia, which leads us to hypothesize a general impairment of motor functions."}, {"Title": "Correctional psychopharmacology: pitfalls, challenges, and victories of prescribing in a correctional setting.", "Abstract": "Mentally ill patients are entering the criminal justice system at alarming rates, representing a significant percentage of those incarcerated.

All patients who presented to the office during the postpartum period completed the EPDS questionnaire, in accordance to our usual practice. The delivery and outpatient records were reviewed for demographic data, EPDS scores and outcomes. Three groups of EPDS scoring were analyzed: <10 (low risk for PPD), 10-13 (borderline risk for PPD), and \u226514 (high risk for PPD).

An early EPDS score of <10 had a 92.7% probability of maintaining low risk screening (EPDS <10) at a later time.\nIn low risk women, there is good correlation between early and late EPDS scores and so these women may not need to be rescreened. Therefore, we should redirect the limited available resources from screening low risk women multiple times, towards provision of follow-up care for the smaller number of women at highest risk.

Our aim was to create an assessment tool to assess mother's views on contraception as part of the discharge planning process. We used a quantitative-qualitative approach. A clinician-guided questionnaire was completed by patients prior to their discharge from hospital and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore views regarding family planning in greater depth. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim onto Microsoft Word. Emerging themes were identified using a grounded theory thematic analysis approach. Eighteen inpatients were assessed at the Bethlem Mother and Baby Unit over a 4-month period (May-August 2015). Half of the women stated that the pregnancy was unplanned. The most common contraception methods used were condoms, followed by no method/natural cycle technique. Forty-four percent felt unsure of contraception options available and were keen for further advice and referral to family planning services. Interestingly, almost all the women interviewed stated that their experience of perinatal mental illness had changed their views on having more children. The contraception assessment tool is a short, simple questionnaire that can be adopted across inpatient and community settings. In cooperating family, planning into the discharge care plan could be protective in preventing future unplanned pregnancies in women at high risk of perinatal mental illness relapse. Performing the assessment also provided an added opportunity for psycho-education regarding reproductive health and medication use during the perinatal period.

The intensity of depression was statistically comparable in both groups. What distinguishes patients transiting emergencies is that their families and couples are more cohesive and adaptable. In this study, we compare both groups in terms of coping mechanisms and multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC).\nAll patients (N=2172) with a major depressive disorder admitted to our department between 01/01/2010 and 31/12/2012 are included in an open study. They completed the Beck's Depression Inventory, the Olson's Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale, visual analogue scales of stress, the ways of coping checklist, and the MHLC scale.\nPatients admitted through emergencies are found to have less belief in chance (CHLC) (t=2.488; p=0.014), distance themselves more from their problems (t=-2.187; p=0.03), but reappropriate them less positively (t=2.355; p=0.019) than those admitted through consultations. A logistic regression model including variables identified in the previous study (adaptability in the original family and the couple's lived stress) gives a risk factor (odds ratio) of 14.7 which means that a patient who would combine the different risk factors would be 14.7 times more likely to go through emergency.\nHow to explain that depressive patients with more favorable factors considered: to believe less in chance, distancing from their problems, and having a better family support, are more likely to go to the E.R.? We make the suggestion that those factors exactly slowed down patients in their care application at first, allowing the depression to worsen. It is only once they would have depleted their reserves that they would reach the emergency room on their own initiative or encouraged by their families, themselves overwhelmed by the situation.

In the present study, we compare among the same patients variables affecting the intensity of depression in each group.\nAll patients with Major depressive disorder admitted in our department through emergencies (N=146) or consultations (N=2172) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2012 were included in an open study. They completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), analogical visual scales about stress levels (in professional, social, family, married life, over the past year and the past month), the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control and the Olson Family Adaptation and Cohesion Scale and the Ways of coping.\nThe depression (t=1.438; p=0.90) is similar in both samples. Although some variables such as gender, internality, coping mechanisms and stress factors influence the intensity of depression in both groups of patients (linear regression p<0.000, r=0.593), other factors play a role only in either one or the other group. The factors of patients' age, number of children, elements of family dynamics, couple life, and the belief in luck do influence the intensity of depression only in patients hospitalized through Cdpt (linear regression p<0.000, r=0.366). The intensity of depression of patients admitted through ER, is specifically dependent on the number of collateral factors (p=0.045, r=0.304), the number of living relatives (p=0.036, r=0.276) and the belief in the power of others (p=0.022, r=-0.16).\nAlthough Both samples are comparable in terms of intensity of depression, patients admitted through the Cdpt are more dependent on the quality of family relationships whereas those coming from emergencies are most influenced by their concrete social and family situation. Alongside these specific variables it remains that stress and coping mechanisms account for the largest percentage of variance of the intensity of depression."}, {"Title": "Liaison psychiatry and bariatric surgery: double standards.

In clinical practice, a wide variety of liaison psychiatry assessment methods exist.\nOn the basis of a post-operative psychiatric comorbidity case report and a literature review on \"liaison psychiatry and bariatric surgery\" we aim to identify opportunities for the systematization of bariatric pre-surgery psychiatric evaluation.\nThe bariatric pre-surgery evaluation must be rigorous and founded on evidence-based medicine. On this basis, specific psychiatric criteria may be defined and researched in assessments. The issue remains for psychiatric comorbidities that develop after surgery and for which a preventive framework should be sustained in the liaison psychiatry approach.\nThe aim of the research is to support an improved systematization of the psychological assessments of pre-operative bariatric surgery candidates.

Integration in community, despite obvious benefits, led to increase in social distance and rejection towards mentally ill. Social stigma affects different life domains of those afflicted, and therefore it is crucial to introduce methods to deal with it. Our objective was to assess and compare psychiatrists' and public attitudes and beliefs about mentally ill people.\nComparison of two samples, one including 107 psychiatrists and second including 708 individuals of the general population. Obtained outcomes were collated with similar studies available in literature.\nThe psychiatrists' attitude was more positive in comparison to the general population. Both groups agree that programs raising public awareness are important, and should be intensified. 41% of general population and 13% of respondents from experts' group think of negative associations with mentally ill.\nConception of utilizing mental health experts as the opinion leaders should be carefully thought through. Although awareness of social distance and stigma improved both among psychiatrists and general population since 2005 (Wciorka & Wciorka 2006, Lauber 2004), still there are areas that needs enhancement.

The objective of this study was to increase the proportion of filled initial psychiatry appointments in an urban, hospital-based primary care practice.\nPatients were identified as having a high or low risk of missing their initial psychiatry appointments based on prior missed medical appointments. High-risk patients were referred to a walk-in clinic instead of a scheduled appointment. The primary outcome was ratio of filled appointments to booked appointments. We used a statistical process control chart (p chart) to measure improvement. Secondary outcomes were percentages of patients from historically underserved groups who received an initial psychiatry evaluation before and after the intervention.\nThe average ratio of filled to booked initial appointments increased from 59% to 77% after the intervention, and the p chart confirmed that this change represented special cause variation. No statistically significant demographic differences between the patients who received psychiatric evaluations before and after the intervention were found.\nMissed initial psychiatry appointments can be accurately predicted by prior missed medical appointments.

The objectives of the continuation phase were to assess safety and relapse rates in the longer term. The objective of this publication, under the Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials (RIAT) initiative, was to see whether access to and analysis of the previously unpublished dataset from the continuation phase of this randomized controlled trial would have clinically relevant implications for evidence-based medicine.\nThe study was an eight-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with a six month continuation phase. The setting was 12 North American academic psychiatry centres, from 20 April 1994 to 15 February 1998. 275 adolescents with major depression were originally enrolled in Study 329, with 190 completing the eight-week acute phase. Of these, 119 patients (43%) entered the six-month continuation phase (paroxetine n\u200a=\u200a49; imipramine n\u200a=\u200a39; placebo n\u200a=\u200a31), in which participants were continued on their current treatment, blinded. As per the protocol, we have looked at rates of relapse (based on Hamilton Depression Scale scores) across both acute and continuation phases, and generated a safety profile for paroxetine and imipramine compared with placebo for up to six months.ANOVA testing (generalized linear model) using a model including effects of site, treatment and site x treatment interaction was applied. Otherwise we used only descriptive statistics.\nOf patients entering the continuation phase, 15 of 49 for paroxetine (31%), 12 of 39 for imipramine (31%) and 12 of 31 for placebo (39%) completed as responders. Across the study, 25 patients on paroxetine relapsed (41% of those showing an initial response), 15 on imipramine (26%), and 10 on placebo (21%). In the continuation and taper phases combined there were 211 adverse events in the paroxetine group, 147 on imipramine and 100 on placebo. The taper phase had a higher proportion of severe adverse events per week of exposure than the acute phase, with the continuation phase having the fewest events.\nThe continuation phase did not offer support for longer-term efficacy of either paroxetine or imipramine. Relapse and adverse events on both active drugs open up the risks of a prescribing cascade. The previously largely unrecognised hazards of the taper phase have implications for prescribing practice and need further exploration."}, {"Title": "Practicing Psychoanalysis and Psychodynamic Psychotherapies in Developing Societies.", "Abstract": "Vital to the contemporary exercise of psychiatry is the biopsychosocial approach, with psychotherapy as its well-defined, and requisite, constituent. The key objectives of psychoanalysis and other related therapies are the amelioration of symptoms and modification of character by probing the unconscious. But the practice of psychoanalysis and similar insight-oriented techniques is in developing nations is different from developed countries due to cultural and educational reasons, along with a shortage of required facilities. The result often is ignorance of exploratory techniques and the substitution of approaches, such cognitive and behavior therapies, which operate at the conscious and subconscious levels of mind. Additionally, decreased implementation of psychotherapy by psychiatrists in industrialized countries may discourage its use by therapists in developing societies.

Diagnoses in psychiatry are also sometimes presented in clinical texts as if they pick out pathological processes that cause sets of symptoms. However, current evidence suggests the possibility that many diagnostic categories in psychiatry are highly causally heterogeneous. For example, major depressive disorder may not be associated with a single type of underlying pathological process, but with a range of different causal pathways, each involving complex interactions of various biological, psychological, and social factors. This paper explores the implications of causal heterogeneity for whether psychiatric diagnoses can be said to serve causal explanatory roles in clinical practice. I argue that while they may fall short of picking out a specific cause of the patient's symptoms, they can nonetheless supply different sorts of clinically relevant causal information. In particular, I suggest that some psychiatric diagnoses provide negative information that rules out certain causes, some provide approximate or disjunctive information about the range of possible causal processes, and some provide causal information about the relations between the symptoms themselves."}, {"Title": "[When a patient falls (asleep) and can't get up: conversion disorder - paraplegia following general anesthesia].", "Abstract": "This case report describes the rare occurrence of paraplegia caused by conversion disorder in a woman who received general anesthesia for breast surgery.\nA 46-year-old healthy woman received general anesthesia for excision of a left breast fibroepithelial lesion.

SP is characterized by altered motor, perceptual, emotional and cognitive functions, such as inability to perform voluntary movements, visual hallucinations, feelings of chest pressure, delusions about a frightening presence and, in some cases, fear of impending death. Most people experience SP rarely, but typically when sleeping in supine position; however, SP is considered a disease (parasomnia) when recurrent and/or associated to emotional burden. Interestingly, throughout human history, different peoples interpreted SP under a supernatural view. For example, Canadian Eskimos attribute SP to spells of shamans, who hinder the ability to move, and provoke hallucinations of a shapeless presence. In the Japanese tradition, SP is due to a vengeful spirit who suffocates his enemies while sleeping. In Nigerian culture, a female demon attacks during dreaming and provokes paralysis. A modern manifestation of SP is the report of \"alien abductions\", experienced as inability to move during awakening associated with visual hallucinations of aliens. In all, SP is a significant example of how a specific biological phenomenon can be interpreted and shaped by different cultural contexts. In order to further explore the ethnopsychology of SP, in this review we present the \"Pisadeira\", a character of Brazilian folklore originated in the country's Southeast, but also found in other regions with variant names. Pisadeira is described as a crone with long fingernails who lurks on roofs at night and tramples on the chest of those who sleep on a full stomach with the belly up. This legend is mentioned in many anthropological accounts; however, we found no comprehensive reference on the Pisadeira from the perspective of sleep science. Here, we aim to fill this gap. We first review the neuropsychological aspects of SP, and then present the folk tale of the Pisadeira. Finally, we summarize the many historical and artistic manifestations of SP in different cultures, emphasizing the similarities and differences with the Pisadeira."}, {"Title": "Religiousness and Mental Health: Systematic Review Study.", "Abstract": "Many people use religious beliefs and practices to cope with stressful life events and derive peace of mind and purpose in life.

(2) What are current recommendations for integration of PaC providers into a psychiatric team? and (3) What gaps exist in the literature?\nPubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched from the start of each database to July 9, 2014 using terms related to PaC providers and inpatient psychiatry. Two independent reviewers performed full-text reviews of each article identified by independent review of all titles/abstracts from the electronic search and by a hand search of articles included in reference lists. Inclusion criteria were: English-language article, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and focus on a PaC provider working in a psychiatric hospital setting. One author performed data extraction.\nForty-nine articles were identified by electronic (84%) and hand search (16%), 18 of which were evaluative studies: 5 qualitative and 13 quantitative. Most of the literature viewed integration of PaC providers in inpatient treatment teams as beneficial. Potential harms were noted and mitigation strategies suggested, including providing training to PaC providers concerning psychiatric illness, clearly defining roles, and enhancing team integration. None of the articles reported outcomes data.\nPsychiatric inpatients often have unmet spiritual needs. Although the literature suggests potential benefits of PaC providers for psychiatric inpatients, more rigorous studies are needed to establish these benefits as efficacious. The authors of this review recommend the cautious integration of PaC providers into the psychiatric inpatient care team."}, {"Title": "Sluggish Cognitive Tempo in a Child and Adolescent Clinical Outpatient Setting.", "Abstract": "Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms have largely emerged from investigations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent research has demonstrated the relevance of SCT symptoms in the field of clinical child and adolescent psychiatry. The goal of this research was to study the symptoms of SCT in a clinical child and adolescent sample and to define its features and comorbid conditions. We reviewed 834 clinical records of patients referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and examined SCT symptoms and their relation with sociodemographic data, clinical diagnosis, comorbid conditions, Child Behavior Checklist dimensions, and intelligence quotient. Of the 515 patients (age range, 4 to 17\u2009y, 62.5% male) for whom a fully completed Child Behavior Checklist for Children and Adolescents was available, 20.8% showed high levels of SCT symptoms. SCT symptoms were strongly associated with age, internalizing symptoms, learning disabilities, and ADHD inattentive subtype (ADHD-I). No significant correlations with intelligence quotient were found. We concluded that SCT symptoms are highly prevalent in a clinical sample, and that these symptoms might be related to the difficulties that some individuals have in responding to demands in their environments, such as academic or social demands, as they increase over time."}, {"Title": "Personal suffering and social criticism in T.

While acknowledging these debates, I advocate for an ethnography of how US soldiers and veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars themselves articulate political and ethical tensions in their experiences of psychiatric drug treatment. Detailing one army veteran's interpretations of drug effects as narrated through the lens of his current antiwar politics, I examine the radicalizing transformations of self and subjectivity that he attributes both to his witnessing drug use in Iraq and to the neurochemical effects of his own medications. Playing on the biomedical notion of \"side effects,\" I highlight surprising political and ethical openings that can surface when psychopharmaceuticals and war intersect.

What about its practice in the medical world? The aim of this article is to answer to this question. Therefore, we contacted every French University Hospital of each region to find out if hypnosis was practiced for the care of pain (hypnoanalgesia), for chirurgical procedures (hypnosedation) and in adult psychiatry care units (hypnotherapy). For this last practice, we also questioned the type of indications. All 30 of the French University Hospitals had replied by November 2015. Hypnoanalgesia is practiced by all and two-thirds offer hypnosedation. Hypnotherapy is practiced by 40\u00a0% of the University Hospitals, 91,7\u00a0% for anxiety disorders, 66,7\u00a0% for psychotraumatic care and 25\u00a0% for mood disorders.

It is also involved in the synthesis of several neurotransmitters. Nutritional iron deficiency is one of the most widespread worldwide; it poses a great health challenge due to the consequences it entails.\nThe aim of this research study is to explore the percentage of psychiatric patients who have a deficiency in iron. In addition, the study investigates the efficacy of iron administered by oral treatment on psychiatric symptomatology among iron deficient patients. The research study utilized the martial biological results, which involved the observation of the level of iron deficiency among the outpatients of a local psychiatrist and assessor from the period of January 2012 until December 2013.\nOut of 412 patients, 295 were women and 117 men. The age of the participants ranged from 16 to 89years, with an average age of 45years. The only exclusion criterion was a patient's refusal or inability to take the prescribed iron assessment test. We considered a transferrin saturation coefficient (TSC)<30% and/or a serum ferritin level\u226450ng/mL to be \"indicative\" of obvious iron deficiency, and a ferritin level between 51 and 100ng/mL to be \"suggestive\" of iron deficiency. A plasma ferritin assay was performed at least once on all of the participants prior to any proposed iron treatment. A calculation of the TSC in 138 patients was requested due to suspected iron deficiency despite a blood ferritin level of>100ng/ml. A single method was utilized in the various laboratories to analyse the blood samples to determine whether there was a deficiency in iron. Only those patients with blood ferritin levels \u2264100ng/mL and/or a TSC of<30% (335 patients) were subsequently given exclusively an oral iron treatment prescribed on its own or as a supplement or simultaneously with psychotropic treatment. The daily administered dose of elemental iron varied between 50 and 200mg a day.\nAbout half of the women\u00a0-\u00a0145 (35.19% of the subjects)\u00a0-\u00a0and 15 men (3.64% of the subjects) certainly had a deficiency in iron (blood ferritin level\u226450ng/mL). Ninety women and 24 men (27.6% of the subjects) had blood ferritin levels between 51 and 100ng/mL indicating iron deficiency, and 28 women and 33 men (14.8% of the subjects) had a TSC of<30% despite a blood ferritin level of>100ng/mL. Overall, 335 patients (81.3% of the subjects) showed an iron deficiency based on the criteria we set. In the remaining 77 patients (18.7% of the subjects), all of them had blood ferritin levels>100ng/mL and some had TSC\u226430%, while the remaining patients' TSC was unknown because it was not measured. The results indicated that there is an iron deficiency in 198 out of 240 patients suffering mostly from mood and behavioural disorders, in 101 out of 126 patients suffering mostly from anxiety disorders, in 18 out of 27 patients suffering mostly from sleep disorders, in 14 out of 15 patients suffering mostly from delusions of persecution, and in the 4 patients suffering mostly from burn out. There was evidence of regression/remission of psychiatric symptoms in 193 responsive patients whereas the remaining 142 patients were considered non-responsive. In the responsive patient category, 37 participants were treated with just iron, 52 received iron supplemented to the initial psychotropic treatment which was not fully effective, and 104 patients were treated with iron and prescribed psychotropic drugs simultaneously. The iron treatment seems to bring about a reduction\u00a0-\u00a0particularly through its mono-aminergic neurotransmitter synthesis-promoting action\u00a0-\u00a0in hyperemotivity, anxiety, irritability, aggressiveness, sadness, anhedonia, apathy, asthenia, sleep disorders, dysautonomia symptoms, eating disorders, restless-leg syndrome, cognitive performance and the likelihood of resorting to psychiatric admission. A daily elemental iron dose intake between 50 and 200mg/day by deficient patients appears to likely enhance the effects of the psychotropic drugs and even to act as an actual antidepressant. Many patients who received a prescription for iron and antidepressants showed few side effects related to antidepressants and a small number required psychiatric hospitalization. Patients considered unresponsive to iron therapy were those who left the study, were not assessed because the study's timeframe ended, still had an iron deficiency because they did not continuously take the medication, or suffered from somatic diseases which explains their resistance to treat the low iron level (nutritional imbalance, digestive or urinary or gynecological or iatrogenic diseases, sleep apnea).\nOur clinical observation of two years in a local psychiatrist's clinic revealed that over 80% of patients had iron deficiency. Although the low iron level cannot explain all physical and psychiatric symptoms in patients, it is useful to note that more than half of the iron deficient patients responded favorably after an oral treatment of iron. This result leads to further investigation of the level of iron in psychiatric patients and to reconsider the iron range placed by the laboratories. In addition, it is crucial not to eliminate the possibility of iron deficiency in psychiatric patients. Further research studies are needed to set more specific and detailed criteria to determine the range of iron deficiency in order to support the findings of this study and optimize the care given to patients suffering from various disorders and psychiatric syndromes."}, {"Title": "Implications of the Group Model of Supervision and Consultation in Forensic Training.", "Abstract": "The clinical case conference has been a hallmark of undergraduate and graduate medical education for decades and affords attendees the opportunity to hear about interesting and difficult cases and to learn from a discussion of the complexities of diagnosis and treatment.

These form a substantial barrier to understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective, personalized treatments. In response, many studies have aimed to stratify psychiatric disorders, aiming to find more consistent subgroups on the basis of many types of data. Such approaches have received renewed interest after recent research initiatives, such as the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and the European Roadmap for Mental Health Research, both of which emphasize finding stratifications that are based on biological systems and that cut across current classifications. We first introduce the basic concepts for stratifying psychiatric disorders and then provide a methodologically oriented and critical review of the existing literature. This shows that the predominant clustering approach that aims to subdivide clinical populations into more coherent subgroups has made a useful contribution but is heavily dependent on the type of data used; it has produced many different ways to subgroup the disorders we review, but for most disorders it has not converged on a consistent set of subgroups. We highlight problems with current approaches that are not widely recognized and discuss the importance of validation to ensure that the derived subgroups index clinically relevant variation. Finally, we review emerging techniques-such as those that estimate normative models for mappings between biology and behavior-that provide new ways to parse the heterogeneity underlying psychiatric disorders and evaluate all methods to meeting the objectives of such as the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and Roadmap for Mental Health Research."}, {"Title": "Global mental health and psychiatric institutions in the 21st century.", "Abstract": "In the 19th century, psychiatric institutions were the focus of thousands of articles in the leading English-language medical and psychiatric journals.

Overall preparedness for leading a health care team, caring for a military population, working in isolated and challenging environments, and being deployed were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale.\nAmong the survey respondents (n = 135, response rate 54%), 77% agreed or strongly agreed that their family medicine residency training was relevant to their role as a general duty medical officer. Most respondents were either satisfied or very satisfied with their emergency medicine training (77%) and psychiatry training (63%), while fewer were satisfied or very satisfied with their sports medicine (47%), base clinic (41%), and critical care (43%) training. Even fewer respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with their trauma (26%) and occupational health (12%) training. Regarding overall preparedness, 57% believed that they were adequately prepared to care for a military patient population, and 52% of respondents believed they were prepared for their first posting. Fewer respondents (38%) believed they were prepared to work in isolated, austere, or challenging environments, and even fewer (32%) believed that residency training prepared them to lead a health care team.\nGeneral duty medical officers were satisfied with many aspects of their family medicine residency training; however, military-specific areas for improvement were identified. Many of these areas might be addressed within the context of a 2-year residency program without risking the generalist nature of family medicine training.

Widowhood is a time when many older people experience loneliness. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Little is known about strategies that are effective in mitigating experiences of loneliness and this paper explores this with older people who have been through the process. The narratives of the older people in this study described a trajectory in which loneliness was experienced as both a loss of spouse and a loss of routines that enabled them to maintain connections with others. This trajectory moved onto the establishment of new routines that enabled connections to be developed. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Loneliness is strongly associated with depression and anxiety in the elderly and mental health nurses should be encouraged to screen for loneliness when undertaking assessments. Interventions that facilitate the development of meaningful routines could be integrated into mental health nursing care of older people.\nBackground Loneliness in older people is a public health concern in many Western countries. While not necessarily a symptom of mental disorder, it is often associated with depression and anxiety. Widowhood is a transition period during which many older people experience acute loneliness but over time develops strategies to manage it. Little is known about effective strategies that older people have used to manage the experience. The strategies older people used to manage this was the focus of this paper. Aim The aim was to examine older widows' experiences of loneliness. Design The design of this study was a qualitative narrative analysis with thematic analysis and the participants were 40 older widow/widowers aged between 70 and 97\u00a0years. Findings The study found that the participants negotiated the experience of loneliness following widowhood from an acute phase of experiencing an absence and the associated loss of routine connection to the establishment of new routines that provided new connections and a new sense of identity as an individual rather than a couple. Conclusions It is important for mental health nurses to screen for loneliness and be able to facilitate interventions that may alleviate the experience of loneliness."}, {"Title": "Child behavior checklist profiles in adolescents with bipolar and depressive disorders.", "Abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) profiles in youths with bipolar and depressive disorders.\nSeventy-four subjects with a mean age of 14.9\u00b11.6years (36 boys) with mood disorders and their parents were recruited from September 2011 to June 2013 in the Department of Psychiatry, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Diagnosis of mood disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorder was confirmed by child psychiatrists using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). The parents of the subjects completed the Parent General Behavior Inventory-10-item Mania Scale (P-GBI-10M), Parent-version of Mood Disorder Questionnaire (P-MDQ), ADHD rating scale (ARS) and CBCL. The adolescents completed the 76-item Adolescent General Behavior Inventory (A-GBI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Adolescent-version of Mood Disorder Questionnaire (A-MDQ).\nWhen adjusted for gender and the comorbidity with ADHD, the Withdrawn and Anxious/Depressed subscale scores of the CBCL were higher in subjects with bipolar disorder than in those with depressive disorder. Higher scores of A-GBI Depressive subscale, A-MDQ and BDI were shown in subjects with bipolar disorder than in those with depressive disorder. There was no significant difference on CBCL-DP, P-GBI-10M, P-MDQ, A-GBI Hypomanic/Biphasic subscale and ARS between two groups. All eight subscales of the CBCL positively correlated with the P-GBI-10M and P-MDQ scores, and seven of all eight subscales of the CBCL positively correlated with A-GBI Depressive and Hypomanic/Biphasic subscales. The BDI score was positively associated with the Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, Anxious/Depressed, and Social Problems subscale scores. CBCL-DP score was strongly correlated with manic/hypomanic symptoms measured by P-GBI-10M and P-MDQ (r=0.771 and 0.826).\nThis study suggests that the CBCL could be used for measuring mood symptoms and combined psychopathology, especially internalizing symptoms, in youth with mood disorder.

The biotransformation of Levomepromazine remains elusive up to now, but found to result in the formation of different derivatives that may contribute to the therapeutic and/or side-effects of the parent drug. The present work aims to resolve the metabolic details of Levomepromazine catalyzed by cytochrome P450, an important heme-containing enzyme superfamily, based on DFT calculation. Two main metabolic pathways have been addressed, S-oxidation and N-demethylation. The mechanistic conclusions have revealed a stepwise transfer of two electrons mechanism in S-oxidation reaction. N-demethylation is a two-step reaction, including the rate-determining N-methyl hydroxylation which proceeds via the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism and the subsequent C-N bond fission through a water-assisted enzymatic proton-transfer process. N-demethylation is more feasible than S-oxidation due to its lower activation energy and N-desmethyllevomepromazine therefore is the most plausible metabolite of Levomepromazine. Each metabolic pathway proceeds in a spin-selective manner (SSM) mechanism, predominately via the LS state of Cpd I. Our observations are in good accordance with the experimental results, which can provide some general implications for the metabolic mechanism of Levomepromazine-like drugs.

Evidence about the long-term consequences of prenatal SSRI exposure on child neurodevelopment is controversial. We prospectively investigated whether prenatal SSRI exposure was associated with childhood non-verbal cognition in a population-based study, and contrasted it to exposure to depressive symptoms (without SSRIs). We included 71 children prenatally exposed to SSRIs, 385 children prenatally exposed to maternal depressive symptoms and 5427 unexposed children. Child executive functioning was assessed by maternal report at 4 years ( n=4020). Non-verbal intelligence was measured at 5 years ( n=5001) and children were tested with a neuropsychological battery at 7 years ( n=1194). Prenatal SSRI exposure was not related to maternal reported executive function at 4 years, nor was it related with observed non-verbal intelligence at age 5 or neuropsychological function at 7 years. Exposure to untreated maternal depressive symptoms was related to maternal reported shifting problems and emotional control problems at 4 years. No associations between exposure to depressive symptoms and observed non-verbal IQ at 5 years or neuropsychological function at 7 years were found.

It is actually one of the main causes of disease and handicap in children aged from 10\u00a0to 19. The major risk is suicide, whose prevalence is estimated, in France, around 6.7\u00a0for 100,000, which is probably underestimated. At present, the discussions about prescription of antidepressants in an adolescent's depression remain intense which is why psychotherapy becomes the first choice of treatment. We propose here to present one of them, Interpersonal PsychoTherapy (IPT), which remains largely unknown in France, and its adaptations in the adolescent population.\nIPT is a brief psychotherapy, structured in twelve to sixteen sessions, which was created by Klerman and Weissman in the seventies inspired by the biopsychosocial model of Meyer, interpersonal theory of Sullivan, and attachment theory of Bowlby. It is divided into three parts: the initial phase, the intermediate phase, and the termination phase.\nIPT was adapted for adolescents by Mufson in 1993, but a few modifications must be considered. Parental implication is the first. Indeed, parents, rather than the adolescent, often ask for the consultation; but it is the latter who benefits from the therapy. Parents may be met at some point in the therapy, for example between each phase and at the end. The initial phase is very close for the adolescent as for the adult; but the therapist must be careful about employing the \"sick role\" which can be used by the adolescent to avoid school, and as a consequence, to exacerbate the interpersonal deficit. The intermediate phase focuses on one of the four interpersonal issues: complicated bereavement, role transition, interpersonal role disputes, and interpersonal deficit. Complicated bereavement may become problematic when prolonged or when the adolescent had complicated relations with the deceased. The therapist essentially works on emotion verbalization. The role of transition is very common during adolescence: children become adults, they pass from high school to college, or their parents get divorced, etc. The patient and the therapist work on giving up the old role with its emotional expression (guilt, anger, and loss), and acquiring new skills, and identifying positive aspects of the new role. Interpersonal role disputes are common during adolescence, with parents or teachers for example. To determine a treatment plan, the therapist may first determine the stage of the role dispute, among impasse, renegotiation, or dissolution, and then work on the communication mode of the patient. At the least, the interpersonal deficit may be the most difficult area to work on because of the risk of psychiatric comorbidity. The therapist must be especially careful about anxious disorder which may complicate the psychotherapy and for which IPT is not the best therapy. The termination phase focuses on the new skills and abilities and works on the future without therapy. IPT is one of the psychotherapies recommended in the treatment of depression disorder in the international recommendations. But in France, all psychotherapies are considered equally. This may be a consensual approach, but the authors wonder if it is the best, especially to motivate research in the psychotherapy field.\nFinally, IPT has been developed in other indications in the past years, and many others are presently in research projects: depression during pregnancy, prevention of depression relapse, eating disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, self-harm for example.\nIts validity, simplicity and efficacy should stimulate psychiatrists and residents to train themselves to IPT."}, {"Title": "[Advocacy for the establishment of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the \"burden\" of schizophrenic disorders].", "Abstract": "This article attempts to identify and put into perspective the different approaches that could globally prevent the suffering induced by schizophrenia, from the detection of early psychosis to the impact on individual and family functioning and emotional health. Schizophrenia causes, at the community level, a number of difficult consequences and associated costs, which likely could be reduced if specific strategies, already known and documented internationally, were applied. Two areas not explored in this article: the role of medication and the issue of suicide prevention. In the scope of screening and early treatment, genetic risk, as well as the predictive ability of the clinical criteria for individuals at \"ultra-high risk\" of developing schizophrenia justify an increased vigilance for the detection of symptoms in order for treatment to begin earlier and to be more effective. These risk factors should not be neglected as the benefits of early management impact the course of illness and functional outcome. At this stage of the emergence of the disorder, it is difficult to systematize a therapeutic protocol. Two options are open to the clinician: \"wait and watch\" given the lack of a conclusive diagnosis and a more pro-active intervention, focused on the therapeutic alliance and enhancing insight and awareness. The second approach seems more productive but requires transparency with the patient and family regarding the uncertainty of the clinical situation, and an attitude that favors sharing information, along the lines of early psych education. Once a pathological stage is reached, early and accurate clinical care is fundamental. They depend heavily on access to care, proximity and availability to clinics or out-reach teams, capable of a thorough diagnostic work-up. Yet conversely, the availability for early and accurate clinical care faces obstacles which are closely related to the pejorative view of psychiatry held by the general public, health care professionals, and public officials. This poor image of psychiatry is partly due to cases of clinical decompensation, dangerous in some instances, underscoring why it is be important to understand and anticipate the contributory factors to these outcomes in the first place so as to avoid them. In this sense, defending a complacent and conciliatory approach can be counter-productive. Following developments of recent decades in other chronic diseases (diabetes, cancer, AIDS, severe heart disease\u2026), the implementation of systematic clinical programs, treatment protocols, psycho-education to reinforce adherence to therapeutic measures, their simplification, the support and appreciation of the role of caregivers, destigmatizing due to proximity of contact, and therefore an increase in the use of care. Similarly, the systematic search for side-effects of medication and pro-actively managing to minimize their occurrence strengthen compliance, a recognized factor of relapse prevention. Preventable comorbidities, addictions, and common physical illnesses are not systematically screened (neoplastic diseases, diabetes, hypertension, dental health, gynecology\u2026) in this population and thus also represent significant potential for a better life expectancy. The tools of psychosocial rehabilitation, unfortunately, are too infrequently used in France. Their goal is to improve the functional outcome of patients, a determinant of social integration and to lessen the burden shouldered by family and other carers, and ultimately to reduce exacerbations of the illness due to situations of interpersonal stress. Work has also proven its worth as a protective factor, as well as strengthening a sense of self-efficiency, of self-esteem, of empowerment, of quality of life, helping attain recovery. It is clear that not all social and health care systems are primarily geared towards these objectives, although they have at their disposal, by the means described above, strong preventive measures for relapses. Beyond the issue of the implementation of clinical programs, the existing culture would benefit from being infused with a prioritization of resource deployment, with debates of these issues regarding parity for mental health services, advocated by users, and forging a place, for example, for the intervention of \"peer supports\", sociologists, social workers, interested beyond the disease, in community environment, employment opportunities, and housing. Overall, this work argues for updating our conceptions of clinical care, supporting the systematic implementation of modern models of care, and expanding the scope of our concerns regarding patients' lives."}, {"Title": "Trends in Psychological Symptoms among Canadian Adolescents from 2002 to 2014: Gender and Socioeconomic Differences.", "Abstract": "To describe trends in psychological health symptoms in Canadian youth from 2002 to 2014 and examine gender and socioeconomic differences in these trends.\nWe used data from the Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study.

To address these limitations, the authors conducted meta- and mega-analyses of data from OCD sites worldwide.\nT<sub>1</sub> images from 1,830 OCD patients and 1,759 control subjects were analyzed, using coordinated and standardized processing, to identify subcortical brain volumes that differ between OCD patients and healthy subjects.

The authors additionally examined potential modulating effects of clinical characteristics on morphological differences in OCD patients.\nThe meta-analysis indicated that adult patients had significantly smaller hippocampal volumes (Cohen's d=-0.13; % difference=-2.80) and larger pallidum volumes (d=0.16; % difference=3.16) compared with adult controls. Both effects were stronger in medicated patients compared with controls (d=-0.29, % difference=-4.18, and d=0.29, % difference=4.38, respectively).

The mega-analysis yielded similar results.\nThe results indicate different patterns of subcortical abnormalities in pediatric and adult OCD patients. The pallidum and hippocampus seem to be of importance in adult OCD, whereas the thalamus seems to be key in pediatric OCD. These findings highlight the potential importance of neurodevelopmental alterations in OCD and suggest that further research on neuroplasticity in OCD may be useful."}, {"Title": "The effectiveness of the peer delivered Thinking Healthy Plus (THPP+) Programme for maternal depression and child socio-emotional development in Pakistan: study protocol for a three-year cluster randomized controlled trial.", "Abstract": "The negative effects of perinatal depression on the mother and child start early and persist throughout the lifecourse (Lancet 369(9556):145-57, 2007; Am J Psychiatry 159(1):43-7, 2002; Arch Dis Child 77(2):99-101, 1997; J Pak Med Assoc 60(4):329; J Psychosoma Res 49(3):207-16, 2000; Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev 14(1):1-27, 2011).

An interaction between dermatology and psychiatry has been increasingly described. Substantial evidence has accumulated that psychological stress can be associated with pigmentation, endocrine and immune systems in skin to create the optimal responses against pathogens and other physicochemical stressors to maintain or restore internal homeostasis. Additionally, given the common ectodermal origin shared by the brain and skin, we are interested in assessing how disruption of skin systems (pigmentary, endocrine and immune systems) may play a key role in brain functions. Thus, we selected three drugs (hydroquinone, isotretinoin, tacrolimus) with percutaneous excessive delivery to respectively intervene in these systems and then evaluate the potential neurotoxic effects. Firstly, C57BL/6 mice were administrated a dermal dose of hydroquinone cream, isotretinoin gel or tacrolimus ointment (2%, 0.05%, 0.1%, respectively, 5 times of the clinical dose). Behavioral testing was performed and levels of proteins were measured in the hippocampus. It was found that mice treated with isotretinoin or tacrolimus, presented a lower activity in open-field test and obvious depressive-like behavior in tail suspension test. Besides, they damaged cytoarchitecture, reduced the level of 5-HT-5-HT1A/1B system and increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in the hippocampus. To enable sensitive monitoring the dose-response characteristics of the consecutive neurobehavioral disorders, mice received gradient concentrations of hydroquinone (2%, 4%, 6%). Subsequently, hydroquinone induced behavioral disorders and hippocampal dysfunction in a dose-dependent response. When doses were high as 6% which was 3 times higher than 2% dose, then 100% of mice exhibited depressive-like behavior. Certainly, 6% hydroquinone exposure elicited the most serious impairment of hippocampal structure and survival. The fact that higher doses of hydroquinone are associated with a greater risk of depression is further indication that hydroquinone is responsible for the development of depression. These above data demonstrated that chronic administration of different dermatology drugs contributed into common mental distress.

One of the main factors that influence bed availability is the length of hospital stay (LOS), which is considered as an important indicator of the quality of inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. We aimed to investigate whether hospital accreditation drives improvements for the length of stay in psychiatric inpatients.\nThe study reviewed medical records of consecutive hospital admissions for pre- and post-accreditation comparisons of LOS in two acute mental health wards at a teaching general hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data obtained from the 12-month-post-accreditation period (July 2011 to June 2012) were compared with those from the 12-month-pre-accreditation period (July 2009 to June 2010). The adoption of accreditation program occurred over a 12-month period in the middle of the study (July 2010 to June 2011). Compiled information included demographics, diagnosis, assessment, and LOS. All identified charts were reviewed; there were no exclusion criteria. Patients were not contacted.\nPost-accreditation, the mean (SD) length of stay was 35.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.5\u00a0days and the range was 3-113\u00a0days. Whereas in the pre-accreditation period the mean (SD) length of stay was 41.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.5\u00a0days and the range was 1-167\u00a0days. The difference was statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026).\nAccreditation reduces excess LOS and contributes to improving the quality of psychiatric inpatient care and access to psychiatric beds."}, {"Title": "Risk Factors for Problematic Behaviors among Forensic Outpatients under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act in Japan.", "Abstract": "The Medical Treatment and Supervision Act (MTSA) was enacted in 2005 in Japan to promote the reintegration of clinical offenders with mental disorders into society. Under the MTSA, individuals who committed serious crimes in a state of insanity or diminished responsibility are diverted from the criminal justice system to the mental health system. Based on court decisions about MTSA-based treatment, clinical offenders have an obligation to engage in rehabilitation within their local community under the guidance of mental health professionals. However, patients under MTSA-based clinical treatments have faced various problems in the course of treatment, because of psychiatric as well as other static or dynamic factors, and sometimes have committed problematic behaviors, such as violence and medical non-compliance. Hence, this study aimed to clarify factors related to patients' inclusion in MTSA-based outpatient treatment and additionally, their commitment of problematic behaviors, based on confidential data acquired during a four-year government survey period (National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry) from MTSA enactment (July 15, 2005) to December 31, 2009. In total, we recruited 441 clinical offenders receiving MTSA-based outpatient treatment from 158 nationwide facilities. To evaluate related factors, we collected demographic, psychiatric, forensic, clinical treatment, and social service information. Statistical analyses demonstrated that predominant profiles of patients included male gender, younger age, low school history, psychiatric diagnoses (F1, F2, and F3), and no correctional or outpatient history before MTSA-based treatment. F1 or substance use diagnosis, in particular, was increasingly correlated with other factors, such as male gender, older age, and correctional history before MTSA treatment. Among the 441 patients, 189 (43%) committed problematic behaviors in the course of the MTSA-based outpatient treatment. Risk factors for patients' commitment of problematic behaviors comprised F1 diagnosis and inpatient history before MTSA-based treatment inclusion. In summary, reduction of overall problematic behaviors under the MTSA outpatient likely makes progress by focal attention to patients with psychiatric disorders caused by substance use and/or a past inpatient history for more severe psychiatric symptoms. This work is of ongoing and future importance in the domain of forensic community treatment, to connect risk-enhancing factors with risk management."}, {"Title": "Emergency psychiatry: a product of circumstance or a growing sub-speciality field?", "Abstract": "This article reviews recent trends in the provision of psychiatric services to the emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in Australia, involving the establishment of specialised in-reach or liaison services as well as various forms of short stay unit attached to emergency departments.

Due to its heterogeneity and fluctuating course, passive and active mobile technologies have been increasingly evaluated as adjunctive or standalone tools to predict and prevent risk of worsening of course in bipolar disorder. As predictive analytics approaches to big data from mobile health (mHealth) applications and ancillary sensors advance, it is likely that early warning systems will increasingly become available to patients. Such systems could reduce the amount of time spent experiencing symptoms and diminish the immense disability experienced by people with bipolar disorder. However, in addition to the challenges in validating such systems, we argue that early warning systems may not be without harms. Probabilistic warnings may be delivered to individuals who may not be able to interpret the warning, have limited information about what behaviors to change, or are unprepared to or cannot feasibly act due to time or logistic constraints. We propose five essential elements for early warning systems and provide a conceptual framework for designing, incorporating stakeholder input, and validating early warning systems for bipolar disorder with a focus on pragmatic considerations."}, {"Title": "Criticism in the Self, Brain, Relationships, and Social Structure: Implications for Psychodynamic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "An integrative-psychodynamic theory of criticism in self and relationships is presented (Shahar, 2015).

Self-criticism, a formidable dimension of vulnerability to a wide array of psychopathologies, is construed as a distorted form of self-knowledge, reducing internal confusion at the expense of widening the gap between A and SK.

The affiliation of Daniela Hubl was incorrectly listed as \"University Hospital of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern.\" It should have been listed as \"University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Bern.\" All versions of this article have been corrected.] Schizotypy is considered an indicator of psychosis-proneness and therefore, a precursor to schizophrenia-spectrum psychosis. In the early detection of psychosis, the widely used ultra high-risk criteria refer to the positive features of schizotypy and schizotypal personality disorders (SPD). In clinical high risk (CHR) samples, self-reported or clinically assessed SPD, notably the lack of close friends, has been suggested to facilitate the prediction of psychosis. In community samples, self-reported schizotypy has mainly been assessed psychometrically using the 4 Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales (WSS; Chapman, Chapman, Kwapil, Eckbald, & Zinser, 1994), and the positive schizotypy dimension was consistently predictive of psychosis (Debban\u00e9 et al., 2015). However, psychometrically assessed schizotypy has not yet been studied as a potential predictor of psychosis in CHR samples. To bridge this gap, we studied the psychosis-predictive value of 3 of the WSSs and their association with CHR state in a clinical sample. One hundred 28 patients (23 \u00b1 7 years; 81% considered CHR) from 2 early detection services were followed for 12 to 101 months. Within 48 months, 36 (28.1%) converted to psychosis. Only physical anhedonia was associated with CHR state, and high scores for physical anhedonia were predictive of conversion in conjunction with the CHR state. Physical anhedonia rather than positive schizotypy scales might separate future converters from nonconverters in clinical samples already presenting a phenomenologically more extreme range on the psychosis continuum. Given their reported psychosis-predictive value in nonclinical samples, psychometric schizotypy measures in general might be useful for the initial screening of psychosis-proneness in the community, whereas physical anhedonia might be particularly useful in CHR samples.

All patients aged 16 years and above, who presented to the ED with a psychiatric complaint were included in the study. A data collection sheet was designed to gather each patient's demographic data such as age and gender, past psychiatric history, nature of the presenting complaints, thoroughness of physical assessment, medications prescribed by the ED doctor prior to psychiatric assessment, and whether the patient was discharged, admitted to a psychiatry or medical ward.\nA total of 202 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was 34.2 years. Females represented 56% of the sample. The majority of the study group (60.4%) were patients with a documented past psychiatric history. Physical examination was conducted in the ED for 61.4% of the patients, while vital signs were recorded for 68.8% of them. Approximately, 31% of the patients required injectable psychotropic medications as tranquillizers in the ED. Patients with an isolated psychiatric complaint coupled with a documented past psychiatric history were more likely to be referred to the on-call psychiatrist without a physical examination by the ED doctors.\nIn our institution, not all patients with psychiatric presentations had a complete physical examination by the ED doctors."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric illness, medication and driving: an audit of documentation.", "Abstract": "Guidelines on advising patients on fitness to drive have been published recently by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.

Despite considerable research in the area of psychiatric neuroimaging outcome prediction, translating putative neuroimaging markers (neuromarkers) of a disorder into clinical practice has proven challenging. We reviewed studies that used neuroimaging measures to predict treatment response and disease outcomes in major depressive disorder, substance use, autism spectrum disorder, psychosis, and dementia. The majority of studies sought to predict psychiatric outcomes rather than develop a specific biological index of future disease trajectory. Studies varied widely with respect to sample size and quantification of out-of-sample prediction model performance. Many studies were able to predict psychiatric outcomes with moderate accuracy, with neuroimaging data often augmenting the prediction compared to clinical or psychometric data alone. We make recommendations for future research with respect to methods that can increase the generalizability and reproducibility of predictions. Large sample sizes in conjunction with machine learning methods, such as feature selection, cross-validation, and random label permutation, provide significant improvement to and quantification of generalizability. Further refinement of neuroimaging protocols and analysis methods will likely facilitate the clinical applicability of predictive imaging markers in psychiatry. Such clinically relevant neuromarkers need not necessarily be grounded in the pathophysiology of the disease, but identifying these neuromarkers may suggest targets for future research into disease mechanisms. The ability of imaging prediction models to augment clinical judgments will ultimately depend on the personal and economic costs and benefits to the patient."}, {"Title": "Model-Free Temporal-Difference Learning and Dopamine in Alcohol Dependence: Examining Concepts From Theory and Animals in Human Imaging.", "Abstract": "Dopamine potentially unites two important roles: one in addiction, being involved in most substances of abuse including alcohol, and a second one in a specific type of learning, namely model-free temporal-difference reinforcement learning. Theories of addiction have long suggested that drugs of abuse may usurp dopamine's role in learning. Here, we briefly review the preclinical literature to motivate specific hypotheses about model-free temporal-difference learning and then review the imaging evidence in the drug of abuse with the most substantial societal consequences: alcohol. Despite the breadth of the literature, only a few studies have examined the predictions directly, and these provide at best inconclusive evidence for the involvement of temporal-difference learning alterations in alcohol dependence. We discuss the difficulties of testing the theory in humans, make specific suggestions, and close with a focus on the interaction with other learning mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Problematic internet use (PIU): Associations with the impulsive-compulsive spectrum. An application of machine learning in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Problematic internet use is common, functionally impairing, and in need of further study. Its relationship with obsessive-compulsive and impulsive disorders is unclear. Our objective was to evaluate whether problematic internet use can be predicted from recognised forms of impulsive and compulsive traits and symptomatology. We recruited volunteers aged 18 and older using media advertisements at two sites (Chicago USA, and Stellenbosch, South Africa) to complete an extensive online survey. State-of-the-art out-of-sample evaluation of machine learning predictive models was used, which included Logistic Regression, Random Forests and Na\u00efve Bayes. Problematic internet use was identified using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). 2006 complete cases were analysed, of whom 181 (9.0%) had moderate/severe problematic internet use. Using Logistic Regression and Na\u00efve Bayes we produced a classification prediction with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.83 (SD 0.03) whereas using a Random Forests algorithm the prediction ROC-AUC was 0.84 (SD 0.03) [all three models superior to baseline models p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001]. The models showed robust transfer between the study sites in all validation sets [p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001].

Neuroscience has provided new expectations that an explanation will be found for the development of mental disorders based on biological functioning alone. However, such a goal has not been that easy to achieve, and new hypotheses have begun to appear in neuroscience research. In this article we identify epigenetics, neurodevelopment, and plasticity as the principal avenues for a new understanding of the biology of mental phenomena. Genetic complexity, the environment's formative role, and variations in vulnerability involve important changes in the principal hypotheses on biological determination of mental disorders, suggesting a reconfiguration of the limits between the \"social\" and the \"biological\" in neuroscience research."}, {"Title": "Erratum.", "Abstract": "Patten SB, Williams JVA, Lavorato DH, et al.

The original English abstract for the above article and the correct French translation are provided below:\nThe Mental Health Experiences Scale is a measure of perceived stigma, the perception of negative attitudes and behaviours by people with mental disorders. A recent Canadian survey (Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health) included this scale, providing an opportunity to describe perceived stigma in relation to diagnosis for the first time in the Canadian general population.\nThe survey interview began with an assessment of whether respondents had utilised services for an \"emotional or mental health problem\" in the preceding 12 months. The subset reporting service utilisation were asked whether others \"held negative opinions\" about them or \"treated them unfairly\" for reasons related to their mental health. The analysis reported here used frequencies, means, cross-tabulation, and logistic regression, all incorporating recommended replicate sampling weights and bootstrap variance estimation procedures.\nStigma was perceived by 24.4% of respondents accessing mental health services. The frequency was higher among younger respondents (<55 years), those who were not working, those reporting only fair or poor mental health, and the subset who reported having received a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Sex and education level were not associated with perceived stigma. People with schizophrenia reported stigmatization only slightly more frequently than those with mood and anxiety disorders.\nStigmatization is a common, but not universal, experience among Canadians using services for mental health reasons.

There is, however, a lack of knowledge about the prevalence and clinical weight of PLEs in clinical child and adolescent (CAD) populations. Available research has primarily been conducted on community populations, and even clinical samples mostly used self-reported questionnaires. These studies also recruited participants 12 years old and older, with a consequent lack of information on children from 8 to 11 years old. We examined the prevalence of PLEs and their relationship with psychiatric diagnosis, functioning, intelligence quotient (IQ), anxiety and depressive symptoms in a clinical sample aged 8-17 years old.\nThe study was conducted on a clinical sample of 46 CAD with PLEs compared to a clinical sample of 60 CAD without PLEs. The two groups were compared on global, social and role functioning, IQ, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and number of psychiatric diagnoses.\nGlobal, role and social functioning were significantly lower in the CAD clinical sample with PLEs. These significant differences were maintained when the covariate IQ, number of psychiatric diagnoses or level of anxiety or depression was added. No significant age-related differences in the presence of PLEs were found.\nThe findings of this study show that PLEs are common in a clinical sample of CAD, even those under 12 years old.

The nature of ADEs and medication errors are important for improving the quality of care worldwide; therefore, we conducted the Japan Adverse Drug Events Study, a series of cohort studies at several settings in Japan.\nThis report included 448 inpatients with 22,733 patient-days in a psychiatric hospital and psychiatric units at a tertiary care teaching hospital over 1 year. Four psychiatrists and two other physicians reviewed all medical charts and related documents to identify suspected incidents. The physicians later classified those incidents into ADEs, potential ADEs, medication errors, or exclusions and evaluated the severity and preventability if the incidents were events.\nDuring the study period, we identified 955 ADEs and 398 medication errors (incidence: 42.0 and 17.5 per 1000 patient-days, respectively). Among ADEs, 1.4\u00a0%, 28\u00a0%, and 71\u00a0% were life-threatening, serious, and significant, respectively. Antipsychotics were associated with half of all ADEs. The incidence of medication errors was higher in medical care units than in acute and nursing care units (40.9, 15.6, and 17.4 per 1000 patient-days, respectively). The monitoring and ordering stages were the most common error stages (39\u00a0% and 34\u00a0% of all medication errors, respectively), and 76\u00a0% of medication errors with ADEs were found at the monitoring stage. Non-psychiatric drugs were three times as likely to cause ADEs with errors compared to psychiatric drugs.\nAntipsychotic use, inadequate monitoring, and treatment of physical ailments by psychiatrists may contribute to the high incidence of medication errors and ADEs among psychiatric inpatients in Japan. Psychiatrists should be cautious in prescribing antipsychotics or unfamiliar medications for physical problems in their psychiatric patients, and should monitor patients after medication administration."}, {"Title": "Quantitative and economic analysis of clinical pharmacist interventions during rounds in an acute care psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "Clinical pharmacists have become an integral part of multidisciplinary medical teams, including in the area of psychiatry.

As yet, however, there is a dearth of data examining these relationships. Our study examined the contributions of grief and a sense of injustice to a model of PTSD symptoms that included the established determinants of trauma events, ongoing adversity and severe psychological distress. The study involved a large population sample (n = 2964, response rate: 82.4%) surveyed in post-conflict Timor-Leste.\nThe survey sites included an urban administrative area (suco) in Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste and a rural village located an hour's drive away. Culturally adapted measures were applied to assess conflict related traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, persisting preoccupations with injustice, symptoms of grief, psychological distress (including depressive symptoms) and PTSD symptoms.\nWe tested a series of structural equation models, the final comprehensive model, which included indices of grief symptoms and injustice, producing a good fit. Locating grief symptoms as the endpoint of the model produced a non-converging model. In the final model, strong associations were evident between grief and injustice (\u03b2 = 0.34, s.e. = 0.02, p < 0.01) and grief and PTSD symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.14, s.e. = 0.02, p < 0.01). The sense of injustice exerted a considerable effect on PTSD symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.13, s.e. = 0.03, p < 0.01). In addition, multiple indirect paths were evident, most involving grief and a sense of injustice, attesting to the complex inter-relationship of these factors in contributing to PTSD symptoms.\nOur findings support an expanded model of PTSD symptoms relevant to post-conflict populations, in which grief symptoms and a sense of injustice play pivotal roles. The model supports the importance of a focus on loss, grief and a sense of injustice in conducting trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD amongst populations exposed to mass conflict and violence.

For psychiatric assessment, digital technology can offer improvements over analog systems for the technical and, subsequently, the social quality of provider-client interaction. This is in turn expected to support greater provider uptake and enhanced patient benefits.\nWithin the framework of Innovation Diffusion Theory, to study service providers' experiences of an existing regional telehealth network for mental health care practice twelve months after digitisation in order to identify the benefits of digital telehealth over an analog system for mental health care purposes in rural Australia.\nQualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with over 40 service providers from June to September 2013 in South Australia, ranging from the metropolitan central operations to health providers located up to 600km away in rural and remote areas of the same state. Participants included rural mental health teams, directors of nursing at rural hospitals, metropolitan-based psychiatrists and registrars, the metropolitan-based mental health team dedicated to rural provider support, rural GPs, administrative staff, and the executive group of the state rural health department. Fieldwork was conducted 12 months after the analog system was digitised. The interview and focus group data were analysed using thematic analysis, focusing on three key areas of innovation diffusion theory: relative advantage, technical complexity and technical compatibility.\nFive themes with 11 sub-themes were identified: (1) \"Existing Uses\", with three sub-themes: current mental health use, use by GPs, and use for staff support; (2) \"Relative Advantage\", with four sub-themes: improved technical quality, improved clinical practice, time and cost benefits for providers, and improved patient care; (3) \"Technical Complexity\"; (4) \"Technical Compatibility\" with two sub-themes: technical-clinical and technical-administrative; and (5) \"Broader Organisational Culture\", with two sub-themes: organizational policy support and 'digital telehealth' culture.\nThe digitised telehealth network was generally well received by providers and adopted into clinical practice. Compared with the previous analog system, staff found advantages in better visual and audio quality, more technical stability with less \"drop-out\", less time delay to conversations and less confusion for clients. Despite these advantages, providers identified a range of challenges to starting or continuing use and they recommended improvements to increase uptake among mental health service providers and other providers (including GPs), and to clinical uses other than mental health. To further increase uptake and impact of telehealth-mediated mental health care in rural and remote areas, even with a high quality digital system, future research must design innovative care models, consider time and cost incentives for providers to use telehealth, and must focus not only on technical training but also how to best integrate technology with clinical practice and must develop an organization-wide digital telehealth culture."}, {"Title": "Economic Burden of Mental Illnesses in Pakistan.", "Abstract": "The economic consequences of mental illnesses are much more than health consequences.

We used Aga Khan University Hospital, Psychiatry department data set (N = 1882) on admission and ambulatory care for the year 2005-06. Healthcare cost data was obtained from finance department of the hospital. Productivity losses, caregiver and travel cost were estimated using socio-economic features of patients in the data set and data of national household survey. We used stratified random sampling and methods of ordinary least square multiple linear regressions to estimate cost on medicines for ambulatory care. All estimates of cost are based on 1000 bootstrap samples by ICD-10 disease classification. Prevalence data on mental illnesses from Pakistan and regional countries was used to estimate economic burden.\nThe economic burden of mental illnesses in Pakistan was Pakistan Rupees (PKR) 250,483 million (USD 4264.27 million) in 2006. Medical care costs and productivity losses contributed 37% and 58.97% of the economic burden respectively. Tertiary care admissions costs were 70% of total medical care costs. The average length of stay (LOS) for admissions care was around 8 days. Daily average medical care cost of admitted patients was PKR 3273 (USD 55.72). For ambulatory care, on average a patient visited the clinic twice a year. The estimated average yearly cost for all mental illnesses was PKR 81,922 (USD 1394.65) and PKR 19,592 (USD 333.54) for admissions and ambulatory care respectively. In the sensitivity analysis productivity losses showed high variability (from USD 1022.17 million to USD 4007.01 million). Assuming a gate keeping role of primary healthcare (PHC) demonstrated a saving of USD 1577.19 million in total economic burden.\nThis study set out to generate evidence using a low cost innovative approach relevant to many LMICs. In Pakistan, like many LMICs, patients access tertiary care directly, even for illness that can be efficiently managed at PHC level. In economic terms the non-medical consequences of mental illnesses are far greater than medical consequences.

These negative life events appear as potential vectors of psychological trauma. Additionally, strong links have been established in the literature between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and many other psychiatric disorders, including suicidal behavior and addictions. Under these conditions, we felt it essential to focus on the identification of PTSD in this sensitive population.Through adapted reception interviews, we tried to identify the PTSD, to describe by means of socio-demographic factors the studied population and to detect psychiatric comorbidities. The screening tool was the M.I.N.I.\u00a05.0, which identifies 17 psychiatric disorders including the PTSD, based on the DSM IV definition. The target population was the prison incomers, agreeing to participate in the study, aged more than 18 years old and imprisoned between 18 January 2013 and 31 December 2013. To this date, 549 inmates were included in the study.The main result of this study was a prevalence of PTSD of 17% for incomers in detention. We found that the PTSD+ population is more likely to be female (15% against 7% p = 0.0246), which is consistent with the literature data. The M.I.N.I.\u00a05.0 showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the PTSD+ group. This association was confirmed in several types of pathology like mood disorders including: major depressive episode and manic or hypomanic episode, suicidal risk, some anxiety disorders including: panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Strong association was found for current major depressive episode, current manic or hypomanic episode and suicidal risk (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005).The prevalence of PTSD is very high in this study, about 24 times higher than in a general population survey using the same screening tool.A large number of comorbidities have been identified, which corresponds to those described in the literature. The specific issues of psychiatry in prison lead us to examine more specifically the significance of the results about suicide risk. A comprehensive suicide risk (sum of medium and high risk screened by the M.I.N.I.) was found in significantly more PTSD+ inmates (17% versus 7%, p = 0.005). This study supports the need for routine screening of PTSD among incomers in detention. This disease is both worrying and common in this population but the real issues are the comorbidities. Suicidal potential is among the most important issues in detention.

Past event-related potential (ERP) research investigating processing of affective stimuli in schizophrenia was done mainly with facial expressions and revealed impaired facial emotion recognition in patients relative to control subjects. Experimentations involving fMRI with this group of patients, showed alteration of limbic and frontal regions in response to emotional unpleasant images, compared to neutral stimuli during a memory task. Other studies have also noted an increase in brain activity when the activation of the stimuli was high compared to low arousal stimuli. This may indicate a different sensitivity threshold to emotional arousal and emotional valence involving frontal pathways in these patients. But very few studies attempted to separate the contributions of emotional valence and arousal within an episodic memory protocol with ERP, in that population.Goal The aim of the current research is to investigate brain electro-cortical activity in schizophrenia in response to emotional images during an episodic memory task.Method ERP components were analyzed in 16 schizophrenic and 17 control participants matched for age, sex and intelligence. ERPs were obtained from 56 EEG electrodes. The tasks consisted in a classical episodic memory task that presented 100 repeated old and 100 new photographic images divided into four categories (unpleasant-high arousal, unpleasant-low arousal, pleasant-high arousal and pleasant-low arousal) selected from the International Affective Picture System. The N200, P300 and late positive component (LPC) mean amplitude, were analyzed using repeated-measure analyses of variance (MANOVA).Results Patients with schizophrenia and control subjects gave comparable subjective evaluations of arousal and valence. However, the frontal\u00a0N200 and the\u00a0P300 both showed an interaction of the group x memory x valence x hemisphere (F [1.32]=8.36; p <.01). Thus, this complex interaction denotes an increase of the episodic memory effect in the right hemisphere in response to unpleasant stimuli, with schizophrenic patients. With respect to the control group, there is also an increase of this memory effect in the right hemisphere, but in response to pleasant stimuli. The schizophrenic patients presented a smaller LPC memory effect, especially at the frontal region. More specifically, the frontal LPC was reduced, and the clinical group was less reactive to the emotional arousal content, compared to the control group.Discussion Altogether, our results revealed that while the subjective evaluation of emotional pictures is equivalent across groups, cerebral differences are present in schizophrenic patients during emotional recognition. N200 and P300 results in the frontal region suggest impaired selective attention and episodic memory to unpleasant stimuli in patients, while later processes related to conscious recollection (parietal LPC) are not affected with patients affected with schizophrenia.Conclusion This finding provides further support for the notion of a possible discrepancy between the subjective experience and the physiological expression of emotions in schizophrenia patients. Those results could open the door to new clinical research investigations in psychiatry, particularly in the comprehension of a relationship between frontal cortex vulnerability and episodic memory often present in psychosis."}, {"Title": "[The Concept of Typology in Psychiatry in the Context of Historical Contributions of Max Weber and Karl Jaspers].", "Abstract": "Against the background of Max Weber's and Karl Jaspers' outstanding historical contributions to the conceptual development of different typologies, the importance of a psychiatric typology is examined. The term \"ideal type\" was introduced into social science by Weber as an analytical construct to describe and classify cultural phenomena. This concept was adopted for the psychiatric context by Jaspers who proposed to establish a typological system in the field of psychotic disturbances without an organic correlate. He emphasized the importance of the course of psychopathological symptoms for such a typological system. The concept of typology can be regarded as a promising heuristic approach in psychiatry, providing a classification system for complex psychopathological symptoms. Even though several historic typologies exist in psychopathology, their usefulness in the fields of therapy and prognosis needs to be critically assessed. Also, new typologies will have to be developed, taking into account neurobiological knowledge now available."}, {"Title": "Genetic Counseling for Autism Spectrum Disorder in an Evolving Theoretical Landscape.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry is steadily moving toward a new conceptualization of brain disorders that blurs long-held diagnostic distinctions among neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, including autism.

Moreover, studies of chromosomal microarray analysis and whole exome sequencing have now detected many of the same pathogenic copy number and sequence-level variants across cohorts with different clinical presentations.\nGoing forward, the genetic counseling field will need to significantly adapt its approaches to pedigree interpretation, variant analysis, and patient education to more precisely describe both the chance and the nature of autism recurrence in terms of a continuum of brain dysfunction. These efforts will have implications for multiple practice areas and require philosophical changes for experienced practitioners and for the training of new genetic counselors. Resetting entrenched dichotomous notions about autism and other brain-based manifestations of genetic conditions will require a strategic educational effort on the part of the genetic counseling profession."}, {"Title": "Modelling intentions to provide smoking cessation support among mental health professionals in the Netherlands.", "Abstract": "Tobacco use prevalence is elevated among people with mental illnesses, leading to elevated rates of premature smoking-related mortality. Opportunities to encourage smoking cessation among them are currently underused by mental health professionals. In this paper, we aim to explore mechanisms to invigorate professionals' intentions to help patients stop smoking.\nData stem from a recent staff survey on the provision of smoking cessation support to patients with mental illnesses in the Netherlands. Items and underlying constructs were based on the theory of planned behaviour and literature on habitual behaviour. Data were weighted and only data from staff members with regular patient contact (n\u2009=\u2009506) were included. Descriptive statistics of the survey items are presented and in a second step using structural equation modelling (SEM), we regressed the latent variables attitudes, subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioural control (PBC), past cessation support behaviour (PB) and current smoking behaviour on intentions to provide support. In optimisation steps, models comprising a subset of this initial model were evaluated.\nA sample of 506 mental health workers who had direct contact with patients completed the survey. The majority of them were females (70.0\u00a0%), respondents had an average age of 42.5\u00a0years (SD\u2009=\u200912.0). Seventy-five percent had at least a BSc educational background. Of the respondents, 76\u00a0% indicated that patients should be encouraged more to quit smoking. Respondents were supportive to train their direct colleagues to provide cessation support more often (71\u00a0%) and\u00a0also supported the involvement of mental health care facilities in providing cessation support to patients (69\u00a0%). The majority of the respondents feels capable to provide cessation support (66\u00a0%). Two thirds of the respondents wants to provide support, however only a minority (35\u00a0%) intends to actually do so during the coming year. Next, using SEM an acceptable fit was found of the constructs derived from the theory of planned behaviour and literature on habitual behaviour to the weighted data (\u03c7 (2) (322)\u2009=\u20091188, p\u2009<\u2009.001; RMSEA\u2009=\u20090.067; CFI\u2009=\u20090.983), after removal of insignificant latent variables (SN and current smoking) and inclusion of covariates. Attitudes, PBC and PB of staff are the strongest identified correlates of intention toward providing cessation support to patients. SN and staff smoking behaviour were found to be weaker, non-significant correlates.\nTo nudge staff towards providing cessation support to people with mental illnesses one should aim at influencing attitudes and perceived behavioural control."}, {"Title": "Effect of changing journal clubs from traditional method to evidence-based method on psychiatry residents.", "Abstract": "Journal club is a valuable educational tool in the medical field.

Professionals undertaking the challenging task of assessing the child's credibility need to rely upon approved evaluation methods. The Criteria-Based Content Analysis is a tool developed to assess the truthfulness of a child's verbal statement. This field-based study explores its validity and its limitations. Three independent experts rated the verbatim statements of 60 real-life alleged victims of sexual abuse. The CBCA scoring and final assessment of credibility were linked to the outcomes: confirmed or unconfirmed allegation of sexual abuse. Inter-rater reliability coefficient was 0.74. The average overall accuracy rate corresponding to confirmed and unconfirmed cases was 75%. Among the confirmed allegations, the accuracy rate reached 90%, whereas the probability of discriminating the true negative cases within the unconfirmed cases was lower than chance level. Of all the 19 criteria, items 6 \"Reproduction of conversation\" and 12 \"Accounts of subjective mental state\" were the strongest predictors of genuine accounts. A significant association between age and CBCA scores was noted, the effect of age on CBCA scores was strongest in the unconfirmed cases. Although some may argue that the validity of the CBCA is reasonably acceptable, results from this field study are less convincing. Increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the CBCA by adding new criteria, so as to raise the percentage of correct classifications in the confirmed accounts as well as in the unconfirmed accounts, would represent a major improvement."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant-like effects of scopolamine in mice are enhanced by the group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495.", "Abstract": "Clinical studies have shown that the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine induces a potent and rapid antidepressant effect relative to conventional antidepressants. However, potential undesirable effects, including memory impairment, partially limit the use of scopolamine in psychiatry. In the present study, we propose to overcome these limitations and enhance the therapeutic effects of scopolamine via administration in combination with the group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist, LY341495. Joint administration of sub-effective doses of scopolamine (0.03 or 0.1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) with a sub-effective dose of LY341495 (0.1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) induced a profound antidepressant effect in the tail suspension test (TST) and in the forced swim test (FST) in mice. This drug combination did not impair memory, as measured using the Morris water maze (MWM), and did not influence the locomotor activity of mice. Furthermore, we found that an AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX (10\u00a0mg/kg), completely reversed the antidepressant-like activity of a mixture of scopolamine and LY341495 in the TST. However, this effect was not influenced by para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) pre-treatment, indicating a lack of involvement of serotonergic system activation in the antidepressant-like effects of jointly given scopolamine and LY341495. Therefore, the combined administration of low doses of the antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495 might be a new, effective and safe strategy in the therapy of depression."}, {"Title": "Decline in Consultant Availability in Massachusetts Emergency Departments: 2005 to 2014.", "Abstract": "Emergency department (ED) consultation is a common practice.

This study evaluated autonomic modulation in dementia patients with and without autonomic involvement, employing ECG spectral analysis in the time-frequency domain (wavelet transform) in supine resting and head-up tilt (HUT) position. Thirty-six patients were prospectively evaluated at the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, General Hospital of the City of Linz, between 2009 and 2014. A standard cardiovascular autonomic test series (Ewing battery) was performed to screen for autonomic dysfunction. The Ewing battery diagnoses were used as reference standard and compared to the diagnostic results obtained by spectral analysis (time-frequency domain) of ECG recordings. Based on the Ewing battery results, 14 patients suffered autonomic dysfunction, while 22 did not. Time frequency domain was accessed by using the continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) with an analytical Morlet mother wavelet in supine resting and HUT position. Within each cohort the modification of spectral components from supine resting to HUT was analyzed reflecting the autonomic modulation. For patients without autonomic dysfunction, a significant increase of autonomic modulation was detected by wavelet transformed ECG recordings (8%, p\u200a<\u200a0.05; low frequency content) during HUT compared to supine resting. There was no significant modulation between HUT and supine resting in patients suffering autonomic dysfunction. In dementia patients suffering autonomic dysfunction, CWT identified blunted autonomic regulation only by analysis of ECG recordings without the need to assess other biosignals or tests depending on the patient's cooperation. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether CWT is a suitable method to support the standard Ewing battery in demented patients."}, {"Title": "Effectiveness of psychotherapeutic consultation in the workplace: a controlled observational trial.", "Abstract": "This study compares the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic consultation in the workplace (PSIW) with psychotherapeutic outpatient care (PSOC) in Germany.\nWork ability (WAI), quality of life (SF-12), clinical symptoms (PHQ) and work-related stress (MBI, IS) were assessed in 367 patients seeking mental health care via two routes (PSIW n\u2009=\u2009174; PSOC n\u2009=\u2009193) before consultation and 12\u00a0weeks later.

Yet few have intentionally explored such judgements to gain a deeper understanding of how the process works or how these judgements might interact to influence engagement with and interpretation of feedback. Using the educational alliance framework, we sought to elaborate an understanding of learners' credibility judgements and their consequences.\nUsing constructivist grounded theory we conducted semi-structured interviews with psychiatry residents. We used a theoretical sampling approach that invited participants with diverse scores based on a previously published feedback survey and an investigator-developed educational alliance inventory. Consistent with the principles of grounded theory analysis, data were collected and analysed in an iterative process to identify themes.\nParticipants depicted themselves as actively contemplating feedback and considering it thoughtfully in light of complex judgements regarding their supervisor, the relationship with their supervisor and the larger context in which the feedback interactions were occurring. These judgements focused on the supervisor's credibility both as a clinician and as a partner in the educational alliance. The educational alliance is judged by trainees in relation to the supervisor's engagement as an educator, commitment to promoting growth of residents and positive attitude toward them.\nOur findings suggest that credibility is a multifaceted judgement that occurs not only at the moment of the feedback interaction but early in and throughout an educational relationship. It not only affects a learner's engagement with a particular piece of feedback at the moment of delivery, but also has consequences for future engagement with (or avoidance of) further learning interactions with the supervisor. These findings can help medical educators develop a more meaningful understanding of the context in which feedback takes place."}, {"Title": "The intensity and correlates of the feelings of loneliness in people with psychosis.", "Abstract": "Loneliness is an established risk factor for numerous negative health outcomes.

The two groups were matched for socio-demographic characteristics.\nThe patient sample proved to be significantly lonelier than the general population sample. The higher level of loneliness in people with psychotic disorders was most strongly related to psychosocial factors, particularly more severe internalized stigma and lesser social support, followed by worse interpersonal competence and smaller social network. After adjusting for socio-demographic and psychosocial variables, the only clinical variable significantly associated with more intense feelings of loneliness turned out to be the greater number of psychiatric inpatient admissions. The findings did not lend support to the view that socio-demographics play a major role in explaining variation in loneliness in psychosis.\nPeople with psychotic disorders are predisposed to experiencing elevated levels of loneliness. To counteract the pernicious effects of this on their health and well-being, there is a need for comprehensive therapeutic programs targeting self-stigma, enhancing social support networks and improving social skills."}, {"Title": "Understanding the experience of care managers and relationship with patient outcomes: the COMPASS initiative.", "Abstract": "To understand how care managers implemented COMPASS and if this was related to patient health outcomes.\nA total of 96 COMPASS care managers were approached to participate in the online survey and 93 (97%) provided responses.

It causes a mean loss of life expectancy of 22\u00a0years. Actual models of psychosis do not trace the beginning of psychosis to the first franc psychotic episode only, but to earlier symptoms. In a classical health system only considering the first psychotic episode, the mean duration of untreated illness (DUI) can last several years. Yet this DUI has a direct impact on the prognosis of the disease. Actual international recommendations prescribe to early detect and treat at risk mental states of psychosis, thus reducing DUI. Such an attitude also helps the patient to integrate care in a moment where she/he is fully in condition to consent and to adhere. Generalist practitioners are crucial actors of early detection. We describe here simple and standardized tools helping early detection of high-risk mental states of psychosis in primary care and the appropriate attitude to do it properly. Numerous countries have developed early detection and treatment centers for psychosis.

This article shows how triangulation of research methods strengthens scholars' ability (1) to draw conclusions from smaller data sets and facilitate comparisons of what suffering means across contexts; (2) to unpack the complexities of ethnographic and narrative data by way of interdigitating narratives with standardized evaluations of psychological distress; and (3) to enhance the translatability of narrative data to interventionists and to make anthropological research more accessible to policymakers. The crux of this argument is based on two discrete case studies, one community sample of Nicaraguan grandmothers in urban Nicaragua, and another clinic-based study of Mexican immigrant women in urban United States, which represent different populations, methodologies, and instruments. Yet, both authors critically examine narrative data and then use the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to further unpack meaning of psychological suffering by analyzing symptomatology.

The detection of suicidal residents relied more on the whole staff and less on the psychologist alone when compared to nursing homes without trained staff. A significantly larger number of measures were taken to manage suicidal residents in the trained nursing homes. Suicidal residents were more frequently referred to the psychologist. Trained nursing homes put in place significantly more suicide prevention measures at an institutional level.\nHaving trained gatekeepers has an impact not only for the trained individuals but also for the whole institution where they work, both in terms of managing suicidal residents and routine suicide prevention measures."}, {"Title": "Pediatric Palliative Care and Child Psychiatry: A Model for Enhancing Practice and Collaboration.", "Abstract": "As the field of Pediatric Palliative Care continues to develop, it is important to consider the scope of practice and the utility of collaboration with other specialties, including child and adolescent psychiatry. The integration of psychiatry and palliative medicine has been explored in adult practice, but has not yet been elaborated in pediatrics. This article proposes a clinical model of care that highlights the overlapping and unique expertise that each discipline brings, in a continuum of collaboration, and proposes an integrated care model for the most complex patients and families. Case examples are used to define specific professional skills and roles, and to describe shared and distinct clinical approaches used by pediatric palliative care and child psychiatry. Effective collaboration provides opportunities for cross-disciplinary educational exchange and enhanced care of children and families with comorbid mental health issues and serious illness."}, {"Title": "[Where is going philosophy of psychiatry ?].", "Abstract": "This contribution provides a critical outline of the current trends in the field of \"philosophy of psychiatry\" by following their developments in the last decade. The first part of the paper focuses on the evolution of this field from a strictly conceptual approach to a perspective more attentive to the social, practical, and clinical dimension of psychiatry. The second part of the paper points out that the need of a mutual commitment of philosophy and psychiatry is perceived according to different ways by the countries involved in this research area. The paper deals especially with the case of France, where the enthusiasm for the \"new philosophy of psychiatry\" has not had the same impact on the philosophical scene as in the English speaking countries. In conclusion, the paper shows that the field of philosophy of psychiatry stands as a fertile ground for new forms of interaction between the analytic, and the continental philosophical traditions. This interaction takes place, more particularly, as regards such topics as normativity, language, and interpretation."}, {"Title": "[The Research Domain Criteria (Rdoc), reductionism and clinical psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The focus of the advocates of the Research Domain Critria (RDoC) on faulty brain circuits has led some to suspect it of being a reductionist enterprise. And because RDoC will eventually impact clinical psychiatry, some have feared that it will transform clinical psychiatry in a mindless and applied neurobehavioral science. We argue that if RDoC is officially endorsing a kind of reductionism, the particular kind of reductionism it endorses is not suffering from the shortcomings of more classical forms of reductionism. Because of that, at least in principle, RDoC could enrich rather than impoverish clinical psychiatry. This paper raises few potential problems of the RDoC for clinical psychiatry caused by its implicit epistemological reductionism."}, {"Title": "[Natural or interactive kinds?

Professor at the Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts after Michel Foucault, Hacking is the author of a reflection on the classification of mental disorders, which arises from the problem of the natural kinds. In order to explain the case studies developed in Hacking's Paris lectures, we first go back to the definition of a series of concepts, then we discuss the status of his scientific metaphors. Finally we analyze the relationship between the notions, respectively, of \"transient mental illness\" and \"culture-bound syndrome\".

We outline some questions raised by disturbances typical of psychotic disorders with regard to a phenomenology of the everyday and common sense. As a link between philosophy and clinical psychopathology, this phenomenology implies a transcendental point of view, embedded in concrete and practical forms of ordinary experience, along with social norms. This opens the possibility of a mutual questioning between philosophy and psychiatry, drawing on its clinical, epistemological, and ethical dimensions."}, {"Title": "[On Michel Foucault's unpublished lectures on Ludwig Binswanger's existential analysis (Lille 1953-54)].", "Abstract": "This paper aims to analyze Michel Foucault's position toward phenomenological psychology and psychopathology during the 1950s, in light of the new documentary sources available today. Our investigation is especially focused on one of the courses given by Foucault at the University of Lille between 1952 and 1954, namely, the course on \"Binswanger and phenomenology\" (1953-54). The analysis of this course, which was conceived by Foucault within the context of a philosophical reflection on the anthropological problem of psychopathology, will finally allow us to re-ascribe Foucault the place he deserves in the field of \"philosophy of psychiatry\"."}, {"Title": "[Philosophy against psychiatry, right up against it].", "Abstract": "Since the early 1990s, there has been a tremendous new interest at the international level for researches at the crossroad between philosophy and psychiatry.

Method: In a retrospective study done between 2013 and 2015, any refugees showing symptoms of a psychiatric disorder during their stay in a residential refugee center were referred to an Outpatient Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for diagnostic assessment. To this end, special consultation hours were arranged. Besides the diagnoses, the number of emergency consultations occurring before and after the implementation of the special consultation hours was recorded.\nOf the 75 refugee minors (75 %) referred, 56 were suffering from a psychiatric disorder, with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression being the most common diagnoses. Following implementation of the consultation hours, the number of refugee patients initially admitted in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry on an emergency basis fell.\nUnaccompanied refugee minors are a highly vulnerable group that poses great challenges to clinical care. The implementation of special consultation hours is a constructive option for meeting these challenges. In particular, this special offer enables improvement of crisis management in the case of emergency consultations."}, {"Title": "The promises and pitfalls of applying computational models to neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Computational models have become an integral part of basic neuroscience and have facilitated some of the major advances in the field. More recently, such models have also been applied to the understanding of disruptions in brain function. In this review, using examples and a simple analogy, we discuss the potential for computational models to inform our understanding of brain function and dysfunction. We argue that they may provide, in unprecedented detail, an understanding of the neurobiological and mental basis of brain disorders and that such insights will be key to progress in diagnosis and treatment. However, there are also potential problems attending this approach. We highlight these and identify simple principles that should always govern the use of computational models in clinical neuroscience, noting especially the importance of a clear specification of a model's purpose and of the mapping between mathematical concepts and reality."}, {"Title": "Bullying, hazing, and workplace harassment: the nexus in professional sports as exemplified by the first NFL Wells report.", "Abstract": "In the sporting context there is a significant nexus between adult workplace harassment and two other critical, developmentally related areas, that of child and adolescent bullying, and college hazing. These are all addressed, albeit obliquely and perhaps inadvertently, in the Miami Dolphins saga and the subsequent NFL Wells Report of 2013-2014. This is a significant document. It is even a brave, if politically expedient milestone. It evaluates the complex inter-personal and inter- and intra-systemic contributions within a sporting organization. Wells also elucidates a case where there is overlapping damage to individuals and systems as a result of malignant bullying, harassment, and hazing within overlapping systems. Constructive approaches to team building, and other positive alternatives to hazing may be the best place to initiate trust and verify institutional change at all these levels."}, {"Title": "No Association of Lower Hippocampal Volume With Alzheimer's Disease Pathology in Late-Life Depression.", "Abstract": "Hippocampal volume is commonly decreased in late-life depression. According to the depression-as-late-life-neuropsychiatric-disorder model, lower hippocampal volume in late-life depression is associated with neurodegenerative changes. The purpose of this prospective study was to examine whether lower hippocampal volume in late-life depression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology.\nOf 108 subjects who participated, complete, good-quality data sets were available for 100: 48 currently depressed older adults and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy comparison subjects who underwent structural MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography imaging, apolipoprotein E genotyping, and neuropsychological assessment. Hippocampal volumes were defined manually and normalized for total intracranial volume. Amyloid binding was quantified using the standardized uptake value ratio in one cortical composite volume of interest. The authors investigated group differences in hippocampal volume (both including and excluding amyloid-positive participants), group differences in amyloid uptake and in the proportion of positive amyloid scans, and the association between hippocampal volume and cortical amyloid uptake.\nA significant difference was observed in mean normalized total hippocampal volume between patients and comparison subjects, but there were no group differences in cortical amyloid uptake or proportion of amyloid-positive subjects. The difference in hippocampal volume remained significant after the amyloid-positive subjects were excluded. There was no association between hippocampal volume and amyloid uptake in either patients or comparison subjects.\nLower hippocampal volume was not related to amyloid pathology in this sample of patients with late-life depression. These data counter the common belief that changes in hippocampal volume in late-life depression are due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease."}, {"Title": "Assessing the usefulness of electroencephalography in psychiatry: Outcome of referrals at a psychiatric hospital.", "Abstract": "This retrospective study was conducted at Sterkfontein psychiatric hospital in Gauteng. The objectives included investigating reasons for referral to conduct an electroencephalography (EEG) and to determine whether EEG findings have impact on clinical management. Source data included EEG reports over an 18-month period and clinical records. The total sample was 85 adult inpatients (53 males; 32 females). Seizure disorder exclusion was the main reason for EEG referral (69.0%). Seventy-four (87.0%) records were normal, 7 (8.2%) were abnormal, 2 (2.4%) were inconclusive and 2 (2.4%) EEG reports were unavailable. There was no statistically significant correlation between abnormal EEG results and demographic variables, symptoms, admission diagnosis and medications. EEG recording demonstrated a low yield of abnormal results. In this study, EEG results did not appear to influence the treating psychiatrists regarding management, but this could be as a result of the small sample size. As interactions between psychiatric conditions and epilepsy are important and well established, negative EEGs are indeed useful and it is recommended that clinicians should carefully consider which patients should be referred for EEGs."}, {"Title": "Compulsivity Across the Pathological Misuse of Drug and Non-Drug Rewards.", "Abstract": "Behavioral adaptation is required for the successful navigation of a constantly changing environment. Impairments in behavioral flexibility are commonly observed in psychiatric disorders including those of addiction. This study investigates two distinct facets of compulsivity, namely reversal learning and attentional set shifting, implicating orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal regions respectively, across disorders of primary and secondary rewards. Obese subjects with and without binge eating disorder (BED), individuals with compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB), alcohol dependence (AD) and pathological video-gaming (VG) were tested with two computerized tasks: the probabilistic reversal task (trials to criterion and win-stay/lose-shift errors) and the intra/extra-dimensional set shift task (IED). Individuals with AD and pathological VG were slower at reversal learning irrespective of valence, with AD subjects more likely to perseverate after losses. Compared to obese subjects without BED, BED subjects were worse at reversal learning to wins but better at losses highlighting valence effects as a function of binge eating. CSB subjects demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to reward outcomes with faster acquisition and greater perseveration with higher magnitude rewards. We further show an impairment in attentional set shifting in individuals with BED and AD relative to healthy volunteers (HV). This study provides evidence for commonalities and differences in two distinct dimensions of behavioral inflexibility across disorders of compulsivity. We summarize studies on compulsivity subtypes within this same patient population. We emphasize commonalities in AD and BED with impairments across a range of compulsivity indices, perhaps supporting pathological binge eating as a form of behavioral addiction. We further emphasize commonalities in reversal learning across disorders and the crucial role of valence effects. These findings highlight the role of behavioral inflexibility and compulsivity as a relevant domain in defining dimensional psychiatry and the identification of relevant cognitive endophenotypes as targets for therapeutic modulation."}, {"Title": "The effect of cross-sex hormonal treatment on gender dysphoria individuals' mental health: a systematic review.", "Abstract": "Cross-sex hormonal treatment represents a main aspect of gender dysphoria health care pathway. However, it is still debated whether this intervention translates into a better mental well-being for the individual and which mechanisms may underlie this association. Although sex reassignment surgery has been the subject of extensive investigation, few studies have specifically focused on hormonal treatment in recent years. Here, we systematically review all studies examining the effect of cross-sex hormonal treatment on mental health and well-being in gender dysphoria. Research tends to support the evidence that hormone therapy reduces symptoms of anxiety and dissociation, lowering perceived and social distress and improving quality of life and self-esteem in both male-to-female and female-to-male individuals. Instead, compared to female-to-male individuals, hormone-treated male-to-female individuals seem to benefit more in terms of a reduction in their body uneasiness and personality-related psychopathology and an amelioration of their emotional functioning. Less consistent findings support an association between hormonal treatment and other mental health-related dimensions. In particular, depression, global psychopathology, and psychosocial functioning difficulties appear to reduce only in some studies, while others do not suggest any improvement in these domains. Results from longitudinal studies support more consistently the association between hormonal treatment and improved mental health. On the contrary, a number of cross-sectional studies do not support this evidence. This review provides possible biological explanation vs psychological explanation (direct effect vs indirect effect) for the hormonal treatment-induced better mental well-being. In conclusion, this review indicates that gender dysphoria-related mental distress may benefit from hormonal treatment intervention, suggesting a transient reaction to the nonsatisfaction connected to the incongruent body image rather than a stable psychiatric comorbidity. In this perspective, timely hormonal treatment intervention represents a crucial issue in gender dysphoria individuals' mental health-related outcome."}, {"Title": "Editorial: Bayesian benefits for child psychology and psychiatry researchers.", "Abstract": "For many scientists, performing statistical tests has become an almost automated routine. However, p-values are frequently used and interpreted incorrectly; and even when used appropriately, p-values tend to provide answers that do not match researchers' questions and hypotheses well. Bayesian statistics present an elegant and often more suitable alternative. The Bayesian approach has rarely been applied in child psychology and psychiatry research so far, but the development of user-friendly software packages and tutorials has placed it well within reach now.

It remains unknown, however, whether this is a valid method for assessing competence in the management of agitation.\nTwenty-six psychiatry residents partook in a randomized controlled study evaluating a simulation-based teaching intervention on the management of agitated patients. Competence in the management of agitation was assessed using three separate modalities: simulation with SPs, open-ended clinical vignettes, and self-report questionnaires.\nPerformance on clinical vignettes correlated significantly with SP-based assessments (r\u2009=\u20090.59, p\u2009=\u20090.002); self-report questionnaires that assessed one's own ability to manage agitation did not correlate with SP-based assessments (r\u2009=\u2009-0.06, p\u2009=\u20090.77).\nStandardized clinical vignettes may be a simple, time-efficient, and valid tool for assessing residents' competence in the management of agitation."}, {"Title": "Off-Label Prescription of Psychopharmacological Drugs in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to describe the frequency of off-label prescriptions of psychopharmacological drugs in a child and adolescent psychiatric setting. A cross-sectional study was conducted on November 1, 2014, including all inpatients and outpatients at the Mental Health Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Capital Region of Denmark, aged 0 to 17 years receiving medical treatment with antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, melatonin and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication. We included a total of 5555 prescriptions representing 2932 patients. The main findings were that 32.3% of all prescriptions were off-label, and 41.6% of subjects received at least 1 off-label prescription. The most frequent off-label category was low age, 72.2%, meaning that the drug was not approved for the age group of the patient. The off-label rates for each drug class were as follows: melatonin, 100%; antipsychotic agents, 95.6%; benzodiazepines, 72.5%; antidepressants, 51.1%; and ADHD medication, 2.7%. Prescription of 2 or more psychopharmacological drugs per patient was common (31.5%). The group of subjects with 4 or more prescriptions (n = 36) was characterized by a higher frequency of inpatients, older age, and a different distribution of diagnoses. This study found a frequent use of off-label prescriptions when treating children and adolescents with psychopharmacological drugs other than ADHD medication. In addition, prescription of more than 1 psychotropic drug is common. These findings support the need for extending the evidence base for psychopharmacologic treatment in children and adolescents."}, {"Title": "[Intracardial fungal multiplication of order Mucor in an almost totally carbonised part of a\u00a0male body found after ten days missing].", "Abstract": "Determination of time of death belongs to the most difficult and also the most important issues for the medical examiners, especially those who deal with violent death. Besides the most frequently evaluated postmortal changes it is sometimes possible to perform the evaluation on the basis of less frequently observed findings. One of such findings is for example the fungal multiplication on the body or in the very close vicinity. Knowledge of moulds as well as information about their speed of growth should contribute to confirmation or negation of some information gained during police investigation. In this case report authors describe the macroscopically visible fungal intracardiac multiplication in heart chambers and aorta in an almost totally carbonised body which was missing for only ten days. Based on the molecular examination it was detected that the body belonged to the 64-year-old man who was repeatedly hospitalised in psychiatry for depression with suicidal tendencies. The last hospitalisation was six weeks before death and there was no organic disability. The cause of fire was a naked flame. The cause of death was burn injury or asphyxia. The almost total carbonisation did not allow to perform toxicological investigation. By histological investigation we found the presence of wide long non-septate moulds growing in the heart muscle, which belonged to the order Mucor. Since there was no obvious inflammatory response, we suppose their growth started on the congealed blood after death."}, {"Title": "Measuring mental disorders: The failed commensuration project of DSM-5.", "Abstract": "Commensuration - the comparison of entities according to a common quantitative metric - is a key process in efforts to rationalize medicine. The push toward evidence-based medicine and quantitative assessment has led to the proliferation of metrics in healthcare. While social scientific attention has revealed the effects of these metrics once institutionalized - on clinical practice, on medical expertise, on outcome assessment, on valuations of medical services, and on experiences of illness - less attention has been paid to the process of developing metrics. This article examines the attempt to create severity scales during the revision to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a case of failed commensuration. Using data from interviews with participants in the DSM-5 revision (n\u00a0=\u00a030), I reconstruct the problems that emerged in the DSM-5 Task Force's effort to develop viable psychometric instruments to measure severity. Framed as a part of a \"paradigm shift\" in psychiatry, the revision produced ad hoc, heterogeneous severity scales with divergent logics. I focus on two significant issues of metric construction in this case - diagnostic validity and clinical utility. Typically perceived as technical and conceptual challenges of design, I show how these issues were infused with, and undermined by, professional political dynamics, specifically tensions between medical researchers and clinicians. This case reveals that, despite its association with objectivity and transparency, commensuration encompasses more than identifying, operationalizing, and measuring an entity; it demands the negotiation of extra-scientific, non-empirical concerns that get written into medical metrics themselves."}, {"Title": "Factors related to treatment compliance in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Medication non-adherence is a major problem in patients with bipolar disorder as it is associated to poor clinical outcomes with frequent relapses and consequently poor quality of life.

Furthermore, it also discourages therapy. The aim of our study was to examine associations between self-stigma and adherence to treatment and discontinuation of medication in patients from various diagnostic groups.\nThis cross-sectional study involved outpatients attending the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic. The level of self-stigma was measured with the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness and adherence with the Drug Attitude Inventory. The patients also anonymously filled out a demographic questionnaire which included a question asking whether they had discontinued their medication in the past.\nWe examined data from 332 patients from six basic diagnostic categories (substance abuse disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders). The study showed a statistically significant negative correlation between self-stigma and adherence to treatment in all diagnostic groups. Self-stigma correlated positively and adherence negatively with the severity of disorders. Another important factor affecting both variables was partnership. Self-stigma positively correlated with doses of antidepressants and adherence with doses of anxiolytics. Self-stigma also negatively correlated with education, and positively with a number of hospitalizations and number of psychiatrists visited. Adherence was further positively correlated with age and age of onset of disorders. Regression analysis showed that self-stigma was an important factor negatively influencing adherence to treatment and significantly contributing to voluntary discontinuation of drugs. The level of self-stigma did not differ between diagnostic categories. Patients suffering from schizophrenia had the lowest adherence to treatment.\nThe study showed a significant correlation between self-stigma and adherence to treatment. High levels of self-stigma are associated with discontinuation of medications without a psychiatrist's recommendation.

The authors summarize issues discussed at a recent Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration workshop at which participants highlighted the importance of going beyond CIT training to most effectively include police in a crisis care continuum model. Such an approach focuses on how police can be engaged as partners with behavioral health providers who are designing and implementing services in the crisis care continuum.

His theories, however, did not arise de novo, being strongly influenced by Karl Kahlbaum and Ewald Hecker. From the 1860-1880s, they articulated a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of psychiatric diagnosis, from symptom-based syndromes, popular since the late 18th century, to proto-disease entities. This effort was influenced by parallel developments in general medicine, especially the rise of bacterial theories of disease where different syndromes had distinctive symptoms, courses, and etiologies. Their thinking was particularly shaped by the increasing understanding of general paresis of the insane. Indeed, this disorder, with its distinct course and characteristic symptoms, was paradigmatic for them. Their hope was that a similar progression of medical understanding would evolve for the other major psychiatric syndromes. Their thinking and its connection with Kraepelin's nosology are illustrated through a close reading of their essays on hebephrenia, catatonia, and cyclic insanity. Kahlbaum, Hecker, and Kraepelin shared both a commitment to a clinical research agenda for psychiatry (to utilize methods of clinical assessment and follow-up to help define disease forms) and a skepticism for the brain-based neuropathological paradigm of psychiatric research then dominant in most European centers. Understanding the historical origins of our key diagnostic concepts can help us to evaluate their strengths and limitations. It remains to be determined whether this \"Kahlbaum-Hecker-Kraepelin paradigm\"-defining disorders based on distinctive symptoms and course-will produce psychiatric syndromes of sufficient homogeneity to yield their etiologic secrets."}, {"Title": "Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: Analysis based on the multicentre DPV registry.", "Abstract": "The interaction between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents has been studied rarely.

For example, there is increased functional connectivity (FC) within and between regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) including prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex. Alterations in network FC are associated with specific aspects of psychopathology. In mice, chronic psychosocial stress (CPS) leads to depression-relevant behavior, including increased fear learning, learned helplessness, fatigue and decreased motivation for reward. Using multimodal in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), we investigated CPS effects on function and structure in the mouse brain under light anesthesia. Mice underwent a baseline MRI/MRS session, followed by 15-day CPS (n=26) or control handling (n=27), and a post-treatment MRI/MRS session. In BOLD fMRI, relative to controls, CPS mice exhibited robust, reproducible increases in FC within 8 of 9 identified cortical networks, including the prefrontal and cingulate cortices that contribute to the \"mouse DMN\". CPS mice exhibited increases in between-network FC, including amygdala - prefrontal cortex and amygdala - cingulate cortex. MRS identified metabolic alterations in CPS mice as increased inositol levels in amygdala and increased glycerophosphorylcholine levels in prefrontal cortex. Diffusion-weighted MRI detected increased fractional anisotropic values in the cingulum. This study demonstrates that chronic psychosocial stress induces FC states in the mouse brain analogous to those observed in depression, as well as cerebral metabolism and white matter pathway alterations that contribute to understanding of pathological processes. It also demonstrates the importance of brain imaging to the establishment of valid animal models in translational psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Quality criteria of involuntary psychiatric admissions - before and after the revision of the civil code in Switzerland.", "Abstract": "The goal was to investigate the quality in terms of formal and content-based comprehensiveness of the forms for involuntary admission before and after the introduction of the new law (KESR, \"Kindes- und Erwachsenenschutzrecht\") for the regulation of involuntary admission.

The basic procedure in computational psychiatry is to build a computational model that formalizes a behavioral or neuronal process. Measured behavioral (or neuronal) responses are then used to infer the model parameters of a single subject or a group of subjects. Here, we provide an illustrative overview over this process, starting from the modeling of choice behavior in a specific task, simulating data, and then inverting that model to estimate group effects. Finally, we illustrate cross-validation to assess whether between-subject variables (e.g., diagnosis) can be recovered successfully. Our worked example uses a simple two-step maze task and a model of choice behavior based on (active) inference and Markov decision processes.

The cohort was followed for a 9- to 11-month period. The relationship between patients' status on admission and the specified outcome variables was explored.\nInformation was collected on 216 admissions, of whom 165 were discharged in the study period. Mean length of stay was 64\u2009days. Female gender, higher dependency, greater challenging behaviour and locality predicted extended stay. Forty per cent of cases experienced delayed discharge. Better physical health, more cognitive impairment, receipt of social care and locality were associated with delayed discharge. The vast majority of patients admitted from home returned there. Younger patients and patients with less dependency, cognitive impairment and challenging behaviour had a higher likelihood of returning home. Patients receiving social care or admitted because of carer stress, a risk of self-neglect, accidental self-harm or abuse/exploitation were less likely to return home.\nThe study provides a useful starting point for identifying cases on which future efforts to improve inpatient outcomes might centre and suggests local rather than national responses may be needed.

With increasing recognition that kynurenine and its metabolites can affect and even control a variety of classic neurotransmitter systems directly and indirectly, interest is expanding rapidly. Moreover, kynurenine pathway metabolism itself is modulated in conditions such as infection and stress, which are known to induce major changes in well-being and behaviour, so that kynurenines may be instrumental in the etiology of psychiatric and neurological disorders. It is therefore likely that the near future will not only witness the discovery of additional physiological and pathological roles for brain kynurenines, but also ever-increasing interest in drug development based on these roles. In particular, targeting the kynurenine pathway with new specific agents may make it possible to prevent disease by appropriate pharmacological or genetic manipulations. The following overview focuses on areas of kynurenine research which are either controversial, of major potential therapeutic interest, or just beginning to receive the degree of attention which will clarify their relevance to neurobiology and medicine. It also highlights technical issues so that investigators entering the field, and new research initiatives, are not misdirected by inappropriate experimental approaches or incorrect interpretations at this time of skyrocketing interest in the subject matter.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at a public psychiatric hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir, one of the institutions selected to be a future \"Centre of Excellence,\" this article focuses on how these reforms have affected psychiatric institutions themselves. Efforts at modernizing and increasing access to mental health care-that is, emphasizing shortened stays, increasing outpatient treatment, and providing care in the \"community\"-depend on quarantining stigmatized, chronically ill, long-term patients who reside in custodial conditions with fewer resources and limited attention from providers. Psychiatrists have a radically different vision for redressing manpower shortages than the MGMH and Indian state, revealing contradictions in the reform process.

When disinhibited, this network biases behavior towards reflexive defense reactions. While well characterized in rodent models, little is known about this system in the primate brain. Employing focal pharmacological manipulations, we have previously shown that activation of the DLSC triggers reflexive defensive responses, including cowering, escape behaviors and defensive vocalizations. Here, we show that activation of the DLSC also disrupts normal dyadic social interactions between familiar pairs of monkeys. When the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) was inhibited concurrent with DLSC activation, cowering behavior was attenuated, whereas escape behaviors and defensive vocalizations were not. Moreover, inhibition of the BLA, previously shown to produce a profound increase in dyadic social interactions, was unable to normalize the decrease in social behavior resulting from DLSC activation.

To examine the degree to which the scientific community has recognized interoception as a construct of interest, we identified and individually screened all articles published in the English language on interoception and associated root terms in Pubmed, Psychinfo, and ISI Web of Knowledge. This search revealed that interoception is a multifaceted process that is being increasingly studied within the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, and biomedical science. To illustrate the multifaceted nature of interoception, we provide a focused review of one of the most commonly studied interoceptive channels, the cardiovascular system, and give a detailed comparison of the most popular methods used to study cardiac interoception. We subsequently review evidence of interoceptive dysfunction in panic disorder, depression, somatic symptom disorders, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. For each disorder, we suggest how interoceptive predictions constructed by the brain may erroneously bias individuals to express key symptoms and behaviors, and outline questions that are suitable for the development of neuroscience-based mental health interventions.

The medical records of all patients with epilepsy who were diagnosed by a neuropsychiatrist as having a psychotic disorder at the Royal Melbourne Hospital from January 1993 to June 2015 were reviewed. Data were extracted regarding epilepsy and its treatment, psychotic symptoms profile and outcome. The diagnosis of epilepsy was established in accordance to the classification system of the International League Against Epilepsy while that of psychotic disorder was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition and the proposal on neuropsychiatric disorders in epilepsy. Patients with antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder were compared to those with psychotic disorders unrelated to antiepileptic drugs assessed over the same period (non-antiepileptic drug induced psychotic disorder group). Univariate comparisons were performed and variables with a value of P < 0.1 were selected for the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The records of 2630 in-patients and outpatients with epilepsy were screened, from which 98 (3.7%) with psychotic disorders were identified.

However, it is not clear whether patients in RTW programmes actually do differ from patients in regular services.\nThis study compared 270 patients treated in an RTW outpatient clinic and 86 patients treated in a regular outpatient clinic, both in specialized mental health care, on patient characteristics, history of treatment and mental health status. Analyses of differences between groups were done by ANOVA tests, chi-square test and logistic regression.\nPatients in the RTW clinic had lower scores on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). There was no difference in health-related quality of life. RTW patients were somewhat older and more likely to live in relationships and have children, and they had higher incomes. Work participation, previous psychiatric hospitalization and present diagnosis contributed uniquely to an explanation of which patients were included in the respective clinics. The RTW clinic seems to reach its intended target group. Almost all of the patients in this group participated in the work arena, and their psychopathologies were clearly dominated by common mental disorders. Most RTW patients' general practitioners had followed them fairly closely in the year before referral, suggesting previous attempts at treatment in primary care settings.\nRelative to outpatients in a specialized mental health care setting, RTW patients had lower symptoms, but still in the same moderate range of severity. They suffered the same reduction in quality of life. Almost all of the RTW patients were diagnosed with illnesses that can be treated effectively, about half of them had recurring mental health problems and many of them had been treated in primary care settings before referral.

There is also limited knowledge of providing tactile massage in child and adolescent psychiatry. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper describes 10 nurses' experiences of tactile massage as a nursing intervention in child and adolescent psychiatry. The nurses considered tactile massage a non-verbal nursing intervention that could complement other available treatments. It reveals their reflections on the impact of tactile massage on their nursing and on themselves as a person, including the belief that they had developed deepened self-reflection and attentiveness. The nurses highlighted the importance of providing a trusting environment and collaborating with the children and adolescents. They both experienced and observed that tactile massage triggered various physical and mental processes in the children and adolescents, such as improvement in sleep disturbances, an ability to relax in body and mind and a deeper connectedness with their own bodies and feelings. The nurses described instructing next of kin in the use of tactile massage, which they believed could serve as a tool at home, mainly as a way for next of kin to help their children to relax, fall asleep more easily and to deepen connectedness. However, the nurses stressed the need to consider if it was appropriate or desired by the children and adolescents. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Tactile massage addresses the individual's emotional and physiological responses and could therefore bring holistic nursing to child and adolescent psychiatry. It could also help nurses in child and adolescent psychiatry to develop their attentiveness and sensitivity in acknowledging the needs of children and adolescents in psychiatric care.\nIntroduction There is limited research on tactile massage in child and adolescent psychiatry and no studies investigating experiences of providing tactile massage in child and adolescent psychiatry were found. Aim The aim was therefore to describe nurses' experiences of providing tactile massage as a nursing intervention in child and adolescent psychiatry.

Attentiveness to and respect for the integrity of the children and adolescents were essential for creating a trusting relationship with them. Tactile massage was found to trigger various physical and mental processes in the children and adolescents. The nurses reflected on the impact of tactile massage on their nursing and on themselves as a person, stating that it had led to the development of self-reflection and attentiveness. Implications for practice Tactile massage addresses the individual's emotional and physiological responses and could therefore bring holistic nursing to child and adolescent psychiatry. It might also enhance attentiveness and sensitivity on the part of child and adolescent psychiatry nurses when acknowledging the needs of children and adolescents in psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Obsessive States: Aesthetics, Erotism, and Fantasy.", "Abstract": "Starting from his early writings, Freud devoted much thought to \"obsessional neurosis\" and continued developing this theme for more than thirty years. However, unlike the disorder hysteria, which in recent years has regained its honorable status in psychoanalytic literature, obsessional neurosis has been continually neglected and relegated to the fields of psychiatry and behavioral psychology, which emphasize the symptomatic and the overt. This process, by clinging to the objective aspects of obsessional neurosis and disassociating it from the instincts and from its historical sources, may itself be deemed obsessive. This paper suggests that obsessive processes should be viewed as structuring a distinct psychic state pertinent to analysis even when obsessive symptoms are not clearly present or apparent. Freud's conceptualizations thus become more flexibly and widely applicable, allowing the analyst once again to relate to the patient's inner world and to the original, implicit essence of obsession, relying less significantly on what is outwardly apparent. The paper will elaborate on three aspects of this \"obsessive state\": aesthetics, eroticism, and fantasy. Finally, the value of the notion of obsessive psychic states will be reassessed in the broader context of the role of sexuality in psychoanalytic theory."}, {"Title": "Esquirol's change of view towards Pinel's mania without delusion.", "Abstract": "We recount how Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol (1772-1840) gradually changed his position towards what Philipe Pinel (1745-1826) referred to as mania without delusion. Between 1805 and 1838, Esquirol moved from outright rejection, questioning the very idea of insane persons committing motiveless acts of violence without delusion, to relative acceptance. He eventually incorporated the clinical characteristics of mania without delusion in his description of homicidal monomania, dividing them between reasoning monomania and instinctive monomania. We examine this change by detailing each of Esquirol's points of disagreement, which decreased sharply between the completion of his thesis in 1805 and the publication of his chapter on homicidal monomania in 1838."}, {"Title": "God in the brain: Experiencing psychosis in the postsecular United States.", "Abstract": "There is a growing literature on what contemporary cultural theorists have broadly termed the \"postsecular\": the abandonment of clear-cut boundaries between the secular and nonsecular in the industrialized West and an embrace of a complex understanding of what is real that neither accepts nor rejects the supernatural. These new cultural currents may affect not only philosophers and theologians, but also the ways in which individuals with psychosis make sense of their experiences. This paper reports on the key findings of an in-depth qualitative analysis of 19 interviews of individuals diagnosed with psychotic disorders. The majority of participants described ongoing and self-conscious struggles to demarcate their experiences as the products of the real world or a \"crazy\" mind. With equal frequency, participants weighed and debated competing secular and supernatural explanations, often juxtaposing and blending different explanatory frameworks. We found that this syncretic process affected not only the content of psychotic experiences-what delusions or hallucinations are about-but also the type of arguments or logics used to justify particular interpretations. We discuss the implications of these observations with respect to clinical practice and the broader phenomenology of psychosis, challenging often oversimplified discourse on \"insight\" and suggesting that polarization(s) between \"biomedical\" and \"psychosocial\" explanations may be of less relevance to patients' real-world experiences than is often assumed."}, {"Title": "Digital applications: the future in psychiatry?", "Abstract": "Digital applications and new mobile technologies can change the nature of the psychiatrist-patient relationship and future clinical practice in terms of diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment, but need to be further studied.

We describe herein a case in which the development of zolpidem-induced sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) and SRCB was strongly suspected. A 71-year-old Korean male was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry due to his repetitive SRED and SRCB with anterograde amnesia, which he reported as having occurred since taking zolpidem. The patient also had restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). His baseline serum iron level was low at admission. Zolpidem discontinuation resulted in the immediate disappearance of his SRED, but did not affect his RLS symptoms. These symptoms rapidly improved after adding a single i.v. iron injection once daily, and so he was discharged to day-clinic treatment. These findings indicate that zolpidem can induce SRCB. Although the pathophysiology of zolpidem-induced SRED and other SRCB remains unclear, clinicians should carefully monitor for the potential induction of complex behaviors associated with zolpidem in patients with comorbid RLS or OSA."}, {"Title": "Fecal Microbiota Transplantation and Its Usage in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplantation has a 1700-year history.

Copy-number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in a number of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders; however, the proportion of heritability in developmental coordination disorder (DCD) attributed to CNVs has not been explored.\nThis study aims to investigate how CNVs may contribute to the genetic architecture of DCD.\nCNV analysis was performed on 82 extensively phenotyped Canadian children with DCD, with or without co-occurring ADHD and/or reading disorder, and 2988 healthy European controls using identical genome-wide SNP microarrays and CNV calling algorithms.\nAn increased rate of large and rare genic CNVs (p=0.009) was detected, and there was an enrichment of duplications spanning brain-expressed genes (p=0.039) and genes previously implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders (p=0.043). Genes and loci of particular interest in this group included: GAP43, RBFOX1, PTPRN2, SHANK3, 16p11.2 and distal 22q11.2. Although no recurrent CNVs were identified, 26% of DCD cases, where sample availability permitted segregation analysis, were found to have a de novo rare CNV. Of the inherited CNVs, 64% were from a parent who also had a neurodevelopmental disorder.\nThese findings suggest that there may be shared susceptibility genes for DCD and other neurodevelopmental disorders and highlight the need for thorough phenotyping when investigating the genetics of neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, these data provide compelling evidence supporting a genetic basis for DCD, and further implicate rare CNVs in the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Home-Based Psychiatric Outpatient Care Through Videoconferencing for Depression: A Randomized Controlled Follow-Up Trial.", "Abstract": "There is a tremendous opportunity for innovative mental health care solutions such as psychiatric care through videoconferencing to increase the number of people who have access to quality care. However, studies are needed to generate empirical evidence on the use of psychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and clinically unsupervised settings.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of home-based treatment for mild depression through psychiatric consultations via videoconferencing.\nA randomized controlled trial with a 6- and 12-month follow-up including adults with mild depression treated in an ambulatory setting was conducted. In total, 107 participants were randomly allocated to the videoconferencing intervention group (n=53) or the face-to-face group (F2F; n=54). The groups did not differ with respect to demographic characteristics at baseline. The F2F group completed monthly follow-up consultations in person. The videoconferencing group received monthly follow-up consultations with a psychiatrist through videoconferencing at home. At baseline and after 6 and 12 months, in-person assessments were conducted with all participants. Clinical outcomes (severity of depression, mental health status, medication course, and relapses), satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic relationship, treatment adherence (appointment compliance and dropouts), and medication adherence were assessed.\nThe severity of depression decreased significantly over the 12-month follow-up in both the groups. There was a significant difference between groups regarding treatment outcomes throughout the follow-up period, with better results in the videoconferencing group. There were 4 relapses in the F2F group and only 1 in the videoconferencing group. No significant differences between groups regarding mental health status, satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic relationship, treatment adherence, or medication compliance were found. However, after 6 months, the rate of dropouts was significantly higher in the F2F group (18.5% vs 5.7% in the videoconferencing group, P<.05).\nPsychiatric treatment through videoconferencing in clinically unsupervised settings can be considered feasible and as effective as standard care (in-person treatment) for depressed outpatients with respect to clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, therapeutic relationship, treatment adherence, and medication compliance. These results indicate the potential of telepsychiatry to extend access to psychiatric care to remote and underserved populations.\nClinicaltrials.gov NCT01901315; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01901315 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6jBTrIVwg)."}, {"Title": "Alcohol and Opioid Use Disorder in Older Adults: Neglected and Treatable Illnesses.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and opioid use disorder (OUD) in older adults for general psychiatrists. The rapid growth of the geriatric population in the USA has wide-ranging implications as the baby boomer generation ages. Various types of substance use disorders (SUDs) are common in older adults, and they often take a greater toll on affected older adults than on younger adults. Due to multiple reasons, SUDs in older adults are often under-reported, under-detected, and under-treated. Older adults often use substances, which leads to various clinical problems. Space limitations prevents a comprehensive review; therefore, we primarily focus on alcohol use disorder and the problem of opioid use disorder, with more emphasis given to the latter, because the opioid use epidemic in the USA has gained much attention. We reviewed the literature on the topics, integrated across geriatric psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, research, and national trends. We discuss unique vulnerabilities of older adults to SUDs with regard to management of SUDs in older adults, medication-assisted treatment (MAT), and psychosocial treatments. We encourage general psychiatrists to raise their awareness of SUDs in older adults and to provide brief intervention or referral for further assessment."}, {"Title": "Cognitive Neuroscience and Causal Inference: Implications for Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate to what extent it is justified to draw conclusions about causal relations between brain states and mental states from cognitive neuroscience studies.

We then discuss the implications of their views in the context of traditional cognitive neuroscience studies in which the effect of changes in mental state on changes in brain states is investigated. After this, we turn to brain stimulation studies in which brain states are manipulated to investigate the effects on mental states. We argue that, depending on whether one sides with Woodward or Baumgartner, it is possible to draw causal conclusions from both types of studies (Woodward) or from brain stimulation studies only (Baumgartner). We show what happens to these conclusions if we adopt different views of the relation between mental states and brain states.

MicroRNAs are small nucleotide sequences with the ability to regulate gene expression at the transcriptomic level and emerging evidence from a range of studies has highlighted their biomarker potential. Here we compared healthy controls (n=20) with patients diagnosed with major depression (n=40) and who were treatment-resistant to identify peripheral microRNA biomarkers, which could be used for diagnosis and to predict response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and ketamine (KET) infusions, treatments that have previously shown to be effective in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). At baseline and after treatment, blood samples were taken and symptom severity scores rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Samples were analyzed for microRNA expression using microarray and validated using quantitative PCR. As expected, both treatments reduced HDRS scores. Compared with controls, the baseline expression of the microRNA let-7b was less by ~40% in TRD patients compared with controls. The baseline expression of let-7c was also lower by ~50% in TRD patients who received ECT. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that let-7b and let-7c regulates the expression of 27 genes in the PI3k-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which has previously been reported to be dysfunctional in depression. The expression of miR-16, miR-182, miR-451 and miR-223 were similar to that in controls. Baseline microRNA expression could not predict treatment response and microRNAs were unaffected by treatment.

Participants completed a detailed structured interview focusing on sociodemographic characteristics, medical history related to gender identity, and, during a specific period of adolescence, key concepts related to gender identity diagnoses as proposed for ICD-11 and from DSM-5 and ICD-10, psychological distress, functional impairment, social rejection, and violence. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and univariate comparisons and multivariate logistic regression models predicting distress and dysfunction.\nBetween April 1, 2014, and Aug 17, 2014, 260 transgender adults were approached and 250 were enrolled in the study and completed the interview. Most (n=202 [81%]) had been assigned a male sex at birth. Participants reported first awareness of transgender identity at a mean age of 5\u00b76 years (SD 2\u00b75, range 2-17), and 184 (74%) had used health interventions for body transformation, most commonly hormones (182 [73%)], with the first such intervention at a mean age of 25\u00b70 years (SD 9\u00b71, range 10-54). 84 (46%) of those who had used hormones did so initially without medical supervision. During adolescence, distress related to gender identity was very common, but not universal (n=208 [83%]), and average level of distress was quite high among those who reported it (79\u00b79 on a scale of 0 [none at all] to 100 [extreme], SD 20\u00b77, range 20-100). Most participants (n=226 [90%] reported experiencing family, social, or work or scholastic dysfunction related to their gender identity, but this was typically moderate (on a scale of 0 [not at all disrupted] to 10 [extremely disrupted], family dysfunction mean 5\u00b73 [SD 3\u00b79, range 0-10]; social dysfunction mean 5\u00b70 [SD 3\u00b78, range 0-10]; work or scholastic dysfunction mean 4\u00b78 [SD 3\u00b76, range 0-10]). Multivariate logistic regression models indicated that distress and all types of dysfunction were strongly predicted by experiences of social rejection (odds ratios [ORs] 2\u00b729-8\u00b715) and violence (1\u00b799-3\u00b799). A current male gender identity also predicted distress (OR 3\u00b790). Of the indicators of gender incongruence, only asking to be treated as a different gender was a significant predictor, and only of work or scholastic dysfunction (OR 1\u00b782).\nThis study provides additional support for classifying health-related categories related to transgender identity outside the classification of mental disorders in the ICD-11. The reconceptualisation and related reclassification of transgender-related health conditions in the ICD-11 could serve as a useful instrument in the discussion of public health policies aimed at increasing access to appropriate services and reducing the victimisation of transgender people.\nNational Institute of Psychiatry Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente Mu\u00f1iz, Mexico."}, {"Title": "You'll Never Guess Who Wrote That: 78 Surprising Authors of Psychological Publications.", "Abstract": "One can find psychological authors in the most unexpected places. We present a capsule summary of scholarly publications of psychological interest authored or coauthored by 78 surprising individuals, most of whom are celebrities or relatives of celebrities, historical figures, or people who have otherwise achieved visibility in academic circles, politics, religion, art, and diverse realms of popular culture. Still other publications are authored by individuals who are far better known for their contributions to popular than to academic psychology. The publications, stretching across more than two centuries, encompass a wide swath of domains of psychological inquiry and highlight the intersection of psychology with fields that fall outside its traditional borders, including public health, economics, law, neurosurgery, and even magic. Many of these scholarly contributions have enriched psychology and its allied disciplines, such as psychiatry, in largely unappreciated ways, and they illustrate the penetration of psychological knowledge into multiple scientific disciplines and everyday life. At the same time, our author list demonstrates that remarkable intellectual accomplishments in one scientific domain, such as physics, do not necessarily translate into success in psychology and underscores the distinction between intelligence, on the one hand, and critical thinking and wisdom, on the other."}, {"Title": "Use of a structured functional evaluation process for independent medical evaluations of claimants presenting with disabling mental illness: rationale and design for a multi-center reliability study.", "Abstract": "Work capacity evaluations by independent medical experts are widely used to inform insurers whether injured or ill workers are capable of engaging in competitive employment. In many countries, evaluation processes lack a clearly structured approach, standardized instruments, and an explicit focus on claimants' functional abilities. Evaluation of subjective complaints, such as mental illness, present additional challenges in the determination of work capacity. We have therefore developed a process for functional evaluation of claimants with mental disorders which complements usual psychiatric evaluation. Here we report the design of a study to measure the reliability of our approach in determining work capacity among patients with mental illness applying for disability benefits.\nWe will conduct a multi-center reliability study, in which 20 psychiatrists trained in our functional evaluation process will assess 30 claimants presenting with mental illness for eligibility to receive disability benefits [Reliability of Functional Evaluation in Psychiatry, RELY-study]. The functional evaluation process entails a five-step structured interview and a reporting instrument (Instrument of Functional Assessment in Psychiatry [IFAP]) to document the severity of work-related functional limitations. We will videotape all evaluations which will be viewed by three psychiatrists who will independently rate claimants' functional limitations. Our primary outcome measure is the evaluation of claimant's work capacity as a percentage (0 to 100\u00a0%), and our secondary outcomes are the 12 mental functions and 13 functional capacities assessed by the IFAP-instrument. Inter-rater reliability of four psychiatric experts will be explored using multilevel models to estimate the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Additional analyses include subgroups according to mental disorder, the typicality of claimants, and claimant perceived fairness of the assessment process.\nWe hypothesize that a structured functional approach will show moderate reliability (ICC\u2009\u2265\u20090.6) of psychiatric evaluation of work capacity. Enrollment of actual claimants with mental disorders referred for evaluation by disability/accident insurers will increase the external validity of our findings. Finding moderate levels of reliability, we will continue with a randomized trial to test the reliability of a structured functional approach versus evaluation-as-usual."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of Voice Acoustics as Predictors of Clinical Depression Scores.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine if acoustic measures of voice, characterizing specific spectral and timing properties, predict clinical ratings of depression severity measured in a sample of patients using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).\nThis is a prospective study.\nVoice samples and clinical depression scores were collected prospectively from consenting adult patients who were referred to psychiatry from the adult emergency department or primary care clinics. The patients were audio-recorded as they read a standardized passage in a nearly closed-room environment. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between actual and predicted depression scores was used as the primary outcome measure.\nThe average MAE between predicted and actual HAMD scores was approximately two scores for both men and women, and the MAE for the BDI-II scores was approximately one score for men and eight scores for women. Timing features were predictive of HAMD scores in female patients while a combination of timing features and spectral features was predictive of scores in male patients. Timing features were predictive of BDI-II scores in male patients.\nVoice acoustic features extracted from read speech demonstrated variable effectiveness in predicting clinical depression scores in men and women. Voice features were highly predictive of HAMD scores in men and women, and BDI-II scores in men, respectively. The methodology is feasible for diagnostic applications in diverse clinical settings as it can be implemented during a standard clinical interview in a normal closed room and without strict control on the recording environment."}, {"Title": "The role of boundary spanners in delivering collaborative care: a process evaluation.", "Abstract": "On average, people with schizophrenia and psychosis die 13-30 years sooner than the general population (World Psychiatry 10 (1):52-77, 2011). Mental and physical health care is often provided by different organisations, different practitioners and in different settings which makes collaborative care difficult. Research is needed to understand and map the impact of new collaborative ways of working at the primary/secondary care interface (PloS One 7 (5); e36468). The evaluation presented in this paper was designed to explore the potential of a Community and Physical Health Co-ordinator role (CPHC) (CPHCs were previously Care Co-ordinators within the Community Mental Health Team, Community in the title CPHC refers to Community Mental Health) and Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meetings across primary and community care, with the aim of improving collaboration of mental and physical health care for service users with Severe Mental Illness (SMI).\nData collection took place across five general practices (GPs) and a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) in the Northwest of England, as part of a process evaluation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of GP staff (n= 18) and CMHT staff (n=4), a focus group with CMHT staff (n=8) and a survey completed by 13 CMHT staff, alongside cardiovascular risk data and MDT actions. Framework analysis was used to manage and interpret data.\nThe results from the evaluation demonstrate that a CPHC role and MDT meetings are effective mechanisms for improving the collaboration and co-ordination of physical health care for SMI service users. The findings highlight the importance of embedding and supporting the CPHC role, with an emphasis on protected time and continuing professional roles and integrating multiple perspectives through MDT meetings. Considering the importance of physical health care for SMI service users and the complex environment, these are important findings for practitioners, researchers and policy makers in the field of primary care and\u00a0mental health.\nThere is an increasing focus on integration and collaborative working to ensure the delivery of quality care across the whole patient pathway, with a growing need for professionals to work together across service and professional boundaries.

This paper argues that psychiatry has a different epistemological basis from medicine, and it is on account of this that research in psychiatry demands a different approach, one that perforce focuses on the clarification of concepts central to psychiatric practice. This means undertaking conceptual analysis and conceptual history and only then moving on to empirical study. This paper highlights the crucial epistemological differences between the practice of medicine and psychiatry, showing that the latter is enacted at the level of language and communication. Consequently, the structures of psychiatric objects, namely, mental disorders and mental symptoms, are complexes of meaning derived from heterogeneous sources - both organic and semantic. Conceptual analysis of such structures is essential as ultimately the validity of empirical research is directly dependent on the conceptual clarification of its objects of inquiry."}, {"Title": "Should the United States Government Repeal Restrictions on Buprenorphine/Naloxone Treatment?", "Abstract": "Attention must be focused on needed changes to the current United States law that restricts physicians who prescribe buprenorphine for the detoxification or treatment of Opioid Use Disorder, to accepting no more than 100 patients.

Antidepressants are a helpful option in treating perinatal depression, but research on risks and benefits of antidepressant use in pregnancy is difficult given lack of \"gold standard\" comparative trials. Methods This paper summarizes current state of knowledge on the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy by providing a summary of the literature published in the past 3 years (January 2013-October 2015). We identified 21 reviews and meta-analyses that were included in this summary report. This report is meant to provide a user-friendly, yet comprehensive guide summarizing the abundant, and in part contradicting, literature on risks and benefits of antidepressants during pregnancy, in order to assist busy primary care prescribers in educating their patients. Our goal is also to contrast the risks/benefits of untreated depression in pregnancy versus treatment with antidepressant medication in pregnancy, and in such support prescribers in their decision-making. Results The past 3 years have yielded an abundance of publications on the topic, in part, with conflicting findings adding to confusion and concern among providers, patients, and their families. Many reported studies have methodological problems limiting their impact. Data on adverse effects of medications on pregnancy and fetal outcomes have to be weighed against the impact of untreated illness and poor health habits associated with untreated illness on the same outcomes. Discussion Medical-decision making is often complex and seldom free of risks. Obviously, as providers we cannot guarantee that fetal exposure to antidepressants is totally free of risk, yet this is true for any medicine taken in pregnancy. However, to date, perinatal psychiatry has collected enough evidence to suggest that, if the clinical picture warrants it, the use of many antidepressants, especially the SSRIs, is favorable compared to exposing mother and child to untreated depressive illness."}, {"Title": "Psychoeducational and Cognitive Behavioral Treatment Programs: Implementation and Evaluation From 1995 to 2015 in Kraepelin's Former Hospital.", "Abstract": "Programs that view individuals as capable of taking an active role in managing their illness have gained importance in Europe and the United States.

Our aim was to review studies where this had been done to guide the use of other available data.\nWe searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies comparing routinely collected mental health diagnosis data to a reference standard. We produced diagnostic category-specific positive predictive values (PPV) and Cohen's kappa for each study.\nWe found 39 eligible studies. Studies were heterogeneous in design, with a wide range of outcomes. Administrative error was small compared to diagnostic error. PPV was related to base rate of the respective condition, with overall median of 76\u00a0%. Kappa results on average showed a moderate agreement between source data and reference standard for most diagnostic categories (median kappa\u2009=\u20090.45-0.55); anxiety disorders and schizoaffective disorder showed poorer agreement. There was no significant benefit in accuracy for diagnoses made in inpatients.\nThe current evidence partly answered our questions. There was wide variation in the quality of source data, with a risk of publication bias. For some diagnoses, especially psychotic categories, administrative data were generally predictive of true diagnosis. For others, such as anxiety disorders, the data were less satisfactory. We discuss the implications of our findings, and the need for researchers to validate routine diagnostic data."}, {"Title": "Operative considerations for late-presenting persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome.", "Abstract": "Persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a condition in which a 46, XY male displays masculine external genitalia, but internally retains developed M\u00fcllerian duct structures (uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper two-thirds vagina). Thoughtful operative consideration is needed to maximize the therapeutic benefit while minimizing the risk of hypogonadism, infertility, and erectile dysfunction. We report a 53-year-old male with a pelvic mass incidentally discovered on routine ultrasound, intra-operatively discovered to be PMDS. PMDS is a rare condition that may present late in life. The primary operative consideration is performing orchiopexy for cancer surveillance or orchiectomy if orchiopexy is not possible. Additional considerations include surveillance and counseling of infertility, hypogonadism, and assessment of the potential need for involvement of psychiatry. Removal of M\u00fcllerian remnants is a subject to debate.

However, recent genomic advances, confirming a genetic contribution to mental illness, are anticipated to increase demand for psychiatric genetic counselling. This is the first study of its kind to employ qualitative methods of research to explore accounts of psychiatric health professionals regarding the prospects for genetic counselling services within clinical psychiatry in the UK. Data were collected from 32 questionnaire participants, and 9 subsequent interviewees. Data analysis revealed that although participants had not encountered patients explicitly demanding psychiatric genetic counselling, psychiatric health professionals believe that such a service would be useful and desirable. Genomic advances may have significant implications for genetic counselling in clinical psychiatry even if these discoveries do not lead to genetic testing. Psychiatric health professionals describe clinical genetics as a skilled profession capable of combining complex risk communication with much needed psychosocial support. However, participants noted barriers to the implementation of psychiatric genetic counselling services including, but not limited to, the complexities of uncertainty in psychiatric diagnoses, patient engagement and ethical concerns regarding limited capacity."}, {"Title": "An Integrative Perspective on the Role of Dopamine in Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "We propose that schizophrenia involves a combination of decreased phasic dopamine responses for relevant stimuli and increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release. Using insights from computational reinforcement-learning models and basic-science studies of the dopamine system, we show that each of these two disturbances contributes to a specific symptom domain and explains a large set of experimental findings associated with that domain. Reduced phasic responses for relevant stimuli help to explain negative symptoms and provide a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with negative symptoms: reduced learning from rewards; blunted activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for rewards and positive prediction errors; blunted activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation; blunted autonomic responding for relevant stimuli; blunted neural activation for aversive outcomes and aversive prediction errors; reduced willingness to expend effort for rewards; and psychomotor slowing. Increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release helps to explain positive symptoms and provides a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with positive symptoms: aberrant learning for neutral cues (assessed with behavioral and autonomic responses), and aberrant, increased activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for neutral cues, neutral outcomes, and neutral prediction errors. Taken together, then, these two disturbances explain many findings in schizophrenia. We review evidence supporting their co-occurrence and consider their differential implications for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms."}, {"Title": "Italian colonial psychiatry: outlines of a discipline, and practical achievements in Libya and the Horn of Africa.", "Abstract": "This article describes the establishment of psychiatry in Italy's former colonies during the period 1906-43, in terms of the clinical and institutional mechanisms, the underlying theories and the main individuals involved. 'Colonial psychiatry' (variously called 'ethnographic', 'comparative' or 'racial' psychiatry) - the object of which was both to care for mentally afflicted colonists and local people and also to understand and make sense of their pathologies - received most attention in colonial Libya, starting in the first months of the Italian occupation (1911-12) and then taking institutional form in the 1930s; in the colonies of what was known as 'Italian East Africa', on the other hand, less was said about psychiatric care, and practical achievements were correspondingly limited."}, {"Title": "Platzschwindel, agoraphobia and their influence on theories of anxiety at the end of the nineteenth century: theories of the role of biology and 'representations' (Vorstellungen).", "Abstract": "During the 1860s, Berlin's exterior physiognomy transformed radically. The city eroded the surrounding rural areas, and the frontiers of the old city centre were abolished. These transformations led to the disappearance of the visible frontiers that once demarcated the limits of the old residential Prussian city. In this context, the description of the clinical picture of agoraphobia by the Berlin psychiatrist Carl Westphal in 1872 marked a turning point, not only in psychiatric theories on anxiety but also in the conceptualization of our experience of space. In this paper, the authors trace the emergence of a new psychology-neurology episteme during the last third of the nineteenth century; and they argue that such an episteme became possible once the relations between anxiety and modern city-scape had been clearly articulated."}, {"Title": "The dysconnection hypothesis (2016).", "Abstract": "Twenty years have passed since the dysconnection hypothesis was first proposed (Friston and Frith, 1995; Weinberger, 1993). In that time, neuroscience has witnessed tremendous advances: we now live in a world of non-invasive neuroanatomy, computational neuroimaging and the Bayesian brain. The genomics era has come and gone. Connectomics and large-scale neuroinformatics initiatives are emerging everywhere. So where is the dysconnection hypothesis now? This article considers how the notion of schizophrenia as a dysconnection syndrome has developed - and how it has been enriched by recent advances in clinical neuroscience. In particular, we examine the dysconnection hypothesis in the context of (i) theoretical neurobiology and computational psychiatry; (ii) the empirical insights afforded by neuroimaging and associated connectomics - and (iii) how bottom-up (molecular biology and genetics) and top-down (systems biology) perspectives are converging on the mechanisms and nature of dysconnections in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Palliative psychiatry for severe persistent mental illness as a new approach to psychiatry? Definition, scope, benefits, and risks.", "Abstract": "As a significant proportion of patients receiving palliative care suffer from states of anxiety, depression, delirium, or other mental symptoms, psychiatry and palliative care already collaborate closely in the palliative care of medical conditions. Despite this well-established involvement of psychiatrists in palliative care, psychiatry does not currently explicitly provide palliative care for patients with mental illness outside the context of terminal medical illness.\nBased on the WHO definition of palliative care, a, a working definition of palliative psychiatry is proposed. Palliative psychiatry focuses on mental health rather than medical/physical issues. We propose that the beneficiaries of palliative psychiatry are patients with severe persistent mental illness, who are at risk of therapeutic neglect and/or overly aggressive care within current paradigms. These include long-term residential care patients with severe chronic schizophrenia and insufficient quality of life, those with therapy-refractory depressions and repeated suicide attempts, and those with severe long-standing therapy-refractory anorexia nervosa. An explicitly palliative approach within psychiatry has the potential to improve quality of care, person-centredness, outcomes, and autonomy for patients with severe persistent mental illness.\nThe first step towards a palliative psychiatry is to acknowledge those palliative approaches that already exist implicitly in psychiatry. Basic skills for a palliative psychiatry include communication of diagnosis and prognosis, symptom assessment and management, support for advance (mental health) care planning, assessment of caregiver needs, and referral to specialized services. Some of these may already be considered core skills of psychiatrists, but for a truly palliative approach they should be exercised guided by an awareness of the limited functional prognosis and lifespan of patients with severe persistent mental illness."}, {"Title": "Sleep problems in children and adolescents with epilepsy: Associations with psychiatric comorbidity.", "Abstract": "Sleep problems are common in pediatric epilepsy and may influence seizure control, daytime functioning, and overall quality of life. Knowledge of factors contributing to sleep problems is likely to improve treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between psychiatric comorbidity and parent-reported and self-reported sleep problems in a sample of children and adolescents with epilepsy. Participants were children and adolescents (N=94), aged 10-19years, with generalized or focal epilepsy who had been referred to a tertiary epilepsy treatment center in Norway. Participants underwent a thorough clinical assessment and 24h of EEG registration. Information on sleep problems was obtained from parents using the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) and from self-reporting using the Sleep Self-Report (SSR) questionnaire. Psychiatric diagnoses were established using the semistructured psychiatric interview Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Present and Lifetime Version (Kiddie-SADS-PL). Both the total and subdomain CSHQ and SSR scores were high in comparison with scores from population-based samples. Having one or more psychiatric disorder(s) was significantly associated with elevated scores on both the CSHQ and the SSR. With the exception of parent-reported parasomnias, associations between sleep problems and psychiatric disorders remained significant after adjusting for relevant epilepsy variables. Psychiatric comorbidity explained about one-third of the variance of the reported sleep problems in children and adolescents with epilepsy."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic drug monitoring and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.", "Abstract": "The therapeutic activity of drugs can be optimized by establishing an individualized dosage, based on the measurement of the drug concentration in the serum, particularly if the drugs are characterized by an inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics that results in an under- or overexposure to treatment. In recent years, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to block intracellular signaling pathways in tumor cells. These oral drugs are candidates for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) due to their high inter-individual variability for therapeutic and toxic effects. Following a literature search on PubMed, studies on TKIs and their pharmacokinetic characteristics, plasma quantification and inter-individual variability was studied. TDM is commonly used in various medical fields, including cardiology and psychiatry, but is not often applied in oncology. Plasma concentration monitoring has been thoroughly studied for imatinib, in order to evaluate the usefulness of TDM. The measurement of plasma concentration can be performed by various analytical techniques, with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry being the reference method. This method is currently used to monitor the efficacy and tolerability of imatinib treatments. Although TDM is already being used for imatinib, additional studies are required in order to improve this practice with the inclusion of other TKIs."}, {"Title": "Low prevalence of the use of the Chinese term for 'psychiatry' in the names of community psychiatry clinics: A nationwide study in Taiwan.", "Abstract": "Relabeling has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the stigma associated with mental illnesses.

In Taiwan, terms other than 'psychiatry' (in Chinese, j\u012bng sh\u00e9n k\u0113) are more commonly used in the names of psychiatry clinics. The term 'psychosomatic clinics' is widely used instead.\nThis study investigated the characteristics of psychiatry clinic names in order to better understand the role of clinic names in primary care settings.\nRelevant data were extracted from an open database maintained by the government of Taiwan. These data included the names of community psychiatry clinics and hospital-based psychiatry clinics, population size and the degree of urbanization in the area served by each clinic.\nAt the time of this study, there were 254 community psychiatry clinics and 190 hospital-based psychiatry clinics in Taiwan. Only 18.9% of the community clinic names included the term 'psychiatry'. Additionally, 14.6% of community clinic names and 28.4% of hospital-based clinic names included the term 'psychosomatics'. The regions in which clinics without 'psychiatry' in their names were located had significantly larger populations and higher levels of urbanization than the regions in which clinics with 'psychiatry' in their names were located.\nA low prevalence of the term 'psychiatry' in community psychiatry clinic names was found in Taiwan.

It is applied in psychiatric patients, as well as in patients with somatic illness. Despite the potential of ESM assessment, the improved logistics and its increased administration in research, its use in clinical trials remains limited. This paper introduces ESM for clinical trials in psychiatry and beyond.\nESM is an ecologically valid method that yields a comprehensive view of an individual's daily life. It allows the assessment of various constructs (eg, quality of life, psychopathology) and psychological mechanisms (eg, stress-sensitivity, coping). These constructs are difficult to assess using cross-sectional questionnaires. ESM can be applied in treatment monitoring, as an ecological momentary intervention, in clinical trials, or in single case clinical trials. Technological advances (eg, smartphone applications) make its implementation easier.\nAdvantages of ESM are highlighted and disadvantages are discussed. Furthermore, the ecological nature of ESM data and its consequences are explored, including the potential pitfalls of ambiguously formulated research questions and the specificities of ESM in statistical analyses. The last section focuses on ESM in relation to clinical trials and discusses its future use in optimising clinical decision-making.\nESM can be a valuable asset in clinical trial research and should be used more often to study the benefits of treatment in psychiatry and somatic health."}, {"Title": "Factors associated with the specialty choice of Korean medical students: a cross-sectional survey.", "Abstract": "An imbalance of physician supply by medical specialty has been observed in most countries. In Korea, there is a greater tendency to avoid surgical specialties and specialty choices in nonclinical medicine, such as the basic science of medicine. In this study, we identified factors affecting the specialty choice of physicians in order to provide a basis for policies to address this problem.\nWe used the results of a 2013 nationwide survey of 12\u2009709 medical students (82.7 % responded) to analyze the data of 9499 students after excluding missing data. Descriptive analyses of all students' specialty choice were performed. Logistic regression was performed by selecting gender, age, grade level, type of medical school, hometown, and the location of the medical school as the independent variables. Medical specialty was the dependent variable. The dependent variable, or specialty of medicine, was categorized into three groups: nonclinical/clinical medicine, surgical-medical specialty, and controllable lifestyle specialty.\nThe order of preferred medical specialties was internal medicine, psychiatry, and pediatrics; for surgical specialties, the order was orthopedic surgery, general surgery, and ophthalmology. Medical specialties were most favored by women and students in the third (men) and second (women) year of the medical program, whereas surgical specialties were most preferred by men and students in the first year of the program. Students in the third year mostly favored nonclinical medicine. Medical college students had a stronger preference for nonclinical medicine (odds ratio [OR] 1.625, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.139-2.318) than graduate medical school students. Surgical specialties were more favored by men (OR 2.537, 95 % CI 2.296-2.804) than by women.

However, gaining approval is by no means the only challenge facing these radiopharmaceuticals. Traversing the blood-brain barrier is a formidable obstacle in drug delivery, and accurately modeling tracer kinetics and correcting for the partial-volume effect are among the difficult tasks that remain once the ligand reaches its intended target. Even so, the use of PET imaging in neurology and psychiatry can be expected to expand in the coming years as novel radiopharmaceuticals continue to be developed."}, {"Title": "Consultations in general practices with and without mental health nurses: an observational study from 2010 to 2014.", "Abstract": "To investigate care for patients with psychological or social problems provided by mental health nurses (MHNs), and by general practitioners (GPs) with and without MHNs.\nAn observational study with consultations recorded by GPs and MHNs.\nData were routinely recorded in 161-338 Dutch general practices between 2010 and 2014.\nAll patients registered at participating general practices were included: 624\u2005477 patients in 2010 to 1\u2005392\u2005187 patients in 2014.\nWe used logistic and Poisson multilevel regression models to test whether GPs recorded more patients with at least one consultation for psychological or social problems and to analyse the number of consultations over a 5-year time period. We examined the additional effect of an MHN in a practice, and tested which patient characteristics predicted transferral from GPs to MHNs.\nIncreasing numbers of patients with psychological or social problems visit general practices. Increasing numbers of GPs collaborate with an MHN. GPs working in practices with an MHN record as many consultations per patient as GPs without an MHN, but they record slightly more patients with psychological or social problems (OR=1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08). MHNs most often treat adult female patients with common psychological symptoms such as depressive feelings.\nMHNs do not seem to replace GP care, but mainly provide additional long consultations. Future research should study to what extent collaboration with an MHN prevents patients from needing specialised mental healthcare."}, {"Title": "Tryptophan for the sleeping disorder and mental symptom of new-type drug dependence: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.", "Abstract": "New-type drugs are popular with adolescents and could lead to psychiatry disorders, but no medications have been proven to be effective for these disorders of new-type drug dependence. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of tryptophan on sleeping disorders and mental symptoms in detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence.\nThis randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 80 detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence, recruited successively from a Compulsory Residential Drug Abstinence Institution in Wuhan, China, from April 2012 to November 2012. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to be treated with tryptophan (1000\u200amg/d, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) for 2 weeks. The sleeping disorders and mental symptoms were assessed using Athens Insomnia Scale and Symptom Check-List-90 at baseline and 2 weeks. Results were analyzed according to the \"intention-to-treat\" approach.\nForty-five participants completed the 2-week study, 24 in the tryptophan group and 21 in the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups and the treatment adherence was similar between groups. The reduction in the Athens Insomnia Scale score in the tryptophan group was significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P = 0.017). However, no significant differences were found in Symptom Check-List-90 scores (either by individual dimension or the overall score) between groups (all P\u200a>\u200a0.05). The frequency of adverse events was similar and no serious adverse events were reported during the study.\nTryptophan was unlikely to be effective for mental symptoms, but could alleviate sleep disorders in short term among detoxified individuals with new-type drug dependence. Future large-scale trials are required to confirm findings from this study."}, {"Title": "Assessment of Response to Providing Health-related Information in a Community Psychiatry Outpatient Setting.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the subjective responses of patient and staff to the provision of health-related information in an outpatient psychiatric clinic. Simple educational information on healthy eating, exercising, and smoking cessation was provided in the waiting area of a clinic over the course of a year. This information took the form of educational handouts, educational DVDs, and monthly \"special events\" such as a poster competition for smoking cessation. In addition, patients were given an opportunity to attend free nutritional counseling sessions. Also, when needed, staff assisted patients in making appointments with primary care physicians. At the end of the year, a survey was distributed to patients and staff to assess the perceived benefits of the initiative. The majority of the 79 patients who completed the survey (n=60, 76%) had used the information provided, 95% of whom (n=57) had made some behavioral change, with 13% of the total survey respondents indicating that they had quit smoking. Ninety percent of the surveyed providers (18/20) felt that the initiative had had a positive impact on their patients. These results suggest that simple, low cost health and wellness initiatives in conjunction with an enthusiastic expenditure of a relatively small amount of staff time have the potential to have a positive impact on individuals attending an outpatient psychiatric clinic."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy and Its Role in Psychiatric Practice: A Position Paper.

In this second article, we focus on the adaptive model of psychopathology, the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions, the synergistic effects of combined psychotherapy and psychopharmacology treatments, and attention to the patient's subjective experience and the doctor-patient alliance to complement an \"objective\" case formulation. The evidence strongly suggests the need for an integrated treatment approach based on the objective, subjective, and intersubjective science that forms the foundation of psychiatry as a clinical discipline, in which psychotherapy and psychopharmacology are seen as complementary treatments within a systemic approach to psychiatric care and training.

A Clinical-Neuropsychological Perspective.", "Abstract": "Neuroscientific research has substantially increased our knowledge about mental disorders in recent years. Along with these benefits, radical postulates have been articulated according to which understanding and treatment of mental disorders should generally be based on biological terms, such as neurons/brain areas, transmitters, genes etc. Proponents of such a 'biological psychiatry' claim that mental disorders are analogous to neurological disorders and refer to neurology and neuropsychology to corroborate their claims. The present article argues that, from a clinical-neuropsychological perspective, 'biological psychiatry' is based on a mechanistic, 'cerebrocentric' framework of brain (dys-)function which has its roots in experimental neuroscience but runs up against narrow limits in clinical neurology and neuropsychology. In fact, understanding and treating neurological disorders generally demands a systems perspective including brain, organism and environment as intrinsically entangled. In this way, 'biological' characterizes a 'holistic', nonreductionist level of explanation, according to which the significance of particular mechanisms can only be estimated in the context of the organism (or person). This is evident in the common observation that local brain damage does not just lead to an isolated loss of function, but to multiple attempts of reorganization and readaptation; it initiates new developments. Furthermore, treating brain disorders necessarily includes aspects of individuality and subjectivity, a conclusion that contradicts the purely 'objectivist', third-person stance put forward by some proponents of biological psychiatry. In sum, understanding and treating brain damage sequelae in the clinical neurosciences demands a biopsychosocial perspective, for both conceptual and historical reasons. The same may hold for psychiatry when adopting a brain-based view on mental disorders. In such a perspective, biological psychiatry seems an interesting project but falls short of its original claims."}, {"Title": "Facial recognition of happiness among older adults with active and remitted major depression.", "Abstract": "Biased emotion processing in depression might be a trait characteristic independent of mood improvement and a vulnerable factor to develop further depressive episodes. This phenomenon of among older adults with depression has not been adequately examined. In a 2-year cross-sectional study, 59 older patients with either active or remitted major depression, or never-depressed, completed a facial emotion recognition task (FERT) to probe perceptual bias of happiness. The results showed that depressed patients, compared with never depressed subjects, had a significant lower sensitivity to identify happiness particularly at moderate intensity of facial stimuli. Patients in remission from a previous major depressive episode but with none or minimal symptoms had similar sensitivity rate to identify happy facial expressions as compared to patients with an active depressive episode. Further studies would be necessary to confirm whether recognition of happy expression reflects a persistent perceptual bias of major depression in older adults."}, {"Title": "The morning after: what now for psychiatry research?", "Abstract": "The UK scientific community is rightly concerned about the impact of leaving the EU on UK science. These concerns are particularly pertinent for mental health research, which is chronically underfunded in comparison to research on physical health conditions. The EU is one of the largest funders of mental health research in the world, with the UK clearly benefitting from this because of its strong track record. Any loss of funding, leadership or influence would weaken this. Likewise if we are unable to attract the best or most promising researchers from the rest of Europe, the loser will not just be research into mental health across Europe, but patients themselves.

The relationship between doctors and patients can be strained, which limits communication. Instead, patients often communicate with each other over the Internet in electronic support groups.\nThis perspective summarizes studies of patient-to-patient communication over the Internet and uses the concept of contested illness to provide insights into the experiences of patients with functional somatic disorders.\nConflict between a patient and their physician is a key feature of functional somatic syndromes. Physicians and patients do not have a shared understanding or appreciation of the patient's experiences. Patients with functional somatic syndromes often value their own embodied experience over medical knowledge. At the same time, they remain deeply invested in finding a \"good doctor\" who believes that the patient is suffering, agrees with their conception of the cause, and assents to the treatment as directed by the patient. Electronic support groups reinforce these beliefs.\nPatients may benefit from a compromising, collaborative approach that is realistic about the limitations of medical knowledge. However, physicians should not engage in unsafe treatment practices. Electronic support groups exist for a wide range of illnesses and the issues that rise to the surface in functional somatic syndromes likely occur to some extent with almost every patient."}, {"Title": "Multi-center MRI prediction models: Predicting sex and illness course in first episode psychosis patients.", "Abstract": "Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have attempted to use brain measures obtained at the first-episode of psychosis to predict subsequent outcome, with inconsistent results. Thus, there is a real need to validate the utility of brain measures in the prediction of outcome using large datasets, from independent samples, obtained with different protocols and from different MRI scanners. This study had three main aims: 1) to investigate whether structural MRI data from multiple centers can be combined to create a machine-learning model able to predict a strong biological variable like sex; 2) to replicate our previous finding that an MRI scan obtained at first episode significantly predicts subsequent illness course in other independent datasets; and finally, 3) to test whether these datasets can be combined to generate multicenter models with better accuracy in the prediction of illness course. The multi-center sample included brain structural MRI scans from 256 males and 133 females patients with first episode psychosis, acquired in five centers: University Medical Center Utrecht (The Netherlands) (n=67); Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London (United Kingdom) (n=97); University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil) (n=64); University of Cantabria, Santander (Spain) (n=107); and University of Melbourne (Australia) (n=54). All images were acquired on 1.5-Tesla scanners and all centers provided information on illness course during a follow-up period ranging 3 to 7years. We only included in the analyses of outcome prediction patients for whom illness course was categorized as either \"continuous\" (n=94) or \"remitting\" (n=118). Using structural brain scans from all centers, sex was predicted with significant accuracy (89%; p<0.001). In the single- or multi-center models, illness course could not be predicted with significant accuracy. However, when reducing heterogeneity by restricting the analyses to male patients only, classification accuracy improved in some samples. This study provides proof of concept that combining multi-center MRI data to create a well performing classification model is possible. However, to create complex multi-center models that perform accurately, each center should contribute a sample either large or homogeneous enough to first allow accurate classification within the single-center."}, {"Title": "Biological markers for anxiety disorders, OCD and PTSD: A consensus statement.

Both are present in normal healthy populations where the need to act quickly and repeatedly without hesitation can be highly advantageous. However, when excessively expressed, impulsive and compulsive behavior can lead to adverse consequences and spectrum disorders exemplified by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), autism, and drug addiction. Impulsive individuals have difficulty in deferring gratification and are inclined to 'jump the gun' and respond prematurely before sufficient information is gathered. Compulsivity involves repetitive behavior often motivated by the need to reduce or prevent anxiety, thus leading to the maladaptive perseveration of behavior. Defined in this way, impulsivity and compulsivity could be viewed as separate entities or 'traits' but overwhelming evidence indicates that both may be present in the same disorder, either concurrently or even separately at different time points. Herein we discuss the neural and cognitive heterogeneity of impulsive and compulsive endophenotypes. These constructs map onto distinct fronto-striatal neural and neurochemical structures interacting both at nodal convergent points and as opponent processes highlighting both the heterogeneity and the commonalities of function. We focus on discoveries made using both translational research methodologies and studies exclusively in humans, and implications for treatment intervention in disorders in which impulsive and compulsive symptoms prevail. We emphasize the relevance of these constructs for understanding dimensional psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Simultaneous determination of four antiepileptic drugs in human plasma samples using an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method and its application in therapeutic drug monitoring.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring of antiepileptic drugs is widely practiced to achieve optimal efficacy and avoid adverse side effects. We describe an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) method developed for the monitoring of four frequently prescribed antiepileptic drugs - lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine and topiramate. The main pharmacologically active metabolite of oxcarbazepine (mono-hydroxy-derivative metabolite, MHD) was also quantified. After addition of internal standards and a simple stage of protein precipitation, plasmatic samples were analyzed on a C<sub>18</sub> column. All antiepileptic drugs were separated and quantified in 6\u2009min, without interference. A good linearity was observed all over the calibration range (r<sup>2</sup> \u2009>\u20090.99), up to 20\u2009\u03bcg/mL (40\u2009\u03bcg/mL for MHD). The limit of quantification was 0.20\u2009\u03bcg/mL (0.40\u2009\u03bcg/mL for MHD) with precision and accuracy ranging from 1.0 to 2.1% and from 96.7 to 110.8%, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy values were within 15%. No significant matrix effect was observed for all analytes. Clinical application was successfully evaluated in 259 samples from patients treated for epilepsy or bipolar disorders. In conclusion, a rapid, specific and sensitive UHPLC/MS/MS method was developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of antiepileptic drugs, suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Reconnecting with oneself while struggling between life and death: The phenomenon of recovery as experienced by persons at risk of suicide.", "Abstract": "The body of knowledge regarding health and recovery as experienced by patients at risk of suicide is limited. More research is needed into the meaning of recovery and what strengthens the desire to live. The aim of this study was to describe the phenomenon of recovery in a context of nursing care as experienced by persons at risk of suicide. In line with a reflective lifeworld research approach, 14 patients from a psychiatric clinic in Sweden participated in phenomenon-oriented interviews. Data were analyzed to describe the essence of the phenomenon. The results reveal that the phenomenon of recovery means 'reconnecting with oneself while struggling between life and death'. Three meaning constituents emerged: being in an expressive space and giving voice to oneself, regaining dignity through nurturing connectedness, and finding a balance in the tension between life and death. In conclusion, the meaning of recovery is to experience the ability to manage one's own life. Professional caregivers need to acknowledge patients' lifeworlds, in a way that enable patients to experience themselves as capable of managing their own lives. Professional caregivers should also facilitate the involvement of supportive relatives."}, {"Title": "Variability in clinical diagnoses during the ICD-8 and ICD-10 era.", "Abstract": "To explore whether the diagnostic homogeneity in a daily, routine clinical activity changed visibly over two historical periods (the ICD-8 and the ICD-10 era) across and within five psychiatric in-patient clinics.\nIn this register study, we analyzed the discharge diagnoses from five university-affiliated departments of psychiatry in Denmark in two time periods: 1980-1985 (ICD-8) and 2001-2010 (ICD-10).\nThe synchronic inter-departmental diagnostic differences did not decrease in the ICD-10 era compared with ICD-8 era.

A number of mental health professionals rose up against such medicalisation of social issues. This ethnographic study was conducted in this climate, in a psychiatric unit, located in a disadvantaged area in the outskirts of Paris, that specialises in adolescents with such problems. The research emphasised how professionals resist being instrumentalised by juvenile counselling services and the justice system, the observed practices bearing traces of critiques of psychiatric institutions since the 1960s. Psychiatrists thus try to justify and legitimate their interventions, which are co-constructed by relevant counselling and mental health professionals and, as much as possible, adolescents and their parents. Consequently, full understanding of institutionalisation, beyond its aspects of constraint and subjection, also requires consideration of its potential as a step in the socialisation process, especially for adolescents from working class backgrounds bereft of social and cultural capital.

A path analysis was performed to examine the effects of symptoms, diagnostic label, experience of education in psychiatry, and demographic features on stigmatizing attitudes. Results showed that schizophrenic symptoms, diagnostic label of schizophrenia, and experience of education in psychiatry were significantly associated with stigmatization toward the case. Interaction terms of these variables did not show significant association with stigmatization. These results highlight the importance of optimizing education techniques about mental illness so as to avoid cultivating stigmatizing attitudes toward schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Associated with Lithium Toxicity.", "Abstract": "Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is an idiosyncratic and potentially life-threatening reaction to neuroleptic drugs. Lithium is a first-line mood stabilizer used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. There are several case reports of lithium-associated NMS, but only when it was given in combination with antipsychotics. Therefore, the possibility of NMS being secondary to the antipsychotics could not be ruled out in those cases. Here we present a case of lithium-induced NMS in a patient who was not being treated concomitantly with any other agent known to cause NMS. The patient, a 74-year-old female with a 30-year history of bipolar affective disorder, was admitted to the emergency room of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, with history of high fever and generalized weakness for 10 days before the admission. NMS was established based the presence of three cardinal symptoms.

Primary sources of Brazilian alienism were theses, memoirs, official reports, and documents written by clinicians and asylum directors. We analysed early mental treatment in Brazilian lunatic asylums, exploring the relative contributions of two main theoretical orientations: moral treatment (based on Pinel and Esquirol) and 'medical-organicist therapeutic orientation'. Intertextuality was used to assess reports of medical organicist treatment in Brazil. We concluded that contemporaneous textual sources indicate that mid-nineteenth-century alienism in Brazil was predominantly influenced by organicism exported from European countries. Pinel's mentalist view, nevertheless, remained the reference point for clinical issues associated with the doctor-patient relationship."}, {"Title": "Clinical trial network for the promotion of clinical research for rare diseases in Japan: muscular dystrophy clinical trial network.", "Abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most commonly inherited neuromuscular disease. Therapeutic agents for the treatment of rare disease, namely \"orphan drugs\", have recently drawn the attention of researchers and pharmaceutical companies. To ensure the successful conduction of clinical trials to evaluate novel treatments for patients with rare diseases, an appropriate infrastructure is needed. One of the effective solutions for the lack of infrastructure is to establish a network of rare diseases.\nTo accomplish the conduction of clinical trials in Japan, the Muscular dystrophy clinical trial network (MDCTN) was established by the clinical research group for muscular dystrophy, including the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, as well as national and university hospitals, all which have a long-standing history of research cooperation.\nThirty-one medical institutions (17 national hospital organizations, 10 university hospitals, 1 national center, 2 public hospitals, and 1 private hospital) belong to this network and collaborate to facilitate clinical trials. The Care and Treatment Site Registry (CTSR) calculates and reports the proportion of patients with neuromuscular diseases in the cooperating sites. In total, there are 5,589 patients with neuromuscular diseases in Japan and the proportion of patients with each disease is as follows: DMD, 29\u00a0%; myotonic dystrophy type 1, 23\u00a0%; limb girdle muscular dystrophy, 11\u00a0%; Becker muscular dystrophy, 10\u00a0%. We work jointly to share updated health care information and standardized evaluations of clinical outcomes as well. The collaboration with the patient registry (CTSR), allows the MDCTN to recruit DMD participants with specific mutations and conditions, in a remarkably short period of time.\nCounting with a network that operates at a national level is important to address the corresponding national issues. Thus, our network will be able to contribute with international research activity, which can lead to an improvement of neuromuscular disease treatment in Japan."}, {"Title": "Do Consultation Psychiatrists, Forensic Psychiatrists, Psychiatry Trainees, and Health Care Lawyers Differ in Opinion on Gray Area Decision-Making Capacity Cases? A Vignette-Based Survey.", "Abstract": "Previous research in the area of medical decision-making capacity has demonstrated relatively poor agreement between experienced evaluators in \"gray area\" cases. We performed a survey to determine the level of agreement about gray area decision-making capacity case scenarios within and between individuals of different professional backgrounds.\nParticipants received a survey consisting of 3 complicated decision-making capacity vignettes with an accompanying \"yes/no\" question regarding capacity and a certainty scale for each vignette. Participants were identified from mailing lists of professional organizations and local hospitals. We received responses from psychiatry trainees, consultation-liaison psychiatrists, forensic psychiatrists, and lawyers with experience in health care law. Results were analyzed using SPSS.\nAcross the 3 vignettes, the percentage agreeing that the individual described had capacity to refuse medical treatment ranged between 35% and 40% for trainees, 33% and 67% for consult psychiatrists, 41% and 76% for forensic psychiatrists, and 40% and 83% for health care lawyers. Only question 2 reached significance between-group differences (Pearson \u03c7(2) = 11.473, p < 0.01). Across vignettes, trainees were less likely to consider patients to have capacity for decision-making than were forensic psychiatrists and lawyers.\nAs found in previous research, agreement among experienced evaluators appears generally low in gray area capacity cases.

We investigated the frequency of physical aggression by patients between 2008 and 2015 in two hospitals for psychiatry and psychotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> Aggressive and violent events were routinely assessed (spontaneous reports) and were analyzed in a differentiated way. <b>Results:</b> The frequency of aggressive behavior of patients towards others showed a slightly, but significantly increase since 2008, although at a low level. This increase was almost entirely caused by an increase of aggressive assaults against nursing staff. <b>Conclusions:</b> The relative frequency of aggressive behavior by patients (4/1000 cases) was on average rather low. The increase of assaults particularly against nursing personnel gives nonetheless reason to scrutinize and continuously optimize measures for prevention and therapy of patients' aggressive behavior."}, {"Title": "[Coercive Interventions in Psychiatry: Prevention and Patients' Preferences].", "Abstract": "<b>Objective</b> This study explores patients' preferences and measures of prevention of coercive methods in psychiatric treatment. <b>Methods</b> Structured interviews of 90 patients with psychotic disorders were undertaken, most of whom had previously experienced coercive methods. <b>Results</b> Participants saw preventive potential in a wider availability of individual non-pharmacological therapy, improvement of staff professional competence and communication skills, high staff-to-patient ratios and retreat facilities. The majority of participants preferred forced medication and manual restraint in case of self-endangerment, and forced medication and mechanical restraint in the event of endangerment of others. <b>Conclusion</b> Patients' suggestions relating to prevention of coercion are in line with most expert's opinions. In case coercive methods are required, manual restraint and application of forced medication is accepted as the treatment of choice according to most patients in case of self-endangerment."}, {"Title": "[Comparison of Aggressive Behavior, Compulsory Medication and Absconding Behavior Between Open and Closed door Policy in an Acute Psychiatric Ward].", "Abstract": "<b>Objective</b> According to legal requirements coercive treatment must be limited to acts necessary for the protection of patients and cannot be used for institutional interests. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that opening psychiatric wards can reduce the number of aggressive assaults and of coercive treatment without increasing absconding rates. <b>Methods</b> Numbers of absconding, coercive medication, fixation and special security actions were collected retrospectively and compared between phases of closed (N total\u200a=\u200a409; N legally committed\u200a=\u200a64) and 90\u200a% of daytime opened (N total\u200a=\u200a571; N legally committed\u200a=\u200a99) doors in an acute psychiatric ward. <b>Results</b> During the phase of opened doors we observed significantly reduced aggressive assaults (p\u200a<\u200a0,001) and coercive medication (p\u200a=\u200a0,006) compared to the closed setting, while the absconding rate did not change (p\u200a=\u200a0,20). <b>Limitation</b> Given the retrospective non-experimental design, no causal interpretations can be drawn. <b>Conclusion</b> The results suggest that open door is associated with reduction of aggressive assaults and coercive medication without increasing absconding rates. This speaks for a stronger implementation of open door policies in acute wards in order to preserve human rights in psychiatry. To collect more robust evidence for this thesis, longer phases should be monitored and moderating variables such as atmosphere and social cohesion should be assessed."}, {"Title": "Alcohol, Substance Use and Psychosocial Competence of Adolescents in Selected Secondary Schools in Uganda: A Cross Sectional Survey.", "Abstract": "1) To determine the nature and extent of alcohol and substance use and 2) To describe the relationship between alcohol use and psychosocial competence among secondary school youths in Northern and Central Uganda.\nThis was a cross-sectional study.\nDepartments of Mental Health, Gulu University (Northern Uganda) and Department of Psychiatry, Makerere University College of Health Sciences (Central Uganda) between September 2011 and April 2012.\nFour (4) and eight (8) secondary schools located in the rural and urban areas of Gulu and Kampala districts respectively were randomly selected to participate in the survey. A total of 3,200 students aged 12 to 24 years were recruited by proportionate multistage sampling. Data was collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire that included questions about nature and frequency of alcohol and substance use. A pre-tested self-administered survey questionnaire with scales to measure components of psychosocial competence (PSC) was administered. Data was entered in Epidata, and exported to SPSS version 16.0 for analysis. Psychosocial competence was classified as high or low depending on the responses in the sub-scales of decision making, self efficacy, empathy, emotional awareness, coping with stress and emotions, and accurate self-assessment and self-confidence.\nA total of 2,902 questionnaires comprising of 2,502, (86.2%) from Kampala district and 400 (13.8%)) from Gulu district were analyzed. Male to female ratio was 1:1 with an age range of 12 to 24 years and a mean of 16.5. About 70.1% had ever used alcohol and substances. Only 39.1% used substances regularly. The commonest substance used was alcohol (23.3%), followed by <i>kuber</i> (10.8%), <i>khat</i> (10.5%), aviation fuel (10.1%), cannabis (9.2%) and cigarettes (5.9%). Respondents from the Gulu district were twice more likely to use all substances. Users and regular users from the North Northern Uganda had lower psychosocial competence. Factors significantly associated with non-use of alcohol were high levels of self-confidence, non-use of cannabis and kuber and age. In the alcohol user groups, a high level of coping was associated with discontinued and experimental use of drugs of abuse.\nMore than two-thirds (70.1%) of young people in this study had ever used substances of abuse only once and slightly over a third had used it regularly.

Mental, somatic, and social problems are translated in a standardised manner into medical jargon which gives rise to a DSM diagnosis, a cost-price, and outcome measures. This medical-bureaucratic system has important virtues, provided it is applied efficiently and the patient-psychiatrist relationship remains intact. In the Netherlands, however, this balance has been disturbed. Future research can be facilitated if distinctions are made between various types of bureaucracy (referred to here as Hippocratic, Weberian, and Kafkaesque bureaucracy). In addition, we discuss various national initiatives which aim to counter bureaucracy, including initiatives of the Dutch government.\nIf the patient-psychiatrist relationship is to regain its central role, bureaucracy needs to be countered constantly. The government can facilitate this process, but healthcare providers can also play a key role and meanwhile help to bring about a substantial reduction in the costs of care."}, {"Title": "FDG-PET hyperactivity pattern in anti-NMDAr encephalitis.", "Abstract": "FDG-PET can show anteroposterior glucose metabolism gradient in anti-NMDAr encephalitis, but there are also suggestions that basal ganglia are involved.

Although an increased willingness by hospital administrators to fund PPM services was apparent, adequate funding remained a core issue. Although the value of research is well recognized, few programs are engaged in systematic PPM investigation.\nThis survey provides evidence that the current field of PPM appears to be in an increasingly stronger position within academic medical centers.

Psychiatrists of that time had seen LSD not only as a tool for psychotherapy but also as a potential therapeutic for anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, autism, and even schizophrenia. When it became a quasi-religious epitome of the Hippie counterculture in the mid 1960s, and cases of what we now call hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and acute psychotic \"flashbacks\" mounted, authorities moved to make LSD illegal. Although research was never actually forbidden, the field almost completely dried out until the early 2010s. Using today's tools of molecular pharmacology, functional imaging, and neuronal network theory, neuropsychiatry is now resurrecting LSD research-with implications that leave us with many medical and ethical questions.

However, electrophysiological data elucidating the neural and synaptic bases for this theory are lacking. Here, we propose a novel theory bridging the information-theoretical principle with the biological phenomenon of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) regulated by neuromodulators, which we term mSTDP. We propose that by integrating an mSTDP equation, we can obtain a form of Friston's free energy (an information-theoretical function). Then we analytically and numerically show that dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) influence the accuracy of a principal component analysis (PCA) performed using the mSTDP algorithm. From the perspective of free-energy minimization, these neuromodulatory changes alter the relative weighting or precision of accuracy and prior terms, which induces a switch from pattern completion to separation. These results are consistent with electrophysiological findings and validate the free-energy principle and mSTDP. Moreover, our scheme can potentially be applied in computational psychiatry to build models of the faulty neural networks that underlie the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, which involve abnormal DA levels, as well as models of the NA contribution to memory triage and posttraumatic stress disorder."}, {"Title": "Evidence for Distinguishable Treatment Costs among Paranoid Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders result in enormous individual suffering and financial burden on patients and on society.

The typical ayahuasca effects consist of strong somatic reactions, vivid visions, relived personal memories, cathartic emotions, and insightful, introspective experiences when the emerging mental contents take different context and get deeper perspectives. The ayahuasca-experience can be exhausting necessitating the presence of an experienced leader for helping participants to pass difficult phases and for maximizing therapeutic benefits.

Despite these commonalities, however, they have been identified as having differently shaded positions and views within psychoanalytic politics: Robert Michels, as relatively conservative regarding controversial issues in psychoanalytic institutional functioning and governance, and Otto Kernberg as inclined toward rapid change regarding these issues (Auchincloss and Michels 2003; Kernberg 2014).

Recent reports suggest that youth with ASD treated with SGAs may suffer more pronounced weight gain than typically developing children. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison of weight gain effects of five SGAs in a clinical population of youth with ASD.\nWe completed a subanalysis of demographic and treatment data describing 202 youth with ASD treated at two large, subspecialty psychiatry clinics. Included subjects were between 2 and 20 years of age and were treated with one of five SGAs (risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or ziprasidone) for up to 4 years. We calculated change in each participant's body-mass index (BMI) z-score during the treatment period using a linear model where the dependent variable was change in BMI z-score and the independent variables were SGA used and duration of treatment. First, these models were run for each drug separately, then the SGA groups were run together to estimate differences between groups. We also adjusted these models for weight gain-attenuating concomitant medications.\nTreatment with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine resulted in statistically significant increase in BMI z-score (p\u2009=\u20090.03, 0.05, and <0.01 respectively). Ziprasidone and quetiapine were not associated with an increase in BMI z-score in this analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.47 and p\u2009=\u20090.11). Subjects treated with olanzapine showed a statistically significant greater increase in BMI z-score when compared with the other SGAs (all p-values <0.05). These results did not change when adjusted for multiple testing or weight gain-attenuating medication as covariate.\nClinicians treating youth with ASD may be able to use this information to balance the risks and benefits of SGA treatment when managing ASD-associated irritability."}, {"Title": "Cortical functional activity in patients with generalized anxiety disorder.", "Abstract": "The neurological correlates of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are not well known, however there is evidence of cortical dysregulation in patients with GAD. The aim of the study was to examine cortical functional activity in different cerebral regions in patients with GAD using electroencephalogram (EEG) nonlinear analysis to evaluate its contribution of anxiety severity.\nThe cohorts consisted of 64 patients diagnosed with GAD as classified by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association-IV-TR. Anxiety severity was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAMA) severity score, with 7\u2009\u2264\u2009scores\u2009\u2264\u200917 indicating mild anxiety as A group (n\u2009=\u200931) and 18 and above indicating moderate-severe anxiety as B group (n\u2009=\u200933). Participants with clinical levels of depression symptoms were excluded. A healthy control group comprising 30 participants was matched for age and gender. Closed eyes EEGs were conducted, and between-group differences on non-linear parameter Correlation Dimension (D2) were analyzed. The association of D2 value with HAMA scores was analyzed using multiple linear stepwise regression.\nCompared with the control group, D2 values were increased in anxiety groups (P\u2009<\u2009.05). For those with mild anxiety, this difference occurred in the left prefrontal regions (P\u2009<\u2009.05). For those with moderate-severe anxiety, significantly greater D2 values were observed in all of the cerebral regions, especially in the left cerebral regions and right temporal lobe (P\u2009<\u2009.01). When compared with those with mild anxiety, D2 values were significantly greater for those with moderate-severe anxiety in the right temporal lobe and all left cerebral regions except for left occipital lobe (P\u2009<\u2009.05). A positive correlation was observed between D2 values and moderate-severe anxiety HAMA scores.\nThe increased D2 values were found in the majority of cerebral regions in GAD patients, especially in the left cerebral regions and the right temporal lobe. The increased GAD severity positively correlates to the D2 values in a larger number of cerebral regions.

Neuropsychiatrist Franz Josef Kallmann (1897-1965) was a product of this interdisciplinary background who showed an ability to adapt to different scientific contexts, first in the field of neuromorphology in Berlin, and later in New York. Nonetheless, having innovative ideas, as Kallmann did, could be an ambiguous advantage, since they could lead to incommensurable scientific views and marginalization in existing research programs. Kallmann followed his Dr. Med. degree (1919) with training periods at the Charit\u00e9 Medical School in Berlin under psychiatrist Karl Bonhoeffer (1868-1948). Subsequently, he collaborated with Ernst Ruedin (1874-1952), investigating sibling inheritance of schizophrenia and becoming a protagonist of genetic research on psychiatric conditions. In 1936, Kallmann was forced to immigrate to the USA where he published The Genetics of Schizophrenia (1938), based on data he had gathered from the district pathological institutes of Berlin's public health department. Kallmann resumed his role as an international player in biological psychiatry and genetics, becoming president (1952) of the American Society of Human Genetics and Director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in 1955. While his work was well received by geneticists, the idea of genetic differences barely took hold in American psychiatry, largely because of \u00e9migr\u00e9 psychoanalysts who dominated American clinical psychiatry until the 1960s and established a philosophical direction in which genetics played no significant role, being regarded as dangerous in light of Nazi medical atrocities.

Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were noted. He was diagnosed as schizophrenia-like psychosis. Treatment with paliperidone at the dose of 6 mg/day and magnesium and potassium supplementations was commenced. However, electrolyte disturbances failed to improve following psychosis remission. Therefore, other underlying diseases resulting in electrolyte disturbances were suspected. Along with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, additional investigation showing metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, renal loss of potassium, were consistent with GS. Gene analysis revealed this patient carried out c. 2687 G\u00a0>\u00a0A homozygous mutation of exon 23 in the SLC12A3 gene which led to p.Arg896Gln. Eventually, GS was identified. Thus, additional spironolactone (40\u00a0mg/day) combined with increased doses of oral potassium chloride sustained-release tablets (3.0\u00a0g/day) and potassium magnesium aspartate (0.3\u00a0g/day) were administered.

His serum potassium was near normal (3.2-3.5\u00a0mmol/L), hypomagnesemia significantly improved (0.57-0.67\u00a0mmol/L).\nElectrolyte abnormalities secondary to GS might cause or contribute to development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In turn, hypokalemia was common among acute psychiatric inpatients.

Tackling these problems requires guidance by a pathophysiological theory. In this paper, we consider recent theories that re-conceptualize ASD from a \"Bayesian brain\" perspective, which posit that the core abnormality of ASD resides in perceptual aberrations due to a disbalance in the precision of prediction errors (sensory noise) relative to the precision of predictions (prior beliefs). This results in percepts that are dominated by sensory inputs and less guided by top-down regularization and shifts the perceptual focus to detailed aspects of the environment with difficulties in extracting meaning. While these Bayesian theories have inspired ongoing empirical studies, their clinical implications have not yet been carved out. Here, we consider how this Bayesian perspective on disease mechanisms in ASD might contribute to improving clinical care for affected individuals. Specifically, we describe a computational strategy, based on generative (e.g., hierarchical Bayesian) models of behavioral and functional neuroimaging data, for establishing diagnostic tests. These tests could provide estimates of specific cognitive processes underlying ASD and delineate pathophysiological mechanisms with concrete treatment targets. Written with a clinical audience in mind, this article outlines how the development of computational diagnostics applicable to behavioral and functional neuroimaging data in routine clinical practice could not only fundamentally alter our concept of ASD but eventually also transform the clinical management of this disorder."}, {"Title": "Updates and Current Perspectives of Psychiatric Assessments after Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychological and psychiatric disorders represent a major concern and cause of disabilities after the trauma, contributing to worse recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Expert commentary: CYP2D6 functional polymorphisms might directly contributed to the prevalence and frequency of the RD condition, commonly observed in BD patients. Although several environmental and socio-demographic/diagnostic variables such as alcohol/drug abuse, and medication non-compliance accounted for a significant proportion of the ability to predict RD prevalence and frequency, the pharmacogenetics of CYP, particularly CYP2D6, may help to identify BD patients at risk for ADRs and TFs. These patients may be addressed towards alternative treatments, thus improving their quality of life, and reducing RD prevalence and frequency and the overall costs for their management."}, {"Title": "Preventing work-related stress among staff working in children's cancer Principal Treatment Centres in the UK: a brief survey of staff support systems and practices.", "Abstract": "Growing evidence of the association between health professionals' well-being and patient and organisational outcomes points to the need for effective staff support. This paper reports a brief survey of the UK's children's cancer Principal Treatment Centres (PTCs) regarding staff support systems and practices. A short on-line questionnaire, administered in 2012-2013, collected information about the availability of staff support interventions which seek to prevent work-related stress among different members of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). It was completed by a member of staff with, where required, assistance from colleagues. All PTCs (n\u00a0=\u00a019) participated. Debriefs following a patient death was the most frequently reported staff support practice. Support groups were infrequently mentioned. There was wide variability between PTCs, and between professional groups, regarding the number and type of interventions available. Doctors appear to be least likely to have access to support. A few Centres routinely addressed work-related stress in wider staff management strategies. Two Centres had developed a bespoke intervention. Very few Centres were reported to actively raise awareness of support available from their hospital's Occupational Health department. A minority of PTCs had expert input regarding staff support from clinical psychology/liaison psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Plague Doctors in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic: Mental Health Professionals and the \"San Francisco Model,\" 1981-1990.", "Abstract": "Psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals were among the first and most crucial responders to HIV/AIDS. Given an epidemic in which behavior and identity played fundamental roles, mental health professionals were uniquely positioned to conduct social research to explain the existence and spread of disease; to develop clinical understanding of psychological aspects of HIV/AIDS as they emerged; and to collaborate with affected communities to promote education and behavioral change. This study examines the roles of mental health professionals as \"plague doctors\" in San Francisco's response to HIV/AIDS, in the early years of the epidemic. Among the many collaborations and projects that distinguished the \"San Francisco model\" of response to this plague, bathhouse-based epidemiology, consult-liaison psychiatry, and community partnerships for counseling and education are examined in detail as illustrations of the epidemic-changing engagement of the mental health community."}, {"Title": "Analysis of glucose metabolism of (18)F-FDG in major depression patients using PET imaging: Correlation of salivary cortisol and \u03b1-amylase.", "Abstract": "Current diagnosis of Major depressive disorder (MDD) depends on its clinical symptoms, not on the results of any laboratory examinations. Establishing biological markers for diagnosis of MDD is one of the most important problems to be solved in psychiatry practice. MDD patients (n=8) and a healthy control group (n=8) were recruited in this study. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) assessments were completed and saliva samples were collected for assessments of salivary cortisol and salivary \u03b1-amylase (sAA). PET examination was performed. Salivary cortisol and sAA in the MDD patients group were significantly higher than the healthy control group (P<0.001). MDD patients showed lower glucose metabolism of 18F-FDG in Cingulate Gyrus (BA24), Superior Frontal Gyrus (BA6), Rectal Gyrus (BA11) and Orbital Gyrus (BA11/47) compared with the healthy control group. The severity of depression, salivary cortisol and sAA correlated negatively with regional glucose metabolism in Cingulate Gyrus (BA 24), Superior Frontal Gyrus (BA 6), Rectal Gyrus (BA 11) and Orbital Gyrus (BA 11/47). The combination of salivary cortisol, sAA, superior frontal gyrus and rectal gyrus was the potential predictor of depression for MDD patients (\u0394R(2)=0.981, p<0.001). The present study showed that, MDD patients group showed higher salivary cortisol, sAA levels and lower glucose metabolism of (18)F-FDG in several brain areas compared with the healthy control group. The combination of salivary cortisol, sAA, glucose metabolism of (18)F-FDG of superior frontal gyrus and rectal gyrus may serve as a simple clinical tool for the early diagnosis of MDD."}, {"Title": "Targeting the ecology within: The role of the gut-brain axis and human microbiota in drug addiction.", "Abstract": "Despite major advances in our understanding of the brain using traditional neuroscience, reliable and efficacious treatments for drug addiction have remained elusive. Hence, the time has come to utilize novel approaches, particularly those drawing upon contemporary advances in fields outside of established neuroscience and psychiatry. Put another way, the time has come for a paradigm shift in the addiction sciences. Apropos, a revolution in the area of human health is underway, which is occurring at the nexus between enteric microbiology and neuroscience. It has become increasingly clear that the human microbiota (the vast ecology of bacteria residing within the human organism), plays an important role in health and disease. This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that bacteria living in the human body (approximately 1kg of mass, roughly equivalent to that of the human brain) outnumber human cells 10 to 1. While advances in the understanding of the role of microbiota in other areas of human health have yielded intriguing results (e.g., Clostridium difficile, irritable bowel syndrome, autism, etc.), to date, no systematic programs of research have examined the role of microbiota in drug addiction. The current hypothesis, therefore, is that gut dysbiosis plays a key role in addictive disorders. In the context of this hypothesis, this paper provides a rationale for future research to target the \"gut-brain axis\" in addiction. A brief background of the gut-brain axis is provided, along with a series of hypothesis-driven ideas outlining potential treatments for addiction via manipulations of the \"ecology within.\""}, {"Title": "[Digital Game Addiction Among Adolescents and Younger Adults: A Current Overview].", "Abstract": "The games that adolescents and young people used to play in the play grounds and on the streets have been replaced in recent years with cyber games played in front of the computer on the internet or in game arcades. This changing culture has particularly brought up the concept of \"digital game addiction\", a condition that stems from the steadily growing passion for digital games and their excessived and uncontrolled usage among adolescents and young people. Game addiction in the psychiatry literature has been described as an impulse control disorder characterized by the symptoms such as \"the inability to control the time spent on game-playing\", \"a loss of interest in other activities\", \"continuing to play despite the adverse effects\" and \"feeling psychologically deprived when not being able to play\".\"Although digital game addiction has not been accepted by psychiatric authorities as a psychiatric disorder yet, the increasing psychiatry referrals due to the problems accompanying this disorder, the efforts of families to seek support and solutions, the evidence that similarities with other types of addiction have been revealed by researchers, as well as the current prevalence rates are all factors that suggest the existence of important of the examination of issue.

A wide range of scattered secondary literature was assessed and evaluated. Additionally, some original sources are literally quoted and interpreted according to the context. Since the end of the nineteenth century a complicated process of separation from internal medicine and psychiatry led to the formation of a self-conscious discipline of neurology. The first generation of German neurologists succeeded in founding the German Journal for Neurology (\"Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Nervenheilkunde\") in 1890 and their own neurological association, the Society of German Neurologists (\"Gesellschaft Deutscher Nerven\u00e4rzte\", GDN) in 1907. On an international scale, however, the institutional implementation of neurology with only a small number of chairs and few neurology departments remained more than modest. The ambitions for autonomy ended 2 years after the change of power in 1933. Regulatory interventions by the government and psychiatric interests led to the fusion of the GDN with the psychiatric specialist society, the new association being called the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists (\"Gesellschaft Deutscher Neurologen und Psychiater\", GDNP) in 1935. In this group psychiatrists dominated the discourse. The expulsion, imprisonment and murder of physicians declared as non-Aryan or Jewish along with the forced consolidation (\"Gleichschaltung\") at the universities prompted profound changes in medical and academic life. It remains an ongoing challenge of neurological historical research to measure the impact of this upheaval on the few neurology departments in hospitals and private practices."}, {"Title": "Signing on for dirty work: Taking stock of a public psychiatry project from the inside.", "Abstract": "As applied anthropologists used to working at arm's length from public psychiatry, we step out of the daily grind to take stock of the challenges of taking on ethnography entrained-harnessed to the implementation of a new program.

In fact, frequent exposure to long-term polipharmacotherapy, poor compliance to pharmachological treatment and comorbidity with organic illnesses requiring the prescription of other drugs are causes of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions.

Then we analysed, in a descriptive way, the different association between the drug and the related ADR, evaluating the different safety profiles, in relation to experimental studies, supporting the importance of the signal.\nIn the last years, among the new 25 ADRs, 10 were related to antidepressant drugs (8 SSRI, 1 mirtazapine, 1 agomelatine). In relation to antipsychotic drugs, 6 new correlations were found between drug and ADR onset, mainly among atypical antispychotics. Other correlations (6 above all) were found among antiepileptic drugs. Among benzodiazepines, a signal linked to rabdomylysis onset was found. It is also recommended an evaluation of safety profile in relation to zolpidem prescription.\nThe results of our systematic review are a motivational input, considering the continuous increase of safety warnings, to attentively monitor drug's prescription. Spontaneous ADRs' signaling is a classical system to provide the required attention in relation to a potential risk.

Some of these drugs have been or are currently being investigated in small Phase 2 studies for depression, alcoholism, smoking cessation, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, unlike the synergistic effects of combining antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs, the potential therapeutic effects of hallucinogen drugs may be attenuated by the concurrent use of these medications because antidepressant and atypical antipsychotic drugs desensitize and/or down-regulate 5HT2A receptors.

It is therefore likely that HA is seen as part of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to construct overlap and the diagnostic uncertainty of HA in this age group. In the present study, the extent of HA symptoms was investigated in 94 children and adolescents with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis of OCD. Self-reported HA symptoms were assessed using the Childhood Illness Attitude Scales. Clinician-rated OCD symptoms and severity were measured using the Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale.

Over the decades, refinements and alternative symptom foci resulted in the development of several CBT protocols/manuals for each of the many disorders, especially in the affective disorders. Although shown to be effective in highly trained providers, the proliferation of CBT protocols also has shown to demonstrate challenges in dissemination and implementation efforts due to the sheer number of CBT protocols and their related training requirements (eg, 6\u2005months per protocol) and their related cost (eg, over US$2000 each; lost days/hours at work). To address these concerns, newer transdiagnostic CBT protocols have been developed to reduce the number of disorder-specific CBT protocols needed to treat patients with affective disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments are based on the notion that various disorder-specific CBT protocols contain important but overlapping treatment components that can be distilled into a single treatment and therefore address the symptoms and comorbidities across all of the disorders at once. 3 examples of transdiagnostic treatments include group CBT of anxiety, unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders and transdiagnostic behaviour therapy. Each transdiagnostic protocol is designed for a different set of disorders, contains a varied amount of CBT treatment components and is tested in different types of samples.

Selected studies assessed antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, were published in peer-reviewed journals, and represented a range of studies across a pragmatic-explanatory continuum as determined by authors (CB/LA). After completing training, raters reviewed the 12 studies and rated the study domains using ASPECT-R. Intraclass correlation coefficients were estimated for total and domain scores. Qualitative ratings then were assigned to describe the inter-rater reliability.\nASPECT-R scores for the 12 studies were completed by seven raters. The ASPECT-R total score intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87, corresponding to an excellent inter-rater reliability. Domain intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.85 to 0.31, corresponding to excellent to poor inter-rater reliability.\nThe inter-rater reliability of the ASPECT-R total score was excellent, with excellent to good inter-rater reliability for most domains.

Antidepressant use (both overall and for SSRIs) prior to violent crime was more common among those convicted than among those without convictions. Among boys with repeated violent crimes, it was also more common than among boys with non-violent crimes. Adjustment for differences in background characteristics decreased the associations between antidepressant use and violent crime, but did not eliminate them.\nThe results add further evidence for caution in prescribing antidepressants among young persons. It also calls for a reanalysis of violence measures in the original trial data."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent sports psychiatry in the US.", "Abstract": "A positive youth sports experience is essential if an athlete is to develop a lifelong commitment to sport. Children enjoy play and adults can create opportunities for physical, emotional, and cognitive development through sport for all children. This article reviews the current state of youth sports in the US, highlighting some of the problems of the current model and efforts to transform and improve the youth sports experience in the US. The new model of youth sports emphasizes the importance of developing 'physical literacy' in all young athletes, increasing availability of recreational sports activities, providing quality coaching to all, improved sports safety, improved availability of sports venues for athletes at all levels, and at an affordable cost for all. The US Olympic Committee, following an innovative programme by USA Hockey, has developed and promoted the American Developmental Model to its component Sport National Governing Boards to improve the experience of young athletes. The sports-informed paediatric psychiatrist, knowledgeable about child and family development and aware of the local youth sports opportunities and challenges, is well prepared to advocate for a healthy and fun sport experience for every young athlete."}, {"Title": "Cardiovascular side effects of psychopharmacologic therapy.", "Abstract": "WHO defined in 1976 psychopharmaca as drugs affecting psychological functions, behaviour and self-perception. Psychopharmacology is the study of pharmacological agents that affect mental and emotional functions. Creative approach to psychopharmacotherapy reflects a transdisciplinary, integrative and person-centered psychiatry. Psychiatric disorders often occur in cardiac patients and can affect the clinical presentation and morbidity. Cardiovascular (CV) side effects (SE) caused by psychopharmaceutic agents require comprehensive attention. Therapeutic approach can increase placebo and decrease nocebo reactions. The main purpose of this review is to comprehend CV SE of psychotropic drugs (PD). Critical overview of CV SE of PD will be presented in this review. Search was directed but not limited to CV effects of psychopharmacological substances, namely antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, antidepressants and stimulants. Literature review was performed and data identified by searches of Medline and PubMed for period from 2004 to 2015. Only full articles and abstracts published in English were included. SE of PD are organized according to the following types of CV effects: cardiac and circulatory effects, abnormalities of cardiac repolarisation and arrhythmias and heart muscle disease. There is wide spectrum and various CV effects of PD. Results of this review are based on literature research. The reviewed data came largely from prevalence studies, case reports, and cross-sectional studies. Psychopharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders is complex and when concomitantly present with CV disease, presentation of drug SEs can significantly contribute to illness course. Further development of creative psychopharmacotherapy is required to deal with CV effects of PD."}, {"Title": "Can Artificial Intelligences Suffer from Mental Illness? A Philosophical Matter to Consider.", "Abstract": "The potential for artificial intelligences and robotics in achieving the capacity of consciousness, sentience and rationality offers the prospect that these agents have minds. If so, then there may be a potential for these minds to become dysfunctional, or for artificial intelligences and robots to suffer from mental illness. The existence of artificially intelligent psychopathology can be interpreted through the philosophical perspectives of mental illness. This offers new insights into what it means to have either robot or human mental disorders, but may also offer a platform on which to examine the mechanisms of biological or artificially intelligent psychiatric disease. The possibility of mental illnesses occurring in artificially intelligent individuals necessitates the consideration that at some level, they may have achieved a mental capability of consciousness, sentience and rationality such that they can subsequently become dysfunctional. The deeper philosophical understanding of these conditions in mankind and artificial intelligences might therefore offer reciprocal insights into mental health and mechanisms that may lead to the prevention of mental dysfunction."}, {"Title": "Hesitation Wounds and Sharp Force Injuries in Forensic Pathology and Psychiatry: Multidisciplinary Review of the Literature and Study of Two Cases.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper was to showcase the significant diagnostic value of hesitation wounds in terms of forensic, psychiatric, and medicolegal interest. A number of studies were reviewed to update and summarize the relevant literature on the incidence, distribution, character, and function of hesitation wounds as well as the sociodemographic variables and psychopathology of the inducers. This study also investigates their importance as a forensic criterion in the distinction between suicide and homicide as well as a psychiatric diagnostic tool in suicide prevention. In addition, the paper reports two new cases. Results conclude that there is equal incidence, but different distribution of hesitation wounds between genders. Furthermore, the low dispersion of hesitation wounds contrasts with the high dispersion of defense wounds. The inducers' psychopathology lies principally in Axis I disorders. Finally, there is a comprehensive analysis of non-suicidal self-injury and the role of self-wounding in suicide prevention."}, {"Title": "Euthanasia for Detainees in Belgium.", "Abstract": "In 2011, Frank Van Den Bleeken became the first detainee to request euthanasia under Belgium's Euthanasia Act of 2002. This article investigates whether it would be lawful and morally permissible for a doctor to accede to this request. Though Van Den Bleeken has not been held accountable for the crimes he committed, he has been detained in an ordinary prison, without appropriate psychiatric care, for more than 30 years. It is first established that Van Den Bleeken's euthanasia request plausibly meets the relevant conditions of the Euthanasia Act and that, consequently, a doctor could lawfully fulfill it. Next, it is argued that autonomy-based reasons for euthanizing him outweigh complicity-based reasons against doing so, and that, therefore, it is also morally permissible for a doctor to carry out the euthanasia request."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders: The psychiatrist's contribution to sport.", "Abstract": "Athletes experience a range of mental health problems with at least an equivalent prevalence to the general population. This chapter explores the psychiatrist's role in sport, along a pathway of mental healthcare from 'upstream' prevention, screening, and early detection of mental stress to 'downstream' assessment, treatment, rehabilitation, and recovery from mental illness. At each stage on this pathway the psychiatrist has a broad spectrum of bio-psycho-social strategies to employ in clinical practice. Upstream, the importance of psychological resilience is described along with the concept of mental 'pre-habilitation' (a term usually associated with the prevention of physical injury). Alongside these preventative measures, early detection is improved by education, increased awareness, and by the use of effective mental health screening measures. Further downstream ready access to psychiatric expertise and good collaboration between the psychiatrist and the world of sport improve access to treatment, delivery of that treatment, rehabilitation, and return to sport during recovery."}, {"Title": "Culturally Sensitive Approaches to Identification and Treatment of Depression among HIV Infected African American Adults: A Qualitative Study of Primary Care Providers' Perspectives.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent among HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals, and is associated with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and accelerated disease progression. MDD is underdiagnosed and undertreated among low-income African Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic. To improve detection and treatment of depression among African Americans living with HIV/AIDS, it is important to understand culturally and contextually relevant aspects of MDD and attitudes about mental health treatment.\nA focus group session was conducted with seven providers and staff at a primary care center that serves a largely African-American community heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic in Washington, DC. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach to distill prominent themes, perspectives, and experiences among participating providers.\nFive themes emerged to characterize the lived experiences of HIV+ African-American patients: (a) Changes in perceptions of HIV over time; (b) HIV is comorbid with mental illness, particularly depression and substance abuse; (c) Stigma is associated with both HIV and depression; (d) Existing mental health services vary and are insufficient and (e) Suggestions for optimal treatment for comorbid HIV and depression.\nThis study reflects the views of providers from one clinic in this community.\nSubstantial economic disadvantage, pervasive childhood adversity, limited education and limited resources jointly put members of this community at risk for acquisition of HIV and for development of depression and addictions. These contextual factors provide an important reminder that any patient-level depression identification or intervention in this community will have to be mindful of such circumstances."}, {"Title": "The Use of Phone Technology in Outpatient Populations: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "A systematic review was conducted to identify the types of phone technology used in the adult outpatient population with a focus on Hispanic patients and psychiatric populations.\nA search for articles was conducted on the EMBASE, PubMed and PsycINFO databases. Articles reviewed were peer-reviewed, full-text, English language and published through mid-November 2014.\nTwenty-one articles were included in this review and grouped according to combinations of phone technology, medical specialty area and population. For all articles, phone technology was defined as telephone, cell, or smart phone. Technology was used in psychiatry with Hispanic population in four articles, in psychiatry with non-Hispanic population in seven articles and in other specialties with Hispanic population in ten articles. Articles were evaluated for quality. Six articles were assessed as strong, eight were moderate and seven were weak in global quality. Interventions included direct communication, text messaging, interactive voice response, camera and smart phone app. Studies with Hispanic populations used more text messaging, while studies in psychiatry favored direct communication. The majority of articles in all groups yielded improvements in health outcomes.\nFew studies have been conducted using phone technology in Hispanic and psychiatric populations. Various phone technologies can be helpful to patients in diverse populations and have demonstrated success in improving a variety of specific and overall healthcare outcomes. Phone technologies are easily adapted to numerous settings and populations and are valuable tools in efforts to increase access to care."}, {"Title": "Computational neuroimaging strategies for single patient predictions.", "Abstract": "Neuroimaging increasingly exploits machine learning techniques in an attempt to achieve clinically relevant single-subject predictions. An alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is the deployment of computational models for inferring on the (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference, focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches - Bayesian model selection and generative embedding - which can link computational models to individual predictions, we review how these methods accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data, and establish a link between a mechanistic, model-based approach and the statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning."}, {"Title": "Tackling Shell Shock in Great War Oxford: Thomas Saxty Good, William McDougall, and James Arthur Hadfield.", "Abstract": "Shell shock was an important object of diagnostic and therapeutic concern in Oxford during the Great War. The efforts of three Oxford physicians--Thomas Saxty Good, William McDougall, and James Arthur Hadfield--are of particular significance to our story. All worked on the problem at various sites throughout the city. They often collaborated. All were committed to employing innovative techniques such as psychotherapy and hypnosis. Each rose, to differing extents, to prominence in the field of psychological medicine during the succeeding decades. Yet all have been neglected in the current historiography. I argue that a close examination of their practices reveals a curious combination of therapeutic pragmatism and psychoanalytically informed techniques that later helped inform clinical psychology's challenge to psychiatry's dominance over the concept and care of mental disorder."}, {"Title": "[Not Available].", "Abstract": "In The Mind of Modernism, Mark Micale demonstrates the ubiquity of the concept of hysteria in the French imagination at the turn of the century. Taking this approach as our starting point, our study attempts to determine if the notion of degeneration played a similar role in the interactions of psychiatry, culture and politics in Quebec. Our analysis of a variety of historical sources demonstrates that the concept of degeneration did indeed penetrate aspects of psychiatric nosology, medical literature, news media, fiction, and political discourse in Quebec."}, {"Title": "The Status of Irritability in Psychiatry: A Conceptual and Quantitative Review.", "Abstract": "Research and clinical interest in irritability have been on the rise in recent years. Yet several questions remain about the status of irritability in psychiatry, including whether irritability can be differentiated from other symptoms, whether it forms a distinct disorder, and whether it is a meaningful predictor of clinical outcomes. In this article, we try to answer these questions by reviewing the evidence on how reliably irritability can be measured and its validity.\nWe combine a narrative and systematic review and meta-analysis of studies. For the systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched studies in PubMed and Web of Science based on preselected criteria. A total of 163\u00a0articles were reviewed, and 24 were included.\nWe found that irritability forms a distinct dimension with substantial stability across time, and that it is specifically associated with depression and anxiety in longitudinal studies. Evidence from genetic studies reveals that irritability is moderately heritable, and its overlap with depression is explained mainly by genetic factors. Behavioral and neuroimaging studies show that youth with persistent irritability exhibit altered activations in the amygdala, striatum, and frontal regions compared with age-matched healthy volunteers. Most knowledge about the treatment of irritability is based on effects of treatment on related conditions or post hoc analyses of trial data.\nWe identify a number of research priorities including innovative experimental designs and priorities for treatment studies, and conclude with recommendations for the assessment of irritability for researchers and clinicians."}, {"Title": "The incidence of schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders in Denmark in the period 2000-2012. A register-based study.", "Abstract": "We aimed to examine changes over time in the incidence of broad and narrow schizophrenia spectrum disorders in Denmark from 2000 to 2012.\nPatients were classified as incident schizophrenia if registered with a first time in- or outpatient contact with relevant diagnostic codes in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register between 2000 and 2012. Their history of contacts was traced back to 1969. Broad schizophrenia included schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, persistent delusional disorder, acute and transient psychotic disorders, schizoaffective disorders, and other nonorganic and unspecified psychotic disorders, (ICD 10 codes F20-F29). Narrow schizophrenia was defined with the ICD 10 codes F20.0-F20.9. Incidence rates (IR) and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using Poisson regression.\nThe IRR for broad schizophrenia increased by 1.43 (CI 95% 1.34-1.52) for females and 1.26 (CI 95% 1.20-1.33) for males. IRR for narrow schizophrenia increased by 1.36 (CI 95% 1.24-1.48) for females and 1.20 (CI 95% 1.11-1.29) for males. There was a significantly increased incidence in patients up to 32years of age. This was mainly explained by a significant 2-3 fold increase in outpatient incidence. We found a significant decrease in IRR for patients with broad and narrow schizophrenia aged 33 or older for both in- and outpatients.\nThe increased incidence of schizophrenia could partly be explained by better implementation of the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia in child and adolescent psychiatry and improved access to early intervention services, but a true increase in incidence of schizophrenia cannot be excluded. The decrease of incidence in the older age group could indicate that the national Danish early intervention strategy was successful."}, {"Title": "Tracing the indirect societal impacts of biomedical research: development and piloting of a technique based on citations.", "Abstract": "There is growing interest in assessing the societal impacts of research such as informing health policies and clinical practice, and contributing to improved health. Bibliometric approaches have long been used to assess knowledge outputs, but can they also help evaluate societal impacts? We aimed to see how far the societal impacts could be traced by identifying key research articles in the psychiatry/neuroscience area and exploring their societal impact through analysing several generations of citing papers. Informed by a literature review of citation categorisation, we developed a prototype template to qualitatively assess a reference's importance to the citing paper and tested it on 96 papers. We refined the template for a pilot study to assess the importance of citations, including self-cites, to four key research articles. We then similarly assessed citations to those citing papers for which the key article was Central i.e. it was very important to the message of the citing article. We applied a filter of three or more citation occasions in order to focus on the citing articles where the reference was most likely to be Central. We found the reference was Central for 4.4\u00a0% of citing research articles overall and ten times more frequently if the article contained three or more citation occasions. We created a citation stream of influence for each key paper across up to five generations of citations. We searched the Web of Science for citations to all Central papers and identified societal impacts, including international clinical guidelines citing papers across the generations."}, {"Title": "The functions of estrogen receptor beta in the female brain: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "Females have unique and additional risk factors for neurological disorders. Among classical estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2) has been suggested as a therapeutic target. However, little is known about the role of ER\u03b2 in the female brain. Six electronic databases were searched for articles evaluating the role of ER\u03b2 in the female brain and the influence of age and menopause on ER\u03b2 function. After screening 3186 titles and abstracts, 49 articles were included in the review, all of which were animal studies. Of these, 19 focused on cellular signaling, 7 on neuroendocrine pathways, 8 on neurological disorders, 4 on neuroprotection and 19 on psychological and psychiatric outcomes (6 studies evaluated two or more outcomes). Our findings showed that ER\u03b2 phosphorylated and activated intracellular second messenger proteins and regulated protein expression of genes involved in neurological functions. It also promoted neurogenesis, modulated the neuroendocrine regulation of stress response, conferred neuroprotection against ischemia and inflammation, and reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Targeting ER\u03b2 may constitute a novel treatment for menopausal symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and neurological diseases. However, to establish potential therapeutic and preventive strategies targeting ER\u03b2, future studies should be conducted in humans to further our understanding of the importance of ER\u03b2 in women's mental and cognitive health."}, {"Title": "Evaluating the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia in a large-scale genome-wide association study.", "Abstract": "The dopamine hypothesis, which posits that dysregulation of the dopaminergic system is etiologic for schizophrenia, is among the most enduring biological theories in psychiatry. Although variation within genes related to dopaminergic functioning has been associated with schizophrenia, an aggregate test of variation, using the largest publicly available schizophrenia dataset, has not previously been conducted.\nWe first identified a core set of 11 genes involved in the synthesis, metabolism, and neurotransmission of dopamine. We then extracted summary statistics of markers falling within, or flanking, these genes from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium's most recent schizophrenia mega-analysis results. We conducted aggregate tests for enrichment of dopamine-related pathways for association with schizophrenia.\nWe did not detect significant enrichment of signals across the core set of dopamine-related genes. However, we did observe modest to strong enrichment of genetic signals within the DRD2 locus.\nWithin the limits of available power, common sequence variation within core genes of the dopaminergic system is not related to risk of schizophrenia. This does not preclude a role of dopamine, or dopamine-related genes, in the clinical presentation of schizophrenia or in treatment response. However, it does suggest that the genetic risk for schizophrenia is not substantially affected by common variation in those genes which, collectively, critically impact dopaminergic functioning."}, {"Title": "[Somatic morbidity in the mentally ill].", "Abstract": "In addition to psychosocial impairment, patients with severe mental illness (SMI) are exposed to substantial risks with respect to physical health.

Potentials for improvement of curative and preventive health care are outlined. Current scientific and clinical knowledge on somatic health of patients with SMI provides evidence of close interactions between physical and mental health.

We collected the effect size, sample size, publication year and Impact Factor of initial studies, largest studies (i.e., with the largest sample size) and the corresponding meta-analyses. Initial studies were considered as replicated if they were in nominal agreement with meta-analyses and if their effect size inflation was below 100%.\nNominal agreement between initial studies and meta-analyses regarding the presence of a significant effect was not better than chance in psychiatry, whereas it was somewhat better in neurology and somatic diseases. Whereas effect sizes reported by largest studies and meta-analyses were similar, most of those reported by initial studies were inflated. Among the 256 initial studies reporting a significant effect (p<0.05) and paired with significant meta-analyses, 97 effect sizes were inflated by more than 100%. Nominal agreement and effect size inflation varied with the biomedical domain and study type. Indeed, the replication rate of initial studies reporting a significant effect ranged from 6.3% for genetic studies in psychiatry to 86.4% for cognitive/behavioral studies. Comparison between eight subgroups shows that replication rate decreases with sample size and \"true\" effect size. We observed no evidence of association between replication rate and publication year or Impact Factor.\nThe differences in reliability between biological psychiatry, neurology and somatic diseases suggest that there is room for improvement, at least in some subdomains."}, {"Title": "Improving the quality of handover in a liaison psychiatry team.", "Abstract": "Handover is a high risk point for errors in clinical care, in many cases leading to adverse events or near misses. The timely transfer of accurate and useful information between professionals is vital to ensure quality and safety, and to ensure the transfer of accountability for care. In this project standards were developed for quality handover between doctors in a liaison psychiatry department. The aim of these were to ensure adequate identification of patients, clear communication of tasks to be completed and relevant risk issues, as well as a guide to the priority of jobs. We measured compliance with these standards for all patients documented in the handover book during three week periods in 2013, 2014 (following delivery of education and guidance on handover to all doctors), and finally in 2015 after implementation of a proforma for handover. Handover documentation prior to the implementation of standards was of poor quality with significant absences of information. Key information to identify patients was frequently absent, for example hospital number was only recorded in 1% of cases. Only 81% of entries included the reason for the patient's referral, and 27% made no mention of the outstanding tasks for completion. Despite guidance and education of all doctors regarding the standards, there was no consistent improvement in compliance. It was particularly concerning that risk issues were only mentioned in 18% of cases, even when assessed immediately after education was given. Following introduction of the proforma compliance increased with overall completeness of handover improving from 40% to 71%. Without guidelines handover between shifts is of a poor quality, and often lacks key information to allow colleagues to identify patients and prioritise need. Education of those performing these handovers did not produce any benefits, either immediately following its delivery or in longer term follow up. The implementation of a template to aid clinicians in recording this data did produce improvements and received positive feedback from doctors."}, {"Title": "Neurasthenia at Mengo Hospital, Uganda: A case study in psychiatry and a diagnosis, 1906-50.", "Abstract": "This article uses a case-study approach to examine the complex and contradictory nature of diagnoses like neurasthenia in colonial Africa. Drawing on the case notes of European and African patients diagnosed with neurasthenia at the Church Missionary Society's Mengo Hospital, Uganda, it argues that in practice, and outside the colonial asylum in particular, ideas about race and mental illness were more nuanced than histories of psychiatry and empire might imply. At Mengo, the tales of pain and suffering recorded by the doctors remind us that there is more to the history of neurasthenia than colonial anxieties and socio-political control. This was a diagnosis that was negotiated in hospital examination rooms as much as in medical journals. Significantly, it was also a diagnosis that was not always reserved exclusively for white colonisers-at Mengo Hospital from the early 1900s neurasthenia was diagnosed in African patients too. It became part of a wider discussion about detribalisation, in which a person's social environment was as important as race."}, {"Title": "A Cross-sectional, Comparative Study of Insight in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Patients in Remission.", "Abstract": "To study insight correlates in schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder in remission among out-patients attending the Psychiatry Department of a Tertiary Care Hospital.\nIn a cross-sectional, naturalistic study, adult patients with schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder in remission (n = 80; schizophrenia-40, mania-20, bipolar depression-20) were compared on insight measures and clinical correlates.\nScale to Assess the Unawareness of Mental Disorders (SUMD) was used as the main tool to assess current and past measures of insight. Hogan's Drug Attitude Inventory was used to assess the drug attitude and compliance.

A commitment to personalized medicine demands an effort to bring evidence-based medicine and personalized medicine closer together. The use of relatively homogeneous groups, defined using a priori criteria, may constitute a promising initial step for developing more accurate risk-prediction models with which to advance the development of personalized evidence-based medicine approaches to heterogeneous syndromes such as schizophrenia. However, this can lead to a paradoxical situation in the field of psychiatry. Since there has been a tendency to loosely define psychiatric disorders as ones without a known aetiology, the discovery of an aetiology for psychiatric syndromes (e.g. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in some cases of schizophrenia), while offering a path toward more precise treatments, may also lead to their reclassification away from psychiatry. We contend that psychiatric disorders with a known aetiology should not be removed from the field of psychiatry. This knowledge should be used instead to guide treatment, inasmuch as psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and other treatments can all be valid approaches to mental disorders. The translation of the personalized clinical approach inherent to psychiatry into evidence-based precision medicine can lead to the development of novel treatment options for mental disorders and improve outcomes."}, {"Title": "Tolerability and suitability of brief group mindfulness-oriented interventions in psychiatric inpatients: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "Mindfulness-oriented therapies have a positive impact on patients' overall well-being and alleviate many psychiatric conditions.

Difference in phenotype characteristics manifests in the manner the addiction arises, history of the alcoholic and history of drinking, comorbid disorders, and the phenomenon of abstinence difficulties. Concerning the etiology of alcoholism, the disease itself is considered to be a consequence of an interactive influence of the environment and genetic factors. Numerous researches conducted in the last decades discovered many aspects of the biochemical, cell and molecular bases of alcohol addiction, leading to a conclusion that alcoholism is, like many other addictions, a brain disease. By recognizing alcoholism as a disease which basically implies changes of the neurobiological mechanisms, as well as a clear genetic basis, it was supposed that the disease, having its basis solely in the symptomatology, is essentially heterogeneous. By trying to solve the problem of a clinically heterogeneous nature of the disease during the last fifty years, various sub-classifications of such patients have been suggested. According to Cloninger, subtypes of alcoholism differ also according to changes in the brain neurotransmission systems, i.e. it is supposed that patients suffering from alcoholism type 1 have a more pronounced dopaminergic transmission deficit, while dopaminergic transmission is not disturbed significantly in patients diagnosed with alcoholism type 2, who, however, have a significant lack of serotonergic transmission. In such a way, Cloninger actually presented the basis of the so-called neurobiological alcoholism model. Since he has connected differences in neurotransmission with differences in personality characteristics, this model is also known as the psychobiological model of alcoholism. The characteristic of alcoholism type 1 is avoiding damage (Harm Avoidance, HA) decreased dopamine transmission and increased serotonin transmission, while the significant characteristic of alcoholism type 2 is seeking for excitement (Novelty Seeking, NS), unchanged dopamine transmission and decreased serotonin transmission. These neurochemical differences among alcoholism subtypes represent the basis for a different therapy approach. Intake of alcohol changes different gene expression in the human brain. The inheritance model of alcoholism is not fully explained, however, it is considered that the disease is connected to a larger gene number included in neurotransmission, cell mechanisms and general metabolic function, with a simultaneous influence of the environment. The contribution of genetic factors is stronger in certain types of alcoholism and thus we have been confronted in the last years of alcoholism research with studies researching the connections of some alcoholism subtypes with the polymorphism phenomenon in the genes coding the synaptic proteins included in the alcoholism etiology. The primary role of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain is catalysis of deamination of the oxidative neurotransmitter amines, i.e. serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. Thus, this enzyme is the key factor for maintaining cytoplasmic concentration of various neurotransmitters and for regulation of the neurotransmitting synaptic activity. Taken this MAO function into consideration, MAO is the enzyme included in the etiology and pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The finding of the decreased platelet MAO activity in various psychiatric disorders has brought us to the assumption that this enzyme may be a constitutional/genetic indicator (trait marker) or an indicator of disease condition (state marker) in biologic psychiatry. There are only a few studies of alcohol addiction researching the connections of the MAO coding gene polymorphism and alcoholism; however, these studies are primarily related to the variable number of tandem repeats (VTNR) polymorphism in the regulatory gene region for MAO-A, considered to influence the transcription activity/functionality of the enzyme."}, {"Title": "ANXIETY AND ATTACHMENT TO THE MOTHER IN PRESCHOOLERS RECEIVING PSYCHIATRIC CARE: THE FATHER-CHILD ACTIVATION RELATIONSHIP AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR.", "Abstract": "This 49-family study is the first to explore the father-child relationship in a clinical population of preschoolers (at a tertiary care child psychiatry clinic) and to examine its relation to child anxiety and attachment to the mother. A moderation model of the father-child activation relationship on the relation between attachment to the mother and child anxiety was tested and discussed. Analyses confirmed the expected independence between mother-child attachment and father-child activation as well as the association between mother-child attachment and anxiety. The highest levels of anxiety were found in insecure children, and more specifically, in insecure-ambivalent children and insecure disorganized-controlling children of the caregiving subtype. Hypotheses regarding the relation between anxiety and activation were only partially confirmed. Finally, the activation relationship with the father was shown to have a moderating effect on the relation between attachment to the mother and child anxiety; activation by the father may be considered either a protective or a risk factor. Results for this clinical population of young children are discussed in the light of attachment theory and activation relationship theory. The study's findings have the potential to contribute to the development of preventative, diagnostic, and intervention programs that take both parental figures into account."}, {"Title": "Medical Boards and Fitness to Practice: The Case of Teleka Patrick, MD.", "Abstract": "Medical boards and fitness-to-practice committees aim to ensure that medical students and physicians have \"good moral character\" and are not impaired in their practice of medicine.\nPresented here is an ethical analysis of stalking behavior by physicians and medical students, with focus on the case of Teleka Patrick, MD (a psychiatry resident practicing medicine while under a restraining order due to her alleged stalking behavior).\nWhile a restraining order is not generally considered a criminal conviction, stalking behavior is clearly unprofessional and a marker of inappropriate character and fitness, yet the reporting obligations for such matters are complex. Medical schools and training programs that fail to assess, record, and report matters of moral conduct such as this potentially allow impaired students to graduate and enter the work force (unless a robust licensing process identifies them). Patrick's case should be a wake-up call for medical schools and medical boards to better integrate the professionalism domain into their operations. Further, the professionalism of students and doctors need to be integrated into the legal domain, so that those who are unfit to practice are, in fact, prevented from doing so.

In addition to the usual considerations when prescribing any psychotropic agent to any patient, the prescriber in this case should pay careful attention to: (1) potential negative impact of the medication on athletic performance, (2) potential performance-enhancing effects, and (3) potential safety risks. This paper describes an updated review of relevant research findings and considerations in the above areas within various categories of psychiatric medications. Many methodological concerns exist with the studies that have examined psychotropic medication use by athletes. These include: small sample sizes; use of the medication in dosing strategies (e.g. single dose) that do not replicate how they are usually taken in the real world; use of primarily male subjects only; use of performance measures (e.g. subtraction, multitask) in some studies that may not align with physical demands experienced by athletes in their natural athletic environments; and not using athletes who actually have the psychiatric disorder or symptom the medication was designed to treat.

Tools from narrative synthesis were used to analyse quantitative findings on participation rates and qualitative findings on patient views.\nPubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, BNI, CINAHL, Cochrane Registers and Web of Science electronic databases were searched using a combination of 'psychiatry', 'symptom monitoring' and 'technology' descriptors.

Technology-based symptom monitoring was used for a range of mental health conditions, either independently of a specific therapeutic intervention or as an integrated component of therapeutic interventions. The majority of studies reported moderate-to-strong rates of participation, though a third reported lower rates. Qualitative feedback suggests that acceptability of monitoring is related to perceived validity, ease of practice, convenient technology, appropriate frequency and helpfulness of feedback, as well as the impact of monitoring on participants' ability to manage health and personal relationships.\nSuch symptom monitoring practices appear to be well accepted and may be a feasible complement to clinical practice.

However, smoking is usually a neglected issue in mental healthcare settings. The aim of this article is to describe a strategy to improve tobacco control in the hospital mental healthcare services of Catalonia (Spain). To bridge this gap, the Catalan Network of Smoke-free Hospitals launched a nationwide bottom-up strategy in Catalonia in 2007. The strategy relied on the creation of a working group of key professionals from various hospitals -the early adopters- based on Rogers' theory of the Diffusion of Innovations. In 2016, the working group is composed of professionals from 17 hospitals (70.8% of all hospitals in the region with mental health inpatient units). Since 2007, tobacco control has improved in different areas such as increasing mental health professionals' awareness of smoking, training professionals on smoking cessation interventions and achieving good compliance with the national smoking ban. The working group has produced and disseminated various materials, including clinical practice and best practice guidelines, implemented smoking cessation programmes and organised seminars and training sessions on smoking cessation measures in patients with mental illnesses.

Anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis is a subacute, autoimmune neurological disorder with psychiatric manifestations. The disease is a form of limbic encephalitis and is often paraneoplastic. The condition is also treatable. In this review article we examine the development of the disease, clinical practice, diagnostics and treatment.MATERIAL AND METHOD The article is based on references retrieved from searches in PubMed, and a discretionary selection of articles from the authors' own literature archive.RESULTS The disease most frequently affects young women. It may initially be perceived as a psychiatric condition, as it usually presents in the form of delusions, hallucinations or mania. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who later develop neurological symptoms such as various movement disorders, epileptic seizures and autonomic instability. Examination of serum or cerebrospinal fluid for NMDA receptor antibodies should be included in the assessment of patients with suspected encephalitis. MRI, EEG and assessment for tumours are important tools in diagnosing the condition and any underlying malignancy.INTERPRETATION If treatment is initiated early, the prognosis is good. Altogether 75\u00a0% of patients will fully recover or experience significant improvement. Apart from surgical resection of a possible tumour, the treatment consists of immunotherapy. Because of good possibilities for treatment, it is important that clinicians, particularly those in acute psychiatry, are aware of and alert to this condition."}, {"Title": "Study protocol-investigation of the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) for the routine detection of delirium in the care home setting: a prospective cohort study.", "Abstract": "Delirium is a common and distressing condition associated with frailty, dementia and comorbidity.

The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of organisms and a sophisticated genomic structure. Bacteria within the gut are estimated to weigh in excess of 1\u2009kg in the adult human and the microbes within not only produce antimicrobial peptides, short chain fatty acids, and vitamins, but also most of the common neurotransmitters found in the human brain. That the microbial content of the gut plays a key role in immune development is now beyond doubt. Early disruption of the host-microbe interplay can have lifelong consequences, not just in terms of intestinal function but in distal organs including the brain. It is clear that the immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication in order to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain about the effect of the gut microbiota in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. However, studies using germ-free animals, infective models, prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics have increased our understanding of the interplay. Early life stress can have a lifelong impact on the microbial content of the intestine and permanently alter immune functioning. That early life stress can also impact adult psychopathology has long been appreciated in psychiatry. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the gut microbiota, immune, and central nervous systems in a network of communication that impacts behavior patterns and psychopathology, to eventually translate these findings to the human situation both in health and disease.

While ethics can seem abstract or philosophical, its tenets are fundamental to the practice of medicine. Understanding relevant ethical principles shapes how practitioners make decisions in all activities, including clinical, administrative, research, and scholarly.\nUsing the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Code of Ethics as the framework, these vignettes serve as stimulus material to help teach the ethical principles relevant to child and adolescent psychiatry practice. Each vignette briefly describes a clinical situation in practice, followed by questions and possible appropriate responses. The teacher's guide includes a discussion of the relevant ethical principles and perspectives on how to think about the issues involved. A supplementary overview of ethical issues in child and adolescent psychiatry and a list of resources are also provided.\nWe and other child and adolescent psychiatrists have used this curriculum at professional organizational meetings, in residency programs, and in teaching medical students with positive learner responses.\nThis curriculum was developed by members of the AACAP Ethics Committee with input from the entire committee in an effort to produce material that was easy to use and provided valuable content about an essential aspect of practice that is relevant to all practitioners at all levels. While designed for child and adolescent psychiatrists, the content is relevant to all physicians working with children, adolescents, and families."}, {"Title": "Videoconferencing in psychiatry, a meta-analysis of assessment and treatment.", "Abstract": "Videoconferencing in psychiatry allows psychiatric counseling to be dealt remotely.

Yet, specific risk factors that contribute to suicidal ideation (SI) among diverse Latino immigrant populations are not well established.\nData were collected in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona using a screening battery assessing mental health, substance abuse risk, trauma exposure, demographics, and sociocultural factors. Prevalence rates of lifetime and 30-day SI were compared across sites. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and sociocultural-contextual factors associated with 30-day SI.\nFive hundred and sixty-seven Latino patients from primary care, behavioral health and HIV clinics and community agencies participated. Rates of lifetime SI ranged from 29-35%; rates for 30-day SI were 21-23%. Rates of SI were not statistically different between sites. Factors associated with SI included exposure to discrimination, lower ethnic identity, elevated family conflict, and low sense of belonging (P<0.01). In the adjusted model, higher scores on depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma exposure were significantly associated with 30-day SI (OR=1.14, 1.04, and 7.76, respectively). Greater number of years living in the host country was significantly associated with increased odds of having SI (OR=2.22) while having citizenship status was associated with lower odds (OR=0.45).\nLatinos suffering depression, trauma exposure, and immigration stressors are more likely to experience SI.

The survey included a well-validated, single-item measure to assess symptoms of burnout, several demographic questions, and Likert-scale items to assess residents' appraisals of empathic functioning and strategies for coping with stress from patient encounters.\nResponses were obtained from 400 residents, for a response rate of 48%. Twenty-one percent (N = 84) of residents reported symptoms of burnout. Burnout was reported more frequently by residents in postgraduate year 2 than by those in other years and was associated with engagement in personal psychotherapy during residency. No association was found between burnout and age, gender, or location of residency program. Residents who endorsed symptoms of burnout reported higher levels of compromised empathic functioning, were less likely to consult with supervisors about stressful clinical experiences, and were more likely to engage in unhealthy coping strategies.\nSymptoms of burnout affect one-fifth of Canadian psychiatry residents.

We have reviewed this topic in Nazi concentration camps (KL), Soviet special camps, and gulags, providing some preliminary data for our research. Data show that the incidence of suicide in Nazi KL could be up to 30 times higher than the general population and was also much higher than in Soviet special camps (maybe due to more favorable conditions for prisoners and the abolishment of death penalty), while available data on Soviet gulags are contradictory. However, data interpretation is very controversial, because, for example, the Nazi KL authorities used to cover-up the murder victims as suicides. Most of the suicides were committed in the first years of imprisonment, and the method of suicide most commonly used was hanging, although other methods included cutting blood vessels, poisoning, contact with electrified wire, or starvation. It is possible to differentiate two behaviors when committing suicide; impulsive behavior (contact with electrified barbed wire fences) or premeditated suicide (hanging up or through poison). In Soviet special camps, possible motives for suicides could include feelings of guilt for crimes committed, fear of punishment, and a misguided understanding of honor on the eve of criminal trials. Self-destructive behaviors, such as self-mutilation in gulag camps or prisoners who let themselves die, have been widely reported.

BED patients suffer from a lack of behavioral control during recurrent binge eating episodes and thus fail to adapt their behavior in the face of negative consequences, eg, high risk for obesity. To examine impairments in flexible reward-based decision-making, we exposed BED patients (n=22) and matched healthy individuals (n=22) to a reward-guided decision-making task during functional resonance imaging (fMRI). Performing fMRI analysis informed via computational modeling of choice behavior, we were able to identify specific signatures of altered decision-making in BED. On the behavioral level, we observed impaired behavioral adaptation in BED, which was due to enhanced switching behavior, a putative deficit in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation appropriately. This was accompanied by diminished activation related to exploratory decisions in the anterior insula/ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, although so-called model-free reward prediction errors remained intact, representation of ventro-medial prefrontal learning signatures, incorporating inference on unchosen options, was reduced in BED, which was associated with successful decision-making in the task. On the basis of a computational psychiatry account, the presented findings contribute to defining a neurocognitive phenotype of BED."}, {"Title": "ADHD in context: Young adults' reports of the impact of occupational environment on the manifestation of ADHD.", "Abstract": "Does changing context play a role in the decline in ADHD symptoms in adulthood? Insufficient research has explored the functioning of adults with ADHD. As adults, individuals with ADHD have significantly more latitude to control aspects of their day-to-day environments. Do the new contexts young adults find themselves in alter their experience of ADHD? Are there particular occupational or educational contexts in which young adults report functioning better than others? To examine this issue, we conducted semi-structured interviews at four North American sites in 2010-11 with 125 young adults, originally diagnosed with ADHD as children, regarding their work and post-secondary educational environments. Many subjects describe their symptoms as context-dependent. In some contexts, participants report feeling better able to focus; in others, their symptoms-such as high energy levels-become strengths rather than liabilities. Modal descriptions included tasks that were stressful and challenging, novel and required multitasking, busy and fast-paced, physically demanding or hands-on, and/or intrinsically interesting. Consistent with a developmental psychopathology framework, ADHD is experienced as arising from an interaction between our subjects and their environments. These findings demonstrate the need to account for the role of context in our understanding of ADHD as a psychiatric disorder, especially as it manifests in young adulthood."}, {"Title": "[25 years after re-unification of Germany: An overview on Eastern German psychiatry.

Forensic psychiatrists were trained in use of the HCR-20 and asked to complete it as part of their admission assessment. The completed forms were then retained by the researchers and not used in clinical practice; for this, clinicians relied solely on national legally required guidelines. Violent outcomes were determined at 3 and 6\u2009months after the assessment. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to calculate the predictive accuracy of the HCR-20 for violence.\nArea under the curve analyses suggested that the HCR-20 total score is a good predictor of violence in this cohort, with the clinical and risk sub-scales showing good predictive accuracy, but the historical sub-scale not doing so. Area under the curve figures were similar at 3\u2009months and at 6\u2009months.\nOur results are consistent with studies previously conducted in Western countries.

A\u00a0further aspect was to record significant clinical differences and also similarities between the patient groups in care, matching with the criteria of ICD\u00a010 for schizophrenia (F20), persistent delusional disorders (F22) and schizoaffective disorder (F25).\nRetrospective analysis with reference to the manually and electronically recorded patient medical records of an acute case care ward for geriatric psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nDuring the assessment period 210 patients over the age of 65\u00a0years were included consecutively in the study (F20 - 64\u00a0patients, F22 - 78\u00a0patients, F25 - 64\u00a0patients, 4\u00a0patients died). Ignoring the fact that many of the patients were admitted without a\u00a0diagnosis, the diagnostic classification of the referring doctor, above all those made by general practitioners, proved to be very consistent for the groups F20 and F25. In the group F22 diagnoses, however, up to almost one half of the referred patients were incorrectly admitted with an F20 diagnosis. The patients included in group F22 formed a\u00a0heterogeneous group, or a\u00a0melting pot for various sub-groups, with the common shared characteristic of being comprised of persons suffering from a\u00a0delusional disorder. These differed from the other two groups in the following attributes: the patients were either older or very old persons, they were mostly receiving inpatient treatment for the first time and subsequently had fewer re-admissions. They also suffered more frequently from both psychiatric and somatic comorbidities; furthermore they included elderly people who had suffered from learning deficiencies or borderline intellectual deficiencies throughout their earlier lives. The patients in groups F20 and F25 differed primarily only in terms of their psychiatric medication, with significantly more mood stabilizer prescribed in the F25 group. Patients in all three groups frequently received tranquilisers during the day and sedatives in the evening, atypical antipsychotics were prescribed in the great majority of cases.\nThe referral diagnoses of patients suffering from many years of schizophrenic type illnesses were largely in compliance with the diagnostic criteria, a\u00a0much more difficult issue for the referring doctors was the allocation of patients with a\u00a0first occurrence of delusional symptoms. Those patients who were allocated to the diagnostic group schizophrenia differed significantly from patients from the group with delusional disorders."}, {"Title": "Examining the Impact of Patient-Reported Hope for Improvement and Patient Satisfaction with Clinician/Treatment on the Outcome of Major Depressive Disorder Treatment.", "Abstract": "This analysis aims at examining if patient-reported variables such as hope for improvement and patient satisfaction with clinician/treatment could influence the outcome major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment, namely depression remission, in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nThe STAR*D study was conducted at 18 primary care and 23 psychiatric care settings in the United States from 2001-2007 and was funded by the National Institute of Mental health (NIMH). The analysis contained in this manuscript was conceptualized at the Cedars-Sinai Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences and performed at the UCLA School of Public Health.\nUsing data from STAR*D, the current study used logistic regression and survival analyses to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms remission and two sets of self-reported factors: Hope for improvement and, Patient satisfaction with treatment/clinician.\nFirst, more than 90% of STAR*D patients reported having high hope for improvement (agree or strongly agree) and more than 66% endorsed high satisfaction with clinicians and more than 50% expressed high satisfaction with treatments (very or mostly satisfied). Second, hope for improvement was predictive of depression remission (p<0.05). Third, satisfaction with clinician/treatment, did not predict remission.\nThis study shows the impact that patients' subjective hope for improvement can have on predicting depression remission in contrast to satisfaction with clinician/treatment. Future studies should prospectively incorporate patients' subjective attitudes regarding hope for improvement and satisfaction with clinicians and treatments as mediators and moderators of MDD treatment success."}, {"Title": "Psychometric Properties of the Persian Version of the Short Beck Depression Inventory with Iranian Psychiatric Outpatients.", "Abstract": "The short form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13) is useful for the screening and assessment of depression in clinical and research settings.

The sample consisted of 52 Iranian psychiatric outpatients who received services at psychiatric and psychological clinics at the School of Behavioral Sciences & Mental Health-Tehran Institute of Psychiatry, Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) in Tehran, Iran. The study examined the reliability, construct validity, and factor structure of the instrument. The instrument indicated good reliability with Cronbach's alpha of .85 and strong construct validity based on moderate to strong positive correlations with other measures of mental health issues. Using a Principal Component Analysis and Varimax Rotation with Kaiser Normalization, three factors were identified and labeled Affective (F1), Somatic/Vegetative (F2), and Cognitive/Loss of Functioning (F3). The current factor structure suggests that depression is a multidimensional construct in an Iranian clinical sample.

Premenstrual syndrome presents with vague psychological, somatic, or biological symptoms. It may be seen more commonly in a specific profile of patients. We try to evaluate the patterns and predictors of premenstrual symptoms among females working in a tertiary care psychiatry hospital. Methodology. We recruited working females at a tertiary care psychiatry hospital in India, through purposive sampling, and assessed them cross-sectionally. Premenstrual Symptom Checklist was used to assess the frequency and distribution of premenstrual symptoms, which were correlated with various sociodemographic variables to evaluate the predictors for premenstrual symptoms. Results. 150 working females were included, belonging to different sociodemographic profile. Somatic symptoms (backache, joint and muscles pain, and fatiguability) were most commonly reported followed by psychological (irritability and losing temper easily) and biological symptoms (increased micturition). Premenstrual symptoms were seen more commonly in women with higher educational status and nursing profession and residing in nuclear families (p < 0.05), while age and marital status did not correlate significantly. Discussion. Premenstrual symptoms are common and distressing, especially for working females. Somatic symptoms such as backache and joint pains predominate over psychobiological symptoms. Women with higher educational status and professions like nursing belonging to nuclear families are more prone to these symptoms. Attention needs to be given to premenstrual symptoms in such population of working females."}, {"Title": "Oral cenesthopathy.", "Abstract": "Cenesthopathy is characterized by abnormal and strange bodily sensations and is classified as a 'delusional disorder, somatic type' or 'somatoform disorder' according to the DSM 5. The oral cavity is one of the frequent sites of cenesthopathy, thus the term 'oral cenesthopathy.' Patients with oral cenesthopathy complain of unusual sensations without corresponding abnormal findings in the oral area, such as excessive mucus secretion, a slimy sensation, or a feeling of coils or wires being present within the oral region. They usually visit multiple dentists rather than psychiatrists. Without a proper diagnosis, they repeatedly pursue unnecessary surgical procedures to remove their 'foreign body'. This sometimes creates a dilemma between the dentists and patients. The nosography of oral cenesthopathy has been discussed in some case reports and reviews but is overlooked in mainstream medicine. This review focuses on the various aspects of oral cenesthopathy. The estimated prevalence of cenesthopathy was 0.2 to 1.9\u00a0% in a study done at a Japanese university psychiatry clinic and 27\u00a0% in a study done at a Japanese psychosomatic dentistry clinic. Oral cenesthopathy do not have clear disposition, while some studies reported that elderly women were most commonly affected. Its pathophysiology has not been fully elucidated. However, recent studies have suggested a right\u2009>\u2009left asymmetrical pattern of the cerebral blood flow of patients with oral cenesthopathy. Antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, electroconvulsive therapy, and psychotherapy might be effective in some cases, though it is known to be intractable. To date, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, classification and treatment of oral cenesthopathy are unknown due to the few reports on the disorder, though there are a few case reports. To overcome this difficult medical condition, clinico-statistical and case-control studies done under rigorous criteria and with a large sample size are required."}, {"Title": "Brain Ways: Meynert, Bachelard and the Material Imagination of the Inner Life.", "Abstract": "The Austrian psychiatrist Theodor Meynert's anatomical theories of the brain and nerves are laden with metaphorical imagery, ranging from the colonies of empire to the tentacles of jellyfish. This paper analyses among Meynert's earliest works a different set of less obvious metaphors, namely, the fibres, threads, branches and paths used to elaborate the brain's interior. I argue that these metaphors of material, or what the philosopher Gaston Bachelard called 'material images', helped Meynert not only to imaginatively extend the tracts of fibrous tissue inside the brain but to insinuate their function as pathways co-extensive with the mind. Above all, with reference to Bachelard's study of the material imagination, I argue that Meynert helped entrench the historical intuition that the mind, whatever it was, consisted of some interiority - one which came to be increasingly articulated through the fibrous confines of the brain."}, {"Title": "Pharmacokinetic Pharmacogenetic Prescribing Guidelines for Antidepressants: A Template for Psychiatric Precision Medicine.", "Abstract": "Antidepressants are commonly prescribed medications in the United States, and there is increasing interest in individualizing treatment selection for more than 20 US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for major depressive disorder.

In this case the strategy of continuation of stimulation and adding antipsychotic drug (quetiapine) was chosen.\nGradual resolution of psychotic symptoms, without worsening of neurological symptoms and no recurrence of psychiatric symptoms was observed.\nIn recent years, work is underway on the use of DBS in psychiatry, particularly in patients with treatment-resistant depression. It is necessary to set the strategy for dealing with side-effects of DBS. Most of the authors prefer the temporary or permanent switch off the stimulator. In the author's opinion, in some cases it is possible to effectively treat the psychotic symptoms without resignation from the benefits of stimulation. So far, however, such cases were described so rarely that it is difficult on this basis to formulate conclusions that can be applied to the whole population of patients treated with DBS.

Almost 100% of the population uses text messaging worldwide and this technology is being suggested as a promising tool in psychiatry. Text messages can be sent either from a classic mobile phone or a web-based application. Reviews are needed to better understand how text messaging can be used in mental health care and other fields of medicine.\nThe objective of the study was to review the literature regarding the use of mobile phone text messaging in mental health care.\nWe conducted a thorough literature review of studies involving text messaging in health care management. Searches included PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases on May 25, 2015. Studies reporting the use of text messaging as a tool in managing patients with mental health disorders were included. Given the heterogeneity of studies, this review was summarized using a descriptive approach.\nFrom 677 initial citations, 36 studies were included in the review. Text messaging was used in a wide range of mental health situations, notably substance abuse (31%), schizophrenia (22%), and affective disorders (17%). We identified four ways in which text messages were used: reminders (14%), information (17%), supportive messages (42%), and self-monitoring procedures (42%). Applications were sometimes combined.\nWe report growing interest in text messaging since 2006. Text messages have been proposed as a health care tool in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders including substance abuse, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and suicide prevention. Most papers described pilot studies, while some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also reported. Overall, a positive attitude toward text messages was reported. RCTs reported improved treatment adherence and symptom surveillance. Other positive points included an increase in appointment attendance and in satisfaction with management and health care services.

So far, focus has primarily been on identifying and changing internal (intramural) factors when seeking to reduce coercion.\nTo identify possible external (extramural) factors that may increase the risk of coercion during admission to a closed psychiatric ward.\nUsing a retrospective case-controlled design, 235 patients admitted to a closed ward during 2011-2013 were randomly selected. Coercion comprised belt restraint, physical restraint, and forced medication. The data source was the electronic patient records, which include statutory information on all forced measures. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to calculate the risk (odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval)) of forced measures being used.\nOut of the 235 patients, 66 (28%) were subject to coercion. The time of forced procedures was predominately during the first hours after admission. The risk of forced measures being applied was significantly higher if patients were involuntarily admitted (OR\u2009=\u20096.4 (3.4-11.9)), or were acutely intoxicated by substances at the time of admission (OR\u2009=\u20093.7 (1.7-8.2)).\nExtramural factors should be included when mental health authorities plan efforts to reduce coercion during admission to psychiatric wards.

Evidence-based medicine (EbM) and HbM are thus not mutually exclusive opposites; rather, despite superficial differences in methods of diagnosis and treatment, EbM must be integrated into HbM as an indispensable component of the latter. Probably the most important difference between EbM and HbM lies in the aims and methods of treatment. In HbM the goal is no longer simply to make illnesses disappear but rather to allow the patient to return to a life that is as autonomous and happy as possible. The human being with all his or her potential and limitations once again becomes the measure of all things. This also implies, however, that the multidimensional diagnostics of HbM are oriented not only towards symptoms, pathogenesis, process and understanding but also to a greater degree towards the patient's resources.

Their contributions reflect the influence of Otto Binswanger, professor of psychiatry in Jena, a representative of the \"psychological direction\" in psychiatry which in the beginning was relatively receptive to Freud. The paper discusses their rapprochement to, and detachment from, the Freudian school, including also the work of a third young physician: Ludwig Binswanger, Otto's nephew, who was active in Jena at the same time. It points to certain factors contributing to the increasing rejection Freud met in academic circles which have been underrated to date: (1) the transformation of psychoanalysis into an art of interpretation; (2) the introduction of transference. Both factors which were elaborated by Freud as essentials of his theoretical and practical approach around 1900 and published in 1904/05, undermined the claim of academic medicine to objectivity.

The recommendation for the integration of spirituality in the approach to psychiatric practice highlights the importance to further think about this practice.\nTo contribute to the debate on the role of spirituality in psychiatry by considering the opinions of two prominent thinkers in this field, the theologian Tillich, and the psychoanalyst Symington.\nThe approach of Tillich and Symington to mental health problems are compared. Narcissism is focussed on, since Symington describes narcissism as the core of all pathology and states that the prime aim of psychoanalysis is the transformation of narcissism. The contributions of Kohut and Kernberg are also briefly discussed.\nIn Symington's opinion more than psychoanalysis is needed to help those in the grip of narcissism. Tillich emphasises the difference between existential anxiety and anxiety due to psychopathology. Psychotherapy can only heal the latter. Yet he also states that we are incapable of change without self-acceptance. For this a larger experience of acceptance or grace is needed, since we are incapable of offering ourselves this type of acceptance.\nIn the struggle to get a grip on narcissism, good nurturing experiences, transformative selfobjects, a confrontation with the darker sides of the self and the message of ultimate acceptance are needed.

For this purpose, the cognitive part of the Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT), focusing on neuro- and social cognition, was compared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with treatment as usual (TAU). 48 outpatients took part in the study. IPT groups received 20 biweekly 1-h-therapy sessions. A test-battery was assessed at baseline, after therapy, and at a 3-month follow-up. Regarding cognitive functioning, significant effects favouring IPT were found in working memory and social perception during therapy and at follow-up. No effects could be found in verbal memory and vigilance. Significant effects favoring IPT were found in negative symptoms, in insight and in general symptoms during therapy and at follow-up using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). No effects were evident in positive symptoms and in psychosocial functioning. Significant effects favoring TAU were found in the quality of life assessment at follow-up.

It is available to any research group for its relative simplicity and low cost and is a useful tool for assessing prefrontal-dependent functions. Older teenagers pose peculiarities in the prefrontal maturation, and we aim to establish HEG patterns that might have clinical applicability.\nThe HEG patterns of 70 university students (56 women and 14 men, 21-48 years old, mean 31.84, SD 10.65, standard error of mean 0.31) were compared with those of 59 adolescents - 13-14-year-old secondary education students, 28 females and 31 males. The HEG patterns were obtained in response to the observation of shocking, unpleasant, and pleasant pictures. We use one-way and two-way analysis of variance to disentangle the differences between groups. All effects were analyzed with F-tests.\nIn all cases, university students and adolescents showed a decrease in prefrontal activity, indicative of differences in the emotional inner networks between groups, which are responsible for security-insecurity processing. Compared with university students, adolescents showed statistically significant differences in decreased activity in very unpleasant (shocking) tests that demand increased security-insecurity processing. Adolescents showed lower decrease. In addition, adolescents, compared with university subjects, did not show statistically significantly decreased HEG activity compared with the baseline in very unpleasant tests.\nTeens showed distinguishable patterns of HEG, which were consistent with the cognitive emotional dysregulation in cognition and emotion interaction, that is, exterior network versus internal network interactions. Disability in regulation (modulation) of emotional response to negative emotional stimuli (fear of insecurity) in adolescence is an indicator of possible future clinical and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety with high incidence of onset at this critical age and frequent comorbidity in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.

New treatments must show not only an improvement on neuropsychological tests but also in co-primary measures of cognition. The cognitive assessment interview (CAI) is an interview-based measure of cognition which assesses the impact of cognitive deficits in patients' daily lives. Information obtained from patients and their relatives is integrated into a rater composite score. This study examines the validity of the CAI (adapted to Spanish, CAI-Sp) as a screening instrument for cognitive impairment, compared to an objective test of cognitive functioning. The psychometric properties of the CAI-Sp and its association with clinical dimensions are also explored. Eighty-one patients with a psychotic disorder and 38 healthy controls were assessed using the CAI-Sp and the screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry (SCIP-S). Patients also underwent a clinical assessment. Poorer cognitive functioning as assessed with the CAI-Sp was associated to illness severity, specifically positive, negative and disorganised syndromes. Binary logistic regression showed that the CAI-Sp was able to detect cognitive impairment in patients, when considering CAI-Sp patient and informant information and CAI-Sp rater scores. The CAI-Sp was found to be a valid and reliable scale to assess cognitive functioning in the context of its impact on daily living. Given its ease and speed of application, the CAI-Sp could prove useful in clinical practice, though not a substitute of objective cognitive testing."}, {"Title": "[Guideline-adherent inpatient psychiatric psychotherapeutic treatment of borderline personality disorder : Normative definition of personnel requirements].", "Abstract": "Borderline personality disorders (BPD) are severe mental diseases which place high pressure on the psychiatric healthcare system.

For in vitro experiments, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were exposed to citalopram along with/without various agents. To do in vivo studies liver function enzyme assays and histological examination were performed. In the in vitro experiments, citalopram (500\u00a0\u00b5M) exposure demonstrated cell death, a marked elevation in ROS formation, mitochondrial potential collapse, lysosomal membrane leakiness, glutathione (GSH) depletion and lipid peroxidation. In vivo biochemistry panel assays for liver enzymes function (AST, ALT and GGTP) and histological examination confirmed citalopram (20\u00a0mg/kg)-induced damage. citalopram-induced oxidative stress cytotoxicity markers were significantly prevented by antioxidants, ROS scavengers, MPT pore sealing agents, endocytosis inhibitors, ATP generators and CYP inhibitors. Either enzyme induction or GSH depletion were concomitant with augmented citalopram-induced damage both in vivo and in vitro which were considerably ameliorated with antioxidants and CYP inhibitors.

Repeated Sleep Deprivation (SD) provides a model treatment to reverse-translate antidepressant effects from in vivo clinical psychiatry to model organisms. We studied the effects of repeated SD alone (ASD) or combined with exercise on a slow spinning wheel (SSW), in 116 C57BL/6J male mice divided in three groups (ASD, SSW, untreated). Forced Swimming Test (FST) was used to detect antidepressant-like effects. Unbiased evaluation of the transcriptional responses were obtained in the hippocampus by Illumina Bead Chip Array system, then confirmed with real time PCR. Spine densities in granular neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) were assayed by standard Golgi staining. Activation of Microglial/Macrophages cells was evaluated by immunufluorescence analysis for Iba1. Rates of cell proliferation was estimated pulsing mice with the S-phase tracer 5-Iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU). All SD procedures caused a decreasing of floating time at FST, and increased expression of the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1. In addition, SSW also increased expression of the Microglia/Macrophages genes Iba-1 and chemokine receptors Cx3cR1 and CxcR4, of the canonical Wnt signaling gene Wnt7a, and of dendritic spines in CA4 neurons of the DG. SSW up-regulated both the number of Iba1+ cells and rates of cell proliferation in the subgranular region of the DG. The antidepressant-like effects of SD dissociated both, from hippocampal neuroplasticity in the DG (not occurring after ASD), and from microglial activation (not preventing behavioral response when occurring). The increase in dendritic spine density in the DG after SD and exercise was associated with an up-regulation of Wnt 7a, and with activation of the innate immune system of the brain. Increased Arc/Arg3.1 suggests however increased neuroplasticity, which could be common to all fast-acting antidepressants, and possibly occurring in other brain areas."}, {"Title": "Understanding the burnout experience: recent research and its implications for psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The experience of burnout has been the focus of much research during the past few decades.

In the late 19th century Italy opened inpatient services first for mentally ill prisoners and then for offenders found not guilty by reason of insanity. Within the past decade, a series of decrees has resulted in transferring the responsibility for treating NGRI acquittees and \"dangerous\" mentally ill prisoners from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health, and their treatment from Italy's high security forensic psychiatric hospitals (OPGs) to community regional facilities (REMSs, Residences for the Execution of Security Measures), community mental health facilities, one of which is located in each region of Italy. Today community REMSs provide the treatment and management of socially dangerous offenders. The dynamic evolution of Italy's progressive mental health system for insanity acquittees, to our knowledge the most libertarian, community oriented approach of any country, is retraced.

As such, the overall aim of this study was to examine ethno-racial variations in recovery perspectives. Specific objectives consist of comparing and contrasting ethno-racial variations in 1) definitions of recovery, 2) barriers to recovery, and 3) facilitators of recovery.\nWe recruited people with severe mental illness from 2 broad ethno-racial groups (Caribbean-Canadian and Euro-Canadian) to partake in a qualitative interview on recovery (n = 47). Participants were asked to give their own definitions of recovery, as well as self-perceived barriers and facilitators. Interview transcripts were then subjected to thematic analysis. We compared and contrasted the distribution and salience of emerging themes between the Euro-Canadian and Caribbean-Canadian participants.\nRecovery was consistently defined as a gradual process involving progress in key life domains including employment, social engagement, and community participation by both groups. This was underpinned by a growing future orientation. Stigma, financial strain, and psychiatric hospitalization were considered major barriers to recovery in both groups. Participants from both groups generally considered stated definitions of recovery to be simultaneous facilitators of recovery-employment and social engagement being the most frequently mentioned. God and religion were key facilitators for the Caribbean-Canadian group but not for Euro-Canadians.\nDefinitions, barriers, and facilitators to recovery were generally shared among our sample, regardless of ethno-racial status, with the exception of God and religion."}, {"Title": "Computational Tracking of Mental Health in Youth: Latin American Contributions to a Low-Cost and Effective Solution for Early Psychiatric Diagnosis.", "Abstract": "The early onset of mental disorders can lead to serious cognitive damage, and timely interventions are needed in order to prevent them. In patients of low socioeconomic status, as is common in Latin America, it can be hard to identify children at risk. Here, we briefly introduce the problem by reviewing the scarce epidemiological data from Latin America regarding the onset of mental disorders, and discussing the difficulties associated with early diagnosis. Then we present computational psychiatry, a new field to which we and other Latin American researchers have contributed methods particularly relevant for the quantitative investigation of psychopathologies manifested during childhood. We focus on new technologies that help to identify mental disease and provide prodromal evaluation, so as to promote early differential diagnosis and intervention. To conclude, we discuss the application of these methods to clinical and educational practice. A comprehensive and quantitative characterization of verbal behavior in children, from hospitals and laboratories to homes and schools, may lead to more effective pedagogical and medical intervention."}, {"Title": "Using Evolutionary Theory to Guide Mental Health Research.", "Abstract": "Evolutionary approaches to medicine can shed light on the origins and etiology of disease. Such an approach may be especially useful in psychiatry, which frequently addresses conditions with heterogeneous presentation and unknown causes. We review several previous applications of evolutionary theory that highlight the ways in which psychiatric conditions may persist despite and because of natural selection. One lesson from the evolutionary approach is that some conditions currently classified as disorders (because they cause distress and impairment) may actually be caused by functioning adaptations operating \"normally\" (as designed by natural selection). Such conditions suggest an alternative illness model that may generate alternative intervention strategies. Thus, the evolutionary approach suggests that psychiatry should sometimes think differently about distress and impairment. The complexity of the human brain, including normal functioning and potential for dysfunctions, has developed over evolutionary time and has been shaped by natural selection. Understanding the evolutionary origins of psychiatric conditions is therefore a crucial component to a complete understanding of etiology."}, {"Title": "Career Interests of Canadian Psychiatry Residents: What Makes Residents Choose a Research Career?", "Abstract": "Training future clinician-researchers remains a challenge faced by Canadian psychiatry departments. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of residents interested in pursuing research and other career options as part of their practice, and to identify the factors associated with interest in research.\nData from a national online survey of 207 Canadian psychiatry residents from a total of 853 (24.3% response rate) were examined. The main outcome was interest in research as part of residents' future psychiatrist practice. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify demographic and vocational variables associated with research interest.\nInterest in research decreases by 76% between the first and fifth year of psychiatry residency (OR 0.76 per year, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97). Training in a department with a residency research track did not correlate with increased research interest (\u03c72 = 0.007, df = 1, P = 0.93).\nExposing and engaging psychiatry residents in research as early as possible in residency training appears key to promoting future research interest.

Various parameters were evaluated, such as duration of treatment, PEPP coding, loss of income by merging cases and case remuneration. Additionally, changes in the duration of treatment, the intensity of treatment and the intensity of care were simulated.\nIn the simulations a reduction in the duration of treatment by 16.1\u2009% led to additional revenues of 1.9\u2009% per treatment day. The calculated additional costs of 1:1 care and intensive nursing care were not completely covered by the additional revenues, whereas psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment programs showed positive profit contributions. Complicated cases with increased merging of cases showed lower revenues but with above average expenditure of efforts.\nThe current version of the PEPP leads to misdirected incentives in patient care. This is caused, for example, by the fact that higher profit contributions can be realized in some patient groups and intensive nursing care of patients is insufficiently represented. It is not clear whether these incentives will persist or can be compensated in subsequent versions of the system."}, {"Title": "A Qualitative Study of Factors Affecting Morale in Psychiatry Residency Training.", "Abstract": "Resident morale is an important yet poorly understood aspect of the residency training experience. Despite implications for program quality, resident satisfaction, patient care, and recruitment, little is known about the variables influencing this complex phenomenon. This study sought to identify important factors affecting morale in psychiatry residency training.\nThe authors conducted four semi-structured focus groups at a moderately sized, urban, psychiatry residency program during the 2013-2014 academic year. They used qualitative data analysis techniques, including grounded theory and content analysis, to identify key themes affecting resident morale across training levels.\nTwenty-seven residents participated in the focus groups with equal distribution across post-graduate years (PGY) 1-4. Five major conceptual categories affecting resident morale emerged: Sense of Community, Individual Motivators, Clinical Work, Feeling Cared For, and Trust in the Administration.\nMorale is an important topic in residency education. The qualitative results suggest that factors related to a Sense of Community and Individual Motivators generally enhanced resident morale whereas factors related to a lack of Feeling Cared For and Trust in the Administration tended to contribute to lower morale. The authors describe the possible interventions to promote stronger program morale suggested by these findings."}, {"Title": "Psychosocial predictors of treatment outcome for trauma-affected refugees.", "Abstract": "The effects of treatment in trials with trauma-affected refugees vary considerably not only between studies but also between patients within a single study. However, we know little about why some patients benefit more from treatment, as few studies have analysed predictors of treatment outcome.\nThe objective of the study was to examine possible psychosocial predictors of treatment outcome for trauma-affected refugees.\nThe participants were 195 adult refugees with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who were enrolled in a 6- to 7-month treatment programme at the Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP), Denmark. The CTP Predictor Index used in the study included 15 different possible outcome predictors concerning the patients' past, chronicity of mental health problems, pain, treatment motivation, prerequisites for engaging in psychotherapy, and social situation. The primary outcome measure was PTSD symptoms measured on the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). Other outcome measures included the Hopkins Symptom Check List-25, the WHO-5 Well-being Index, Sheehan Disability Scale, Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales, the somatisation scale of the Symptoms Checklist-90, Global Assessment of Functioning scales, and pain rated on visual analogue scales. The relations between treatment outcomes and the total score as well as subscores of the CTP Predictor Index were analysed.\nOverall, the total score of the CTP Predictor Index was significantly correlated to pre- to post treatment score changes on the majority of the ratings mentioned above. While employment status was the only single item significantly correlated to HTQ-score changes, a number of single items from the CTP Predictor Index correlated significantly with changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, but the size of the correlation coefficients were modest.\nThe total score of the CTP Predictor Index correlated significantly with outcomes on most of the rating scales, but correlations were modest in size, possibly due to the number of different factors influencing treatment outcome."}, {"Title": "Anthology of Venezuelan psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Reception of Psychiatry in Venezuela since the 19th Century to the late 20th Century merits a historical approach.

Multiple linear regression models were used for analysis.\nBiological attribution was positively associated with perceived family collaboration, and so was environmental attribution with perceived informational support. Internalized stigma was negatively associated with perceived family collaboration. Caregiving rewards were positively related to both perceived family collaboration and informational support, and so was experience of problems with services to perceived family collaboration.\nThe examination of family perceptions informs Western psychiatric care providers of the importance of culturally sensitive practices in developing an effective working relationship with family caregivers, particularly in regards to caregivers' casual attributions, impact of stigma, and caregiving experiences."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric Patients Tracking Through a Private Social Network for Relatives: Development and Pilot Study.", "Abstract": "The treatment of psychiatric patients requires different health care from that of patients from other medical specialties. In particular, in the case of Department of Psychiatry from the Zamora Hospital (Spain), the period of time which patients require institutionalized care is a tiny part of their treatment. A large part of health care provided to the patient is aimed at his/her rehabilitation and social integration through day-care centres, supervised flats or activities. Conversely, several reports reveal that approximately 50\u00a0% of Internet users use the network as a source of health information, which has led to the emergence of virtual communities where patients, relatives or health professionals share their knowledge concerning an illness, health problem or specific health condition. In this context, we have identified that the relatives have a lack of information regarding the daily activities of patients under psychiatric treatment. The social networks or the virtual communities regarding health problems do not provide a private space where relatives can follow the patient's progress, despite being in different places. The goal of the study was to use technologies to develop a private social network for being used by severe mental patients (mainly schizophrenic patients). SocialNet is a pioneer social network in the health sector because it provides a social interaction context restricted to persons authorized by the patient or his/her legal guardian in such a way that they can track his/her daily activity. Each patient has a private area only accessible to authorized persons and their caregivers, where they can share pictures, videos or texts regarding his/her progress. A preliminary study of usability of the system has been made for increasing the usefulness and usability of SocialNet. SocialNet is the first system for promoting personal interactions among formal caregivers, family, close friends and patient, promoting the recovery of schizophrenic patients. Future studies should study the network's potential usefulness for improving the prognosis and recovery of schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Acute hospital dementia care: results from a national audit.", "Abstract": "Admission to an acute hospital can be distressing and disorientating for a person with dementia, and is associated with decline in cognitive and functional ability.

Although prior reviews have attributed this state of affairs to diagnostic heterogeneity, symptom comorbidity and phenotypic complexity, little attention has been paid to the implications of intra-individual symptom dynamics and inter-relatedness for biomarker study designs. In this critical review, we consider the impact of short-term symptom fluctuations on widely used study designs that regress the 'average level' of a given symptom against biological data collected at a single time point, and summarize findings from ambulatory assessment studies suggesting that such designs may be sub-optimal to detect symptom-substrate relationships. Although such designs have a crucial role in advancing our understanding of biological substrates related to more stable, longer-term changes (for example, gray matter thinning during a depressive episode), they may be less optimal for the detection of symptoms that exhibit high frequency fluctuations, are susceptible to common reporting biases, or may be heavily influenced by the presence of other symptoms. We propose that a greater emphasis on intra-individual symptom chronometry may be useful for identifying subgroups of patients with common, proximal pathological indicators. Taken together, these three recent developments in the areas of symptom conceptualization and measurement raise important considerations for future studies attempting to identify reliable biomarkers in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Nursing management of sensory overload in psychiatry \u2013 development of a theoretical framework model].", "Abstract": "Background: The concept of \u201cremoval from stimuli\u201d has already been examined by a Delphi-Study.

We used two waves of data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES), an ongoing population-based, prospective cohort study in Japan. A unique feature of our study was the availability of information about mental health status pre-dating the disaster. Our sample comprised community-dwelling survivors aged 65 and older, who responded to surveys in 2010 (i.e. one year before the disaster) and in 2013 (n\u00a0=\u00a03464). We categorized disaster exposure according to three types of experiences: loss of family/friends, property damage, and disruption in access to medical service. Our main outcome was change in depressive symptoms, measured by the 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS). Among the participants, 917 (26.5%) reported losing a family member to the disaster, while a further 537 (15.5%) reported losing a friend. More than half of the participants reported some damage to their homes. After adjusting for demographics and baseline mental health, people whose homes were completely destroyed had significantly elevated depressive symptom scores three years later (+1.22 points, 95%CI: 0.80, 1.64, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The APA's concern is to safeguard the public perception of psychiatry as a scientific and credible profession. The ethic is that diagnostic terminology and theory should not be used for speculative or ad hominem attacks that promote the interests of the individual physician or for political and ideological causes. However, the Goldwater Rule presents conflicting problems. These include the right to speak one's conscience regarding concerns about the psychological stability of high office holders and competing considerations regarding one's role as a private citizen versus that as a professional figure. Furthermore, the APA's proscription on diagnosis without formal interview can be questioned, since third-party payers, expert witnesses in law cases, and historical psychobiographers make diagnoses without conducting formal interviews. Some third-party assessments are reckless, but do not negate legitimate reasons for providing thoughtful education to the public and voicing psychiatric concerns as acts of conscience. We conclude that the Goldwater Rule was an excessive organizational response to what was clearly an inflammatory and embarrassing moment for American psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Perceived Discrimination, Social Support, and Quality of Life in Gender Dysphoria.", "Abstract": "Transgender individuals experience discrimination in all domains of their personal and social life.

Demographic, social, and medical transition features were collected with standardized forms.\nSelf-report measurements of QoL (Turkish version of the World Health Organization's Quality of Life-BREF) that included physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains, perceived discrimination with personal and group subscales (Perceived Discrimination Scale [PDS]), and social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) were completed.\nNinety-four participants (76.6% trans men) adequately completed the study measurements. Regression models with each QoL domain score as a dependent variable indicated a significant predictor value of personal PDS in social and environmental QoL. Social support from family was associated with better QoL in psychological QoL, whereas perceived support from friends significantly predicted all other domains of QoL. There was a tendency for group PDS to be rated higher than personal PDS, suggesting personal vs group discrimination discrepancy. However, group PDS was not found to be a predictor of QoL in the multivariate model.\nPerceived personal discrimination and social support from different sources predicted domains of QoL with a non-uniform pattern in individuals with GD. Social support and discrimination were found to have\u00a0opposing contributions to QoL in GD. The present findings emphasize the necessity of addressing discrimination and social support in clinical work with GD.

These practices involve taking up the cause of the oppressed in ways that respect them as agents of their own liberation. In this article, I describe what I term 'solidarity practice' with young people and their families as a counter force resisting the increasingly blaming and individualising discourse of mainstream psychology, psychiatry and social policy."}, {"Title": "Supports for medical students during rural clinical placements: factors associated with intention to practise in rural locations.", "Abstract": "Through rural clinical schools (RCSs), medical students may undertake an extended block of clinical training in rural Australia. The premise of these placements is that meaningful rural exposure will facilitate rural career uptake. RCSs offer a range of supports to facilitate student engagement in the program. This study aims to analyse RCS students' perceptions of these supports and impact on intentions to work rurally.\nBetween September 2012 and January 2013 RCS students were invited to complete questions regarding perceptions of student support, as a part of the annual Federation of Australian Medical Educators survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associations between supports and intentions for rural internship or career.\nThere were 454 participants. A majority of students (n=349, 79.1%) felt well supported by their RCS. Students from a rural background (odds ratio (OR)=1.64 (95% confidence interval (CI):1.13-2.38)), or who indicated that their placement had a positive impact on their wellbeing (OR=1.38 (95%CI:1.07-1.80)), were more likely to intend to complete a rural internship. Those who felt socially isolated were less likely to elect this (OR=0.82 (0.70-0.97)). Outcomes were similar for those indicating a preference for rural or remote practice after completing training.\nStudent perceptions of supports offered by RCSs were generally very positive. Perceptions of financial support were not predictive of rural career intent. Although this does not negate the importance of providing appropriate financial supports, it does demonstrate that student wellbeing is a more important recruitment factor for rural practice."}, {"Title": "Commentary on \"The Cerebellar System and What it Signifies from a Biological Perspective: A Communication by Christofredo Jakob (1866-1956) Before the Society of Neurology and Psychiatry of Buenos Aires, December 1938\".", "Abstract": "This commentary highlights a \"cerebellar classic\" by a pioneer of neurobiology, Christfried Jakob. Jakob discussed the connectivity between the cerebellum and mesencephalic, diencephalic, and telencephalic structures in an evolutionary, developmental, and histophysiological perspective. He proposed three evolutionary morphofunctional stages, the archicerebellar, paleocerebellar, and neocerebellar; he attributed the reduced cerebellospinal connections in humans, compared to other primates, to the perfection of the rubrolenticular and thalamocortical systems and the intense ascending pathways to the red nucleus in exchange for the more elementary descending efferent pathways. Jakob hypothesized the convergence of cerebellar pathways in associative cortical regions, insisting on the intimate collaboration of the cerebellum with the frontal lobe. The extensive lines of communication between regions throughout the association cortex substantiate Jakob's intuition and begin to outline the mechanisms for substantial cerebellar involvement in functions beyond the purely motor domain. Atop a foundation of anatomical and phylogenetic mastery, Jakob conceived ideas that were noteworthy, timely, and have much relevance to our current thinking on cerebellar structure and function."}, {"Title": "The Cerebellar System and What it Signifies from a Biological Perspective, by Professor Christofredo Jakob (English Translation).", "Abstract": "The paper is an English translation of Christofredo Jakob's 1938 lecture on cerebellar neurobiology, rendered from the original Spanish text.

The proportion of the Chinese population suffering from mental disorder has grown in parallel with the rapid economic development, as social stresses have increased. The aim of this study is to shed light on the status of collaborations in the Chinese psychiatry field, of which there is currently limited research.\nWe sampled 16,224 publications (2003-2012) from 10 core psychiatry journals from Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang Database. We used various social network analysis (SNA) methods such as centrality analysis, and Core-Periphery analysis to study collaboration. We also used hierarchical clustering analysis in this study.\nFrom 2003-2012, there were increasing collaborations at the level of authors, institutions and regions in the Chinese psychiatry field. Geographically, these collaborations were distributed unevenly. The 100 most prolific authors and institutions and 32 regions were used to construct the collaboration map, from which we detected the core author, institution and region. Collaborative behavior was affected by economic development.\nWe should encourage collaborative behavior in the Chinese psychiatry field, as this facilitates knowledge distribution, resource sharing and information acquisition. Collaboration has also helped the field narrow its current research focus, providing further evidence to inform policymakers to fund research in order to tackle the increase in mental disorder facing modern China."}, {"Title": "Migration and psychosis in acute inpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "We investigated the role of biological and psychosocial risk factors in the development of psychotic disorders with regards to immigrant status. Our hypothesis was that biological risk factors are more predictive of psychosis in non-immigrants, whereas psychosocial risk factors play a bigger role in immigrants.\nA retrospective audit of admissions between December 2013 and June 2014 in an Australian adult inpatient unit was conducted, focussing on patients with psychotic disorders. We analysed the association between immigrant status, and biological and psychosocial variables.\nFor biological risk factors, non-immigrants had significantly more family history of psychotic disorders (p = 0.021), illicit drug use (p = < 0.001) and alcohol use (p = < 0.001). For psychosocial risk factors, immigrants were more likely to have experienced a traumatic event (p = 0.022). With regards to age of index presentation, age at onset of psychotic disorder, proportion of males and dysfunctional family background, there was no significant difference.\nRetrospective data in this report suggests that the development of psychotic disorders in immigrants and non-immigrants may be different."}, {"Title": "Highlights lecture EANM 2015: the search for nuclear medicine's superheroes.", "Abstract": "The EANM 2015 Annual Congress, held from October 10th to 14th in Hamburg, Germany, was outstanding in many respects. With 5550 participants, this was by far the largest European congress concerning nuclear medicine. More than 1750 scientific presentations were submitted, with more than 250 abstracts from young scientists, indicating that the future success of our discipline is fuelled by a high number of young individuals becoming involved in a multitude of scientific activities. Significant improvements have been made in molecular imaging of cancer, particularly in prostate cancer. PSMA-directed PET/CT appears to become a new gold standard for staging and restaging purposes. Novel tumour specific compounds have shown their potential for target identification also in other solid neoplasms and further our understanding of tumour biology and heterogeneity. In addition, a variety of nuclear imaging techniques guiding surgical interventions have been introduced. A particular focus of the congress was put on targeted, radionuclide based therapies. Novel theranostic concepts addressing also tumour entities with high incidence rates such as prostate cancer, melanoma, and lymphoma, have shown effective anti-tumour activity. Strategies have been presented to improve further already established therapeutic regimens such as somatostatin receptor based radio receptor therapy for treating advanced neuroendocrine tumours. Significant contributions were presented also in the neurosciences track. An increasing number of target structures of high interest in neurology and psychiatry are now available for PET and SPECT imaging, facilitating specific imaging of different subtypes of dementia and movement disorders as well as neuroinflammation. Major contributions in the cardiovascular track focused on further optimization of cardiac perfusion imaging by reducing radiation exposure, reducing scanning time, and improving motion correction. Besides coronary artery disease, many contributions focused on cardiac inflammation, cardiac sarcoidosis, and specific imaging of large vessel vasculitis. The physics and instrumentation track included many highlights such as novel, high resolution scanners. The most noteworthy news and developments of this meeting were summarized in the highlights lecture. Only 55 scientific contributions were mentioned, and hence they represent only a brief summary, which is outlined in this article.

Since then, efforts have been made to produce effective medications with few side effects (SEs) or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Newer psychotropics have been developed but are not without risk. ADRs and SEs can lead to medication noncompliance, morbidity, and mortality. In many cases, ADRs can be prevented and common SEs relieved through proper interventions. Nursing interventions are vital to improving patient safety and outcomes in mental health populations.

Further, we argued that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine provided a good model for this process. Subsequently, we validated the model in patients with psychosis, relating aberrant prediction error signals to delusion severity. During the ensuing period, we have developed these ideas, drawing on the simple principle that brains build a model of the world and refine it by minimising prediction errors, as well as using it to guide perceptual inferences. While previously we focused on the prediction error signal per se, an updated view takes into account its precision, as well as the precision of prior expectations. With this expanded perspective, we see several possible routes to psychotic symptoms - which may explain the heterogeneity of psychotic illness, as well as the fact that other drugs, with different pharmacological actions, can produce psychotomimetic effects. In this article, we review the basic principles of this model and highlight specific ways in which prediction errors can be perturbed, in particular considering the reliability and uncertainty of predictions. The expanded model explains hallucinations as perturbations of the uncertainty mediated balance between expectation and prediction error. Here, expectations dominate and create perceptions by suppressing or ignoring actual inputs. Negative symptoms may arise due to poor reliability of predictions in service of action. By mapping from biology to belief and perception, the account proffers new explanations of psychosis. However, challenges remain. We attempt to address some of these concerns and suggest future directions, incorporating other symptoms into the model, building towards better understanding of psychosis."}, {"Title": "Headache meets neurology and psychiatry: a framework for diagnosis.", "Abstract": "This is a case of a very rare progressive disorder which presented with unusual neurological symptoms.

Research on associations between previous or current self-harm and different types of inpatient aggression is missing.\nThe aim of this register study was to investigate the prevalence of self-harm and the type of inpatient aggression among female forensic psychiatric inpatients, and to study whether the patients' self-harm before and/or during forensic psychiatric care is a risk factor for inpatient aggression.\nFemale forensic psychiatric patients (n\u2009=\u2009130) from a high security hospital were included.\nThe results showed that 88% of the female patients had self-harmed at least once during their life and 57% had been physically and/or verbally aggressive towards staff or other patients while in care at the hospital. Self-harm before admission to the current forensic psychiatric care or repeated self-harm were not significantly associated with inpatient aggression, whereas self-harm during care was significantly associated with physical and verbal aggression directed at staff.\nThese results pointed towards self-harm being a dynamic risk factor rather than a historical risk factor for inpatient aggression among female forensic psychiatric patients. Whether self-harm is an individual risk factor or a part of the clinical risk factor 'Symptom of major mental illness' within the HCR-20V3 must be further explored among women. Thus, addressing self-harm committed by female patients during forensic psychiatric care seems to be important in risk assessments and the management of violence, especially in reducing violence against staff in high-security forensic psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Does the brain listen to the gut?", "Abstract": "Transplanting gut bacteria from one mouse strain to another can override genetics and change behavior."}, {"Title": "Seven steps towards a PhD in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The present review aims to describe the main steps for completing a psychiatric PhD thesis with success.\nA selective review of the literature and the author's experience as a psychiatrist completing a PhD.\nDeciding upon a topic, choosing a mentor, organising your time, persevering and remaining motivated are the key elements.\nPreparedness and diligence lead the way towards a PhD.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between dose, serum concentration, and clinical outcome as well as the influencing factors thereof in paediatric patients treated with clozapine. Data from a routine Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) service between 2004 and 2014 were studied in 68 patients, aged 11-18\u00a0years. Severity of illness, therapeutic effectiveness and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were assessed by standardized means. A relationship between the daily dose (mean 319\u00a0mg, 4.9\u00a0mg/kg) and serum concentration (mean 387\u00a0ng/ml) of clozapine was found with the variation in dose explaining 30\u00a0% of the variability in clozapine serum concentrations. Also gender contributed to the variability, however, no influence of age or concomitant medications was detected. Furthermore, a significant association was found between clozapine serum concentration and the occurrence of ADRs. Patients without ADRs had a lower mean serum concentration than those with mild (261.4 vs 407.3\u00a0ng/ml, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and moderate ADRs (261.4 vs 416.3\u00a0ng/ml, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). As clozapine was estimated to be effective in lower blood concentrations, guidance on a possibly lower therapeutic range of clozapine serum levels in paediatric patients is provided. With ADRs increasing under higher concentrations, TDM is strongly recommended in paediatric clozapine therapy for individualized dosing. Dose adjustment in females also might be reasonable according to gender-related differences in serum concentrations. However, regarding the limitations of this study results should be validated in larger studies with more standardized designs."}, {"Title": "Development of the C4 inventory: a measure of common characteristics that complicate care in outpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric syndromes are complicated by comorbidity and other factors that burden patients, making guideline-informed psychiatric care challenging, and negatively affecting outcome. A comprehensive intake tool could improve the quality of care. Existing tools to quantify these characteristics do not identify specific complications and may not be sensitive to phenomena that are common in psychiatric outpatients.\nTo develop a practical inventory to capture observations related to complex care in psychiatric outpatients and quantify the overall burden of complicating factors.\nWe developed a checklist inventory through literature review and clinical experience. The inventory was tested and compared with related measures in a cross-sectional study of 410 consenting outpatients at the time of initial assessment.\nThe summed score of inventory checklist items was significantly correlated with patient-assessed measures of distress (K10, <i>r</i>=0.36) and function (WHODAS 2.0, <i>r</i>=0.31), and physician-assessed measures of function (GAF, <i>r</i>=-0.42), number of psychiatric diagnoses [<i>F</i>(df3)=33.6], and most complex diagnosis [<i>F</i>(df3)=37.4]. In 53 patients whose assessment was observed by two clinicians, inter-rater reliability was acceptable for both total inventory score (intraclass correlation, single measures = 0.74) and agreement on specific items (mean agreement score = 90%).\nThe Psychiatric C4 Inventory is a reliable instrument for psychiatrists that captures information that may be useful for quality improvement and resource planning. It demonstrates convergent validity with measures of patient distress, function, and complexity.

Automatic computational methods offer the possibility to analyse social signals and behaviours of several partners simultaneously and dynamically. Here, 20 dyads of mothers and their 13-36-month-old infants were videotaped during mother-infant interaction including 10 extremely high-risk and 10 low-risk dyads using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) sensors. From 2D+3D data and 3D space reconstruction, we extracted individual parameters (quantity of movement and motion activity ratio for each partner) and dyadic parameters related to the dynamics of partners heads distance (contribution to heads distance), to the focus of mutual engagement (percentage of time spent face to face or oriented to the task) and to the dynamics of motion activity (synchrony ratio, overlap ratio, pause ratio). Features are compared with blind global rating of the interaction using the coding interactive behavior (CIB). We found that individual and dyadic parameters of 2D+3D motion features perfectly correlates with rated CIB maternal and dyadic composite scores. Support Vector Machine classification using all 2D-3D motion features classified 100% of the dyads in their group meaning that motion behaviours are sufficient to distinguish high-risk from low-risk dyads. The proposed method may present a promising, low-cost methodology that can uniquely use artificial technology to detect meaningful features of human interactions and may have several implications for studying dyadic behaviours in psychiatry. Combining both global rating scales and computerized methods may enable a continuum of time scale from a summary of entire interactions to second-by-second dynamics."}, {"Title": "Standardization and adult norms for the sequential subtracting tasks of serial 3's and 7's.", "Abstract": "The Serial 3's and 7's subtraction tasks are traditionally used in mental status examinations. The usefulness of these tasks is based upon the assumption that they measure attention and mental concentration. However, there is no uniform method of administration, and there are no recognized norms for these subtraction tasks, which has led some in the field of psychiatry and neuropsychology to conclude that the tests are not useful. The purpose of this research had three goals: (a) to create a standardization of the administration, (b) to provide a structured and consistent framework for the data evaluation, and (c) to create adult norms as a frame of reference for interpretation. The study investigated normal control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0204) and specific variables of interest included both efficiency and accuracy of performance. The results demonstrated that when used conjointly, Serial 3's and Serial 7's are an efficient and accurate measure of sequential subtracting, but even more importantly, the study revealed the hierarchical increase in cognitive demand when the performances between 3's and 7's were compared. With standardization and norms, serial subtraction becomes a more effective screening technique within the context of a mental status examination. Similarly, the conjoint administration of these tasks yields synergistic data that can be useful in determining deficits in the cognitive domains of attention and working memory."}, {"Title": "Diagnostic pitfalls in a young Romanian ranger with an acute psychotic episode.", "Abstract": "The identification and distinction of the pathological conditions underlying acute psychosis are often challenging. We present the case of a 35-year-old ranger who had no history of acute or chronic infectious disease or any previous neuropsychiatric symptoms. He arrived at the Psychiatry Clinic and was admitted as an emergency case, displaying bizarre behavior, hallucinations, paranoid ideation, and delusional faults. These symptoms had first appeared 7 days earlier. An objective examination revealed abnormalities of behavior, anxiety, visual hallucinations, choreiform, and tic-like facial movements. After the administration of neuroleptic and antidepressant treatment, he showed an initial improvement, but on day 10 entered into a severe catatonic state with signs of meningeal irritation and was transferred to the intensive care unit. An electroencephalogram showed diffuse irritative changes, raising the possibility of encephalitis. Taking into consideration the overt occupational risk, Borrelia antibody tests were prescribed and highly positive immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG titers were obtained from serum, along with IgG and antibody index positivity in cerebrospinal fluid. In parallel, anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies and a whole battery of other autoimmune encephalitis markers showed negative. A complex program of treatment was applied, including antibiotics, beginning with ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin - for suspected aspiration bronchopneumonia - and thereafter with ceftriaxone. A gradual improvement was noticed and the treatment continued at the Infectious Disease Clinic. Finally, the patient was discharged with a doxycycline, antidepressant, and anxiolytic maintenance treatment. On his first and second control (days 44 and 122 from the disease onset), the patient was stable with no major complaints, Borrelia seropositivity was confirmed both for IgM and IgG while the cerebrospinal fluid also showed reactivity for IgG on immunoblot.

Key factors that are associated with disability and these disorders in young people are social and economic participation (e.g. education, employment), physical health, suicide and self-harm behaviours, and alcohol and substance use. A better understanding of the objective markers (i.e. neurobiological parameters) associated with these factors is important for the development of effective early interventions that reduce the impact of disability and illness persistence.\nWe systematically reviewed the literature for neurobiological parameters (i.e. neuropsychology, neuroimaging, sleep-wake and circadian biology, neurophysiology and metabolic measures) associated with functional domains in young people (12 to 30 years) with mood and/or anxiety disorders.\nOf the one hundred and thirty-four studies selected, 7.6\u00a0% investigated social and economic participation, 2.1\u00a0% physical health, 15.3\u00a0% suicide and self-harm behaviours, 6.9\u00a0% alcohol and substance use, whereas the majority (68.1\u00a0%) focussed on clinical syndrome.\nDespite the predominance of studies that solely examine the clinical syndrome of young people the literature also provides evidence of distinct associations among objective measures (indexing various aspects of brain circuitry) and other functional domains.

From this perspective and on the assumption that physical structures affect the therapeutic environment, a prospective longitudinal study was designed to investigate the impact of the facility relocation of three forensic psychiatric hospitals on patients' perceptions of ward atmosphere and quality of received forensic psychiatric care. Participants were patients over 18 years of age sentenced to compulsory forensic psychiatric treatment. Data were obtained by validated questionnaires. Overall, 58 patients (78%) answered the questionnaires at baseline with a total of 25 patients (34%) completing follow-up 1\u00a0at six months and 11 patients (15%) completing follow-up 2, one year after relocation. Approximately two-thirds of the participants at all time-points were men and their age range varied from 18 to 69. The results of this study showed that poor physical environment features can have a severe impact on care quality and can reduce the possibilities for person-centered care. Furthermore, the study provides evidence that the patients' perceptions of person-centered care in forensic psychiatric clinics are highly susceptible to factors in the physical and psychosocial environment.

The pathological aggression is described as a non-homogeneous phenomenon, it is variable in according to social, psychological and biological agents. The distinction of violence between affective aggression and predatory aggression can be functional to the prediction of outcome of any treatment. In general, a pattern of predatory violence tend to match with patients unresponsive and not compliant to treatment, a low probability to predict future violence and, therefore, a difficulty in managing risk. The affective aggressor, however, shows increased probability of treatment response, with more predictability of violent actions in reaction to situations perceived as threatening and, therefore, greater management of future violence risk. Those who act affective violence tend to show a wide range of emotional and cognitive problems, while those who act with predatory patterns show greater inclination to aggression and antisocial behavior. Aggression that occurs in psychiatry mostly appears to be affective, therefore susceptible to modulation through treatments."}, {"Title": "Validity of symptom reports of asylum seekers in a psychiatric hospital: A descriptive study.", "Abstract": "Our study involved three samples (N=85; N=38, and N=27) of asylum seekers in a Dutch psychiatric hospital. We looked at how often they reported severe dissociative episodes (i.e., not recognizing oneself in a mirror; seeing traumatic images in a mirror) and whether these symptoms were related to deviant performance on Symptom Validity Tests (SVTs), notably items from the Structured Inventory of Malingered Symptomatology (SIMS; Widows & Smith, 2005) and a forced-choice task modeled after the Morel Emotional Numbing Test (MENT; Morel, 1998). We also examined whether poor language proficiency and the presence of incentives to exaggerate symptoms might affect scores on SVTs. Dissociative target symptoms were reported by considerable percentages of patients (27-63%). Patients who reported these symptoms had significantly more often deviant scores on SVT items compared with those who did not report such symptoms. With a few exceptions, deviant scores on SVT items were associated with incentives rather than poor language skills. We conclude that the validity of self-reported symptoms in this target group should not be taken for granted and that SVTs may yield important information."}, {"Title": "Neuroscience in forensic psychiatry: From responsibility to dangerousness. Ethical and legal implications of using neuroscience for dangerousness assessments.", "Abstract": "Neuroscientific evidence is increasingly being used in criminal trials as part of psychiatric testimony. Up to now, \"neurolaw\" literature remained focused on the use of neuroscience for assessments of criminal responsibility. However, in the field of forensic psychiatry, responsibility assessments are progressively being weakened, whereas dangerousness and risk assessment gain increasing importance. In this paper, we argue that the introduction of neuroscientific data by forensic experts in criminal trials will be mostly be used in the future as a means to evaluate or as an indication of an offender's dangerousness, rather than their responsibility. Judges confronted with the pressure to ensure public security may tend to interpret neuroscientific knowledge and data as an objective and reliable way of evaluating one's risk of reoffending. First, we aim to show how the current socio-legal context has reshaped the task of the forensic psychiatrist, with dangerousness assessments prevailing. In the second part, we examine from a critical point of view the promise of neuroscience to serve a better criminal justice system by offering new tools for risk assessment. Then we aim to explain why neuroscientific evidence is likely to be used as evidence of dangerousness of the defendants. On a theoretical level, the current tendency in criminal policies to focus on prognostics of dangerousness seems to be \"justified\" by a utilitarian approach to punishment, supposedly revealed by new neuroscientific discoveries that challenge the notions of free will and responsibility. Although often promoted as progressive and humane, we believe that this approach could lead to an instrumentalization of neuroscience in the interest of public safety and give rise to interventions which could entail ethical caveats and run counter to the interests of the offenders. The last part of this paper deals with some of these issues-the danger of stigmatization for brain damaged offenders because of adopting a purely therapeutic approach to crime, and the impact on their sentencing, in particular."}, {"Title": "Traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine approaches to mental health care and psychological wellbeing in India and China.", "Abstract": "India and China face the same challenge of having too few trained psychiatric personnel to manage effectively the substantial burden of mental illness within their population. At the same time, both countries have many practitioners of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine who are a potential resource for delivery of mental health care. In our paper, part of The Lancet and Lancet Psychiatry's Series about the China-India Mental Health Alliance, we describe and compare types of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine in India and China. Further, we provide a systematic overview of evidence assessing the effectiveness of these alternative approaches for mental illness and discuss challenges in research. We suggest how practitioners of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine and mental health professionals might forge collaborative relationships to provide more accessible, affordable, and acceptable mental health care in India and China. A substantial proportion of individuals with mental illness use traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine, either exclusively or with biomedicine, for reasons ranging from faith and cultural congruence to accessibility, cost, and belief that these approaches are safe. Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine find several approaches to be promising for treatment of mental illness, but most clinical trials included in these systematic reviews have methodological limitations. Contemporary methods to establish efficacy and safety-typically through randomised controlled trials-need to be complemented by other means. The community of practice built on collaborative relationships between practitioners of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine and providers of mental health care holds promise in bridging the treatment gap in mental health care in India and China."}, {"Title": "The burden of mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in China and India: a systematic analysis of community representative epidemiological studies.", "Abstract": "China and India jointly account for 38% of the world population, so understanding the burden attributed to mental, neurological, and substance use disorders within these two countries is essential. As part of the Lancet/Lancet Psychiatry China-India Mental Health Alliance Series, we aim to provide estimates of the burden of mental, neurological, and substance use disorders for China and India from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013).\nIn this systematic analysis for community representative epidemiological studies, we conducted systematic reviews in line with PRISMA guidelines for community representative epidemiological studies. We extracted estimates of prevalence, incidence, remission and duration, and mortality along with associated uncertainty intervals from GBD 2013. Using these data as primary inputs, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression instrument, used a log rate and incidence-prevalence-mortality mathematical model to develop internally consistent epidemiological models. Disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) changes between 1990 and 2013 were decomposed to quantify change attributable to population growth and ageing. We projected DALYs from 2013 to 2025 for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders using United Nations population data.\nAround a third of global DALYs attributable to mental, neurological, and substance use disorders were found in China and India (66 million DALYs), a number greater than all developed countries combined (50 million DALYs). Disease burden profiles differed; India showed similarities with other developing countries (around 50% of DALYs attributable to non-communicable disease), whereas China more closely resembled developed countries (around 80% of DALYs attributable to non-communicable disease). The overall population growth in India explains a greater proportion of the increase in mental, neurological, and substance use disorder burden from 1990 to 2013 (44%) than in China (20%). The burden of mental, neurological, and substance use disorders is estimated to increase by 10% in China and 23% in India between 2013 and 2025.\nThe current and projected burden of mental, neurological, and substance use disorders in China and India warrants the urgent prioritisation of programmes focused on targeted prevention, early identification, and effective treatment.\nChina Medical Board, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation."}, {"Title": "Rauwolfia vomitoria inhibits olfaction and modifies olfactory bulb cells.", "Abstract": "The rising cost of orthodox medication has endeared so many to the use of herbs for the management of neurological conditions. Rauwolfia vomitoria (RV) one of such herbs is a rainforest shrub whose parts are used locally in the management of psychiatry and other medical issues. Its usefulness though not in doubt is wrapped with adverse reports as its active constituents depletes brain monoamine and dopamine stores. This motivated this research on the effects of the root bark extract on olfaction and the olfactory bulb of adult Wistar rats. Eighteen adult Wistar rats (220g average) were divided into three groups (n=6); control (placebo), 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg RV root bark extract, respectively. The oral administration lasted for seven days and on day 8, test of olfaction was carried out and the animals immediately anaesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (i.p.) and perfuse-fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin. All the brains were processed for histology and immunoreactivity. Results showed loss of body weights and olfaction in the 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg RV groups. There was hypertrophy and atrophy of mitral cells respectively, in the 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg RV groups, while there was hyperplasia of cells in the internal granular and plexiform layers of both groups. There was decreased neuron specific enolase (NSE) and neurofilament (NF) expression in the 200mg/kg RV group, while NF and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was decreased in the 400mg/kg RV group. However, NSE expression was enhanced in the 400mg/kg group, while GFAP expression was enhanced in the 200mg/kg RV group. These results suggest that these doses of RV affect olfaction and appetite, and stimulate adverse cellular changes in the olfactory bulb."}, {"Title": "An exploratory clinical study of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children and adolescents from India.", "Abstract": "Children with chronic non-episodic irritability were frequently diagnosed as suffering from pediatric bipolar disorder.

Of 21 members of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry interviewed, 6 report fulltime engagement in professional activity, 10 partial reduction, and 5 full retirement from practice. Through direct quotations from the respondents' interviews several matters are considered including the concept of retirement, structural changes in practice, health concerns, dream experience, spirituality and matters of legacy, how others have influenced attitudes toward continued work, and how fears of retirement are manifest among those currently in practice. Among the conclusions is the suggestion that the sense of self-regard and personal satisfaction of those who do retire is far greater than anticipated by those still in active practice."}, {"Title": "Combining Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and Pharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "Many patients with depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric disorders are treated with combinations of psychodynamic psychotherapy and medication. Whether this is better than monotherapy is an empirical question that requires much more extensive research than is currently available. When medications were first introduced to treat psychiatric illnesses, some psychopharmacologists insisted that it heralded a new area of \"biological psychiatry\" that would ultimately render psychotherapy obsolete. Psychodynamic theorists and practitioners, on the other hand, argued that psychopharmacology offered only a superficial approach to treatment. Fortunately, these battles are now largely supplanted by the belief that whatever treatment offers the patient the best outcome should be employed, regardless of the therapist's theoretical outlook. This should motivate more extensive study of the value of combination treatment. So far, the few studies that have been done suggest that the combination of psychodynamic psychotherapy and medication may be superior for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, but most of these studies have small sample sizes and involve only short-term psychotherapy. An examination of the neuroscience of mood and anxiety disorders and of the mechanism of action of psychodynamic psychotherapy and of antidepressant medication suggests several routes by which the two treatment modalities could be synergistic: stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis; epigenetic regulation of gene expression; dendritic remodeling; enhanced prefrontal cortical control of limbic system activity; and action at specific neurohormonal and neurotransmitter targets. The evidence for each of these mechanisms is reviewed with an eye toward potential experiments that might be relevant to them."}, {"Title": "Neurocomputational Nosology: Malfunctions of Models and Mechanisms.", "Abstract": "Executive dysfunctions, psychopathologies arising from problems in the control and regulation of behavior, can occur as a result of the faulty execution of formal information processing models or as a result of malfunctioning neural mechanisms. The models correspond to the formal descriptions of how signals in the environment must be transformed in order to behave adaptively, and the mechanisms correspond to the signal transformations that nervous systems implement in order to execute those cognitive functions. Mechanisms in the form of repeated patterns of neural dynamics execute information processing models. Two distinct modes of malfunction can occur when neural dynamics execute models of information processing. The processing models describing behavior may fail to be executed correctly by neural mechanisms. Or, the neural mechanisms may malfunction, failing to implement the right computation. As an example of malfunctioning models in executive cognition, purported failures of rule following can be understood as failures to appropriately execute a suite of processing models. As an example of malfunctioning mechanisms of executive cognition, maladaptive behavior resulting from dysfunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can be understood as failures in the signal transformations carried out therein. The purpose of these examples is to illustrate the potential benefits of considering models and mechanisms in the diagnosis and etiology of neuropsychological illness and dysfunction, especially disorders of executive cognition."}, {"Title": "Is there Progress? An Overview of Selecting Biomarker Candidates for Major Depressive Disorder.", "Abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) contributes to a significant worldwide disease burden, expected to be second only to heart disease by 2050. However, accurate diagnosis has been a historical weakness in clinical psychiatry. As a result, there is a demand for diagnostic modalities with greater objectivity that could improve on current psychiatric practice that relies mainly on self-reporting of symptoms and clinical interviews. Over the past two decades, literature on a growing number of putative biomarkers for MDD increasingly suggests that MDD patients have significantly different biological profiles compared to healthy controls. However, difficulty in elucidating their exact relationships within depression pathology renders individual markers inconsistent diagnostic tools. Consequently, further biomarker research could potentially improve our understanding of MDD pathophysiology as well as aid in interpreting response to treatment, narrow differential diagnoses, and help refine current MDD criteria. Representative of this, multiplex assays using multiple sources of biomarkers are reported to be more accurate options in comparison to individual markers that exhibit lower specificity and sensitivity, and are more prone to confounding factors. In the future, more sophisticated multiplex assays may hold promise for use in screening and diagnosing depression and determining clinical severity as an advance over relying solely on current subjective diagnostic criteria. A pervasive limitation in existing research is heterogeneity inherent in MDD studies, which impacts the validity of biomarker data. Additionally, small sample sizes of most studies limit statistical power. Yet, as the RDoC project evolves to decrease these limitations, and stronger studies with more generalizable data are developed, significant advances in the next decade are expected to yield important information in the development of MDD biomarkers for use in clinical settings."}, {"Title": "How can mental health and faith-based practitioners work together? A case study of collaborative mental health in Gujarat, India.", "Abstract": "Despite the knowledge that people with mental illness often seek care from multiple healing systems, there is limited collaboration between these systems. Greater collaboration with existing community resources could narrow the treatment gap and reduce fragmentation by encouraging more integrated care. This paper explores the origins, use, and outcomes of a collaborative programme between faith-based and allopathic mental health practitioners in India. We conducted 16 interviews with key stakeholders and examined demographic and clinical characteristics of the user population. Consistent with previous research, we found that collaboration is challenging and requires trust, rapport-building, and open dialogue. The collaboration reached a sizeable population, was reviewed favourably by key stakeholders-particularly on health improvement and livelihood restoration-and perhaps most importantly, views the client holistically, allowing for both belief systems to play a shared role in care and recovery. Results support the idea that, despite differing practices, collaboration between faith-based and allopathic mental health practitioners can be achieved and can benefit clients with otherwise limited access to mental health care."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of the Psychometric Properties of the Mental Vulnerability Questionnaire in Undergraduate Students.", "Abstract": "Translate, adapt the language, and assess the psychometric properties of the Mental Vulnerability Questionnaire (MVQ) in a Portuguese population sample of young adults.\nA psychometric validation study was performed.

She presented with a painful ulcer on her right lower abdomen. She also presented with multiple scars, skin grafts on the extremities, and a missing left lower leg, the causes for all of which were unexplained. The results of her blood test were normal, except for the hemoglobin level. Histology of the skin biopsy specimen from the ulcer did not show any specific findings. The previous surgeon who had performed the laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that surgical wound dehiscence had occurred during her admission. After a body restraint had been applied, the ulcer improved. Medical records indicated that she had been admitted to the department of plastic surgery at our hospital for skin grafting of a leg ulcer. During that admission, she refused to consult with the department of psychiatry, al-though the staff suspected mental disorders. Therefore, we diagnosed her with cutaneous Munchausen syndrome. After vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy had been performed to prevent her from traumatizing the ulcer again, it rapidly became granulated and reepithelialized.

Kurt Schneider was then a junior psychiatrist and Max Scheler a renowned philosophy professor and co-founder of the phenomenological movement in philosophy. We uncover the facts about their intellectual and personal relationship, summarize the main articles and books that they wrote and consider whether Max Scheler did influence the young Kurt Schneider. We conclude that Scheler's philosophy of emotion impressed Schneider, and that the latter's notion of 'vital depression' as the core element in melancholia was essentially applied Schelerian philosophy. Schneider's more celebrated contributions to psychiatry - his notion of first rank symptoms of schizophrenia - owed nothing to Scheler or any other philosopher."}, {"Title": "Prohibited or regulated?

However, during the 1960s, research began to decline, before coming to a complete halt in the mid-1970s. This has commonly been explained through the increase in prohibitive federal regulations during the 1960s that aimed to curb the growing recreational use of the drug. However, closely examining the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of LSD research in the 1960s will reveal that not only was LSD research never prohibited, but that the administration supported research to a greater degree than has been recognized.

As such, motivation is a complex process that is critical for survival, which involves multiple behavioural functions mediated by a number of interacting neural circuits. Classical theories of motivation suggest that there are both directional and activational aspects of motivation, and activational aspects (i.e. speed and vigour of both the instigation and persistence of behaviour) are critical for enabling organisms to overcome work-related obstacles or constraints that separate them from significant stimuli. The present review discusses the role of brain dopamine and related circuits in behavioural activation, exertion of effort in instrumental behaviour, and effort-related decision-making, based upon both animal and human studies. Impairments in behavioural activation and effort-related aspects of motivation are associated with psychiatric symptoms such as anergia, fatigue, lassitude and psychomotor retardation, which cross multiple pathologies, including depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this review also attempts to provide an interdisciplinary approach that integrates findings from basic behavioural neuroscience, behavioural economics, clinical neuropsychology, psychiatry, and neurology, to provide a coherent framework for future research and theory in this critical field. Although dopamine systems are a critical part of the brain circuitry regulating behavioural activation, exertion of effort, and effort-related decision-making, mesolimbic dopamine is only one part of a distributed circuitry that includes multiple neurotransmitters and brain areas. Overall, there is a striking similarity between the brain areas involved in behavioural activation and effort-related processes in rodents and in humans. Animal models of effort-related decision-making are highly translatable to humans, and an emerging body of evidence indicates that alterations in effort-based decision-making are evident in several psychiatric and neurological disorders. People with major depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease show evidence of decision-making biases towards a lower exertion of effort. Translational studies linking research with animal models, human volunteers, and clinical populations are greatly expanding our knowledge about the neural basis of effort-related motivational dysfunction, and it is hoped that this research will ultimately lead to improved treatment for motivational and psychomotor symptoms in psychiatry and neurology."}, {"Title": "Videoconferencing and telementoring about dementia care: evaluation of a pilot model for sharing scarce old age psychiatry resources.", "Abstract": "While videoconferencing, telementoring, and peer support have been shown to enhance services in some instances, there has been no research investigating the use of these technologies in supporting professionals managing clients with dementia. The objective of this research was to evaluate expansion of an old age psychiatry consultation service and pilot test a model to improve medical supervision and clinical governance for staff within regional and remote areas using remote information technology.\nThe design was a mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) evaluation using before, mid-point and post-implementation semi-structured interviews and questionnaires to examine orientation, acceptance, and impact underpinned by theoretical approaches to evaluation. Education evaluations used a Likert style response template. Participants were 18 dementia service staff, including staff from linked services and old age psychiatrists. Qualitative interviews addressed the pilot implementation including: expectations, experiences, strategies for improving the pilot, and perceived impact on work practice and professional development opportunities.\nThere was high satisfaction with the program. The case conference process contributed to perceived improved outcomes for clients, family, and staff. Clinicians perceived improvement in family carer and staff carer stress and their confidence in managing clients with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Thematic analysis indicated that the pilot enhanced professional development, decreased travel time, and improved team cohesion.\nGiven the increasing aging population in regional, rural, and remote areas, initiatives using videoconferencing and telementoring will help to develop a confident and skilled workforce.

A Qualitative Study of Physicians' Practice.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric genetic counseling (PGC) is an emerging specialty discipline within the genetic counseling profession. A specialist PGC service was founded in 2012 in Vancouver, Canada, and though patient benefits have been demonstrated, many physicians do not regularly refer patients to the service despite awareness of its availability. We conducted a qualitative study involving semi-structured telephone interviews with Vancouver-based physicians who were aware of the PGC service to explore this phenomenon. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analysed for emergent themes. Consistent with a grounded theory approach, constant comparison was employed throughout data collection and analysis. Analyses of interviews conducted with 12 physicians revealed that referral practices were informed by perceptions about the purpose of PGC and interpretation of patient cues. Physicians perceived PGC as an information-focused intervention, and considered referral when patients explicitly expressed desire for information about recurrence risk or etiology that they felt unable to adequately address themselves. Even when physicians identified psychotherapeutic benefits of PGC, patient needs of this nature were not perceived as cues prompting referral to PGC. These data suggest that further work is necessary to position PGC in physicians' minds as a service that could potentially benefit most individuals with psychiatric disorders and their families, and that it encompasses more than information provision. It is important to increase physicians' awareness of the complementary role that genetic counselors can play to that of the physician in providing psychotherapeutically oriented counselling about illness etiology."}, {"Title": "Effect of trauma onset on personality traits of politically persecuted victims.", "Abstract": "The hypothesis that traumatic experiences in early childhood impact personality formation and psychopathology is well known in psychology and psychiatry, but this is difficult to verify statistically in methodological terms. The aim of this study, conducted with politically persecuted Poles, was to establish the influence of the time when trauma is experienced on the development of psychopathological symptoms.\nThe subjects were divided into two groups: those who had experienced trauma before age five (group 1) and those who experienced trauma at an older age (group 2). Subjects in both groups suffered from chronic untreated post-traumatic stress disorder. In order to test the research hypothesis, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 profiles of both groups were compared using Student's t-test, and the Mann-Whitney U-test.\nStatistically significant between-group differences were found for the F validity scale and the following clinical scales: Hypochondriasis, Depression, Psychopathic deviate, Psychasthenia, Schizophrenia, and Social introversion. All the significantly different scores were higher in the group traumatized in early childhood. People exposed to trauma under age five had profiles similar to those traumatized after age five, but they experienced their symptoms more intensely.\nOf clinical significance, higher scores on the psychasthenia, schizophrenia, and social introversion scales, especially on the psychopathic deviate scale, indicated pathology only in the early childhood trauma group. Taken together, these symptoms lead to withdrawal and hindrance of social functioning. This outcome confirms the hypothesis of the influence of various early childhood factors (such as trauma) on personality formation and personality traits in adulthood."}, {"Title": "Combined Effects of Acamprosate and Escitalopram on Ethanol Consumption in Mice.", "Abstract": "Major depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatry comorbidities of alcohol use disorders (AUD). As negative emotions can trigger craving and increase the risk of relapse, treatments that target both conditions simultaneously may augment treatment success. Previous studies showed a potential synergistic effect of Food and Drug Administration approved medication for AUD acamprosate and the antidepressant escitalopram. In this study, we investigated the effects of combining acamprosate and escitalopram on ethanol (EtOH) consumption in stress-induced depressed mice.\nForty singly housed C57BL/6J male mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress. In parallel, 40 group-housed male mice were subjected to normal husbandry. After 3\u00a0weeks, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and EtOH consumption were assessed. For the next 7\u00a0days, mice were injected with saline, acamprosate (200\u00a0mg/kg; twice/d), escitalopram (5\u00a0mg/kg; twice/d), or their combination (n\u00a0=\u00a09 to 11/drug group/stress group). Two-bottle choice limited-access drinking of 15% EtOH and tap water was performed 3\u00a0hours into dark phase immediately after the daily dark phase injection. EtOH drinking was monitored for another 7\u00a0days without drug administration.\nMice subjected to the chronic unpredictable stress paradigm for 3\u00a0weeks showed apparent depression- and anxiety-like behaviors compared to their nonstressed counterparts including longer immobility time in the forced swim test and lower sucrose preference. Stressed mice also displayed higher EtOH consumption and preference in a 2-bottle choice drinking test. During the drug administration period, the escitalopram-only and combined drug groups showed significant reduction in EtOH consumption in nonstressed mice, while only the combined drug group showed significantly reduced consumption in stressed mice. However, such reduction did not persist into the postdrug administration period.\nThe combination of acamprosate and escitalopram suppressed EtOH intake in both nonstressed and stressed mice; hence, this combination is potentially helpful for AUD individuals with or without comorbid depression to reduce alcohol use."}, {"Title": "Challenges of regulatory rights of half-capacitated persons: A sociological perspective on the French Civil Code reform.", "Abstract": "Democratic societies are based on the principle of equal legal capacity of all citizens to decide and act for themselves in all areas of social life. This \"socio-civil capacity\", which may involve both material property of an individual, as well as private life in matters ranging from health to personal relationships, is recognized by the law (both codified law and common law). These rights guarantee the autonomy and freedom of individuals in the name of respect for human dignity. Civil capacity of a person is legally diminished because his or her \"natural\" abilities, capacity, or competence are reduced. Recent social changes have lead to increased uses of legal measures of protection. The reasons for these changes are complex and they are accompanied by legislative reforms that modify the rights of half-capacitated persons. In this article, we examine certain issues of civil capacity rights based on the French example. We start present a perspective of the historical definition and practice of these rights as well as their democratization."}, {"Title": "St George Acute Care Team: the local variant of crisis resolution model of care.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe functioning and clinical activities of the St George Acute Care Team and how it compares to the typical crisis resolution model of care.\nDescriptive data including demographics, sources of referral, type of clinical intervention, length of stay, diagnoses and outcomes were collected from records of all patients who were discharged from the team during a 10 week period.\nThere were 677 referrals. The team's functions consisted of post-discharge follow-up (31%), triage and intake (30%), case management support (23%) and acute community based assessment and treatment (16%).

Laws that have regulated sexual behaviour have referred to terms such as 'sexual deviation', 'sexual perversion' or even archaic moral terms such as 'unnatural acts and unspeakable crimes against nature'. A possible link between sexual perversion, psychopathy, and criminality, specifically manifesting in sexual homicide, has been the subject of remarkable research in forensic psychiatry. This contribution examines the phenomenon of paraphilia with specific reference to its definition, diagnostic classification and characteristics, as well as a few selections of incidences of paraphilia in South African criminal case law. A brief assessment is made of how South African criminal courts have dealt with paraphilia. In this regard, an analysis is made of the criminal liability of the paraphiliac. The South African response to sexual deviation as addressed in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007 will also be addressed with reference to its efficacy in addressing paraphilia within South African criminal law. The interface between criminal law and medical ethics within the context of this theme will also be canvassed.

When choosing the cases of pedophilic actions, incest incidents were excluded and 307 incidents were taken into assessment.\nThe male subjects are 97.4%, 39.7% of them are 19-29years old, 10% of them are over age 60, 59% of the subjects are single, 36.5% of them are unemployed, 71.7% of the incidents have no physical disorder. The subjects who were imprisoned before were 20.2% and 22.1% of them had undergone psychiatric treatment before the incident. Twenty separate diagnosis are determined by the FMI for the subjects. There were mental retardation, schizophrenia and various personality disorders on the top the diagnosis list. The paraphilia type of the incidents are pedophilia (60.3%), exhibitionism (8.1%), pedophilia and exhibitionism (7.5%) and fetishism (5.9%).

The study consecutively assessed a sample of 1364 psychiatric inpatients. Socio-demographic and clinical data including use of PR were collected from the medical records using a form designed for this study and confirmed via interview. Psychopathology and insight were measured using standardized instruments. The percentage of PR was 27.2% in the whole sample with 30.7% and 22.4% occurring respectively before and after the NMHL implementation (p=0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis PR was positively associated with unemployment, lower income, aggression in the past month, being admitted before the NMHL implementation and poorer insight. The percentage of PR in Chinese psychiatric patients is associated with various clinical factors and appeared to decrease after the implementation of the NMHL. Focused and individualized care for patients who are unemployed, have low income, recent aggression and poor insight would be necessary at early stages of admission."}, {"Title": "Strengthening leadership as a catalyst for enhanced patient safety culture: a repeated cross-sectional experimental study.", "Abstract": "Current literature emphasises that clinical leaders are in a position to enable a culture of safety, and that the safety culture is a performance mediator with the potential to influence patient outcomes. This paper aims to investigate staff's perceptions of patient safety culture in a Danish psychiatric department before and after a leadership intervention.\nA repeated cross-sectional experimental study by design was applied. In 2 surveys, healthcare staff were asked about their perceptions of the patient safety culture using the 7 patient safety culture dimensions in the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. To broaden knowledge and strengthen leadership skills, a multicomponent programme consisting of academic input, exercises, reflections and discussions, networking, and action learning was implemented among the clinical area level leaders.\nIn total, 358 and 325 staff members participated before and after the intervention, respectively. 19 of the staff members were clinical area level leaders. In both surveys, the response rate was >75%. The proportion of frontline staff with positive attitudes improved by \u22655% for 5 of the 7 patient safety culture dimensions over time. 6 patient safety culture dimensions became more positive (increase in mean) (p<0.05). Frontline staff became more positive on all dimensions except stress recognition (p<0.05). For the leaders, the opposite was the case (p<0.05). Staff leaving the department after the first measurement had rated job satisfaction lower than the staff staying on (p<0.05).\nThe improvements documented in the patient safety culture are remarkable, and imply that strengthening the leadership can act as a significant catalyst for patient safety culture improvement. Further studies using a longitudinal study design are recommended to investigate the mechanism behind leadership's influence on patient safety culture, sustainability of improvements over time, and the association of change in the patient safety culture measures with change in psychiatric patient safety outcomes."}, {"Title": "Using the Script Concordance Test to Evaluate Clinical Reasoning Skills in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Although clinical reasoning is a major component of psychiatric training, most evaluating tools do not assess this skill properly. Clinicians mobilize networks of organized knowledge (scripts) to assess ambiguous or uncertain situations. The Script Concordance Test (SCT) was developed to assess clinical reasoning in an uncertainty context. The objective of this study was to test the usefulness of the SCT to assess the reasoning capacities of interns (7th year medical students) during the psychiatry training.\nThe authors designed a SCT for psychiatry teaching, adapted to interns. The test contained 20 vignettes of five questions each. A reference panel of senior psychiatrists underwent the test, and we used their scoring as a reference for the student group. The SCT assessed the competence of students at the beginning and the end of their training in psychiatry.\nA panel of 10 psychiatrists and 47 interns participated to this study. As expected, the reference panel performed significantly (p<0.001) better (79.4\u00b15.1) than the students on the SCT. Interns improved significantly (p<0.001) their scores between the beginning (58.5\u00b16.2) and the end (65.0\u00b15.3) of their psychiatry rotation. The students improved significantly (p<0.001) their scores between the beginning and the end of the training (6.4\u00b14.8).\nThis is the first study using the SCT in psychiatry. This study shows the feasibility of this procedure and its utility in the field of psychiatry for evaluating medical students in their clinical reasoning competence.

One method to address this need is via regional conferences, open to current and recently graduated research residents and their mentors. With this in mind, we developed the biennial California Psychiatry Research Resident Retreat (CPRRR) and collected feedback from participants to 1) Assess resident satisfaction, 2) Determine the utility of the retreat as a networking and mentorship tool, and 3) Identify areas for improvement.\nWe gathered survey data from resident attendees at the two first CPRRRs. We analyzed the data to look for trends in satisfaction as well as areas that need improvement.\nThirty-two residents from five California training programs attended the CPRRR in 2013 while 33 attended from six programs in 2015. The residents were from all years of training, but concentrated in their second and third years. Approximately 41% and 49% of the attendees were female and 53% and 39% had an MD/PhD in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Twenty-four and 32 residents provided anonymous feedback in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Mean feedback scores were very high (> 4/5) for overall satisfaction, peer- and faculty-networking, the keynote speaker and the flash talks for both years. Mean feedback scores for the ethics debates and mentoring sessions were somewhat lower (\u2264 4/5), however, both showed significant improvement from 2013 to 2015.\nThe CPRRRs appear to be an effective mechanism for providing psychiatry research residents with a meaningful cross-institutional opportunity for networking and mentorship. Feedback-driven changes to the CPRRRs improved participant satisfaction for several components of the conference. Future efforts will be aimed at broadening mentorship and networking opportunities, optimizing teaching approaches for research ethics, and considering different feedback-gathering approaches to allow for improved longitudinal follow-up and subgroup analysis."}, {"Title": "Isolated amygdala enlargement in temporal lobe epilepsy: A systematic review.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the seizure characteristics and treatment outcomes in patient groups with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) identified with isolated amygdala enlargement (AE) on magnetic resonance imaging studies.\nPubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies using the keywords 'amygdala enlargement', 'epilepsy', and 'seizures' in April 2015. Human studies, written in English, that investigated cohorts of patients with TLE and AE were included.\nOf 204 abstracts initially identified using the search strategy, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria (11 epilepsy studies and 3 psychiatry studies). Ultimately, 8 full studies on AE and TLE involving 107 unique patients were analyzed. Gender distribution consisted of 50 males and 57 females. Right amygdala enlargement was seen in 39 patients, left enlargement in 58 patients, and bilateral enlargement in 7 patients. Surgical resection was performed in 28 patients, with the most common finding being dysplasia/hamartoma or focal cortical dysplasia. Most studies involved small samples of less than 12 patients. There was a wide discrepancy in the methods used to measure amygdala volume, in both patients and controls, hindering comparisons. Most TLE with AE studies observed a later age of seizure onset (mean: 32.2years) compared with studies involving TLE with HS (mean of mid- to late childhood). A higher frequency of complex partial seizures compared with that of convulsive seizures is seen in patients with AE (67-100% vs. 26-47%), and they have an excellent response to antiepileptic drugs (81.8%-100% of seizure-free patients). All studies that included controls also found a significant difference in frequency of seizure types between their cases and controls.\nReliable assessment of amygdala volume remains a critical issue hindering better understanding of the clinical management and research of this focal epilepsy syndrome.

Behavior and quality of life were evaluated by self-administered questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory). Patient groups were contrasted and scale results were correlated with clinical and polysomnographic parameters, and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels.\nYoung patients with NT1 showed increased internalizing problems associated with aggressive behavior. Emotional profile in patients with NT1 positively correlated with age at onset, diagnostic delay, and subjective sleepiness, whereas treatment and disease duration were associated with fewer behavioral problems (attention problems, aggressive behavior, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Psychosocial health domains of pediatric NT1 were worse than in healthy controls, whereas the physical health domains were comparable.\nYoung NT1 patients show a discrete pattern of altered behavioral, thought, and mood profile in comparison with healthy controls and with idiopathic epilepsy patients thus suggesting a direct link with sleepiness. Further studies investigating behavior in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia or type 2 narcolepsy are needed to disentangle the role of REM sleep dysfunction and hypocretin deficiency in psychiatric disorders. Symptoms of withdrawal, depression, somatic complaints, thought problems, and aggressiveness were common, NT1 children perceived lower school competencies than healthy children, and their parents also reported worse psychosocial health.

Given that psychiatric patients are at risk of comorbid substance abuse, we hypothesised that NPS use would be present in the psychiatric population, and sought to determine its prevalence and investigate the characteristics of those who use these drugs with a retrospective review of discharge letters.\nGeneral adult inpatient wards of a psychiatric hospital in a Scottish city.\nAll adult inpatients (18-65) discharged from general psychiatric wards between 1 July 2014 and 31 December 2014. Of the 483 admissions identified, 46 were admissions for maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and were excluded. Of the remaining 437 admissions, 49 discharge letters were unobtainable, leaving 388 admissions to analyse.\nThe mention, or lack thereof, of NPS use in discharge letters was our planned primary outcome measure and was also the primary outcome measure we used in our analysis.\nNPS use was identified in 22.2% of admissions, contributing to psychiatric symptoms in 59.3%. In comparison to non-users, NPS users were younger (p<0.01), male and more likely to have a forensic history ((p<0.001) for both). The diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis was significantly more likely in NPS users (p<0.001, OR 18.7, 95% CI 8.1 to 43.0) and the diagnosis of depression was significantly less likely (p<0.005, OR 0.133, CI 0.031 to 0.558).

In addition to the significant debates surrounding ideal methods to collect and interpret measures of HRV, standardized reporting of methodology in this field is lacking. Commonly cited recommendations were designed well before recent calls to improve research communication and reproducibility across disciplines. In an effort to standardize reporting, we propose the Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability (GRAPH), a checklist with four domains: participant selection, interbeat interval collection, data preparation and HRV calculation. This paper provides an overview of these four domains and why their standardized reporting is necessary to suitably evaluate HRV research in psychiatry and related disciplines.

However, risk factors for early diagnosis have not been studied exclusively in surgical patients. Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety symptoms in surgical patients.\nWe included 392 surgical patients in this prospective cross-sectional study, which took place between June 2011 and June 2012. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to screen for symptoms of depression and anxiety at weekly interviews. Regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for early (the day after admission) and late (one week or more) in-hospital psychiatry symptoms.\nDepression and anxiety symptoms increased from the time of admission toward longer hospital stay. Scores obtained in the second and third weeks of admission were associated with the need for surgery while HADS in the third week was associated with lack of familial support and being under the poverty line (p < 0.050). Regression model analysis showed that early depression was associated with female gender, and early anxiety was inversely affected by female gender and protected by higher education level. A history of mood disorder was a risk factor. Later anxiety was also associated with longer hospital stay.\nDepression and anxiety symptoms are a major concern in surgical patients especially in females and those with a history of mood disorders or lower educational level. Patients with a longer hospital stay, in particular, those with underlying diseases, postoperative complications, lack of familial support, and the need for reoperation were also at increased risk."}, {"Title": "Effects of cortisol on hippocampal subfields volumes and memory performance in healthy control subjects and patients with major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "Overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most consistently replicated biological findings in psychiatry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have consistently demonstrated that hippocampal (HC) volume is decreased in patients with MDD. The improved spatial resolution of high field strength MRI has recently enabled measurements of HC subfield volumes in vivo. The main goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between cortisol concentrations over a day and HC subfield volumes in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls and to investigate whether diurnal cortisol measures are related to memory performance. Fourteen MDD patients with moderate or severe episodes were recruited, together with 14 healthy controls. Imaging was performed using a 4.7T whole-body imaging system. HC subfields and subregions were segmented manually using previously defined protocol. Memory performance was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale IV. The salivary cortisol levels were measured over the course of one day. We found that cortisol awakening response to 8h (CAR-8h) was higher in MDD patients compared to controls and that this increase in CAR-8h in MDD patients correlated negatively with left total Cornu Ammonis (CA)1-3 and left HC head volume. In healthy controls mean cortisol levels were negatively associated with right total CA1-3, right HC head, and right total HC volume. In addition, in healthy controls higher CAR-8h was related to worse performance on the immediate content memory. These results provide the first in vivo evidence of the negative associations between cortisol level, CA1-3 HC subfield volume and memory performance in patients with MDD and healthy controls."}, {"Title": "Magnetoencephalographic recording of auditory mismatch negativity in response to duration and frequency deviants in a single session in patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetoencephalographic (MEG) counterpart (MMNm) are an established biological index in schizophrenia research. MMN in response to duration and frequency deviants may have differential relevance to the pathophysiology and clinical stages of schizophrenia. MEG has advantage in that it almost purely detects MMNm arising from the auditory cortex. However, few previous MEG studies on schizophrenia have simultaneously assessed MMNm in response to duration and frequency deviants or examined the effect of chronicity on the group difference.\nForty-two patients with chronic schizophrenia and 74 matched control subjects participated in the study. Using a whole-head MEG, MMNm in response to duration and frequency deviants of tones was recorded while participants passively listened to an auditory sequence.\nCompared to healthy subjects, patients with schizophrenia exhibited significantly reduced powers of MMNm in response to duration deviant in both hemispheres, whereas MMNm in response to frequency deviant did not differ between the two groups. These results did not change according to the chronicity of the illness.\nThese results, obtained by using a sequence-enabling simultaneous assessment of both types of MMNm, suggest that MEG recording of MMN in response to duration deviant may be a more sensitive biological marker of schizophrenia than MMN in response to frequency deviant. Our findings represent an important first step towards establishment of MMN as a biomarker for schizophrenia in real-world clinical psychiatry settings."}, {"Title": "Maternal versus adolescent reports of suicidal behaviors: a nationwide survey in Israel.", "Abstract": "Community and nationwide surveys on adolescent suicidal behaviors using clinical interviews are not abundant. Rates of self-reported suicide attempts in community samples vary greatly between 1 and 20\u00a0%. In general, adolescent and parental agreement in child psychiatry practice is low, and their agreement with regard to suicidal behavior is unknown. The current study assesses the rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors as well as the rate of agreement between adolescents and their mothers in a representative nationwide sample. The survey included a representative and randomized community sample of 14- to 17-year-old adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a0957), and their mothers who were interviewed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment Inventory (DAWBA). The prevalence of suicidal ideation and self-initiated behaviors was 4.9 and 1.9\u00a0%, respectively. The concordance between mothers' and adolescents' reporting on ideation was low (7.3\u00a0%). There was no concordance between mothers' and adolescents' reports of suicidal acts. Adolescents reported self-initiated behaviors nearly three times more frequently than their mothers. Paternal unemployment, care by welfare agencies and having a psychiatric disorder, specifically depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, was associated with a higher risk for both suicidal ideation and attempts. In this nationwide community study, by evaluating information gathered by clinical interviews, it was found that the lifetime rates of suicidal ideation were moderate. The rates of suicide attempts were lower than have been previously reported. The concordance between the reports of adolescents and their mothers was low for ideation and nonexistent for attempts. Thus, clinicians should interview adolescents separately from their mothers regarding their suicidality."}, {"Title": "Clonidine Use in Psychiatry: Panacea or Panache.", "Abstract": "Clonidine, an alpha agonist, formally prescribed in clinical medicine as antihypertensive medication, is currently being used more frequently to address a multitude of psychiatric entities.

The examination of handwriting was part of an ensemble of diagnostic tools. Although disorders of handwriting seemed to indicate psychic diseases, graphology did not seem the right method to produce valid observations. Nevertheless, psychiatrists began to incorporate the process of writing into research and diagnosis and to make the process of handwriting an experimental field. Emil Kraepelin invented an apparatus - the so-called Writing-Scale - with which he could measure the dynamics of writing in various dimensions and, in particular, the pressure of movements. The experiments produced a huge amount of data, but the psychiatrists were unable to interpret them in a comprehensible way.

Seizures resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with electrical discharges in the brain. Symptoms typically start in early adulthood and women are far more affected than men. Video-EEG is widely considered to be the gold standard for diagnosis. Still psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are often misdiagnosed and treated as epilepsy for years that is burdensome to patients and costly to the healthcare system. Patients having psychogenic nonepileptic seizures show a high prevalence of traumatic life events, therefore, psychosocial factors are thought to play an important role in the etiology. Neurobiological factors may also contribute to the development of seizures as a subgroup of patients are characterized by cognitive impairment and subtle structural and functional brain abnormalities. Treatment includes psychotherapeutic procedures, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy and additional pharmacological interventions.

While migrants' symptoms often bear cultural hallmarks of suffering, they also reveal images of a traumatic history, which resurface in moments of danger, uncertainty, and crisis. I claim these symptoms are allegories of a dispossessed past, and can be interpreted as counter-memories, as \"palimpsests\" of an eclipsed script. Trauma symptoms keep returning to a collective past, and thus can be considered a particular form of historical consciousness. Psychiatric diagnoses may obscure these counter-memories. In particular, the diagnostic category of posttraumatic stress disorder that is commonly attached to traumatic experiences in current clinical practice recognizes the truth of individual traumatic events, but at the same time contributes to concealing the political, racial, and historical roots of suffering."}, {"Title": "Precision psychiatry: a neural circuit taxonomy for depression and anxiety.", "Abstract": "Although there have been tremendous advances in the understanding of human dysfunctions in the brain circuitry for self-reflection, emotion, and cognitive control, a brain-based taxonomy for mental disease is still lacking.

To address this gap, I present this synthesis of published work, with a focus on functional imaging of circuit dysfunctions across the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders. This synthesis provides the foundation for a taxonomy of putative types of dysfunction, which cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries for depression and anxiety and includes instead distinct types of neural circuit dysfunction that together reflect the heterogeneity of depression and anxiety. This taxonomy is suited to specifying symptoms in terms of underlying neural dysfunction at the individual level and is intended as the foundation for building mechanistic research and ultimately guiding clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Ecological momentary interventions in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In this review, we discuss feasibility, content, and where possible efficacy of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) in psychiatry.

We will discuss EMIs in the field of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression disorder, as well as one generic, transdiagnostic EMI.\nThe few studies that are available all underscore feasibility and acceptability of mobile health approaches in patients with severe mental illness. In terms of content, there is a huge variety in approaches ranging from a mixture of face-to-face contacts augmented with EMI components to a fully automated EMI. With regard to efficacy, only two randomized clinical trials have been conducted, supporting the efficacy of EMIs in mental health. Evidence seems to point toward greater efficacy when EMI is integrated with real-life assessment using experience sampling methodology, preferentially tailoring the intervention toward the specific needs of the individual as well as toward those moments when intervention is needed.\nThe review demonstrates that mobile health may be an important asset to the mental health field but underscores that it still is in its very early ages.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 guidelines recommend \"behavior therapy\" over medication as first-line treatment for children aged 4-5 years with ADHD; these recommendations are consistent with current guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for younger children. CDC analyzed claims data to assess national and state-level ADHD treatment patterns among young children.\nCDC compared Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) claims for \"psychological services\" (the procedure code category that includes behavior therapy) and ADHD medication among children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD, using the MarketScan commercial database (2008-2014) and Medicaid (2008-2011) data. Among children with ESI, ADHD indicators were compared during periods preceding and following the 2011 AAP guidelines.\nIn both Medicaid and ESI populations, the percentage of children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD increased over time; however, during 2008-2011, the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving clinical care was double that of ESI beneficiaries. Although state percentages varied, overall nationally no more than 55% of children with ADHD received psychological services annually, regardless of insurance type, whereas approximately three fourths received medication. Among children with ESI, the percentage receiving psychological services following release of the guidelines decreased significantly by 5%, from 44% in 2011 to 42% in 2014; the change in medication treatment rates (77% in 2011 compared with 76% in 2014) was not significant.\nAmong insured children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD, medication treatment was more common than receipt of recommended first-line treatment with psychological services. Among children with ADHD who had ESI, receipt of psychological services did not increase after release of the 2011 guidelines.

Prior research using a variety of types of neuroimaging techniques has confirmed that neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with dysfunction in anatomical and functional brain circuits. We first discuss current challenges associated with the identification of reliable neuroimaging markers for diagnosis and prognosis in mood disorders and for neurosurgical treatment planning for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We then present data on the use of neuroimaging for the diagnosis and prognosis of mood disorders and for DBS treatment planning. We demonstrate how multivariate analyses of functional activation and connectivity parameters can be used to differentiate patients with bipolar disorder from those with major depressive disorder and non-affective psychosis. We also present data on connectivity parameters that mediate acute treatment response in affective and non-affective psychosis. We then focus on precision mapping of functional connectivity in native space. We describe the benefits of integrating anatomical fiber reconstruction with brain functional parameters and cortical surface measures to derive anatomically informed connectivity metrics within the morphological context of each individual brain. We discuss how this approach may be particularly promising in psychiatry, given the clinical and etiological heterogeneity of the disorders, and particularly in treatment response prediction and planning. Precision mapping of connectivity is essential for DBS. In DBS, treatment electrodes are inserted into positions near key gray matter nodes within the circuits considered relevant to disease expression. However, targeting white matter tracts that underpin connectivity within these circuits may increase treatment efficacy and tolerability therefore relevant for effective treatment. We demonstrate how this approach can be validated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by identifying connectivity patterns that can be used as biomarkers for treatment planning and thus refine the traditional approach of DBS planning that uses only gray matter landmarks. Finally, we describe how this approach could be used in planning DBS treatment of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "What Is Constructionism in Psychiatry?

The paper takes a look at the claim that culture has an impact on psychiatry from the perspective of metaphysics and the philosophy of science. Its aim is to offer, in a general fashion, partial explications of some significant versions of the thesis that culture and social environment shape mental disorders and to highlight some of the consequences social constructionism about psychiatry has for psychiatric explanation. In particular, it will be argued that the alleged dependence of facts about particular mental disorders and about the second order property of being a mental disorder on social facts amounts to a robust form of constructivism, whereas the view that clinician-patient interaction is influenced by cultural facts is perfectly compatible with an anti-constructivist stance."}, {"Title": "Factors influencing treatment team recommendations to review tribunals for forensic psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "It is the responsibility of forensic psychiatric hospitals to detain and treat patients, gradually reintegrating them into society; decisions to release patients must balance risk to the public with maintaining the least restrictive environment for patients. Little is known about the factors considered when making such decisions and whether these factors have been empirically linked to future risk of violence. The current study explores the factors predictive of forensic treatment teams' recommendations for patients under the care of the Ontario Review Board (ORB). Factors differ depending on level of security; decisions on medium secure units were influenced by the presence of active symptoms and patients' overall violence risk level and decisions made on minimum secure units were influenced by the number of critical incidents that occurred within the recommendation year. Understanding the factors used to make recommendations to the ORB tribunal helps treatment teams to reflect on their own decision-making practices.

Explanatory frameworks for hikikomori abound, with different stakeholders attributing it to individual psychopathology, poor parenting, and/or a lack of social support structures. This article takes an interpretive approach to hikikomori by exploring parents' narrative constructions of hikikomori children in support group meetings and in-depth interviews. I argue that some parents were able to find hope in hikikomori by 'emplotting' their children's experiences into a larger narrative about onset, withdrawal, and recovery, which helped them remain invested in the present by maintaining a sense of possibility about the future. Contrary to literature that examines hikikomori as an epidemic of isolated individuals, I demonstrate how parents play a key role in hikikomori through meaning-making activities that have the potential to shape their children's experiences of withdrawal."}, {"Title": "Acute laryngeal dystonia: a persisting psychiatric emergency.", "Abstract": "Acute laryngeal dystonia is one of the most life-threatening medication side effects in psychiatry.

However, by relying too much on syndromes and symptoms, they too often do not define stable constructs. As a result, inclusions and removals from the manuals are not always backed by sound reasons. The RDoC framework is an important move towards ameliorating matters. This paper argues that it improves the current situation by re-referencing constructs to physical properties (biomarkers for disorders, for example), by allowing theoretical levels within the framework, and by treating psychiatry as a special case of the cognitive sciences."}, {"Title": "Dimensional psychiatry: mental disorders as dysfunctions of basic learning mechanisms.", "Abstract": "It has been questioned that the more than 300 mental disorders currently listed in international disease classification systems all have a distinct neurobiological correlate. Here, we support the idea that basic dimensions of mental dysfunctions, such as alterations in reinforcement learning, can be identified, which interact with individual vulnerability and psychosocial stress factors and, thus, contribute to syndromes of distress across traditional nosological boundaries. We further suggest that computational modeling of learning behavior can help to identify specific alterations in reinforcement-based decision-making and their associated neurobiological correlates. For example, attribution of salience to drug-related cues associated with dopamine dysfunction in addiction can increase habitual decision-making via promotion of Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer as indicated by computational modeling of the effect of Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli (here affectively positive or alcohol-related cues) on instrumental approach and avoidance behavior. In schizophrenia, reward prediction errors can be modeled computationally and associated with functional brain activation, thus revealing reduced encoding of such learning signals in the ventral striatum and compensatory activation in the frontal cortex. With respect to negative mood states, it has been shown that both reduced functional activation of the ventral striatum elicited by reward-predicting stimuli and stress-associated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in interaction with reduced serotonin transporter availability and increased amygdala activation by aversive cues contribute to clinical depression; altogether these observations support the notion that basic learning mechanisms, such as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, represent a basic dimension of mental disorders that can be mechanistically characterized using computational modeling and associated with specific clinical syndromes across established nosological boundaries. Instead of pursuing a narrow focus on single disorders defined by clinical tradition, we suggest that neurobiological research should focus on such basic dimensions, which can be studied in and compared among several mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Prediction of Individual Response to Electroconvulsive Therapy via Machine Learning on Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.", "Abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe depression. However, biomarkers that accurately predict a response to ECT remain unidentified.\nTo investigate whether certain factors identified by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to predict ECT response.\nIn this nonrandomized prospective study, gray matter structure was assessed twice at approximately 6 weeks apart using 3-T MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Patients were recruited through the inpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, from March 11, 2010, to March 27, 2015. Two patient groups with acute major depressive disorder were included. One group received an ECT series in addition to antidepressants (n\u2009=\u200924); a comparison sample was treated solely with antidepressants (n\u2009=\u200923). Both groups were compared with a sample of healthy control participants (n\u2009=\u200921).\nBinary pattern classification was used to predict ECT response by structural MRI that was performed before treatment. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes.\nOne participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x\u2009=\u20098, y\u2009=\u200921, z\u2009=\u2009-18; Z\u2009score, 4.00; P\u2009<\u2009.001; peak voxel r\u2009=\u20090.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x\u2009=\u2009-28, y\u2009=\u2009-9, z\u2009=\u2009-18; Z score, 7.81; P\u2009<\u2009.001) that was missing in the medication-only sample.\nA relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT.

Current diagnostic classifications approach this complex phenomenon using syndromatic definitions based on presence or absence of a restricted set of signs or symptoms that have demonstrated low specificity. One of the several utilities of the phenomenological method in psychiatry is to complement the clinical panorama, helping in the process of identifying potential differences between two separated clinical syndromes. The main objective of this publication is to explore one particular clinical difference between these two conditions - that is, the experience of self-continuity and time perception.\nthe argument explored in this paper is based on previous second-person or phenomenological accounts of sufferers of both conditions.\nWhereas borderline personality disorder patients tend to experience only the present moment, referring frequent difficulties of drawing experiences of the past in order to determine their own future, bipolar disorder patients are constantly worried about the contradictions in their past experiences and the latent risk of losing control of themselves in future episodes of their disease. This contrast should be, however, corroborated in future research comparing directly the two groups in terms of the continuity of the self and their temporal structures."}, {"Title": "[Recovery and Inclusion: A Field Report on 5 Years of Peer Support in Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "We report on 5 years of hands-on experience with the inclusion of peers as recovery companions in the psychiatric teams at Klinikum Bremerhaven-Reinkenheide.

To compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone and aripiprazole in the treatment of preschool children with disruptive behavior disorders comorbid with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Randomized clinical trial conducted in a university-affiliated child psychiatry clinic in southwest Iran. Forty 3-6-year-old children, diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with ADHD, were randomized to an 8-week trial of treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole (20 patients in each group). Assessment was performed by Conners' rating scale-revised and clinical global impressions scale, before treatment, and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 of treatment. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 16. Mean scores between the two groups were compared by analysis of variance and independent and paired t-test. Mean scores of Conners rating scales were not different between two groups in any steps of evaluation. Both groups had significantly reduced scores in week 2 of treatment (P = 0.00), with no significant change in subsequent measurements. Rates of improvement, mean increase in weight (P = 0.894), and mean change in fasting blood sugar (P = 0.671) were not significantly different between two groups. Mean serum prolactin showed a significant increase in risperidone group (P = 0.00).

To learn more about the relevance of day centres in this respect, this study aimed to examine the experiences of young people with psychiatric disabilities. A particular focus was on the perceptions of meaningful occupation when visiting day centres, their reasons for not choosing this option when given it and what they desired instead. A qualitative design based on individual interviews was used. Twelve women and eight men between 18 and 35 years, with a need for organized daily occupations, participated as informants. Qualitative content analysis revealed three categories: 'Being in a context', 'Balancing between developing and stagnating', and 'Longing for something more'. The findings indicated that the occupations were inherently age neutral, as were the possibilities for socializing. There was a desire for more activities in the community and more support for engaging in occupations that other young people did. A major issue in the accomplishment of this was the need to earn money, and the lack of opportunities for doing that in the day centre context was a considerable drawback.

The mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) is a tool that can facilitate direct observation and feedback. This study assessed the impact of a mini-CEX requirement across all 3rd-year clerkships on student report of direct observation by faculty and objectively measured clinical skills.\nA mini-CEX requirement across all 3rd-year clerkships was implemented in the 2012-2013 academic year. The impact of the mini-CEX requirement on student report of direct observation was assessed by end-of-clerkship surveys and Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) items on direct observation. The impact on students' clinical skills was assessed by a summative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Pre/post comparisons were assessed with chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.\nA mini-CEX requirement had been in place for the internal medicine clerkship, and student reports of direct observation were historically higher for the internal medicine clerkship than for other clerkships. Faculty, residents, and students at each of the clinical sites across all 6 clerkships were oriented to the use of the mini-CEX; the feasibility of its use during usual patient interaction settings and the importance of direct observation and feedback for student improvement were emphasized during these sessions.\nAdherence to the mini-CEX requirement was high: 92% of required forms were completed, and 78% of completed forms indicated that specific feedback was given.

In a naturalistic study design, we tested if suicidal attempts and violent crimes are differently associated with adverse childhood experiences and levels of appetitive aggression in male forensic psychiatry inpatients. Adverse childhood experiences and appetitive aggression styles were collected by means of self-report measures, suicide attempts were taken from the medical history and violent crimes were appraised by official court records. The data were analyzed by the means of generalized linear models. Results revealed that appetitive aggression and adverse childhood experiences were significant predictors of suicide attempts, whereas violent crimes were associated solely with appetitive aggression. Suicide attempts and violent delinquency in forensic patients seem to be both positively associated with high levels of appetitive aggression, whereas their etiological pathways might differ with regard to adverse childhood experiences.

After discharge to rehabilitation, he had 2 subsequent admissions for delirium. On the first readmission, the transplant team started the patient on risperidone and resumed treatment with sertraline. On his second readmission, neurology and psychiatry were consulted. On evaluation, the patient demonstrated signs of catatonia. On the basis of recommendations from psychiatry, the risperidone and sertraline were stopped, and the patient was started on mirtazapine. He failed to demonstrate improvement within the next 48 hours. Extensive work-up demonstrated a multifactorial etiology for his delirium, including calcineurin-related neuropsychiatric toxicity from tacrolimus leading to possible posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. However, after the initiation of memantine on hospital day 3-before the cessation of tacrolimus-the patient demonstrated marked improvement in mental status and motor symptoms. His magnetic resonance imaging, in addition to findings that raised concerns about posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, had demonstrated bilateral basal ganglia abnormalities on T1 imaging of uncertain origin. It is postulated that these findings served as predisposing factors for the patient's catatonic symptoms. Although it has been described in case reports following liver transplant, catatonia remains an underrecognized neuropsychiatric complication following liver transplant.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of communication skills training (CST) for improving diagnostic discussions, particularly in specialties such as oncology, but only limited evidence exists about CST for psychiatry. This study evaluated a CST program specifically developed for psychiatry residents called ComPsych that focuses on conveying diagnostic and prognostic information about schizophrenia.\nThe ComPsych program consists of an introductory lecture, module booklets for trainees, and exemplary skills videos, followed by small group role-plays with simulated patients (SPs) led by a trained facilitator. A standardized patient assessment (SPA) was digitally recorded pre- and post-training with a SP using a standardized scenario in a time-limited (15\u00a0min) period. Recorded SPAs were independently rated using a validated coding system (ComSkil) to identify frequency of skills used in five skills categories (agenda setting, checking, questioning, information organization, and empathic communication).\nThirty trainees (15 males and 15 females; median age\u2009=\u200932) undertaking their vocational specialty training in psychiatry participated in ComPsych training and pre- and post-ComPsych SPAs.

Meeting either of these criteria allows the inference that the syndrome is caused by a specific biological mechanism not present in other syndromes. Failing to meet either of these criteria means the syndrome has been arbitrarily grouped and is invalid. Kendell and Jablensky's account of validity is too restrictive. Scientific phenomena are generally produced by a multiplicity of unstable overlapping causes, the causes for one phenomenon typically also present in other phenomena. Despite this, scientific phenomena are not automatically arbitrary. Science employs idealistic models that can successfully describe phenomena produced by overlapping causes and can gain approximately true knowledge of that phenomenon. The specific biological mechanisms that Kendell and Jablensky see as delivering validity are only specific in an idealized sense. Also, approximate truth means Kendell and Jablensky are mistaken to see validity as invariant and independent of context. An alternative approach to inferring causes is the common cause and unifications. Scientists often see otherwise unrelated phenomena regularly co-occur, and this legitimizes inferring common causes responsible for the phenomena. Applied to psychiatry, I show how syndromes that cover many different unrelated phenomena allow an inference to common causes, and this delivers validity. Zones of rarity can actually decrease validity. Idealized models often produce more information about causes by covering more phenomena, whereas zones of rarity often reduce the number of symptoms covered by a syndrome. Ignoring zones of rarity in favour of syndromes that cover many symptoms can sometimes increase validity. This can also occur when validating syndromes through corroborations with other factors. Increasing corroborations may require reducing the number of symptoms, potentially reducing validity."}, {"Title": "Commercial pharmacogenetic-based decision-support tools in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Despite a compendium of pharmacotherapies available for treating psychiatric illnesses, suboptimal response to these therapies is typical and thought to be in part a result of genetic variation.

During the follow-up, it appeared that each healthcare decision made for the patient (on treatment, type of care) led to a meeting of at least 20 members of the family, who discussed and debated the best decision to make.\nTaking into account gypsy cultural habits, the psychiatrist's intervention facilitated the initiation and follow-up of care for this patient. Her mother, assisted by the psychologist, better understood institutional procedures and could also change some of her habits to optimize care. Some other members of the family were included in the care procedure, because we understood that it was very important for the mother and to improve alliance and ongoing care.\nTaking into account cultural and social aspects is highly important for the management of care and the therapeutic alliance, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Integrated management of patients with schizophrenia: beyond psychotropic drugs].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex disease with severe functional repercussions; therefore it merits treatment which goes beyond drugs.\nIt requires an approach that considers a diathesis-stress process that includes rehabilitation, psychotherapeutic strategies for persistent cognitive, negative and psychotic symptoms, psychoeducation of patient and communities, community adaptation strategies, such as the introduction to the work force, and the community model, such as a change in the asylum paradigm.\nIt is necessary to establish private and public initiatives for the integrated care of schizophrenia in the country, advocating the well-being of those with the disease.\nThe integrated management of schizophrenic patients requires a global view of the patient and his/her disease, and its development is essential."}, {"Title": "What is special about a Paediatric Liaison Child and Adolescent Mental Health service?", "Abstract": "The paediatric population is known to be at high risk for psychiatric problems. Paediatric liaison child/adolescent mental health services (PL-CAMHS) have been developed to help increase recognition and management of psychiatric morbidity in the paediatric setting. This report describes clinical activity by a psychological medicine PL-CAMHS and considers specificity by comparing this with community/general CAMHS activity.\nClinical information was obtained on consecutive patients seen by a PL-CAMHS in a UK tertiary specialist hospital. Where feasible this was compared with published data on national/community CAMHS work.\nData was obtained on 800 patients (mean age 11.9, SD 3.8). Most referrals came from a variety of paediatric teams, nearly two-thirds were for psychosomatic problems or difficulties adjusting to physical illness. The majority had an ICD-10 psychiatric diagnosis (mostly adjustment, mood and anxiety, and somatoform disorders); problems were often complex and in about half, family difficulties were also noted; one-third had received prior mental health treatment. Virtually all children were seen by the PL service within a month of referral and only 2% of families failed to attend for assessment. Some level of clinical improvement was noted for the majority. There were indications of differences from national/community CAMHS work in referral source, take up rates and psychiatric diagnoses.\nPaediatric liaison child and adolescent mental health services users commonly have characteristic psychiatric problems, interventions appear potentially effective and the work is specific and complementary of community CAMHS.

A clinical pharmacist reviewed the full patient notes, identified drug-related problems (DRPs), and proposed interventions using a DRP Registration Form (PCNE classification V6.2). Acceptance rate and outcomes of interventions were assessed.\nFor 49 patients, 71 DRPs were identified, ranging from one to four problems/patient (1.43\u00b10.68), predominantly related to tolerability and treatment effectiveness. The DRPs were mostly caused (N=184) by inappropriate drug selection (64%) or dose (23.4%): too many drugs for indication (N=33); a non-cost-effective choice (N=29); inappropriate combination (N=27); an inappropriate drug (N=23); lack of therapeutic drug monitoring (N=14); subtherapeutic (N=13) or supratherapeutic (N=11) dosing.

The historical roots of connectomics in schizophrenia go back to the late 19th century, when influential scholars such as Theodor Meynert, Carl Wernicke, Emil Kraepelin, and Eugen Bleuler worked on a theoretical understanding of the multifaceted syndrome that is currently referred to as schizophrenia. Their work contributed to the understanding that symptoms such as psychosis and cognitive disorganization might stem from abnormal integration or dissociation due to disruptions in the brain's association fibers. As methods to test this hypothesis were long lacking, the claims of these early pioneers remained unsupported by empirical evidence for almost a century.

Despite periodic attempts from the late nineteenth through the mid-twentieth centuries to implement diagnostic systems based on the principle of specificity, psychiatric diagnoses remained undifferentiated, overlapping, and capacious. The need for medical legitimacy, compatibility with a biomedical model, and conditions that third parties would reimburse led psychiatry to replace the psychodynamically oriented DSM-I and DSM-II with the radically empiricist DSM-III in 1980. This manual emphasized explicit measurement, symptom-based entities, and homogeneous categories that were compatible with the specific disorders embraced in the rest of medicine. Yet the diagnostic system that the DSM-III launched was incongruent with the underlying nature of the continuous, fluid, and intersecting conditions with which psychiatry deals. The widespread institutionalization of the specific diagnostic system in psychiatric practice, however, prevented any thoroughgoing revisions when the DSM-5 was published in 2013. The result is an impasse between psychiatry's classificatory system and the need for scientific progress in understanding the causes of and treatments for mental disorders."}, {"Title": "Point Prevalence of Co-Occurring Behavioral Health Conditions and Associated Chronic Disease Burden Among\u00a0Adolescents.", "Abstract": "To examine the point prevalence of behavioral health conditions (BHCs) and co-occurring chronic medical conditions among adolescents in an integrated health system.\nThe sample consisted of adolescents in an integrated health care system diagnosed with at least 1 of the 5 most prevalent BHCs in 2014 (n\u00a0= 30,643), and patients without a BHC matched on age, sex, and medical home facility (n\u00a0= 30,643).

We analysed retrospectively over a period of two years the medical records of psychiatric unit in-patients with abnormal results for at least one of the following hepatic markers: aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin.\nIn total, 188\u00a0liver test results were abnormal, with an average of 1.7\u00a0per patient.

One fifth of the patients in this study had no psychiatric diagnosis beside IDD, which may be due to diagnostic difficulties, or other problems (e.g. somatic or behavioural disorders) leading to psychiatric contact.

The effects of reserpine are of historical interest although there are some reports of it still being used in highly specialist situations in psychiatry. Chlorpromazine is also an old drug but it is still used for treatment of people with schizophrenia.\nTo investigate the effects of two old medications (reserpine and chlorpromazine) for people with schizophrenia. Reserpine is now rarely used while chlorpromazine remains on the essential list of drugs of the World Health Organization (WHO).\nWe searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (24 March 2016).\nWe included randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus reserpine for schizophrenia that presented useable data.\nWe extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.\nThe review currently includes nine studies with an average 60 participants per study. All of these studies are now over 60 years old, conducted between 1955 and 1962. When chlorpromazine was compared with reserpine for people with schizophrenia, improvement in global state was better at short term for those receiving chlorpromazine (n = 781, 6 RCTs, RR 'not improved' 0.75 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92, low-quality evidence). Short-term improvement in paranoid distortion was measured using the Multidimensional Scale for Rating Psychiatric Patients (MSRPP). Data showed no clear difference between treatment groups (n = 19, 1 RCT, RR 1.33 95% CI 0.62 to 2.89, very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in functioning: occupational adjustment, medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.83 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, moderate-quality evidence) and general behaviour (n = 98, 1 RCT, RR 0.79 CI 0.41 to 1.53, moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events were poorly reported. For 'toxic reaction' there was, again, no obvious difference between the two compounds (n = 210, 3 RCTs, RR 1.68 95% CI 0.43 to 6.54, moderate-quality evidence), and this also applied to leaving the study early (n = 229, 4 RCTs, RR 1.16 95% CI 0.94 to 1.42, moderate-quality evidence).\nJudged by standards of today, the evidence is largely of limited quality. However, some of these 1950s studies are remarkable in their foresight and clarity. Reserpine did have some effect on global state - but chlorpromazine did seem to perform better. Important issues regarding adverse effects were not really addressed by these trials. Chlorpromazine remains on the WHO list of essential drugs.

I. Psychiatry as a Psychobiological Discipline.", "Abstract": "Economic, political, and ideological landscapes have impacted the practice of psychiatry throughout its evolution as a medical discipline. Despite enormous scientific advances over the course of the past century, many psychiatrists continue to operate with a split Cartesian picture of mind versus brain and entrenched ideological positions ranging from biological \"chemical imbalance\" to rigidly followed manualized psychotherapy approaches, both of which frequently result in fractured clinical care. With the impact of systemic economic and political pressures in Canada and the United States, the attention to the doctor-patient relationship has taken a back seat to high-volume practices, computerized assessment tools, and the focus on evidence-based treatments for behaviorally defined syndromes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that often come at the expense of the patient's experience of his or her illness. We spend much time teaching the next generation of psychiatrists what to prescribe versus how to prescribe; what manualized treatments to administer versus questioning why our patients engage in dysfunctional patterns of thinking, feeling, and relating to others, and what impact these patterns may have on their interaction with us in the here-and-now of the treatment setting. In this paper, we propose an integrative psychobiological model, in which biological interventions carry personal meanings, and relational transactions in the treatment setting are a form of learning that results in lasting physiological changes in the brain. Psychiatry needs to reconnect with its roots as a science of attachment and meaning, in which attention to the objective, subjective, and relational domains of the patient-provider experience is equally foundational for any successful treatment outcome."}, {"Title": "Anti N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis: a game-changer?", "Abstract": "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an inflammatory disorder of the brain that has garnered significant interest within the medical and lay communities.

Legal rights principles require rationale for coercive measure use be thoroughly considered and rigorously documented. This article presents an in-principle Danish Psychiatric Complaint Board decision concerning MR use initiated by untrained staff. The case illustrates that, judicially, weight must be put on the patient perspective on course of happenings and especially when health professional documentation is scant, patients' rights call for taking notice of patient evaluations. Consequently, if it comes out that psychiatric staff failed to pay appropriate consideration for the patient's mental state, perspective, and expressions, patient response deviations are to be judicially interpreted in this light potentially rendering MR use illegitimated. While specification of law criteria might possibly improve law use and promote patients' rights, education of psychiatry professionals must address the need for, as far as possible, paying due regard to meeting patient perspectives and participation principles as well as formal law and documentation requirements."}, {"Title": "Somnophilia and Sexual Abuse Using Vaginal Administration of Triazolam.", "Abstract": "Somnophilia is a rare paraphilia, a form of sexual fetishism which is characterized by the desire to have sex with an unconscious human object who is unable to respond.

Two topics are addressed: (i) whether previous animal abuse can be identified by a patient's Psychopathy Checklist profile and (ii) whether animal abuse statistically mediates between psychopathy and sadistic acting. In a German forensic hospital, 60 patients were investigated. Animal abuse was assessed using face-to-face interviews and the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV), and sadistic acting was identified by file records.Discriminant analysis separated previous animal abuse (10/60) by high adolescent antisocial behavior, superficiality, lack of remorse, lack of empathy, and grandiosity. The mediation from psychopathy to sadistic acting (6/60) through animal abuse was found to be complete.The results, although sample size is limited and base rate of animal abuse and sadistic acting are low, fit with a model suggestive of animal abuse as a causal step toward sadistic crimes. Animal abuse correlates with callous, unemotional traits, and a development of sadistic crimes."}, {"Title": "The Microbiome and Mental Health: Looking Back, Moving Forward with Lessons from Allergic Diseases.", "Abstract": "Relationships between gastrointestinal viscera and human emotions have been documented by virtually all medical traditions known to date. The focus on this relationship has waxed and waned through the centuries, with noted surges in interest driven by cultural forces. Here we explore some of this history and the emerging trends in experimental and clinical research. In particular, we pay specific attention to how the hygiene hypothesis and emerging research on traditional dietary patterns has helped re-ignite interest in the use of microbes to support mental health. At present, the application of microbes and their structural parts as a means to positively influence mental health is an area filled with promise. However, there are many limitations within this new paradigm shift in neuropsychiatry. Impediments that could block translation of encouraging experimental studies include environmental forces that work toward dysbiosis, perhaps none more important than westernized dietary patterns. On the other hand, it is likely that specific dietary choices may amplify the value of future microbial-based therapeutics. Pre-clinical and clinical research involving microbiota and allergic disorders has predated recent work in psychiatry, an early start that provides valuable lessons. The microbiome is intimately connected to diet, nutrition, and other lifestyle variables; microbial-based psychopharmacology will need to consider this contextual application, otherwise the ceiling of clinical expectations will likely need to be lowered."}, {"Title": "[Homicides committed by women in the area served by the Munich Institute of Legal Medicine].", "Abstract": "According to crime statistics only a small percentage of intentional killings are committed by women.

The relation between education level and suicidality has not been investigated in MS patients. Our objective was to estimate attempted suicide and completed suicide risks amongst MS patients.\nA total of 29 617 Swedish MS patients were identified through the Swedish Patient Register and matched with 296 164 people without MS from the general population. Cox regression analysis estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of MS with attempted and completed suicide, with adjustment for age, sex, education and calendar period.\nThe adjusted HR for attempted suicide amongst MS patients is 2.18 (95% CI 1.97-2.43) compared with the general population cohort. For completed suicide the HR is 1.87 (95% CI 1.53-2.30). In both groups women are at higher risk of attempting suicide, whilst men are at higher risk of completing suicide. Education level is inversely associated with completed suicide amongst the non-MS cohort (0.68, 0.51-0.91), but not amongst MS patients (1.10, 0.60-2.04).\nMultiple sclerosis patients are at higher risk of both attempted and completed suicide.

Classical theories of psychological measurements assume that only convergence among different informants' reports allows for an estimate of the true nature and causes of clinical presentations. However, the integration of multiple accounts is fraught with problems because findings in child and adolescent psychiatry do not conform to the fundamental expectation of convergence. Indeed, reports provided by different sources (self, parents, teachers, peers) share little variance. Moreover, in some cases informant divergence may be meaningful and not error variance. In this review, we give an overview of conceptual and theoretical foundations of valid multi-informant assessment and discuss why our common concepts of validity need revaluation."}, {"Title": "[Assessment and management of gender dysphoria in children and adolescents].", "Abstract": "Gender dysphoria, originally called gender identity disorder, is characterized by the dissociation between one's expressed gender and the gender of rearing as assigned at birth, which generates significant clinical distress and social, academic, and other important forms of isolation. This state is also known as transgender or transsexualism and is recognized as a medical disease. Adults with gender dysphoria can benefit from psychological, medical, and surgical care. However, gender dysphoria rarely occurs in adulthood but rather emerges in childhood or adolescence, generating deep social and academic difficulties, especially at puberty. For the last 10years, the management of gender dysphoria in children and adolescents has developed in several countries, specifically in Europe, but remains under-recognized in France. Since 2013, several pediatric psychiatry and endocrinology departments have initiated a multidisciplinary evaluation and management approach for these patients.

Serotonin (5-HT) and other neuroactive compounds deriving from Tryptophan (Trp), including kynurenine (Kyn), have not yet been investigated in large cohorts of aggressive individuals to validate their potential as biomarkers of aggression. In 361 male inmates we measured serum levels of Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT, Kyn, the ratios 5-HT/Trp\u22171000 and Kyn/Trp\u22171000, and performed Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I and -II Disorders (SCID-I and -II), global assessment of functioning (GAF), and scales for aggressive behavior, impulsivity, adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligent quotient (IQ). Aggressive compared to non-aggressive inmates exhibited lower Trp and Kyn serum levels but higher levels of 5-HT and 5-HT/Trp\u22171000, higher levels of impulsivity and ADHD indices, lower IQ and GAF, higher prevalence of mood disorders, drug abuse/dependence, and borderline, conduct and antisocial behaviors. Interestingly, Kyn/Trp\u22171000 was positively correlated to the number of severe aggressive acts (r=0.593, P<0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis indicated that 5-HT/Trp\u22171000, antisocial behavior, and GAF were predictors of aggressive behavior. The model combining these three predictors had an area under the ROC curve of 0.851 (95% CI 0.806-0.895). This study indicates that while circulating Trp is reduced in aggressive individuals, the combination of biological (5-HT/Trp ratio) and psychopathological (antisocial behavior and GAF) markers discriminates between aggressive and non-aggressive behavior suggesting the potential of a multi-marker approach in psychiatry given the heterogenic nature of mental diseases."}, {"Title": "Historical aspects of Mexican psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Mexican psychiatry initiated since pre-Hispanic times.

In a young lady who presented with catatonia, we considered anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, after ruling out other aetiologies. After a positive antibody test we treated her with immunotherapy. She showed gradual improvement in her psychotic and catatonic symptoms. Knowledge regarding the nature and function of NMDA receptors and pathophysiology of this particular encephalitis is important for psychiatric practice. The great opportunity for research in this area due to its association with psychotic disorders is evident but an appeal to temper the enthusiasm by considering the historical lessons learnt from Karl Jaspers' critique of General Paresis of Insane, is in place.

However, to our knowledge, no studies have determined whether this is an effective means of teaching residents to manage acutely agitated patients. This study aimed to determine whether simulation-based training in the management of acute agitation improves resident knowledge and performance, as compared to didactic-based instruction.\nFollowing a standard lecture on the management of agitated patients, first-year psychiatry residents were randomized (in clusters of three to four residents) to either the intervention (n\u2009=\u200915) or control arm (n\u2009=\u200911). Residents in the intervention arm then received simulation-based training on the management of acute agitation using a scenario with an agitated standardized patient. Those in the control arm received simulation-based training on a clinical topic unrelated to the management of agitation using a scenario with a non-agitated standardized patient who had suffered a fall. Baseline confidence and knowledge were assessed using pre-intervention self-assessment questionnaires and open-ended clinical case vignettes. Efficacy of the intervention as a teaching tool was assessed with post-intervention open-ended clinical case vignettes and videotaped simulation-based assessment, using a different scenario of an agitated standardized patient.\nResidents who received the agitation simulation-based training showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge (intervention\u2009=\u20093.0 vs. control\u2009=\u20090.3, p\u2009=\u20090.007, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.2) and performance (intervention\u2009=\u200939.6 vs control\u2009=\u200932.5, p\u2009=\u20090.001, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20091.6).

The cognitive processes that guide decision making as well as the brain circuits they are based on are only poorly understood. Numerous studies point to a potential role of dopamine and nicotine in decision making but less is known about their interactions. Here, 26 healthy male subjects performed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in two sessions following the administration of either nicotine or placebo. Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Results indicate that lower DAT levels were associated with better performance in the IGT (p=0.0004). Cognitive modelling analysis using the prospect valence learning (PVL) model indicated that low DAT subjects' performance deteriorated following nicotine administration as indicated by an increased learning rate and a decreased response consistency. Our results shed light on the neurochemistry underlying reward-based decision making in humans by demonstrating a significant interaction between nicotine and the DAT. The observed interaction is consistent with the hypothesized associations between DAT expression and extracellular dopamine levels, suggestive of an inverted U-shape relationship between baseline dopamine and magnitude in response to a pro-dopaminergic compound. Our findings are of particular interest in the context of psychiatric disorders where aberrant decision making represents a part of the core symptomatology, such as addiction, schizophrenia or depression."}, {"Title": "Enhancing latent cognitive capacity in mild cognitive impairment with gist reasoning training: a pilot study.", "Abstract": "Cognitive training offers a promising way to mitigate cognitive deterioration in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Understanding the cellular mechanisms of T. gondii-generated brain pathologies would aid the advancement of novel strategies to reduce disease. Complement factor C1q is part of a classic immune pathway that functions peripherally to tag and remove infectious agents and cellular debris from circulation. In the developing and adult brain, C1q modifies neuronal architecture through synapse marking and pruning. T. gondii exposure and complement activation have both been implicated in the development of complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia. Thus, it seems logical that mechanistically, the physiological pathways associated with these two factors are connected. We employed a rodent model of chronic infection to investigate the extent to which cyst presence in the brain triggers activation of cerebral C1q. Compared to uninfected mice, cortical C1q was highly expressed at both the RNA and protein levels in infected animals bearing a high cyst burden. In these mice, C1q protein localized to cytoplasm, adjacent to GFAP-labeled astrocytes, near degenerating cysts, and in punctate patterns along processes. In summary, our results demonstrated an upregulation of cerebral C1q in response to latent T. gondii infection. Our data preliminarily suggest that this complement activity may aid in the clearance of this parasite from the CNS and in so doing, have consequences for the connectivity of neighboring cells and synapses."}, {"Title": "Parent-child bed-sharing: The good, the bad, and the burden of evidence.", "Abstract": "The practice of parent and child sharing a sleeping surface, or 'bed-sharing', is one of the most controversial topics in parenting research.

If left unaddressed, these youth have a high risk of growing up with additional health and mental health problems. In this article the authors review three key aspects of helping youth heal from the symptoms of experiencing a traumatic event; (1) recommended guidelines, (2) specific treatments, and (3) the Trauma-Informed Care Framework. Eleven recommendations from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry are discussed as they relate to effective practices in the treatment of trauma in children and adolescents. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and child-parent psychotherapy are also explored as the two specific interventions that have the most empirical support for treatment in children and adolescents. Finally, the tenets of a Trauma-Informed Care Framework are presented along with a review of how well these have been applied in youth serving organizations."}, {"Title": "Patient cost-sharing for ambulatory neuropsychiatric services in Abu Dhabi, UAE.", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are of high concern and burden of disease in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The aim of this study is to describe patient cost-sharing patterns, insurance coverage of ambulatory neuropsychiatric disorders, and utilization of neuropsychiatric services in Abu Dhabi.\nThe study utilized the data published by Health Authority-Abu Dhabi (HAAD) and the American Center for Psychiatry and Neurology (ACPN) records in Abu Dhabi. The data were collected from the ACPN to describe patterns of insurance coverage and patient cost-sharing. The data included information on patient visits to the ACPN from January 1, 2010 till May 16, 2013. The data also included insurance coverage, total cost of treatment for each patient and the amount of coinsurances and deductibles paid by each patient. Additionally, the study utilized data published by HAAD on health services utilization, and health insurance plans in 2014. The percentage of total costs paid by patients and insurance were calculated by insurance groups and health service. Insurance plans with different patient cost-sharing arrangements for mental health treatment benefits were divided into three groups. ANOVA and MANOVA analyses were performed to test for differences among three categories of neuropsychiatric services (neurology, psychiatry and psychotherapy) in terms of the total costs and patient cost-sharing. The data were analysed using STATA version 12.\nAbout 36\u00a0% of the total costs on ambulatory neuropsychiatric services was paid directly by patients; 1\u00a0% of total costs was covered by patients as co-insurances and deductibles, and 63\u00a0% of total costs was covered by insurance providers. The average cost per visit was about 485 AED ($132), including 304 AED ($83) paid by insurance and 181 AED ($49) paid by patient. About 44\u00a0% of total costs was related to psychiatry services, 28\u00a0% of total costs was related to neurology services, and 28\u00a0% of total costs was related to psychotherapy services. Using ANOVA analyses, statistical differences were found among three categories of neuropsychiatric services in terms of the total costs and patient cost-sharing. These findings provide hint on some degree of association between patient cost-sharing and neuropsychiatry services utilization.\nThe determination of parities in the coverage and finance between neuropsychiatric and physical health services will help policymakers make informed decisions on regulations of health insurance plans. Given the level of unmet need for neuropsychiatric services in Abu Dhabi, there is a need to fully include neuropsychiatric services in all basic and enhanced insurance plans. The study provided a description of patient cost-sharing and coverage of neuropsychiatric services in order for policymakers to recognize the disparities of the coverage and the degree of economic burden on households."}, {"Title": "Overstatements in abstract conclusions claiming effectiveness of interventions in psychiatry: a study protocol for a meta-epidemiological investigation.", "Abstract": "Abstracts are the major and often the most important source of information for readers of the medical literature. However, there is mounting criticism that abstracts often exaggerate the positive findings and emphasise the beneficial effects of intervention beyond the actual findings mentioned in the corresponding full texts. In order to examine the magnitude of this problem, we will introduce a systematic approach to detect overstated abstracts and to quantify the extent of their prevalence in published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of psychiatry.\nWe will source RCTs published in 2014 from the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) that claim effectiveness of any intervention for mental disorders. The abstract conclusions will be categorised into three types: superior (only stating significant superiority of intervention to control), limited (suggesting that intervention has limited superiority to control) and equal (claiming equal effectiveness of intervention as control). The full texts will also be classified as one of the following based on the primary outcome results: significant (all primary outcomes were statistically significant in favour of the intervention), mixed (primary outcomes included both significant and non-significant results) or all non-significant results. By comparing the abstract conclusion classification and that of the corresponding full text, we will assess whether each study exhibited overstatements in its abstract conclusion.\nThis trial requires no ethical approval. We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal.\nUMIN000018668; Pre-results."}, {"Title": "Patients assessed by the liaison psychiatric team in the emergency department of a regional hospital in Canada - general characteristics and gender differences.", "Abstract": "To describe the characteristics of liaison psychiatric patients in the emergency department (ED) of a medium sized hospital in the oil sands region of Northern Alberta.\nED psychiatry services users were evaluated using a data assessment tool designed to capture all relevant demographic and clinical characteristics.\nOverall, 477 patients (48.2% male) were assessed by the psychiatric team over the 12 month period. There was a fairly balanced distribution by age, ethnicity and relationship status between both sexes. The majority of patients with a history of self-harm or childhood sexual abuse were female while male patients were significantly more likely to report medication non-compliance. A higher proportion of female patients had depressive disorders and personality disorders while a higher proportion of male patients had anxiety disorders, bipolar and related disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders and substance-related disorders. Nearly one in five patients was admitted for inpatient treatment with a significantly higher proportion of males being admitted involuntarily.\nThere were sex-specific differences in many of the demographic and clinical measures in our ED psychiatric sample.

These prolific writers were able to establish or extend the scope of the discipline in which they chose to act, questioning the establishment of rigid boundaries within the framework of a rigorous epistemological reflection. Thus the systematizing spirit of Jose Ingenieros' in the context of positivist evolutionism, resulted in the act of founding a discipline that integrated the biological and the social. In the case of Guillermo Vidal his conception of mental health went beyond the biomedical to consider psychotherapies as an emotional commitment, continence and empathic understanding; with regard to C\u00e9sar Cabral his formation and extensive clinical practice resulted in a work defined by the inquiring into the theoretical concepts underlying Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology.

The importance of a nursing internship as an access point to the psychiatric field is not considered by key players. A survey conducted across German medical schools in 2012 analyzed medical care internships as viewed by medical school students. From among students surveyed, those who participated in a nursing internship, and would consider taking part in further internships within the psychiatric department (\"PFJ\"), were separated from those who were not sure (\"PFU\") or who would not (\"PFN\") consider further study in the field of psychiatry. The survey's conclusion was that a comparably small number of students opted for a psychiatric nursing internship based upon practical aspects of content, satisfaction, and access to nursing internships. A potential solution to the low numbers of students selecting psychiatric internships is to restructure the initial contact program that psychiatric departments use to introduce prospective medical school students to the field of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[25 Years After Re-Unification of Germany: An Overview on Eastern German Psychiatry. Part 1: Post-War Era, Pavlovization, Psychopharmacological Era and\u00a0Social Psychiatric Reform Movement].", "Abstract": "This is the first of a 2-part study on the history of\u00a0psychiatry in Eastern Germany, i.\u200ae. the Soviet Occupied Zone and later German Democratic Republic. It mainly covers the years post World War II up until the beginning of the 1970s. The first post-war years were determined by the new power holders' attempts to overcome National Socialist (Nazi) heritage and to re-organize mental health and care in general. The doctrine of a strict denazifization in East Germany must, however, be regarded as a myth. Promoted by centralized organization, there was an increase in communist party-ideological influence and harassment as well as aligning scientific views and research with Soviet paradigms (Pavlovization) during the 1950s and early 1960s. This, however, led to an enormous rise in exodus of skilled labor to West Germany, which in turn further increased the notorious lack of staff. After the erection of the inner-German wall, this problem was mitigated, yet never fully solved over the 40 years of the existence of the GDR. Despite adverse conditions, East German psychiatrists made major original contributions to the development of psychiatry in general, at least up until the 1960s. Academic psychiatry was mainly based on biological concepts that were further promoted by new somatic and psychopharmacological therapeutic options. In the 1960s, social psychiatric reformist forces emerged, primarily in the large psychiatric hospitals. The improvements achieved by these forces, however, were not implemented on a nation-wide scale, but mainly restricted to one particular or several institutions."}, {"Title": "Assessment of Pharmacological Treatment Quality: Comparison of Symptom-triggered vs. Fixed-schedule Alcohol Withdrawal in Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> Despite the fact, that symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal treatment is recommended by German guidelines on alcoholism, many hospitals continue to use fixed-schedule protocols, as they have been successfully applied for many years. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study compared all patients' records of alcohol withdrawal treatment from October 2010 to November 2011 at Magdeburg's University Department of Psychiatry (n=120). A symptom-triggered protocol with clomethiazole (AESB, n=46) was used in parallel with the existing fixed-schedule protocol with diazepam (n=74). <b>Results:</b> The symptom-triggered group showed less need of pharmacological treatment duration (p<0.001) and cumulative dosage of medication compared to the fixed-schedule protocol (p<0.006). No difference was observed regarding the need of clonidine or haloperidol (to treat blood pressure derailment or delirium) and the incidence of epileptic seizures. <b>Discussion:</b> Based on the shorter treatment duration and a similar rate of complications our department has switched to the symptom-triggered protocol to improve the quality of patient care."}, {"Title": "Relation between CYP2D6 Genotype, Phenotype and Therapeutic Drug Concentrations among Nortriptyline and Venlafaxine Users in Old Age Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "<b>Objectives:</b> To determine relations between drug concentrations and the cytochrome P450-CYP2D6 genotype or phenotype among elderly patients treated with nortriptyline or venlafaxine. <b>Methods:</b> A post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial was performed. Patients were grouped into phenotypes according to the metabolite/mother compound ratio. Genotypes were assessed by the <i>CYP2D6</i> *3 and *4 alleles. <b>Results:</b> Data was available from 81 patients (41 nortriptyline, 40 venlafaxine) with a mean age of 72 years. No phenoconversion from poor metabolizers (PM) to extensive metabolizers (EM), or vice versa, was found. However, we did find phenoconversion from PM to intermediate metabolizers (IM), IM to EM, or vice versa in 36% of observations. Among nortriptyline users, patients with a PM or IM genotype had more supra-therapeutic blood levels, although this did not reach statistical significance. In exploratory analyses we found men were more likely (RR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.14-5.07) to display phenoconversion from an IM genotype to EM phenotype. In addition, compared to non-PMs, PMs were found to have higher risk (RR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.03-2.37) on non-response, although this was only significant when response was measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and not on the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patients phenoconversed, but we did not observe phenoconversion from PM to EM or vice versa.

Our study aimed to look for specific stressor differences among demographic and clinical variables in a naturalistic setting of patients with AD.\nA restrospective statistical analysis of the data of patients diagnosed with AD from November 2009 to September 2012, identified via manual search from the archive of the outpatient setting at the University Unit of Psychiatry \"A. Fiorini\" Hospital, Terracina (Latina, Italy), was performed.\nThe sample consisted of 93 patients (46 males and 47 females), aged between 26 and 85, with medium-high educational level who were mainly employed. In most cases (54.80%), a diagnosis of AD with mixed anxiety and depressed mood was made. In all, 72% of the sample reported a negative family history for psychiatric disorders. In 22.60%, a previous history of psychopathology, especially mood disorders (76.19%), was reported. The main stressors linked to the development of AD were represented by working problems (32.30%), family problems (23.70%), and/or somatic disease (22.60%) with significant differences with respect to age and sex. Half of the patients were subjected to a single first examination; 24.47% requested a copy of medical records.\nConfirming previous data from previous reports, our results suggest that AD may have a distinct profile in demographic and clinical terms. Increased scientific attention is hoped, particularly focused on addressing a better definition of diagnostic criteria, whose correctness and accuracy are critical, especially in situations with medicolegal implications."}, {"Title": "Role of CYP2C19 gene polymorphism in acute alcohol withdrawal treatment with loading dose of diazepam in a South Indian population.", "Abstract": "Alcohol dependence is a public health problem worldwide, commonly associated with withdrawal symptoms for which diazepam is a frequently used drug. We studied the effect of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms on diazepam loading dose requirement and time to reversal of acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms. We also studied the influence of the polymorphism in this gene on the persistent symptoms after loading dose of diazepam.\nSixty-nine patients who reported to the psychiatry department with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria were included for the study. A 10-mg loading dose of diazepam was administered iv after baseline assessment of withdrawal severity using CIWA-Ar scoring. The patients were assessed for improvement of the symptoms every two hourly and 20\u00a0mg oral diazepam was given based on improvement of symptoms. Genotyping for CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3 and CYP2C19*17 was done by PCR-RFLP and RT-PCR methods.\nThe diazepam dose requirement as well as the time required for reversal of acute symptoms was not statistically different among the different genotype groups. Similarly, the frequency of patients with persistent symptoms after successful treatment of the acute episode was not different among the groups. However, the total diazepam dose requirement was influenced by baseline CIWA-Ar scores (adjusted OR 0.21, p\u2009=\u20090.026). In addition, the odds of treatment with a lower dose (10\u00a0mg) of diazepam were higher in smokers (adjusted OR 5.22, p\u2009=\u20090.025) and patients with other addiction (adjusted OR 9.26, p\u2009=\u20090.026).\nWe found that CYP2C19 polymorphism did not have any significant effect on the diazepam dose requirement, time duration needed for successful treatment or on the persistent symptoms after loading dose of diazepam in South Indian population.

This editorial focusses on psychotropic drug treatment, which plays an essential part in the comprehensive management of a range of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. Despite a growing evidence base for drug treatment in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, much psychotropic medication continues to be prescribed off-label (i.e. outside the limits of the marketing authorisation or product license). The reasons for and implications of off-label prescribing, including the potential clinical benefits/risks and medico-legal implications, are often poorly understood by both patients and prescribers. An important unintended consequence of the uncertainties and confusion surrounding the status of off-label prescribing for children and adolescents may be that effective drug treatments are being withheld or underused.

Due to lack of resources, psychiatric forensic patients ended up in the correctional system or homeless with the reduction of psychiatric beds in forensic and civil state hospitals. Lacking proper training and medication management, the recidivism rate of this population was close to 10% for rearrest and about 35% for revocation of conditional release (CR; Manguno-Mire et al., ). A new treatment modality was created to successfully transition patients from the forensic state hospital system to the community. This article describes and analyzes the principles and constructs of Passageway, a model residential program for patients found not guilty by reason of insanity or those incompetent to proceed to CR. The CR allows for a program like Passageway to be successful in transitioning patients back into the community.

Daily gavage of vehicle (dH2O) in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice induced a social avoidance behavior that was not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This was not observed in NOD animals with depleted microbiota via oral administration of antibiotics. Transfer of intestinal microbiota, including members of the Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, from vehicle-gavaged NOD donors to microbiota-depleted C57BL/6 recipients was sufficient to induce social avoidance and change gene expression and myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Metabolomic analysis identified increased cresol levels in these mice, and exposure of cultured oligodendrocytes to this metabolite prevented myelin gene expression and differentiation. Our results thus demonstrate that the gut microbiota modifies the synthesis of key metabolites affecting gene expression in the prefrontal cortex, thereby modulating social behavior."}, {"Title": "Cerebrospinal fluid data compilation and knowledge-based interpretation of bacterial, viral, parasitic, oncological, chronic inflammatory and demyelinating diseases.

During a vacation with her family, she went swimming with dolphins. A few days later, Isela awoke at night with laughing spells; during the day, she was pacing, aggressive, and had a decline in self-care and communication skills. Her parents attributed the symptoms to the dolphins. She was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist. The sleep-deprived electroencephalogram, brain magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, and thyroid function tests were normal. A genomic microarray was sent. The neurologist initiated empirical therapy for seizures with lamotrigine, which caused a rash. It was discontinued. She was then treated with oxcarbazepine followed by topiramate for several months without any change in symptoms. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a small deletion at 14q13.1, which includes the NPAS3 gene. Psychiatry was consulted after several months of persistent symptoms. Isela seemed to be laughing in response to internal stimuli. Owing to the decline in communication and her apparent preoccupation with visual and auditory internal stimuli, Isela could not be interviewed adequately to confirm that she was experiencing hallucinations, but her laughter seemed to be in response to hallucinations. Isela was diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia with psychosis. Risperidone was prescribed. A psychology evaluation was completed a few months later. Parents noted significant improvement after starting risperidone with reduced inappropriate laughing spells, reduced pacing, as well as improved eating, sleeping, communication, and self-care.

This article reviewed 18 studies testing the effects of language therapy or training in 433 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia. Results showed that 14 studies out of 18 lead to improvements in language and/or speech abilities. Most of these studies comprised pragmatic or expressive discursive skills being the only aim of the therapy or part of it. The therapy settings vary widely ranging from twice daily individual therapy to once weekly group therapy. The therapeutic approach was mainly operant conditioning. Although the evidence tends to show that certain areas of language are treatable through therapy, it remains difficult to state the type of approach that should be favoured and implemented to treat language impairments in schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Three-Year Follow-Up of Insomnia and Hypnotics after Controlled Internet Treatment for Insomnia.", "Abstract": "To investigate the long-term effects of therapist-guided Internet-based insomnia treatment on insomnia severity and sleep medication use, compared with active control.\nThis study was an 8 week randomized controlled trial with follow-up posttreatment and at 6, 12, and 36 months, set at the Internet Psychiatry Clinic, Stockholm, Sweden. Participants were 148 media-recruited nondepressed adults with insomnia.

Primary outcome was insomnia severity, measured with the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary outcomes were sleep medication use and use of other treatments.\nThe large pretreatment to posttreatment improvements in insomnia severity of the ICBT-i group were maintained during follow-up. ICBT-ctrl exhibited significantly less improvement posttreatment (between-Cohen d = 0.85), but after 12 and 36 months, there was no longer a significant difference.

However, how physicians actually conceptualize and manage their power when interacting with patients remains unexamined in the literature. This study explored how power is perceived and exerted in the physician-patient encounter from the perspective of experienced physicians. It is necessary to examine physicians' awareness of power in the context of modern healthcare that espouses values of dialogic, egalitarian, patient centered care.\nThirty physicians with a minimum five years' experience practicing medicine in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Family Medicine were recruited. The authors analyzed semi-structured interview data using LeCompte and Schensul's three stage process: Item analysis, Pattern analysis, and Structural analysis. Theoretical notions from Bourdieu's social theory served as analytic tools for achieving an understanding of physicians' perceptions of power in their interactions with patients.\nThe analysis of data highlighted a range of descriptions and interpretations of relational power. Physicians' responses fell under three broad categories: (1) Perceptions of holding and managing power, (2) Perceptions of power as waning, and (3) Perceptions of power as non-existent or irrelevant.\nAlthough the \"sharing of power\" is an overarching goal of modern patient-centered healthcare, this study highlights how this concept does not fully capture the complex ways experienced physicians perceive, invoke, and redress power in the clinical encounter. Based on the insights, the authors suggest that physicians learn to enact ethical patient-centered therapeutic communication through reflective, effective, and professional use of power in clinical encounters."}, {"Title": "[Suicide in psychiatric hospitals : Results, risk factors and therapeutic measures].", "Abstract": "Suicide prevention is a core responsibility of psychiatry and psychotherapy. Periods of change in psychiatric inpatient treatment concepts are usually also accompanied by an increase in psychopathological behavior and with increased suicide rates in psychiatric hospitals, as seen in the 1970s and 1980s in Germany. That this represented a real increase of inpatient suicides during those years was confirmed and subsequently the number and rate of inpatient suicides has decreased from approximately 280 out of 100,000 admissions of patients in 1980 to approximately 50 in 2014. Death can also occur in psychiatric hospitals and an absolute prevention is not possible even under optimal conditions of therapy and nursing, communication and security. The suicide rate has clearly decreased over the last two decades in relation to admissions. The group of young male schizophrenic patients newly identified as having a high clinical suicide risk has decreased among the suicide victims whereas the percentage of severely depressed patients with delusions has increased. This reduction could be associated with the comprehensive improvements in educational and training programs in the field of suicide and suicide prevention, objectification of coping methods, development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, improvements in therapy and relationship possibilities and a general reduction in the number of suicides in Germany."}, {"Title": "[Guideline-adherent inpatient psychiatric psychotherapeutic treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder : Normative definition of personnel requirements].", "Abstract": "Guideline-oriented inpatient psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an important part of the care available for these patients.

Two recent comparisons suggest higher rates of mental disorders in US and UK military personnel compared with civilians. However, these findings may not apply to other nations. Previous studies have focused on the overall effects of military service rather than the separate effects of military service and deployment. This study compared German military personnel with and without a history of deployment to sociodemographically matched civilians regarding prevalence and severity of 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders.\n1439 deployed soldiers (DS), 779 never deployed soldiers (NS) and 1023 civilians were assessed with an adapted version of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic interview across the same timeframe. Data were weighted using propensity score methodology to assure comparability of the three samples.\nCompared with adjusted civilians, the prevalence of any 12-month disorder was lower in NS (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-0.99) and did not differ in DS. Significant differences between military personnel and civilians regarding prevalence and severity of individual diagnoses were only apparent for alcohol (DS: OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6; NS: OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and nicotine dependence (DS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6; NS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.7) with lower values in both military samples. Elevated rates of panic/agoraphobia (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.3) and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-8.0) were observed in DS with high combat exposure compared with civilians.\nRates and severity of mental disorders in the German military are comparable with civilians for internalising and lower for substance use disorders. A higher risk of some disorders is reduced to DS with high combat exposure. This finding has implications for mental health service provision and the need for targeted interventions. Differences to previous US and UK studies that suggest an overall higher prevalence in military personnel might result from divergent study methods, deployment characteristics, military structures and occupational factors. Some of these factors might yield valuable targets to improve military mental health."}, {"Title": "History of trauma and posttraumatic disorders in literature.", "Abstract": "In 1980 a third edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) brought diagnostic criteria for a new diagnosis - posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

We also analysed the normative aspect of involuntary admissions, i.e. which Articles of the Polish Mental Health Act constituted the basis for these patients admission, and if the choice of articles was justifiable by a diagnosis of the mental disorder.\nThe primary research tool consisted of an original questionnaire allowing for the collection of relevant data. The material was submitted to statistical analysis, using primarily simple percentage methods.\nInvoluntary psychiatric holds constituted 15.8% of the total number of admissions to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology (3,498 persons) in 2012. 522 persons with mental disorders were subject to involuntary admission on emergency basis (292 women and 260 men). Majority of patients was over 40 years old. The number of patients admitted to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology on emergency basis without the consent ranged from 38 to 62 people per month. Season did not differentiate significantly the number of admitted persons, majority of patients was admitted during the day (82%). Among the diagnosed patients, paranoid schizophrenia was the most frequent illness (43%), delirium tremens (7%), bipolar disorders (6%), dementia (5%), other psychotic disorders (5%), paranoid syndrome (5%), schizoaffective disorder (5%), other diagnoses (less than 1%). 4% of admissions to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology were due to attempted suicide. 37% of patients were admitted to the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology under Article 23.1 of the Mental Health Act, 34% under Article 22.2, in accordance with Article 24.1 - only 7% of patients. Invoking Article 28 of the Mental Health Act by doctors referred to 14% of patients admitted without consent.\nInvoluntary psychiatric admissions are common practice not only in Poland but in the world. The structure of involuntary admissions in the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in 2012 did not differ from data from other European countries. However, while quantitative measures describing the phenomenon of involuntary admissions are comparable, knowledge of each country's legal rules in relation to medical conditions is crucial for truly adequate comparisons. From the point of view of the Polish legal system it is essential for doctors, who decide on the admission of the patient against his will, to adequately evaluate the patient's condition in relation to statutory requirements that point to the need of such an admission.

We argue that the complaint of \"thinking a lot\" indicates the presence of a certain causal network of psychopathology that is found across cultures, but that this causal network is localized in profound ways. We show, using a Cambodian example, that examining \"thinking a lot\" in a cultural context is a key way of investigating the local bio-cultural ontology of psychopathology. Among Cambodian refugees, a typical episode of \"thinking a lot\" begins with ruminative-type negative cognitions, in particular worry and depressive thoughts. Next these negative cognitions may induce mental symptoms (e.g., poor concentration, forgetfulness, and \"zoning out\") and somatic symptoms (e.g., migraine headache, migraine-like blurry vision such as scintillating scotomas, dizziness, palpitations). Subsequently the very fact of \"thinking a lot\" and the induced symptoms may give rise to multiple catastrophic cognitions. Soon, as distress escalates, in a kind of looping, other negative cognitions such as trauma memories may be triggered. All these processes are highly shaped by the Cambodian socio-cultural context. The article shows that Cambodian trauma survivors have a locally specific illness reality that centers on dynamic episodes of \"thinking a lot,\" or on what might be called the \"thinking a lot\" causal network."}, {"Title": "Speaking of That: Terms to Avoid or Reconsider in the Eating Disorders Field.", "Abstract": "Inspired by an article on 50 terms that, in the interest of clarity in scientific reasoning and communication in psychology, psychiatry, and allied fields, \"should be avoided or at most be used sparingly and only with explicit caveats,\"(1) we propose a list of terms to avoid or think twice about before using when writing for the International Journal of Eating Disorders (IJED).

Psychedelic psychotherapy typically involves a patient lying with their eyes-closed during peak drug effects, while listening to music and being supervised by trained psychotherapists. In this context, music is considered to be a key element in the therapeutic model; working in synergy with the drug to evoke therapeutically meaningful thoughts, emotions and imagery. The underlying mechanisms involved in this process have, however, never been formally investigated. Here we studied the interaction between LSD and music-listening on eyes-closed imagery by means of a placebo-controlled, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75\u00b5g) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which LSD works in combination with music listening to enhance certain subjective experiences that may be useful in a therapeutic context."}, {"Title": "[Dysmorphic disorder].", "Abstract": "The term \"dysmorphic disorder\" is used in psychiatry to define an obsessive fear of being ugly or deformed.

However, the association between ceramides and neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD remains unclear.\nThis study sought to investigate the association between plasma ceramide levels and multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD.\nA total of 98 patients and 92 cognitively normal controls participated in this study, including 56 with mild AD and 42 with moderate to severe AD. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms. Considering the influences of dementia severity on ceramide levels and neuropsychiatric symptoms, a subgroup analysis was conducted by dementia severity.\nExcept for C24\u200a:\u200a0, all ceramide species were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. After controlling for confounding factors, the C16\u200a:\u200a0 and C20\u200a:\u200a0 levels were positively associated with delusions, and the quartiles of C22\u200a:\u200a0 and C24\u200a:\u200a0 were positively associated with depression. In the subgroup analysis, association between ceramide species and delusions were only observed in mild AD, and the association between ceramides and depression were prominent in moderate to severe AD. In mild AD, after controlling for age, gender, anti-dementia medications, diabetes status, and ApoE \u025b4 status, the C16\u200a:\u200a0, C20\u200a:\u200a0, and quartiles of C24\u200a:\u200a1 were associated with delusions. In moderate to severe AD, depression was associated with C22\u200a:\u200a0 and C24\u200a:\u200a0.\nThere were stage-specific associations between ceramides and neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD.

Screening for perinatal depression alone does not improve treatment rates or patient outcomes. This paper describes the development, implementation and outcomes of a new and low-cost population-based program to help providers address perinatal depression, the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Project (MCPAP) for Moms.\nMCPAP for Moms builds providers' capacity to address perinatal depression through (1) trainings and toolkits on depression screening, assessment and treatment; (2) telephonic access to perinatal psychiatric consultation for providers serving pregnant and postpartum women; and (3) care coordination to link women with individual psychotherapy and support groups.\nIn the first 18months, MCPAP for Moms enrolled 87 Ob/Gyn practices, conducted 100 trainings and served 1123 women. Of telephone consultations provided, 64% were with obstetric providers/midwives and 16% were with psychiatrists. MCPAP for Moms costs $8.38 per perinatal woman per year ($0.70 per month) or $600,000 for 71,618 deliveries annually in Massachusetts.\nThe volume of encounters, number of women served and low cost suggest that MCPAP for Moms is a feasible, acceptable and sustainable approach that can help frontline providers effectively identify and manage perinatal depression."}, {"Title": "The Effectiveness of Parent Training as a Treatment for Preschool Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled, Multicenter Trial of the New Forest Parenting Program in Everyday Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "Parent training is recommended as the first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in preschool children.

There are two treatment arms, NFPP and treatment as usual. NFPP consists of eight individually delivered parenting sessions, where the child attends during three of the sessions. Outcomes are examined at three time points (T1, T2, T3): T1 (baseline), T2 (week 12, post intervention), and T3 (6 month follow/up). 140 children between the ages of 3-7, with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, informed by the Development and Well Being Assessment, and recruited from three child and adolescent psychiatry departments in Denmark will take part. Randomization is on a 1:1 basis, stratified for age and gender.\nThe primary endpoint is change in ADHD symptoms as measured by the Preschool ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) by T2. Secondary outcome measures include: effects on this measure at T3 and T2 and T3 measures of teacher reported Preschool ADHD-RS scores, parent and teacher rated scores on the Strength & Difficulties Questionnaire, direct observation of ADHD behaviors during Child's Solo Play, observation of parent-child interaction, parent sense of competence, and family stress.

As such, insight is fundamental for patients' management, prognosis, and treatment. Not surprisingly, the majority of available data, which have been gathered on schizophrenia, show a relationship between low insight and poorer outcomes. For mood disorders, however, insight is associated with less positive results. For other psychiatric disorders, insight has rarely been investigated. In neurology, the impaired ability to recognize the presence of sensory, perceptual, motor, affective, or cognitive functioning-referred to as anosognosia-has been related to damage of specific brain regions.

Specific features of autism (like obsessive behaviour) are seen frequently (83%), but classical autism was not diagnosed in any. A mild clinical phenotype is associated with a small in-frame 5' deletions, which are often inherited. Deletions and other mutations causing haploinsufficiency of the full-length AUTS2 transcript give a more severe phenotype and occur de novo.\nThe 13 patients with AUTS2 syndrome with unique pathogenic deletions scattered around the AUTS2 locus confirm a phenotype-genotype correlation.

However, it remains difficult to objectively quantify the socio-emotional development of ASD children. To address this problem, we developed a novel analytical method that assesses subjects' complex behaviors using multivariate analysis, 'Behavior Output analysis for Quantitative Emotional State Translation' (BOUQUET). Here, we examine the potential for psycho-cognitive ASD therapy based on comparative evaluations of clinical (human) and experimental (animal) models. Our observations of ASD children (vs. their normally developing siblings) and the domestic chick in socio-sensory deprivation models show the importance of unimodal sensory stimulation, particularly important for tactile- and auditory-biased socialization. Identifying psycho-cognitive elements in early neural development, human newborn infants in neonatal intensive care unit as well as a New World monkey, the common marmoset, also prompted us to focus on the development of voluntary movement against gravity. In summary, striking behavioral similarities between children with ASD and domestic chicks' socio-sensory deprivation models support the role of multimodal sensory-motor integration as a prerequisite step for normal development of socio-emotional and psycho-cognitive functions. Data obtained in the common marmoset model also suggest that switching from primitive anti-gravity reflexes to complex voluntary movement may be a critical milestone for psycho-cognitive development. Combining clinical findings with these animal models, and using multivariate integrative analyses may facilitate the development of effective interventions to improve social functions in infants and in children with neurodevelopmental disorders."}, {"Title": "Striatal dopamine, reward, and decision making in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Elevated striatal dopamine function is one of the best-established findings in schizophrenia.

While within a sample, an increase of diagnostic accuracy of schizophrenia (SZ) with number of subjects (N) has been shown, the relationship between N and accuracy is completely different between studies. Using data from a recent meta-analysis of machine learning (ML) in imaging SZ, we found that while low-N studies can reach 90% and higher accuracy, above N/2\u2009=\u200950 the maximum accuracy achieved steadily drops to below 70% for N/2\u2009>\u2009150. We investigate the role N plays in the wide variability in accuracy results in SZ studies (63-97%). We hypothesize that the underlying cause of the decrease in accuracy with increasing N is sample heterogeneity. While smaller studies more easily include a homogeneous group of subjects (strict inclusion criteria are easily met; subjects live close to study site), larger studies inevitably need to relax the criteria/recruit from large geographic areas. A SZ prediction model based on a heterogeneous group of patients with presumably a heterogeneous pattern of structural or functional brain changes will not be able to capture the whole variety of changes, thus being limited to patterns shared by most patients. In addition to heterogeneity (sample size), we investigate other factors influencing accuracy and introduce a ML effect size. We derive a simple model of how the different factors, such as sample heterogeneity and study setup determine this ML effect size, and explain the variation in prediction accuracies found from the literature, both in cross-validation and independent sample testing. From this, we argue that smaller-N studies may reach high prediction accuracy at the cost of lower generalizability to other samples. Higher-N studies, on the other hand, will have more generalization power, but at the cost of lower accuracy. In conclusion, when comparing results from different ML studies, the sample sizes should be taken into account. To assess the generalizability of the models, validation (by direct application) of the prediction models should be tested in independent samples. The prediction of more complex measures such as outcome, which are expected to have an underlying pattern of more subtle brain abnormalities (lower effect size), will require large samples."}, {"Title": "Useful but Different: Resident Physician Perceptions of Interprofessional Feedback.", "Abstract": "Phenomenon: Based on recently formulated interprofessional core competencies, physicians are expected to incorporate feedback from other healthcare professionals. Based on social identity theory, physicians likely differentiate between feedback from members of their own profession and others. The current study examined residents' experiences with, and perceptions of, interprofessional feedback.\nIn 2013, Anesthesia, Obstetrics-Gynecology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry residents completed a survey including questions about frequency of feedback from different professionals and its perceived value (5-point scale). The authors performed an analysis of variance to examine interactions between residency program and profession of feedback provider. They conducted follow-up interviews with a subset of residents to explore reasons for residents' survey ratings.\nFifty-two percent (131/254) of residents completed the survey, and 15 participated in interviews. Eighty percent of residents reported receiving written feedback from physicians, 26% from nurses, and less than 10% from other professions. There was a significant interaction between residency program and feedback provider profession, F(21, 847) = 3.82, p < .001, and a significant main effect of feedback provider profession, F(7, 847) = 73.7, p < .001. On post hoc analyses, residents from all programs valued feedback from attending physicians higher than feedback from others, and anesthesia residents rated feedback from other professionals significantly lower than other residents. Ten major themes arose from qualitative data analysis, which revealed an overall positive attitude toward interprofessional feedback and clarified reasons behind residents' perceptions and identified barriers.

Over the past several decades, the number, size, and quality of psychopharmacologic studies in youth has greatly increased. Here we review the current evidence for efficacy and safety of each of the major pharmacologic drug classes in youth (psychostimulants, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics). Psychostimulants have a robust body of literature supporting their evidence as first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have documented efficacy for pediatric depression and multiple different anxiety disorders with childhood onset. Combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with SSRI treatment enhances treatment benefit and minimizes adverse events of medication. Mood stabilizers, including lithium and anticonvulsant medications, have a less robust strength of evidence and come with more problematic side effects. However, they are increasingly prescribed to youth, often to treat irritability, mood lability, and aggression, along with treatment of bipolar disorder. Antipsychotics have long been a mainstay of treatment for childhood-onset schizophrenia, and in recent years, the evidence base for providing antipsychotics to youth with bipolar mania and autistic disorder has grown. Most concerning with antipsychotics are the metabolic side effects, which appear even more problematic in youth than adults.

Nowadays, the constructs of organic-induced and substance-induced psychotic disorder show that our diagnostic classification system already reflects, in part, aetiological factors. Most recently, gene copy number variation and autoimmunity have been associated with schizophrenia.

It is well documented that the modulation of the sensory events is not a unique way for achieving pain relief. In addition, pain patients still express dissatisfaction and complain of unwanted effects of the medications, suggesting that alternative approaches for the treatment of neuropathic pain are essential. In psychiatry, pain relief represents relaxation and a feeling of comfort and satisfaction, which suggests that cognitive and emotional motivations are important factors in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The comorbidity of chronic pain and psychiatric disorders, which is well recognized, suggests that the effective therapeutic relief for neuropathic pain induced by SCI can be achieved in conjunction with the management of the sensory and psychiatric aspects of patient.

The systematic review highlighted the tremendous potential of the sensors and has clearly stated that there is a need for further studies evaluating its potential for rehabilitation. Zhang et al. (2015) in their recent article have advocated several reasons as to why biosensors are pertinent for stroke rehabilitation. Of note, recent studies done by the World Health Organization have highlighted that stroke is a growing epidemic. Aside to the utilization of smartphone based sensors for stroke rehabilitation, as proposed by Zhang et al. (2015), researchers have also investigated the use of other low cost alternatives, such as Kinect, to facilitate the rehabilitation of stroke survivors. Whilst it may seemed like that has been quite extensive evaluation of the Kinect sensor for stroke rehabilitation, one core area that bio-engineers and researchers have not looked into is that of the psychiatric and mental health issues that might at times arise following a stroke. It is thus the aim of this letter to address how such a sensor could be tapped upon for psychiatric rehabilitation amongst stroke survivors. To this end, the authors have thus conceptualized a game that could help in the cognitive remediation for stroke survivors using low cost Kinect sensors."}, {"Title": "The abuses of a certain knowledge.", "Abstract": "In the psychiatric institution, the sex act is a matter of controversy, all the more so when elderly patients with dementia are concerned. Yet, a question imposes itself: thinking beyond the biomedical model, the current governing paradigm for explaining senile dementia, what effects does the repression of the sex act have on the symptoms of the demented patient? The psychoanalytic exploration of the institutional situation described here suggests that the sexual demands of the patient suffering from dementia would not be meaningless, but would constitute a defensive modality against the return of a former threat of castration. Their repression, by means of practices that impede the libido in its search of an object, would reinforce the process of dementia by encouraging a regression toward earlier stages of development. More generally, the authors argue that unconscious dynamic processes might play a major role in the development of senile dementia. They show that psychoanalysis constitutes an essential method for the understanding of dementia and challenges the predominance of the biomedical model and its therapeutic arsenal in this context."}, {"Title": "[\ufeffThe origin of a differentiated neuropsychopharmacotherapy for children and adolescents: an analysis of psycho- and neuropharmacology in the 1940s and 50s\ufeff].", "Abstract": "The origin of a differentiated approach to neuropsychopharmacotherapy in children and adolescents can be traced back to the 1940s and 50s. Certain clinical disorders in the range of psychiatry and neurology were treated with a multiplicity of substances.\nWe conducted an exclusive screening of 700 medical records of patients under 18 years of age from a psychiatric university hospital in Jena (from 1942\u20131945) and 89 files of children who attended Tr\u00fcper\u2019s approved school in Jena between 1946 and 1954.\nDifferentiated therapies were administered for ailments such as acute anxiety states, erethism, hyperkinetic syndrome, enuresis, migraine, sleep disturbance, epilepsy, Sydenham\u2019s chorea, spasticity, neuralgia, neuritis, dizziness, pain syndrome, tetany, and syphilis.\nInterventions for mental disorders were relatively unspecific before the development of neuroleptic and antidepressant agents. During this time, multitudes of treatments were implemented for neurovegetative disorders, psychoneuroses, and different kinds of psychopathies. Barbiturates were administered in both pure and mixed forms. Additionally, since mental disorders were frequently caused by physical disorders, they could be eliminated or improved by the use of chemotherapeutics. Other somatic therapies like convulsive shock treatment with camphor and cardiazol, malaria treatments, hypoglycemic shock therapy, and electroconvulsive treatment have been applied in patients with schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Missed diagnosis: The emerging crisis of borderline personality disorder in older people.", "Abstract": "Clinical experience suggests a growing prevalence of borderline personality disorder in aged residential care and psychiatric facilities with attendant difficulties in their management. This paper reviews the literature concerning the prevalence, phenomenology and diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in old age. The aim is to elucidate the phenomenological differences in old age and thus improve identification of the disorder.\nA systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases, employing the search terms including 'personality disorder', 'borderline personality disorder', 'aged care', 'gerontology', 'geriatric psychiatry' and 'life span'. The search included articles in English involving participants 65+ years. Long-term prospective studies of borderline personality disorder, long-term follow-up studies and studies involving older adults from 50+ years were also examined.\nThere is a paucity of literature on borderline personality disorder in the elderly. No diagnostic or rating instruments have been developed for borderline personality disorder in the elderly. The phenomenology of borderline personality disorder in the aged population differs in several respects from that seen in younger adults, causing some of the difficulties in reaching a diagnosis. Escalations of symptoms and maladaptive behaviours usually occur when the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is either not made or delayed. Improved identification of borderline personality disorder in older patients, together with staff education concerning the phenomenology, aetiology and management of these patients, is urgently needed.\nDiagnostic instruments for borderline personality disorder in the elderly need to be developed. In the interim, suggestions are offered concerning patient symptoms and behaviours that could trigger psychiatric assessment and advice concerning management. A screening tool is proposed to assist in the timely diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in older people. Timely identification of these patients is needed so that they can receive the skilled help, understanding and treatment needed to alleviate suffering in the twilight of their lives."}, {"Title": "Obsessive-compulsive adults with and without childhood ADHD symptoms.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently coexist. To understand whether childhood ADHD can increase the risk of OCD in adulthood and whether it influences the phenomenology of OCD, we investigated the symptoms of ADHD during childhood in obsessive-compulsive adults who had never been diagnosed as ADHD. Adults with OCD (n\u00a0=\u00a083) were given the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The prevalence of childhood ADHD symptoms was 40.9\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a034) and that of adult ADHD was 16.9\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a014). Patients with childhood ADHD symptoms had an earlier onset of OCD, higher scores of the BAI and BIS-11. The scores of the Y-BOCS and HDRS-17 did not differ between those having and not having childhood ADHD symptoms. Childhood history of ADHD symptoms is common in adult OCD patients who have never been diagnosed as ADHD. Childhood ADHD symptoms are associated with an earlier age of OCD, more severe anxiety and higher impulsiveness. Even remitted ADHD may be a risk factor for OCD in later life."}, {"Title": "From Surviving to Advising: A Novel Course Pairing Mental Health and Addictions Service Users as Advisors to Senior Psychiatry Residents.", "Abstract": "The authors describe a novel course that pairs service users as advisors to senior psychiatry residents with the goals of improving the residents' understanding of recovery, reducing negative stereotypes about people in recovery, and empowering the service users who participated.\nService users who had experience working as peer support workers and/or system advocates were selected for a broad and deep understanding of recovery and an ability to engage learners in constructive dialogue. They met monthly with resident advisees over a period of 6\u00a0months. They were supported with monthly group supervision meetings and were paid an honorarium. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative feedback from the first two cohorts of the course, comprising 34 pairs, are reported here.\nThe first cohort of residents responded with a wide range of global ratings and reactions. In response to their suggestions, changes were made to the structure of the course to create opportunities for small group learning and reflective writing and to protect time for residents to participate. The second cohort of residents and both cohorts of service users gave acceptably high global ratings. Residents in the second cohort described gaining a number of benefits from the course, including an enhanced understanding of the lived experience of recovery and a greater sense of shared humanity with service users. Advisors described an appreciation for being part of something that has the potential for changing the practice of psychiatry and enhancing the lives of their peers.\nPositioning service users as advisors to psychiatry residents holds promise as a powerful way of reducing distance between future psychiatrists and service users and facilitating system reform toward person-centered recovery-oriented care."}, {"Title": "Two-year follow-up of a Chinese sample at clinical high risk for psychosis: timeline of symptoms, help-seeking and conversion.", "Abstract": "Chinese psychiatrists have gradually started to focus on those who are deemed to be at 'clinical high-risk (CHR)' for psychosis; however, it is still unknown how often those individuals identified as CHR from a different country background than previously studied would transition to psychosis. The objectives of this study are to examine baseline characteristics and the timing of symptom onset, help-seeking, or transition to psychosis over a 2-year period in China.\nThe presence of CHR was determined with the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) at the participants' first visit to the mental health services. A total of 86 (of 117) CHR participants completed the clinical follow-up of at least 2 years (73.5%). Conversion was determined using the criteria of presence of psychotic symptoms (in SIPS). Analyses examined baseline demographic and clinical predictors of psychosis and trajectory of symptoms over time. Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) methods along with Log-rank tests were performed to illustrate the relationship of baseline data to either conversion or non-conversion over time. Cox regression was performed to identify baseline predictors of conversion by the 2-year follow-up.\nIn total 25 (29.1%) of 86 completers transitioned to a psychotic disorder over the course of follow-up. Among the CHR sample, the mean time between attenuated symptom onset and professional help-seeking was about 4 months on average, and converters developed fully psychotic symptoms about 12 months after symptom onset. Compared with those CHR participants whose risk syndromes remitted over the course of the study, converters had significantly longer delays (p = 0.029) for their first visit to a professional in search of help. At baseline assessment, the conversion subgroup was younger, had poorer functioning, higher total SIPS positive symptom scores, longer duration of untreated prodromal symptoms, and were more often given psychosis-related diagnoses and subsequently prescribed antipsychotics in the clinic.\nChinese CHR identified primarily by a novel clinical screening approach had a 2-year transition rate comparable with those of specialised help-seeking samples world-wide. Early clinical intervention with this functionally deteriorating clinical population who are suffering from attenuated psychotic symptoms, is a next step in applying the CHR construct in China."}, {"Title": "Inpatient forensic-psychiatric care: Legal frameworks and service provision in three European countries.", "Abstract": "Laws governing the detention and treatment of mentally disordered offenders (MDOs) vary widely across Europe, yet little information is available about the features of these laws and their comparative advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this article is to compare the legal framework governing detention in forensic psychiatric care in three European countries with long-established services for MDOs, England, Germany and the Netherlands. A literature review was conducted alongside consultation with experts from each country. We found that the three countries differ in several areas, including criteria for admission, review of detention, discharge process, the concept of criminal responsibility, service provision and treatment philosophy. Our findings suggest a profound difference in how each country relates to MDOs, with each approach contributing to different pathways and potentially different outcomes for the individual. Hopefully making these comparisons will stimulate debate and knowledge exchange on an international level to aid future research and the development of best practice in managing this population."}, {"Title": "A long-term noninterventional safety study of adjunctive lacosamide therapy in patients with epilepsy and uncontrolled partial-onset seizures.", "Abstract": "This noninterventional, observational, postauthorization safety study (SP0942, NCT00771927) evaluated the incidence of predefined cardiovascular- (CV) and psychiatric-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), in patients with epilepsy and uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, when initiating adjunctive therapy with lacosamide or another approved antiepileptic drug (AED) according to standard medical practice. Active recording of predefined TEAEs of interest took place at three-monthly recommended visits for up to 12months. Of 1004 patients who received at least one dose of adjunctive AEDs, 511 initially added lacosamide therapy, 493 added another AED, 69 were \u226565years of age, and 72 took concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients in the lacosamide cohort had a higher median frequency of partial-onset seizures (6.0 versus 3.5 per 28days) despite taking more concomitant AEDs (84.9% versus 66.9% took \u22652) at baseline. Patients who added lacosamide took a modal dose of 200mg/day over the treatment period (n=501), and 50.1% (256/511) completed 12months of treatment. Fifty-one point nine percent (256/493) of patients who added another AED completed the study, with the most commonly added AED being levetiracetam (28.4%). Four patients (0.8%) in each cohort, all <65years of age, reported predefined CV-related TEAEs. None were considered serious or led to discontinuation. One event each of sinus bradycardia (lacosamide), atrioventricular block first degree (lacosamide), and syncope (other AED) were judged to be treatment-related. Another patient in the other AED cohort reported bradycardia while taking concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs. Predefined psychiatric-related TEAEs were reported by 21 patients (4.1%) in the lacosamide cohort and 27 patients (5.5%) in the other AED cohort. Depression was the most common to be treatment-related (7/11 and 12/18 of patients reporting treatment-related psychiatric TEAEs, respectively). Serious psychiatric-related TEAEs were reported by four patients who added lacosamide (two cases of depression, two of suicide attempt) and one who added another AED (depression). Seven deaths occurred, all of which were considered unrelated/unlikely related to study medication. This thorough evaluation revealed a low incidence of predefined CV- and psychiatric-related TEAEs in patients taking adjunctive AED therapy according to standard medical practice.

However, there exists an absence of information on efficacy, side effects, accessibility and prescription practices of psychotropic medication utilization from the viewpoint of the practitioners who are primarily involved in prescribing, dispensing and administering these medications.\nQualitative study composed of semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty three (23) participants from Accra psychiatry, Pantang and Ankaful hospitals. These were fifteen (15) nurses, six (6) clinicians and two (2) pharmacists. All interviews were recorded digitally and analyzed thematically.\nThe commonly prescribed psychotropic medications were grouped into four classes.

The aim of this study was to investigate 4th term nursing students' opinions on the use of Virtual Patients for assessment in a Mental Health and Ill-health course module. We asked 24 volunteering students to practise with five different VP cases during almost 10 weeks before the exam. The participants were gathered together for participating in a written and an oral evaluation. The students were positive to the use of VPs in psychiatry and were very positive to use VPs in their continued nursing education. It seems that Virtual Patients can be an activity producing pedagogic model promoting students' independent knowledge development, critical thinking, reflection and problem solving ability for nurse students in psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Counterpoint: clinical neuroscience is not ready for clinical use.", "Abstract": "Radical proposals are being made to change the practice, teaching and research basis of psychiatry to that of clinical neuroscience.

After September 11, 2001, the French forces participated in a multinational force deployed in Afghanistan to fight against terrorism. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) became a priority. We report the daily work of the psychiatrists involved in this mission and the organization developed to psychologically support wounded military personnel. The doctrine of early intervention psychiatrization and the technique of collective debriefing are the key points of this procedure. The psychiatrist is also responsible for the healthcare community, particularly vulnerable when confronted with severe ballistic injuries. One aim of this organization is also to screen PTSD in soldiers returning from Afghanistan. The military general practitioner is a pivotal point of this procedure built to detect PTSD, anxiety, depressive reaction and behavioral problems. The French health service has developed a genuine care strategy aimed at identifying patients, accompanying them in the formalities for recognition and compensation, and offering them treatment locally by arranging clinical psychology consultations near their home."}, {"Title": "Exploring and explaining involuntary care: The relationship between psychiatric admission status, gender and other demographic and clinical variables.", "Abstract": "Involuntary admission and treatment are features of psychiatric care in many countries, but the relationship between involuntary status and gender (among other factors) is not clear. We examined demographic and diagnostic factors associated with involuntary admission in a general adult psychiatry service in a deprived area of Dublin's north inner-city over a 7-year period (2008 to 2014 inclusive). Over this period, there were 1099 admissions, yielding an annual admission rate of 504.8 admissions per 100,000 population per year. When adjusted for deprivation, this rate (387.7) was lower than the national rate (413.9). Consistent with other inner-city areas in Dublin, 14.1% of admissions were involuntary, yielding an involuntary admission rate of 71.2 per 100,000 population per year (deprivation-adjusted rate: 54.8), which is higher than the national rate (39.4). After controlling for age, occupation, marital status and diagnosis, the only independent predictors of admission status were place of origin (p<0.001) and male gender (p=0.001). These findings are consistent with studies showing associations between male gender and involuntary status in the United States, New Zealand, Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, France, and Luxembourg. In contrast, female gender is associated with involuntary status in Switzerland, Brazil, and China. These cross-national differences are likely related to differing legal traditions and different criteria for involuntary admission, possibly related to varying emphases placed on \"dangerousness\" as a mandatory criterion for involuntary hospitalization. This merits further, cross-national study."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric disorders in persons aged 60 years or older treated as inpatients ou outpatients in hospitals in Togo: epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic aspects.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe the social, demographic, and clinical profile of inpatients and outpatients 60 years or older treated for psychiatric disorders.

It is necessary to find enough patients to take part in a clinical trial so that the results of the trial are reliable. The NIHR Mental Health BRC (here after abbreviated to BRC) is a centre for research in London which seeks to find out better ways to treat patients with mental health difficulties. The BRC has experienced problems trying to find sufficient numbers of patients to participate in its clinical trials as it appears that insufficient patients were being told by their doctor about opportunities to participate in clinical research. In order to help the BRC find enough patients to volunteer to take part in its clinical trials, the author (a patient representative) of this article and a clinical researcher in the nearby Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) decided to work together to try to find the best way to let patients know more about what clinical trials are, what it is like to take part in them and which clinical trials are seeking patients to take part. The author and researcher used a report by the Association of Medical Research Charities (AMRC) on patient difficulties in finding clinical trials to take part in, and the recommendations it made, to guide them in building a website to give such patients the information on clinical trials they wanted (including clinical trials run by the BRC). The author and researcher also asked patients, carers, staff at the IoPPN and BRC what they thought of the website and how to make it better. They used the ideas, suggestions and criticisms to improve the website. The author and researcher also asked mental health charities and research organisations if they would advertise the final version of this website on their own websites; many said yes, they would. The manager of the BRC on reviewing the website, agreed that a final version of the website with the NIHR Mental Health BRC logo would be paid for and will form part of a new main website for the BRC in early 2016.\nPublic & patient recruitment to clinical trials is viewed as one of the main barriers to the implementation of clinical trials. This difficulty is often attributed to the working culture of the NHS, rapid turnover of staff and patients and poor-gatekeeping in referring patients to suitable clinical trials.

The nature of the intervention was educational, for third year undergraduate nursing students. The core intervention included lectures on mental illness, encounters with people coping with mental illness, simulations, and a film on coping with mental illness. Behavioral intention to work with mentally ill patients and three dimensions of nursing students' attitudes (perceived functional characteristics, perceived danger, and value diminution of mentally ill patients) were measured before and after the intervention. The post-intervention impact of the intervention on participants' attitudes and behavioral intention was measured.\nOne hundred and one undergraduate third year nursing students studying at four nursing schools in Israel participated in the study. The planned intervention improved the students' attitudes towards mentally ill patients but did not improve their intention of working with them. Post-intervention, older and less religious students had more intention to work with mentally ill patients. Moreover, older and Jewish students held better attitudes towards the functional characteristics of mentally ill patients. Being older was also correlated with the perception of mentally ill patients as less dangerous and male students ascribed to them more value diminution.\nStudents' attitudes towards mentally ill patients and their behavioral intention to work in the psychiatry field should be addressed during the initial training and in continuing education.

The practice of psychiatry is affected by ideologically driven policies by politicians, and the continuing long-lasting impact of the global economic downturn along with new developments in health care delivery. Changing biological factors include better understanding of brain structures and functioning and potential developments in psychopharmacogenomics. Social changes facing psychiatry include globalisation and rapid urbanisation. Psychological changes include therapies without therapists and the impact of social media and the information age. The current paper explores these challenges and the opportunities for psychiatrists to provide leadership in a number of settings.\nLeadership skills are essential skills for psychiatrists, and enable an individual to plan and deliver services, and also help them to lead not only clinical teams but organisations and institutions. Psychiatrists are best placed because of the breadth of the training they undergo and their communication skills.

While family carers are essential to the well-being and quality of life of older adults with mental illness, they frequently experience marginalisation from clinicians.\nAn interpretative phenomenological analysis approach was used to inform data collection and analysis.\nIndividual, semistructured, audio-recorded qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 primary carers.\nTwo themes were abstracted from the data highlighting carers' contrasting satisfaction with, and delivery of culturally competent care by, clinicians. A third theme, strategies for enhancing carers' experience of care, incorporated carers' suggestions about ways to strengthen their experience of caring.\nAlthough some primary carers had favourable experiences with clinicians, most were dissatisfied and this, in turn, clouded their overall experience of caring.\nOur findings have implications for the provision of education, ongoing support for, and building the cultural competence of, clinicians about working with carers.

This article describes a series of studies to validate a novel hybrid computational approach--the Complex Systems-Causal Network (CS-CN) method-designed to integrate causal discovery within a complex systems framework for psychiatric research. The CS-CN method was first applied to an existing dataset on psychopathology in 163 children hospitalized with injuries (validation study). Next, it was applied to a much larger dataset of traumatized children (replication study). Finally, the CS-CN method was applied in a controlled experiment using a 'gold standard' dataset for causal discovery and compared with other methods for accurately detecting causal variables (resimulation controlled experiment). The CS-CN method successfully detected a causal network of 111 variables and 167 bivariate relations in the initial validation study. This causal network had well-defined adaptive properties and a set of variables was found that disproportionally contributed to these properties. Modeling the removal of these variables resulted in significant loss of adaptive properties. The CS-CN method was successfully applied in the replication study and performed better than traditional statistical methods, and similarly to state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms in the causal detection experiment. The CS-CN method was validated, replicated, and yielded both novel and previously validated findings related to risk factors and potential treatments of psychiatric disorders. The novel approach yields both fine-grain (micro) and high-level (macro) insights and thus represents a promising approach for complex systems-oriented research in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that consists of applying a weak electric current over the scalp to modulate cortical excitability. tDCS has been extensively investigated in adults with psychiatric disorders.

The technique was well tolerated, with no reports of serious side effects.\nPreliminary research suggests that tDCS may be well tolerated and safe for children and adolescents with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Nevertheless, because the literature regarding tDCS in child and adolescent psychiatry is scarce and there exist limited numbers of randomized controlled trials, it is not possible to draw definite conclusions.

The patients had an untreated major depressive episode and no inflammatory medical conditions; they were recruited in the psychiatry outpatient clinic in Razi hospital - Tunisia over an eight-month period ranging from May to December 2012. We examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and both groups had an inflammatory balance including: high sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, serum protein electrophoresis, haptoglobin and orosomucoid. A standardized inflammatory protein profile for age and sex was performed.\nHigh sensitive C-reactive protein levels did not differ significantly between patients with depression and controls. The assay results of Interleukin 6 in our study showed higher values in patients with depression than in controls (p=0.024). Albumin was found to be increased in patients with depression (p<0.001). The dosage of the alpha-1-globulin including the orosomucoid and of the alpha-2-globulin including haptoglobin, showed that patients with depression had higher values than controls (p<0.001). The inflammatory protein profile (which consists of a synthesis of three inflammatory proteins: high sensitive C-reactive protein, haptoglobin and orosomuco\u03cad) showed a trend towards higher levels of inflammation among patients with depression than among controls.\nThe relatively small number of subjects decreased the statistical power and the cross-sectional setting does not allow us to draw any conclusions about cause-to-effect relationships. Although we tried to exclude people with current infections, a small percentage of subjects may have had subclinical infections. The Body Mass Index, a parameter that might affect the levels of the investigated inflammatory markers, was not measured.\nThe existence of inflammation in depression has been proven by the results of four meta-analyses and over a hundred studies.

Statistical analysis was done by correlational analysis using Pearson's coefficient (r) and the t-student test for categorical variables.\nAn occupational health risk (red flag) was found for residents in the \"Cognitive demands\" dimension of COPSOQ and a health risk (red flag) in the \"Work influence\" dimension for the female Anaesthesiology sub-group. A possible risk (yellow flag) was found in 17 dimensions. Results also showed moderate correlations between various COPSOQ dimensions and the emergency department workload, workload, home study, number of children, year of training and the medical specialty variables.\nThese results suggest that residents have a health risk which derives from the cognitive demands of their work and that it increases with the workload.\u00a0 This implicates the need for occupational health measures to be taken to manage and reduce these psychological risks."}, {"Title": "Tapping onto the Potential of Smartphone Applications for Psycho-Education and Early Intervention in Addictions.", "Abstract": "E-health, and in particular smartphone-based technology, is increasingly becoming commonplace in healthcare. While psychiatry has tapped onto these innovations for conditions, such as affective disorders, and schizophrenia and psychosis, the usage of these technologies in addiction is limited. Addiction psychiatry could harness the potential of smartphone technologies. Given the increasing incidences of substance-related problems globally, and along with the normalization of the general public's perspectives toward substances, and also in consideration of unwillingness for at-risk individuals in seeking help, the authors hope to illustrate how these issues could potentially be solved using E-health and technological innovations. The objectives of the current perspective article are to illustrate how recent advances in smartphone-based technologies could help in terms of psycho-education, as well as in helping individuals who are at-risk users in seeking help earlier. The authors aim to illustrate how the above are possible, building on existing theory-driven framework that has been extensively reviewed in the previous literature.

The distinction between syndromal and nonsyndromal forms of ID is of great clinical importance, but the boundary between these clinical entities is difficult to ascertain for many genes of interest. ID is more common in men than in women, but the genetic explanation of this sex asymmetry is incompletely understood. This Review systematically examines the reported cases of X-linked ID caused by de novo loss-of-function mutations in the gene IQSEC2. This gene is largely known as a cause of X-linked nonsyndromal ID in male patients. However, depending on the severity of the mutation, the phenotypic spectrum of IQSEC2-related ID can range from the classic X-linked nonsyndromal form of the disease to a severe syndrome that has been reported in the context of de novo mutations only, in both male and female patients. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that truncation of the longer of the two protein isoforms of the gene can be sufficient to lead to the syndrome, which may be caused by the disruption of cell signaling and signal transduction pathways. The clinical features of the syndrome converge on a pattern of global developmental delay, deficits in social communication, stereotypical hand movements, and hypotonia. In addition, many if not all of these patients have seizures, microcephaly, and language regression in addition to delay. We argue that it is clinically appropriate to test for IQSEC2 mutations in male and female patients with this symptom profile but without a known genetic mutation."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetic Testing: Application in Mental Health Prescribing.", "Abstract": "Despite extensive scholastic and professional training, medication management in psychiatry is often relegated to trial-and-error prescribing.

Data collected included demographic characteristics, referral characteristics, Charlson Comorbidity Index to measure medical comorbidity severity, psychiatric diagnoses, type of psychiatric intervention, and time variables, namely TTR and LOS. We modeled the relationship LOS and TTR after adjusting for Charlson Index using a 3-component finite mixture of exponential regression models.\nA total of 814 patients were included. The median LOS was 12 days (interquartile range : 4-28 days). Median TTR was 3 days (interquartile range: 1,9), and median Charlson Index was 5 (interquartile range 3,6). Bivariate analysis indicated a strong positive correlation among LOS and TTR (Spearman correlation: 0.77, p < 0.0001) and Charlson Index(Spearman correlation: 0.34, p < 0.0001), respectively. After controlling for Charlson Index, we observe that TTR was significantly associated with LOS in each of the 3 components of the mixture of exponential regression models. Persons with longer TTR have longer expected LOS. Graphical summaries suggest that the mixture of exponential regression model provides a good fit to these LOS response data.\nPatients with longer TTR had significantly longer LOS.

The results are presented in two main categories: (1) getting to know the person behind the illness and (2) making a difference.\nCare in forensic psychiatry needs to shift towards a more long-term view of the role of nursing, focusing less on the traditional and stereotypical identity of the productive nurse and more on the care given when nurses slow down and take the time to see the patients as individuals. Establishing trusting relationships with patients in forensic psychiatric settings is viewed as a less oppressive way to control patients and guide them in directions that are preferable for the nurses and for the society.\nNurses may use simple strategies in their daily practice such as sitting on the sofa with patients to establish trust.

The relation between constructs and indicator variables in models with categorical and continuous latent variables is discussed, as are techniques specifically designed to address the distinction between latent categories as opposed to continua (taxometrics). In addition, we examine latent variable models that allow latent structures to have both continuous and categorical characteristics, such as factor mixture models and grade-of-membership models. Finally, we discuss recent alternative approaches based on network analysis and dynamical systems theory, which entail that the structure of constructs may be continuous for some individuals but categorical for others. Our evaluation of the psychometric literature shows that the kinds-continua distinction is considerably more subtle than is often presupposed in research; in particular, the hypotheses of kinds and continua are not mutually exclusive or exhaustive. We discuss opportunities to go beyond current research on the issue by using dynamical systems models, intra-individual time series and experimental manipulations."}, {"Title": "Nonepileptic seizures: an updated review.", "Abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are a functional neurological disorder/conversion disorder subtype, which are neurobehavioral conditions at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. Significant advancements over the past decade have been made in the diagnosis, management, and neurobiological understanding of PNES. This article reviews published PNES research focusing on semiologic features that distinguish PNES from epileptic seizures, consensus diagnostic criteria, the intersection of PNES and other comorbidities, neurobiological studies, evidence-based treatment interventions, and outcome studies. Epidemiology and healthcare utilization studies highlight a continued unmet medical need in the comprehensive care of PNES. Consensus guidelines for diagnostic certainty are based on clinical history, semiology of witnessed typical event(s), and EEG findings. While certain semiologic features may aid in the diagnosis of PNES, the gold standard remains capturing a typical event on video electroencephalography (EEG) showing the absence of epileptiform activity with history and semiology consistent with PNES. Medical-neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in PNES; these should be assessed in diagnostic evaluations and integrated into treatment interventions and prognostic considerations. Several studies, including a pilot, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, have now demonstrated that a cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for PNES, and additional efforts are necessary to evaluate the utility of pharmacologic and other psychotherapy treatments. Neuroimaging studies, while requiring replication, suggest that PNES may occur in the context of alterations within and across sensorimotor, emotion regulation/processing, cognitive control, and multimodal integration brain systems. Future research could investigate similarities and differences between PNES and other somatic symptom disorders."}, {"Title": "The role of GSK-3 in treatment-resistant depression and links with the pharmacological effects of lithium and ketamine: A review of the literature.", "Abstract": "Since the discovery of antidepressants, new treatments have emerged with fewer side effects but no greater efficacy. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 \u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), a kinase known for its activity on glycogen synthesis, has in the last few years raised growing interest in biological psychiatry. Several efficient treatments in major depression have an inhibitory effect on this kinase, which could be targeted in new mood disorder treatments.\nThe aim of this review is to summarize findings concerning the intracellular pharmacologic effects of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors on mood. After a brief description of the intracellular transduction pathways implicated in both GSK-3\u03b2 and mood disorders, we reviewed the results demonstrating GSK-3\u03b2 involvement in the effects of lithium and ketamine.\nGSK-3\u03b2 can be inhibited through several mechanisms such as serine phosphorylation or binding in a proteic scaffold and others. Its inhibition is implicated in numerous cellular pathways of interest involved in neuronal growth and architecture, cell survival, neurogenesis or synaptic plasticity. This inhibition appears to be both efficient and sufficient in improving mood in animal models. In human beings, several levels of evidence show GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition with antidepressant use. Crucially, strong inhibition has been shown with lithium via the proteic scaffold PP2A/\u03b2-arrestin/AKT, and with the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine via p70S6K.\nOur review focuses on mechanisms whereby the GSK-3\u03b2 pathway has a part in the antidepressant effect of lithium and ketamine.

In particular, the disciplines and professions concerned with the human mind, brain, and behavior (\"the psy-ences\") were strongly affected by sociopolitical changes spanning the state-socialist and postsocialist periods. These disciplines' relationship to the state, their modes of knowledge production, and the epistemic order and subjectivities they contributed to have all undergone dramatic ruptures. In this essay, we trace the literature on these issues across three thematic domains: (a) history and memory; (b) the reform of psychiatry in an era of global mental health; and (c) therapy and self-fashioning. We argue for a closer articulation between the social science and historical literature on socialism and its \"posts\" and the literature among anthropologists, sociologists, and historians on the sciences of the mind and brain, and we suggest that each of these literatures helps to critically open up and enrich the other."}, {"Title": "Can microteaching be used for teaching postgraduate psychiatry residents in a small group?", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using microteaching for teaching postgraduate psychiatry residents in a small-group setting.\nTwelve postgraduate psychiatry residents attending the tutorial program were employed as study participants.

It is unknown whether pharmacists can improve medication safety through targeted monitoring of at risk populations. Access Community Health Centers implemented a quality improvement pilot project that included pharmacists on an integrated care team to provide medication reviews for patients. Aims were to determine whether inclusion of a pharmacist performing medication reviews within a primary care behavioral health (PCBH) practice is feasible and facilitates safe medication use.\nPharmacists performed medication reviews of the electronic health record for patients referred for psychiatry consultation. Reviews were performed 1-3 months following consultation and focused on medications with known suboptimal monitoring rates. Reviews were documented within the EHR and routed to the primary care provider. Primary outcome measures were change in percentage up-to-date on monitoring and AIMS assessment, and at risk of experiencing drug interaction(s) between baseline and 3 months postreview. Secondary outcome was provider opinion of medication reviews collected via electronic survey.\nReviews were performed for 144 patients. Three months postreview, percentage up-to-date on recommended monitoring increased 18% (p = .0001), at risk for drug interaction decreased 20% (p < .0001), and up-to-date on AIMS decreased 12% (p = .2113). The majority of surveyed providers wanted medication reviews to continue.\nPharmacist population-level monitoring within an integrated care team is feasible and associated with improved safety monitoring of psychotropic medications.

Our main continuous outcome was 'decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >10 mL/min/1.73 m(2)' over 5-year follow-up. Hypernatremia and acute kidney injury (AKI) were secondary outcomes. Whether baseline USG <1.010 predicted outcomes was assessed in bivariate and multivariate analyses.\nUSG <1.010 predicted hypernatremia episodes (sodium concentration \u2265150 mmol/L-28.1 versus 12%, \u03c7(2) = 4.7, P = 0.03). USG <1.010 [odds ratio 2.36 (95% confidence interval 0.93-6.0), P = 0.07], baseline eGFR and typical antipsychotic use independently predicted decrease in eGFR >10 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

It is now becoming clear how biological factors are contributing to development of an illness in the face of a number of psychosocial factors. Resilience is a psychobiological factor which determines individual's response to adverse life events. Resilience is a human capacity to adapt swiftly and successfully to stressful/traumatic events and manage to revert to a positive state. It is fundamental for growth of positive psychology which deals with satisfaction, adaptability, contentment, and optimism in people's life. Of late, there has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of resilience in context of stress risk vulnerability dimension. It is a neurobiological construct with significant neurobehavioral and emotional features which plays important role in deconstructing mechanism of biopsychosocial model of mental disorders. Resilience is a protective factor against development of mental disorder and a risk factor for a number of clinical conditions, e.g. suicide. Available information from scientific studies points out that resilience is modifiable factor which opens up avenues for a number of newer psychosocial as well as biological therapies. Early identification of vulnerable candidates and effectiveness of resilience-based intervention may offer more clarity in possibility of prevention.

The current studies examined the hypothesis that one aspect of the capability for suicide-fearlessness of the pain involved in dying-would amplify the positive association between current suicide ideation and a previous suicide attempt in two samples at high risk for experiencing suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Study 1 examined this relation using self-report methods in a sample of adults entering treatment in a mental health outpatient clinic. Study 2 utilized similar methods in a sample of adults admitted to inpatient psychiatry. Both studies indicated that those individuals who reported suicide ideation were more likely than non-ideators to report having attempted suicide only if they also reported greater fearlessness of the pain involved in dying.

Despite the effectiveness of serotonergic compounds in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment-resistant symptoms remaining in 40 to 60 % of patients present a pressing clinical problem. There are currently no medications that effectively treat the core impairments of autism spectrum disorder. There is an urgent need for the development of conceptually novel pharmacological strategies. Agents targeting glutamate neurotransmission, such as memantine, represent promising candidates.

Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia in a number of countries.\nThis 12-week study has an add-on, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design of treatment with memantine, including an up-titration phase (forced flexible dose design, 5-15 mg/day), in patients aged 6-17 years and 9 months with obsessive-compulsive disorder or autism spectrum disorder. It is planned to include patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 50) or autism spectrum disorder (N = 50) across four centres in three European countries. Patients will be randomly assigned to memantine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Primary objectives are the investigation of the effectiveness of memantine in paediatric patients for improving symptoms of compulsivity (primary outcome measure: total score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale) and to explore its tolerability and safety. Secondary objectives are to explore the effects of memantine at the level of structure, function and biochemistry of the fronto-striatal circuits, and to collect blood for genetic analyses and biomarkers. Tertiary objectives are to explore the role of new candidate genes and pathways for compulsivity by linking genes to clinical phenotypes, response to treatment, neurocognitive test performance, and key structural and functional neuroimaging measures of the fronto-striatal circuits and to explore biomarkers/proteomics for compulsivity traits.\nThis study is part of the large, translational project TACTICS ( http://www.tactics-project.eu/ ) that is funded by the European Union and investigates the neural, genetic and molecular factors involved in the pathogenesis of compulsivity.

Its active agents are \u03b2-carboline and tryptamine derivatives. As a sacrament, ayahuasca is still a central element of many healing ceremonies in the Amazon Basin and its ritual consumption has become common among the mestizo populations of South America. Ayahuasca use amongst the indigenous people of the Amazon is a form of traditional medicine and cultural psychiatry. During the last two decades, the substance has become increasingly known among both scientists and laymen, and currently its use is spreading all over in the Western world. In the present paper we describe the chief characteristics of ayahuasca, discuss important questions raised about its use, and provide an overview of the scientific research supporting its potential therapeutic benefits. A growing number of studies indicate that the psychotherapeutic potential of ayahuasca is based mostly on the strong serotonergic effects, whereas the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) agonist effect of its active ingredient dimethyltryptamine raises the possibility that the ethnomedical observations on the diversity of treated conditions can be scientifically verified. Moreover, in the right therapeutic or ritual setting with proper preparation and mindset of the user, followed by subsequent integration of the experience, ayahuasca has proven effective in the treatment of substance dependence. This article has two important take-home messages: (1) the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca are best understood from a bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model, and (2) on the biological level ayahuasca may act against chronic low grade inflammation and oxidative stress via the Sig-1R which can explain its widespread therapeutic indications."}, {"Title": "All in My Head: Beckett, Schizophrenia and the Self.", "Abstract": "This article will explore the representation of certain mental and somatic phenomena in Beckett's trilogy of novels Molloy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable, exploring how his understanding of schizophrenia and psychosis informs his representation of the relationship between mind and body. It will also examine recent phenomenological and philosophical accounts of schizophrenia (Louis Sass, Josef Parnas, Shaun Gallagher) that see the condition as a disorder of selfhood and concentrate in it on the disruption to ipseity, a fundamental and pre-reflective awareness of self that leads to a loss of 'grip' (in the term of Merleau-Ponty) on concepts and percepts. Beckett's writing might, it is argued, make such disruptions more tangible and intelligible. The article will also consider John Campbell's argument that immunity of the first person to error-Sydney Shoemaker's foundational philosophical idea that we cannot misspeak the first person pronoun-is revoked in states of psychosis, and relate such states to the moments in Beckett's writing where this immunity is challenged, and quasi-psychotic experiences represented."}, {"Title": "DSM-5 Criteria and Its Implications for Diagnosing PTSD in Military Service Members and Veterans.", "Abstract": "This review addresses how changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria has the potential to affect the care and careers of those who have served in the military, where the diagnosis often determines fitness for duty and veterans' benefits. PTSD criteria changes were intended to integrate new knowledge acquired since previous DSM editions. Many believe the changes will improve diagnosis and treatment, but some worry these could have negative clinical, occupational, and legal consequences. We analyze the changes in classification, trauma definition, symptoms, symptom clusters, and subtypes and possible impacts on the military (e.g., over- and under-diagnosis, \"drone\" video exposure, subthreshold PTSD, and secondary PTSD). We also discuss critiques and proposals for future changes. Our objectives are to improve the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of those service members who have survived trauma and to improve policies related to the military mental healthcare and disability systems."}, {"Title": "The relationship between assessment methods and self-directed learning readiness in medical education.", "Abstract": "This research explored the assessment of self-directed learning readiness within the comprehensive evaluation of medical students' knowledge and skills and the extent to which several variables predicted participants' self-directed learning readiness prior to their graduation.\nFive metrics for evaluating medical students were considered in a multiple regression analysis. Fourth-year medical students at a competitive US medical school received an informed consent and an online survey. Participants voluntarily completed a self-directed learning readiness scale that assessed four subsets of self-directed learning readiness and consented to the release of their academic records.\nThe assortment of metrics considered in this study only vaguely captured students' self-directedness. The strongest predictors were faculty evaluations of students' performance on clerkship rotations. Specific clerkship grades were mildly predictive of three subscales. The Pediatrics clerkship modestly predicted critical self-evaluation (r=-.30, p=.01) and the Psychiatry clerkship mildly predicted learning self-efficacy (r =-.30, p=.01), while the Junior Surgery clerkship nominally correlated with participants' effective organization for learning (r=.21, p=.05). Other metrics examined did not contribute to predicting participants' readiness for self-directed learning.\nGiven individual differences among participants for the variables considered, no combination of students' grades and/or test scores overwhelmingly predicted their aptitude for self-directed learning. Considering the importance of fostering medical students' self-directed learning skills, schools need a reliable and pragmatic approach to measure them. This data analysis, however, offered no clear-cut way of documenting students' self-directed learning readiness based on the evaluation metrics included."}, {"Title": "The phenomenological method in qualitative psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article will closely examine the phenomenological method as applied to qualitative inquiry in psychology and psychiatry.

Our aim was to define frequency and character of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders among patients with probable and definite bvFTD compared to possible bvFTD, other neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric diagnoses, using MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We additionally compared psychiatric prodromes between these groups. Subjects were participants of the late-onset frontal lobe (LOF) study, a longitudinal multicenter study. In each patient, after baseline diagnostic procedure, a neurologist and geriatric psychiatrist made a joint clinical diagnosis. Independently, a structured diagnostic interview according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (MINI-Plus) was performed by a trained professional blinded to clinical diagnosis. Out of 91 patients, 23 with probable and definite bvFTD, 3 with possible bvFTD, 25 with a non bvFTD neurodegenerative disease, and 40 with a clinical psychiatric diagnosis were included. Overall frequency of formal current and past psychiatric disorders in probable and definite bvFTD (21.7% current, 8.7% past) did not differ from other neurodegenerative diseases (12.0% current, 16.0% past) or possible bvFTD (66.7% current, 66.7% past), but was less than in patients with a clinical psychiatric diagnosis (57.5% current, 62.5% past; p\u200a< \u200a0.01). In probable and definite bvFTD unipolar mood disorders were most common. Formally diagnosed psychiatric disorders are not overrepresented in probable bvFTD, suggesting that psychiatric misdiagnosis in bvFTD can be reduced by strictly applying diagnostic criteria.

The aim of this study was to systematically describe and analyze the experiences of parents' informal care responsibility. The questions were, what are the experiences around parents' informal care activities and responsibilities and how do parents construct and manage their caring responsibility and with what consequences? Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted (16 hours of recorded material) with eight parents who were all members of the Interest Association for Schizophrenia (Intressef\u00f6reningen f\u00f6r Schizofreni (IFS)) in Sweden. A mixed hermeneutic deductive and inductive method was used for the interpretation of the material. The parents endow their informal caring responsibility with meaning of being a good, responsible, and accountable parent with respect to their social context and social relationships as well as with respect to the psychiatric care representatives. In this tense situation, parents compromise between elements of struggle, cooperation, avoidance, and adaption in their interaction with the world outside, meaning the world beyond the care provision for their child, as well as with the world inside themselves."}, {"Title": "The investigation of factors related to suicide attempts in Southeastern Turkey.", "Abstract": "Suicide is an important health problem in Turkey as it is in all regions of the world. Suicidal behavior has multiple causes, which are broadly divided into those related to proximal stressors and those due to predisposition. Suicide statistics may be associated with mental health disorders, which are among the foremost predictors of suicide attempts. More than 90% of patients who commit suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, usually a major depressive disorder. Other major risk factors for suicide attempts are history of suicide attempts in the family, stressful life events, sleep disturbances, poor income, unemployment, severity of symptoms of depression, and anxiety. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. Sleep disturbances can therefore be contributed to the emergence of suicidal behavior allowing for the possibility of predicting future suicides.\nWe evaluated 106 patients who were admitted after suicide attempts to the Department of Psychiatry at Dicle University Faculty of Medicine. The recruited subjects were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, and the intensity of symptoms was evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The mean values of the subjects attempting multiple and single suicides were compared using appropriate inferential statistical tests.\nMost suicide attempts are believed to be preventable. Our results revealed that a great variety of risk factors are associated with an increased risk for multiple suicide attempts. Most of these attempts appeared to be spontaneous and impulsive rather than planned. In particular, this study highlights the importance of previous suicide attempts, history of suicide in the family, history of stressful life events in the previous 6 months, poor income, unemployment, sleep disturbances, severe hopelessness with depression, and coexisting symptoms of anxiety as risk factors.\nThe first step in prevention of suicides is doubtlessly strong and reliable communication, due to the fact that the majority of subjects who commit suicide have had contact with a health professional during the month before the suicide."}, {"Title": "Neurotoxicity and LSD treatment: a follow-up study of 151 patients in Denmark.", "Abstract": "LSD was introduced in psychiatry in the 1950s.

National data on hospital care for psychiatric illness in children with epilepsy are limited.\nWe used the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality from 2003 to 2009 to examine MHSA hospitalization patterns in children with comorbid epilepsy. Nonparametric and regression analyses determined the association of comorbid epilepsy with specific MHSA diagnoses and examined the impact of epilepsy on length of stay (LOS) for such MHSA diagnoses while controlling for demographic, payer, and hospital characteristics.\nWe observed 353,319 weighted MHSA hospitalizations of children ages 6-20; 3280 of these involved a child with epilepsy. Depression was the most common MHSA diagnosis in the general population (39.5%) whereas bipolar disorder was the most common MHSA diagnosis among children with epilepsy (36.2%). Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that children with comorbid epilepsy had greater adjusted odds of bipolar disorder (AOR: 1.17, 1.04-1.30), psychosis (AOR: 1.78, 1.51-2.09), sleep disorder (AOR: 5.90, 1.90-18.34), and suicide attempt/ideation (AOR: 3.20, 1.46-6.99) compared to the general MHSA inpatient population. Epilepsy was associated with a greater LOS and a higher adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for prolonged LOS (IRR: 1.12, 1.09-1.17), particularly for suicide attempt/ideation (IRR: 3.74, 1.68-8.34).\nChildren with epilepsy have distinct patterns of hospital care for mental illness and substance abuse and experience prolonged hospitalization for MHSA conditions. Strategies to reduce psychiatric hospitalizations in this population may require disease-specific approaches and should measure disease-relevant outcomes. Hospitals caring for large numbers of children with neurological disease (such as academic centers) may have inaccurate measurements of mental health-care quality unless the impact of key comorbid conditions such as epilepsy is considered."}, {"Title": "The advent of psychosurgery in Australia-with particular attention to its introduction into Sydney.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe the advent of prefrontal lobotomy in Sydney and, less comprehensively, its introduction into Australia.\nReference to journal articles, books, reports and archival data held at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and via internet searches, interviews and personal memory.\nThis paper describes the arrival of psychosurgery in Sydney in the mid-1940s, and less comprehensively, its arrival in other Australian cities.\nIn New South Wales, from 1945 or 1946, prefrontal lobotomies were conducted in private clinics and in public hospitals but, because of legal and practical hurdles, it is unlikely that psychosurgery was performed in mental hospitals prior to December 1958.

Little is known about who first initiate the contact between the patients and the referring doctors and which expectations the referring doctors have with respect to the involuntary admissions. The aim of the study was to examine who first detected the patients who were subsequently involuntarily admitted, and to examine the referring doctors' expectations for the admissions.\nSemi-structured interviews with 74 doctors that had referred patients for involuntary admission at a psychiatric hospital.\nPatients who were involuntarily admitted were detected by other branches of the health service (52\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a039), family (25\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a019), and the police (17\u00a0%, n\u00a0=\u00a013). The doctors mentioned these expectations for the admission (more than one expectation could be given): start treatment with neuroleptics: 58\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a043), take care of the patient: 45\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a034), extensive changes to the treatment regime: 37\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a028), solve an acute situation: 35\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a026), and clarify the diagnosis: 22\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a017). Female doctors significantly more often expected that the patients would be examined and treated, while the male doctors significantly more often expected that the patients would be cared for.\nInvoluntary admissions are typically complex processes involving different people and services and patients with various needs.

It has been poorly studied in low-middle income countries such as India both within acute care as well as long stay settings. 272 psychiatry admissions had 19.9% prevalence of agitation with the most common form being non goal directed physical agitation (13.6%). Episodes of agitation were most likely to occur on the 3rd or 2nd day of admission. Substance abuse [O.R.=2.51(1.05-5.99)] and the presence of persecutory delusions [O.R.=2.62(1.34-5.15)] were independently associated with agitation. It is difficult to predict violence in acutely ill individuals and there is evidence that the emergence of more serious aggression may be preceded by milder forms of agitation.

Both delirium and comorbid delirium-dementia groups scored higher than the dementia group for DRS-R98 and CTD total scores, but all three neurocognitively impaired groups scored similarly in respect of total NPI-Q scores. For individual DRS-R98 items, delirium groups were distinguished from dementia groups by a range of non-cognitive symptoms, but only for impaired attention of the cognitive items. For the CTD, attention (p=0.002) and vigilance (p=0.01) distinguished between delirium and dementia. No individual CTD item distinguished between comorbid delirium-dementia and delirium. For the NPI-Q, there were no differences between the three neurocognitively impaired groups for any individual item severity.\nThe neurocognitive profile of delirium is similar with or without comorbid dementia and differs from dementia without delirium. Simple tests of attention and vigilance can help to distinguish between delirium and other presentations. The NPI-Q does not readily distinguish between neuropsychiatric disturbances in delirium versus dementia.

Prior work suggests that casual contact in public space, which we call \"sociability,\" facilitates more sustained social bonds in the community. We appropriate the term \"hospitality\" to describe a main street's propensity to support a density of such social interactions. Hospitality is a result of the integrity and complex contents of the main street and surrounding area. We examine this using a typology we term \"box-circle-line\" to represent the streetscape (the box), the local neighborhood (the circle), and the relationship to the regional network of streets (the line). Through field visits to 50 main streets in New Jersey and elsewhere, and a systematic qualitative investigation of main streets in a densely interconnected urban region (Essex County, New Jersey), we observed significant variation in main street hospitality, which generally correlated closely with sociability. Physical elements such as street wall, neighborhood elements such as connectivity, inter-community elements such as access and perceived welcome, and socio-political elements such as investment and racial discrimination were identified as relevant to main street hospitality. We describe the box-circle-line as a theoretical model for main street hospitality that links these various factors and provides a viable framework for further research into main street hospitality, particularly with regard to geographic health disparities."}, {"Title": "Mental illness, problem behaviour, needs and service use in adults with intellectual disability.", "Abstract": "Mental ill health in adults with intellectual disability (ID) is a neglected field in psychiatry and thus still widely understudied.

These have included subjective reports based on self-evaluations and/or clinical observations describing motor, as well as sensory-based corporeal anomalies. There has been, however, a paucity of objective methods to capture and characterize bodily issues in SZ. Here we present a new research method and statistical platform that enables precise evaluation of peripheral activity and its putative contributions to the cognitive control of visuomotor actions. Specifically, we introduce new methods that facilitate the individualized characterization of the function of sensory-motor systems so as to detect if subjects perform outside of normal limits. In this paper, we report data from a cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of SZ. First, we characterize neurotypical subjects performing a visually guided pointing task that requires visuomotor transformations, multi-joint coordination, and the proper balance between different degrees of intent, among other factors. Then we measure SZ patients against the normative statistical ranges empirically determined. To this end, we examine the stochastic signatures of minute fluctuations in motor performance (micro-movements) of various velocity- and geometric-transformation-dependent trajectory parameters from the hand motions. These include the motions en-route to the target as well as spontaneous (without instructions) hand-retractions to rest. The comparisons reveal fundamental differences between SZ patients and controls. Specifically, velocity-dependent signatures show that SZ patients move significantly slower than controls with more noise and randomness in their moment-by-moment hand micro-motions. Furthermore, the normative geometric-dependent signatures of deliberateness are absent from the goal-directed reaches in SZ, but present within normative ranges in their spontaneous hand retractions to rest. Given that the continuous flow of micro-motions contributes to internally sensed feedback from self-produced movements, it is highly probable that sensory-motor integration with externally perceived inputs is impaired. Such impairments in this SZ cohort seem to specifically alter the balance between deliberate and spontaneous control of actions. We interpret these results as potential indexes of avolition and lack of agency and action ownership. We frame our results in the broad context of Precision Psychiatry initiatives and discuss possible implications on the putative contributions of the peripheral nervous system to the internal models for the cognitive control of self-produced actions in the individual with a clinical diagnosis of SZ."}, {"Title": "[Use of regional health administrative databases to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders and health service utilization in a Local Health Unit of Tuscany Region (Central Italy)].", "Abstract": "prevalence estimation of mental disorders and mental health services (SSM) utilization in 2011, using the administrative regional health databases (hospital discharge records, pharmaceutical prescriptions) and the Regional Database on Mental Health (SIRSM).\ndescriptive population-based study.\nresidents in a Local Health Unit (Florence) of Tuscany Region (Central Italy) who have access to SSM and/or to hospital departments of psychiatry/neuropsychiatry and/ or have psycholeptic/psychoanalectic prescriptions.\nfrequencies; crude and age-standardized prevalence of patients who have access to the SSM or have admission to a hospital psychiatric ward or have psycholeptic/psychoanalectic prescriptions.\na high prevalence (11.2%) of residents had at least one contact with health services for mental health problems, mostly (84%) for drug prescriptions only (20% of patients had a unique prescription during 2011).

In the United States, in 2011 there were 73.3 emergency room visits per 100\u2009000 people for suicide attempts with prescription drugs. The latter were also involved in 13% of completed suicides between 1999 and 2013. In most cases, these drugs were distributed by members of our profession who could not predict this outcome. This led us to create an initiative to teach pharmacy students how to prevent suicide. A literature review and online search were performed to find documentation about pharmacists' commitment to the cause, but very little information exists. Thus, a training session was developed for third-year pharmacy students that includes basic statistics, arguments for involving pharmacists in suicide prevention, role-playing, tools to evaluate suicide risk, thoughtful verbatims of interview techniques, and case studies. It is delivered during the mental health theme of the psychiatry course. In 5 years, around 1150 students have participated in the course, of whom approximately 950 are now practicing pharmacists. This intervention may have prevented some suicides, although the impact is impossible to measure. The objective of this paper is to describe the creative process of designing a suicide prevention training session for pharmacy students, while inspiring a mental health sensitive readership to this noble cause. This article does not provide guidelines on how to replicate this initiative, nor does this article replace proper training on suicide prevention."}, {"Title": "Assessment of Depression, Anxiety, and Quality of Life in Singaporean Patients With Glaucoma.", "Abstract": "To determine the prevalence and risk factors for anxiety disorder and depression among glaucoma patients in Singapore, and to assess the relationship between quality of life (QOL) and depression/anxiety.\nIn this cross-sectional study, glaucoma patients aged 21 and above with a known diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma or primary angle-closure glaucoma were recruited from a tertiary care hospital. Patients with other types of glaucoma, and coexisting ocular or psychiatric disorders were excluded.Ophthalmic examination was carried out on all participants, which included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), gonioscopy, standard automated perimetry, and optic disc evaluation. Sociodemographic information and treatment histories were also collected.The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), and Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ25) were administered to evaluate for depression, anxiety, and impact on QOL, respectively.\nA total of 100 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 67.1\u00b112.0 years (range, 24 to 90 y). The frequency of depression and anxiety among our patients was 30% and 64%, respectively. The mean HAM-D score was 4.37\u00b14.17 (range, 0 to 17), whereas the mean HAM-A score was 2.38\u00b12.80 (range, 0 to 13). The mean VFQ25 score was 78.8\u00b116.0 (range, 42.4 to 97.0). The poorest subscale on the VFQ25 was driving, with a mean score of 42.4\u00b142.6 (range, 0.0 to 100.0).We did not find any significant difference between the presence of depression/anxiety between patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (P=0.263) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (P=0.830). Risk factors for depression included: female sex (P=0.020), higher logMAR BCVA in the worse eye (P=0.004), higher cup-disc ratio (P=0.016), lower MD in the better and worse eye (P=0.022 and 0.001, respectively), and lower mean VFQ25 score (P<0.001). Risk factors for anxiety included: lower MD in the worse eye (P=0.004) and lower mean VFQ25 score (P=0.004). There was also no significant association between the use of topical \u03b2-blockers/carbonic anhydrase inhibitors with depression (P=0.793) or anxiety (P=0.282).\nThere is a relatively high prevalence of depression (30%) and anxiety disorders (64%) among glaucoma patients in Singapore. Female glaucoma patients are more likely to suffer from depression. Other risk factors for depression include higher cup-disc ratio, higher logMAR BCVA, lower MD, and a lower mean VFQ25 score. Risk factors for anxiety disorder include lower MD and lower mean VFQ25 score. Ophthalmologists could consider use of the VFQ25 as an assessment for impairments in QOL in a glaucoma patient.

Substitution of generic drugs is any change in the name of the manufacturer of the generic drug. The therapeutic areas were: diabetes (metformin); hypertension (amlodipine); dyslipidemia (simvastatin); psychiatry (sertraline); cardiology (propafenone); osteoporosis (alendronate). The retrospective analysis was carried out on the administrative databases of two Local Healthcare Units (ASL - Azienda sanitaria locale Bergamo (BG) and Pavia (PV)) in the Lombardy Region of Italy. The correlation between persistence and adherence with the different cohorts of generic substitution frequency within each therapeutic area was then calculated.\nAccording to the inclusion criteria, 23,773 patients were evaluated. Patients were observed for a period of 36 months starting from the first drug delivery (index date). The median age of the overall population was above 61 years in all therapeutic areas. The generic drug substitution occurred in 61.5% of patients (BG: 57.6% and PV: 65.4% respectively); Hypertension was the therapeutic area with the highest percentage of patients with substitutions. Patients' adherence, evaluated by the Medical Possession Rate (MPR) and persistence to the treatment decreases with the increase in the frequency of generic substitutions. This observation was confirmed by a statistically significant negative correlation (p-value of <0.001) between the adherence and persistence and the number of generic substitutions in each therapeutic area and Local Healthcare Units (ASL).\nAdherence is one of the pillars of the patient's health management in the control and prevention of progression of the disease. Several factors, such as ageing, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, may affect adherence and influence the outcome of treatments. These results are in line with studies supporting the possibility that the change of package appearance each time a new prescription is dispensed may create confusion and ultimately reduce patients' adherence. Clinicians and decision makers should consider the impact of frequent generic substitutions on persistence and adherence, which may influence efficacy and/or safety."}, {"Title": "Trajectories of suicidal ideation in patients with first-episode psychosis: secondary analysis of data from the OPUS trial.", "Abstract": "Heterogeneity in suicidal ideation over time in patients with first-episode psychosis is expected, but prototypical trajectories of this have not yet been established. We aimed to identify trajectories of suicidal ideation over a 3-year period and to examine how these trajectories relate to subsequent suicidality.\nWe used longitudinal data from the prospective 10-year follow-up OPUS trial of young Danish patients with first-episode psychosis. Participants were recruited between January, 1998, and December, 2000, from all inpatient and outpatient mental health services in Copenhagen and Aarhus County, were aged between 18 and 45 years, and had a diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified in alternating blocks for five centres. In Aarhus, a secretary drew lots when the researcher phoned her. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (modified assertive community treatment) or a control group (standard treatment at community mental health centres) and assessed at treatment initiation, and after 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. We included all patients' data on suicidal ideation from the first three assessments in a latent growth mixture modelling analysis to empirically identify trajectories of suicidal ideation. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate associations between trajectories and subsequent suicidality. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00157313.\nThree trajectories for suicidal ideation were identified in 521 patients. 317 of 521 members (61%) of the largest trajectory, low-decreasing, consisted of patients who initially reported suicidal ideation once-to-a-few-times in the past year followed by a decrease in suicidal ideation. 172 of 521 (33%) members of the frequent-stable trajectory reported suicidal ideation sometimes-to-frequently at the first assessment and remained stable over time. Finally, 32 of 521 (6%) members of the frequent-increasing trajectory reported frequent suicidal ideation initially followed by worsening. Compared with the low-decreasing class, the risk of persistent suicidal ideation was higher for patients in the frequent-stable and frequent-increasing classes at 5 years (Odds ratio=4\u00b75, 95% CI 2\u00b750-8\u00b702 and 4\u00b77, 1\u00b755-14\u00b724 respectively) and at 10 years (4\u00b72, 2\u00b742-7\u00b713 and 3\u00b72, 1\u00b720-8\u00b770 respectively).

There was no difference in suicide rate at 5 or 10 years between trajectories.\nBecause up to 40% of patients experienced frequent suicidal ideations that persisted or increased during the first years of treatment, our findings warrant special focus on suicidal issues as an integral part of treatment along with treatment to target psychotic symptoms.\nThe Danish Council for Independent Research (Medical Sciences), Trygfonden, The Mental Health Services of the Capital Region of Denmark, The Danish Ministry of Health, The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs, the Psychiatry and Social Service Department in Central Denmark Region, and The Lundbeck Foundation."}, {"Title": "[Pathway of a patient within a healthcare unit].", "Abstract": "Care in prison must be based as much as possible on the model used for the general population.

The main aim was to assess how frequently chorionicity has been examined in relation to heritability estimates, and to assess which phenotypes may be most sensitive to, or affected by, bias in heritability estimates because of chorionicity. Consistent with the theory that some chorionicity effects could lead to overestimation and others to underestimation of heritability, there were instances of each across the many phenotypes reviewed. However, firm conclusions should not be drawn since some of the outcomes were only examined in one or few studies and often sample sizes were small. While the evidence for bias due to chorionicity was mixed or null for many outcomes, results do, however, consistently suggest that heritability estimates are underestimated for measures of birth weight and early growth when chorionicity is not taken into account."}, {"Title": "Comparison of Certification and Recertification Examinee Performance on Multiple-Choice Items in Forensic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Research on the association between age and performance on tests of medical knowledge has generally shown an inverse relationship, which is of concern because of the positive association between measures of knowledge and measures of clinical performance. Because the certification and maintenance of certification (MOC) examinations in the subspecialty of forensic psychiatry draw on a common item bank, performance of the two groups of examinees on the same items could be compared. In addition, the relationship between age and test performance was analyzed. Performance on items administered to certification and MOC examinees did not differ significantly, and the mean amount of time spent on each item was similar for the two groups. Although the majority (five of eight) of the correlations between age and test score on the certification and MOC examinations were negative, only three were significant, and the amount of variance explained by age was small. In addition, examination performance for those younger than 50 was similar to those 60 and older, and diplomates recertifying for the second time outperformed those doing so for the first time.

Using a Web-based survey, we examined the experiences and attitudes of members of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law (AAPL) regarding PTSD in the criminal forensic setting. Of 238 respondents, 50 percent had been involved in a criminal case involving PTSD, 41 percent in the previous year. Eighty-six percent of cases involved violent crime and 40 percent homicides. Forty-two percent of defendants were soldiers in active service or veterans, of whom 89 percent had had combat exposure, mostly in the Second Iraq and Afghan wars. Outcomes reported were not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) (7%), guilty on the original charge (40%), and pleading guilty to a lesser charge (23%).

Ideally, a classification system should \"carve nature at its joints.\" Barring that, psychiatry needs operational definitions to appreciate the differences between idiosyncratic, psychotic thinking, and shared subcultural beliefs or ideologies.

His bizarrely composed compendium and references to himself as the \"Knights Templar\" raised concerns that he had a psychotic mental illness. Beliefs such as Mr. Breivik's that precede odd, unusual, or extremely violent behavior present a unique challenge to the forensic evaluator, who sometimes struggles to understand those beliefs. Psychotic disorder frequently is invoked to characterize odd, unusual, or extreme beliefs, with a classification that has evolved over time. However, the important concept of overvalued idea, largely ignored in American psychiatry, may better characterize these beliefs in some cases. We discuss the definitions of delusion and overvalued ideas in the context of Anders Breivik's rigidly held extreme beliefs. We also review the British definition of overvalued idea and discuss McHugh's construct, to introduce the term \"extreme overvalued belief\" as an aid in sharpening the forensic evaluator's conceptualization of these and similar beliefs."}, {"Title": "Increased Prevalence of Intermittent Rhythmic Delta or Theta Activity (IRDA/IRTA) in the Electroencephalograms (EEGs) of Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder.", "Abstract": "An increased prevalence of pathological electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been reported in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In an elaborative case description of such a patient with intermittent rhythmic delta and theta activity (IRDA/IRTA), the BPD symptoms where linked to the frequency of the IRDAs/IRTAs and vanished with the IRDAs/IRTAs following anticonvulsive therapy. This observation raised a question regarding the prevalence of such EEG abnormalities in BPD patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to identify the frequency of EEG abnormalities in a carefully analyzed psychiatric collective. Following earlier reports, we hypothesized an increased prevalence of EEG abnormalities in BPD patients.\nWe recruited 96 consecutive patients with BPD from the archive of a university clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy, and compared the prevalence of EEG abnormalities to those of 76 healthy controls subjects. The EEGs were rated by three different blinded clinicians, including a consultant specializing in epilepsy from the local epilepsy center.\nWe found a significant increase in the prevalence of IRDAs and IRTAs in BPD patients (14.6%) compared to the control subjects (3.9%; p = 0.020).\nIn this blinded retrospective case-control study, we were able to confirm an increased prevalence of pathological EEG findings (IRDAs/IRTAs only) in BPD patients. The major limitation of this study is that the control group was not matched on age and gender.

In the current study we tested whether deterministic and stochastic curtailment can be applied to shorten the 19-item SSI, without compromising its accuracy.\nData from 366 patients, who were seen by a liaison psychiatry service in a general hospital in Scotland after a suicide attempt, were used. Within 24h of admission, the SSI was administered; 15 months later, it was determined whether a patient was re-admitted to a hospital as the result of another suicide attempt. We fitted a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to derive the best cut-off value of the SSI for predicting future suicidal behavior. Using this cut-off, both deterministic and stochastic curtailment were simulated on the item score patterns of the SSI.\nA cut-off value of SSI\u22656 provided the best classification accuracy for future suicidal behavior. Using this cut-off, we found that both deterministic and stochastic curtailment reduce the length of the SSI, without reducing the accuracy of the final classification decision. With stochastic curtailment, on average, less than 8 items are needed to assess whether administration of the full-length test will result in an SSI score below or above the cut-off value of 6.\nNew studies using other datasets should re-validate the optimal cut-off for risk of repeated suicidal behavior after being treated in a hospital following an attempt.\nCurtailment can be used to simplify the assessment of suicidal behavior, and should be considered as an alternative to the full scale."}, {"Title": "New Developments of the Therapeutic Alliance (TA): Good News for Psychodynamic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Clinicians have long known that successful psychotherapy, including successful psychodynamic psychotherapy, depends upon the interaction between therapist and patient.

Despite the widespread therapeutic and diagnostic use of TMS in neurology and psychiatry, its observed response remains hard to predict, limiting its further development and applications. Although the stimulation intensity is always maximum at the cortical surface near the coil, experiments reveal that TMS can affect deeper brain regions as well.\nThe explanation of this spread might be found in the white matter fiber tracts, connecting cortical and subcortical structures. When applying an electric field on neurons, their membrane potential is altered. If this change is significant, more likely near the TMS coil, action potentials might be initiated and propagated along the fiber tracts towards deeper regions. In order to understand and apply TMS more effectively, it is important to capture and account for this interaction as accurately as possible. Therefore, we compute, next to the induced electric fields in the brain, the spatial distribution of the membrane potentials along the fiber tracts and its temporal dynamics.\nThis paper introduces a computational TMS model in which electromagnetism and neurophysiology are combined. Realistic geometry and tissue anisotropy are included using magnetic resonance imaging and targeted white matter fiber tracts are traced using tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging. The position and orientation of the coil can directly be retrieved from the neuronavigation system. Incorporating these features warrants both patient- and case-specific results.\nThe presented model gives insight in the activity propagation through the brain and can therefore explain the observed clinical responses to TMS and their inter- and/or intra-subject variability.

Some of the animal models commonly used to date are more suitable for investigating mechanisms of anxiety and fear than the long-lasting behavior that characterized PTSD. That said, mechanisms and neurocircuits involved in paradigms such as fear conditioning and extinction share several common features with those of PTSD. In this article, we review preclinical studies in which electrical stimulation has been delivered to animal models of PTSD-like behavior. In those studies, commonly targeted regions were the basolateral amygdala, ventral striatum, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Overall, stimulation delivered at high frequencies to most of these targets improved fear extinction and anxiety-like behavior.

The ORs of 1-6-year-old and 7-12-year-old children compared with 13-19-year-old children were 3.14 (95 % CI 1.31-7.53) and 3.34 (95% CI 1.64-6.79), respectively, and the OR of the group with longer disease duration (\u226548 months) compared with the group with shorter disease duration was 3.36 (95% CI 1.71-6.59). Only the age and disease duration showed statistically significant differences between the patients who were administered CAM and those who received other rehabilitation therapies (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nCAM is preferred by patients under 13 years of age compared with patients aged 13-19 years, whereas other rehabilitation therapies are preferred by patients aged 1-6 years, followed by those aged 6-12 years and then by those aged 13-19 years. The patient's age and disease duration are the major factors influencing CAM use.

An additional one third of medically ill patients remain in hospitals with undetected and, therefore, undiagnosed mental health problems. The comorbidity of mental and physical illnesses leads to poor health outcomes, prolonged inpatient stays and use of inpatient resources, involvement of various affiliated health services, introduction of medications and discharge to long-term facilities, including residential and nursing 24-h care, increased both readmission rates and mortality. The establishment of Liaison psychiatry services to meet the needs for people with mental health problems admitted to medical wards is a priority for many acute health Trusts. This has an economical background in terms of cost-savings, especially in relation to the older adults, with decreasing readmission rates and quicker hospital discharges. In the current review, we address the latest policies regarding Liaison psychiatry services; especially those for older people with dementia and delirium, and discuss their future shaping."}, {"Title": "An Interpretation of Nurse-Patient Relationships in Inpatient Psychiatry: Understanding the Mindful Approach.", "Abstract": "Nurses who work in acute inpatient psychiatry, where lengths of stay are increasingly shortened, struggle to establish therapeutic nurse-patient relationships. The purpose of this inquiry was to illuminate the nature of relationships between inpatient psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurses and their patients. The author used semistructured interviews and nonparticipant observation in an interpretive phenomenological inquiry. The data consisted of texts that were transcribed from narratives and observations. The meanings that were generated led to the uncovering of patterns of commonality, or themes. Of the themes uncovered, the theme of mindful approach highlighted PMH nurses as engaging with patients in distress, strategically creating encounters to establish a basis for ongoing therapeutic work. The PMH nurse-patient relationship in acute inpatient psychiatry continues to be under pressure, but nurses still carefully construct relational approaches in response to patient distress, and patients in these settings experience these approaches as meaningful to their recovery."}, {"Title": "Introduction.", "Abstract": "When Thomas Insel announced last year that he was stepping down from his position as director of the National Institute of Mental Health to join Google Life Sciences, some surprise was expressed by my colleagues.

However, the evidence for follow-up treatments reducing suicidal behavior in these patients is limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP) in reducing suicidal behavior. ASSIP is a novel brief therapy based on a patient-centered model of suicidal behavior, with an emphasis on early therapeutic alliance.\nPatients who had recently attempted suicide were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (n = 60) or treatment as usual plus ASSIP (n = 60). ASSIP participants received three therapy sessions followed by regular contact through personalized letters over 24 months. Participants considered to be at high risk of suicide were included, 63% were diagnosed with an affective disorder, and 50% had a history of prior suicide attempts. Clinical exclusion criteria were habitual self-harm, serious cognitive impairment, and psychotic disorder. Study participants completed a set of psychosocial and clinical questionnaires every 6 months over a 24-month follow-up period. The study represents a real-world clinical setting at an outpatient clinic of a university hospital of psychiatry. The primary outcome measure was repeat suicide attempts during the 24-month follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures were suicidal ideation, depression, and health-care utilization. Furthermore, effects of prior suicide attempts, depression at baseline, diagnosis, and therapeutic alliance on outcome were investigated. During the 24-month follow-up period, five repeat suicide attempts were recorded in the ASSIP group and 41 attempts in the control group. The rates of participants reattempting suicide at least once were 8.3% (n = 5) and 26.7% (n = 16). ASSIP was associated with an approximately 80% reduced risk of participants making at least one repeat suicide attempt (Wald \u03c721 = 13.1, 95% CI 12.4-13.7, p < 0.001). ASSIP participants spent 72% fewer days in the hospital during follow-up (ASSIP: 29 d; control group: 105 d; W = 94.5, p = 0.038). Higher scores of patient-rated therapeutic alliance in the ASSIP group were associated with a lower rate of repeat suicide attempts. Prior suicide attempts, depression, and a diagnosis of personality disorder at baseline did not significantly affect outcome. Participants with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (n = 20) had more previous suicide attempts and a higher number of reattempts. Key study limitations were missing data and dropout rates. Although both were generally low, they increased during follow-up. At 24 months, the group difference in dropout rate was significant: ASSIP, 7% (n = 4); control, 22% (n = 13). A further limitation is that we do not have detailed information of the co-active follow-up treatment apart from participant self-reports every 6 months on the setting and the duration of the co-active treatment.\nASSIP, a manual-based brief therapy for patients who have recently attempted suicide, administered in addition to the usual clinical treatment, was efficacious in reducing suicidal behavior in a real-world clinical setting. ASSIP fulfills the need for an easy-to-administer low-cost intervention. Large pragmatic trials will be needed to conclusively establish the efficacy of ASSIP and replicate our findings in other clinical settings.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02505373."}, {"Title": "An International Congress on Violence in Clinical Psychiatry: Reflections and Takeaways.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric-mental health nurses are lifelong learners and reflective practitioners.

We chose to focus on distinct interventions rather than on holistic service models where any element responsible for therapeutic change would be difficult to isolate.\nWe performed a systematic review and narrative synthesis of non-pharmacological interventions intended to reduce violence in a SMI population and in patients with a primary diagnosis of PD. Five online databases were searched alongside a manual search of seven relevant journals, and expert opinion was sourced. Eligibility of all returned articles was independently assessed by two authors, and quality of studies was appraised via the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias.\nWe included 23 studies of diverse psychological and practical interventions, with a range of experimental and quasi-experimental study designs that included 7 Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs). The majority were studies of Mentally Disordered Offenders. The stronger evidence existed for patients with a SMI diagnosis receiving Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or modified Reasoning & Rehabilitation (R&R). For patients with a primary diagnosis of PD, a modified version of R&R appeared tolerable and Enhanced Thinking Skills showed some promise in improving attitudes over the short-term, but studies of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy in this population were compromised by high risk of experimental bias. Little evidence could be found for non-pharmacological, non-psychological interventions.\nThe evidence for non-pharmacological interventions for reducing violence in this population is not conclusive.

It was hypothesised that professionals' relating style and attitudes toward their work might be important, and thus this exploratory study modelled associations between these characteristics and therapeutic relationships developed in community psychosis treatment.\nDyads of professionals and young patients with psychosis rated their therapeutic relationships with each other. Professionals also completed measures of attachment style, therapeutic optimism, outcome expectancy, and job attitudes regarding working with psychosis.\nProfessionals' anxious attachment predicted less positive professional therapeutic relationship ratings. In exploratory directed path analysis, data also supported indirect effects, whereby anxious professional attachment predicts less positive therapeutic relationships through reduced professional therapeutic optimism and less positive job attitudes.\nProfessional anxious attachment style is directly associated with the therapeutic relationship in psychosis, and indirectly associated through therapeutic optimism and job attitudes. Thus, intervening in professional characteristics could offer an opportunity to limit the impact of insecure attachment on therapeutic relationships in psychosis."}, {"Title": "Characterizing a psychiatric symptom dimension related to deficits in goal-directed control.", "Abstract": "Prominent theories suggest that compulsive behaviors, characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction, are driven by shared deficits in goal-directed control, which confers vulnerability for developing rigid habits. However, recent studies have shown that deficient goal-directed control accompanies several disorders, including those without an obvious compulsive element. Reasoning that this lack of clinical specificity might reflect broader issues with psychiatric diagnostic categories, we investigated whether a dimensional approach would better delineate the clinical manifestations of goal-directed deficits. Using large-scale online assessment of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive performance in two independent general-population samples, we found that deficits in goal-directed control were most strongly associated with a symptom dimension comprising compulsive behavior and intrusive thought. This association was highly specific when compared to other non-compulsive aspects of psychopathology. These data showcase a powerful new methodology and highlight the potential of a dimensional, biologically-grounded approach to psychiatry research."}, {"Title": "Effect of obesity on cognition in adults with and without a mood disorder: study design and methods.", "Abstract": "Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions. Individuals with mood disorders (bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD)) display an increased prevalence of both obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, BD and MDD are associated with impairment in cognitive functioning across multiple domains. The independent contribution of obesity to cognitive decline in this population has not been explored. This study examines the impact of obesity on cognition by comparing neuropsychological performance in obese individuals, with or without a mood disorder before and after undergoing bariatric surgery.\nThis study compares measures of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention in obese individuals (body mass index >35 kg/m(2)) with BD or MDD, and 2 control populations (obese individuals without a psychiatric illness and healthy non-obese controls) prior to and following bariatric surgery. Participants (ages 18-60) receive a psychiatric diagnosis via the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; SCID). Mood ratings, physical measurements, nutritional and health questionnaires are also administered. A standardised battery of neuropsychological tests aimed at establishing performance in areas of declarative memory, executive functioning and attention are administered. Warrington's Recognition Memory Task (RMT) and an N-Back Task are performed in a 3 T functional MRI to investigate patterns of neural activation during cognitive performance. Additionally, anatomical MRI data are obtained to investigate potential changes in neural structures.

Epigenetic changes include histone modifications such as methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDACs are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histones, as well as a range of other proteins including transcriptional factors. HDACs are highly conserved proteins divided into two families and based on sequence similarity in four classes. Here we will discuss the roles of Rpd3 in physiology and longevity with emphasis on its role in flies. Rpd3, the Drosophila HDAC1 homolog, is a class I lysine deacetylase and a member of a large family of HDAC proteins.

The aim of this article was to estimate the personnel requirements for guideline-adherent psychiatric psychotherapeutic hospital treatment.\nA normative concept for the required psychotherapeutic \"dose\" for anxiety disorders was determined based on a literature review. The required staffing contingent was compared to the resources provided by the Psych-PV based on category A1.\nAccording to the German policy guidelines for outpatient psychotherapy, a quota of 25 sessions of 50 min each (as a rule plus 5 probatory sessions) is reimbursed. This approach is supported by studies on dose-response relationships. As patients undergoing inpatient treatment for anxiety disorders are usually more severely ill than outpatients, a contingent of 30 sessions for the average treatment duration of 5 weeks seems appropriate in order to fully exploit the costly inpatient treatment time (300 min per patient and week). In contrast, only 70 min are reimbursed according to the Psych-PV. The total personnel requirement for the normative concept is 624 min per patient and week. The Psych-PV only covers 488 min (78\u2009%).\nCurrently, the time contingents for evidence-based psychiatric psychotherapeutic/psychosomatic hospital care are nowhere near sufficient.

There is a wide variation in clinical practice, and perhaps some more awareness between clinicians is needed. Due to the high frequency of chronic treatment in severe mental patients, careful attention is recommended on the physical risk. IHPRL symptoms could be underestimated without routine examination.\nAn intense scientific literature search was performed in order to draw up a multidisciplinary consensus, including different specialists of psychiatry, endocrinology, oncology and internal medicine, and looking for a consensus about clinical risk and detection of IHPRL following evidence-based medicine criteria levels (EBM I- IV).\nShort-term symptoms include amenorrhea, galactorrhoea, and sexual dysfunction with decrease of libido and erectile difficulties related to hypogonadism. Medium and long-term symptoms related to oestrogens are observed, including a decrease bone mass density, hypogonadism, early menopause, some types of cancer risk increase (breast and endometrial), cardiovascular risk increase, immune system disorders, lipids, and cognitive dysfunction. Prolactin level, gonadal hormones and vitamin D should be checked in all patients receiving antipsychotics at baseline although early symptoms (amenorrhea-galactorrhoea) may not be observed due to the risk of underestimating other delayed symptoms that may appear in the medium term. Routine examination of sexual dysfunction is recommended due to possible poor patient tolerance and low compliance. Special care is required in children and adolescents, as well as patients with PRL levels >50ng/ml (moderate hyperprolactinaemia).

A number of biological properties of lithium have been discovered, including its hematological, antiviral and neuroprotective effects. In this article, a systematic review of the effect of lithium on hematopoietic, mesenchymal and neural stem cells is presented. The beneficial effects of lithium on the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and growth factors have been reported since 1970s. Lithium improves homing of stem cells, the ability to form colonies and HSC self-renewal. Lithium also exerts a favorable influence on the proliferation and maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Studies on the effect of lithium on neurogenesis have indicated an increased proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and enhanced mitotic activity of Schwann cells. This may be connected with the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of lithium, reflected in an improvement in synaptic plasticity promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis. In clinical studies, lithium treatment increases cerebral gray matter, mainly in the frontal lobes, hippocampus and amygdala. Recent findings also suggest that lithium may reduce the risk of dementia and exert a beneficial effect in neurodegenerative diseases. The most important mediators and signaling pathways of lithium action are the glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways.

Index admissions are excluded from the cohort if they are observation, inpatient admissions for psychiatry, skilled nursing, hospice, rehabilitation, maternal and newborn visits, or if the patient expires during the index admission. Data are randomly and repeatedly divided into fitting and validating sets for cross validations. Approaches including LACE, STEPWISE logistic, LASSO logistic, and AdaBoost, are compared with sample sizes varying from 2,500 to 80,000.\nOur results confirm that LACE has moderate discrimination power with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) around 0.65-0.66, which can be improved to 0.73-0.74 when additional variables from EMR are considered. These variables include Inpatient in the last six months, Number of emergency room visits or inpatients in the last year, Braden score, Polypharmacy, Employment status, Discharge disposition, Albumin level, and medical condition variables such as Leukemia, Malignancy, Renal failure with hemodialysis, History of alcohol substance abuse, Dementia and Trauma. When sample size is small (\u22645000), LASSO is the best; when sample size is large (\u226520,000), the predictive performance is similar. The STEPWISE method has a slightly lower AUC (0.734) comparing to LASSO (0.737) and AdaBoost (0.737). More than one half of the selected predictors can be false positives when using a single method and a single division of fitting/validating data.\nTrue predictors can be identified by repeatedly dividing data into fitting/validating subsets and referring the final model based on summarizing results. LASSO is a better alternative to the STEPWISE logistic regression, especially when sample size is not large. The evidence for adequate sample size can be explored by fitting models on gradually reduced samples.

When integrating the data, it is clear that compounds from several biological pathways have been found to be associated with aggressive behavior, indicating complexity and the need for a broad approach. In the second part of the paper, using examples from the aggression literature and psychiatric metabolomics studies, we argue that a better understanding of aggression would benefit from a more holistic approach such as provided by metabolomics. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "The type and prevalence of the use of analgesics among inpatients in a geriatric psychiatry department.", "Abstract": "The association between the presence of pain and mental disorder is well known. The extent of pain treatment in psychiatric patients is estimated to be high, but there is a lack of recent studies focusing on analgesic treatment in patients with mental disorders. The use of analgesics can be associated with side effects, and it is possible that analgesics are not the correct treatment for chronic pain among patients with mental disorders.\nData were obtained among inpatients in a geriatric psychiatry department at Aarhus University Hospital, Risskov, Denmark, between 1 April 2013 and 1 October 2013. The study examines the extent of analgesic use by patients at admission with a follow up at discharge to note any change during hospitalization.\nA total of 89 patients aged 68 years or older were included (56 women, 33 men). At admission, 51.7% used analgesics, and this number did not change significantly from admission to discharge. A statistically significant increased risk of analgesic use was found in females (odds ratio 4.0). The indications for analgesic use were not present in 34.5% of the pain-treated patients at admission. At discharge, this number had been reduced to 23.1%. Paracetamol was the drug most frequently used, followed by opioids.\nThe use of analgesics among aged psychiatric inpatients is high. An increased focus on this topic is recommended."}, {"Title": "The physical and psychological problems of immigrants to Japan who require psychosomatic care: a retrospective observation study.", "Abstract": "As the number of immigrants to Japan increases, the health problems of foreign nationals also have an increasing impact on Japanese medical institutions. The aim of this study was to clarify the Japan-specific health problems related to both the physical and psychological symptoms of foreign nationals from the viewpoint of psychosomatic medicine. The second aim was to clarify the measures that should be taken in Japan and similar countries where immigration may still be considered less than common.\nThe study period was from June 2004 to May 2015. The data of non-Japanese patients who had visited the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine, Kinki University Hospital and its branches, Sakai Hospital and Nihonbashi Clinic, were collected. All patients were aged 16 years or over. Multiple factors, such as age, sex, nationality, length of stay, marital status, employment status, level of Japanese proficiency, clinical symptoms, physical and psychiatric diagnosis, psycho-social factors and therapy were retrospectively analyzed from the medical charts of 20 non-Japanese patients. Cases were divided into two groups; early onset and late onset cases. This study showed that multiple factors related to the health problems of non-Japanese patients were combined and had a mutual influence, however, they can be summarized into two important clinical observations. These are 1) cultural differences, and 2) language barriers related to both the physical and psychological symptoms of non-Japanese patients from the viewpoint of psychosomatic medicine.\nFuture efforts should focus on sensitizing health care professionals in Japan to the psychosomatic problems of non-Japanese patients as well as on facilitating medical systems with services such as medical professional interpreters and liaison-consultation models. It is essential to take measures against language barriers and to promote the field of transcultural psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine in Japan. In addition, the Japanese government should introduce a more comprehensive social support system for non-Japanese people."}, {"Title": "Social skills group training in high-functioning autism: A qualitative responder study.", "Abstract": "Systematic reviews show some evidence for the efficacy of group-based social skills group training in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, but more rigorous research is needed to endorse generalizability. In addition, little is known about the perspectives of autistic individuals participating in social skills group training. Using a qualitative approach, the objective of this study was to examine experiences and opinions about social skills group training of children and adolescents with higher functioning autism spectrum disorder and their parents following participation in a manualized social skills group training (\"KONTAKT\"). Within an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT01854346) and based on outcome data from the Social Responsiveness Scale, six high responders and five low-to-non-responders to social skills group training and one parent of each child (N\u2009=\u200922) were deep interviewed. Interestingly, both high responders and low-to-non-responders (and their parents) reported improvements in social communication and related skills (e.g. awareness of own difficulties, self-confidence, independence in everyday life) and overall treatment satisfaction, although more positive intervention experiences were expressed by responders. These findings highlight the added value of collecting verbal data in addition to quantitative data in a comprehensive evaluation of social skills group training."}, {"Title": "Consensus statement on the role of Accredited Exercise Physiologists within the treatment of mental disorders: a guide for mental health professionals.", "Abstract": "The aim is to identify the role and scope of Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) services in the mental health sector and to provide insight as to how AEPs can contribute to the multidisciplinary mental health team.\nA modified Delphi approach was utilised.

Current recommendations on agitation in psychiatry are not univocal. Actually, an improper assessment and management may result in unnecessary coercive or sedative treatments. A thorough and balanced review plus an expert consensus can guide assessment and treatment decisions.\nAn expert task force iteratively developed consensus using the Delphi method. Initial survey items were based on systematic review of the literature. Subsequent surveys included new, re-worded or re-rated items.\nOut of 2175 papers assessing psychomotor agitation, 124 were included in the review. Each component was assigned a level of evidence. Integrating the evidence and the experience of the task force members, a consensus was reached on 22 statements on this topic.\nRecommendations on the assessment of agitation emphasise the importance of identifying any possible medical cause. For its management, experts agreed in considering verbal de-escalation and environmental modification techniques as first choice, considering physical restraint as a last resort strategy. Regarding pharmacological treatment, the \"ideal\" medication should calm without over-sedate. Generally, oral or inhaled formulations should be preferred over i.m. routes in mildly agitated patients. Intravenous treatments should be avoided."}, {"Title": "Clinical features, course and treatment of methamphetamine-induced psychosis in psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "Over the past few years, methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MIP) has increased in Iran, accounting for a significant percentage of psychiatry hospital admissions. The present study was conducted with an aim to investigate clinical symptoms, and course and treatment methods of MIP inpatients in Shafa Psychiatry Hospital in northern Iran.\nParticipants were 152 MIP inpatients. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) subscales of suspiciousness, unusual thought content; hallucinations and hostility were used to measure psychiatric symptoms. Data regarding suicide and homicide and violence were also obtained through interviews with the inpatients and their family. Based on their lengths of recovery time, the inpatients were categorized into 3 clinical groups. These inpatients received their usual treatments and were monitored for their psychiatric symptoms and clinical course of illness. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics.\nThe most frequent psychiatric symptoms were violence (75.6 %), intimate partner violence (61.2 %), delusions of persecution (85.5 %), delusions of reference (38.5 %), delusions of grandiosity (32.9 %), delusions of infidelity (30.2 %), auditory hallucinations (51.3 %), visual hallucinations (18.4 %), suicidal thoughts (14.5 %), homicidal thoughts (3.9 %), suicide attempts (10.5 %) and homicide attempts (0.7 %). Recovery from psychotic symptoms in 31.6 % of the inpatients took more than one month. 46.1% of the inpatients were treated with Risperidone and 37.5 % with Olanzapine. Persecutory delusion and auditory hallucination were the most frequent persistent psychotic symptoms. 20.8 % of the inpatients with duration of psychosis more than one month were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) along with antipsychotics.\nAll forms of violence are highly frequent in MIP inpatients. Our finding agrees with many other studies suggesting that recovery from MIP can take more than a month.

A Review of Educational Programs.", "Abstract": "Because there have been no published formal reviews on teaching of firearm safety, we set out to systematically locate and review the literature on curricula that educated physicians and other health care providers, residents across specialties, and medical students on how to counsel on firearm safety.\nWe searched for all papers with outcomes that described firearm safety training programs for healthcare providers and trainees. Studies were identified through PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, EMBASE, and MedEdPortal databases and electronically searched using combinations of words from general topic areas of firearms, learners, and education.\nWe found four programs that met inclusion criteria. These targeted a narrow range of learners including medical students, pediatric residents, practicing pediatricians, and nurse practitioners. Teaching methods included lectures, case-based learning, group discussions, and audiotape training. There were two randomized controlled trials, one cohort design, and one posttest design. One of the randomized controlled trials was an office-based high quality multisite national study, although the focus of teaching was not on firearm safety alone. All studies used different outcomes, and only one study validated the outcome measures. There were no studies targeting psychiatrists or psychiatry residents.\nThese results underscore a priority for developing firearm safety education programs in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education settings."}, {"Title": "Perceptions of the Professional Development Value of Honorary Fellowship Award Experiences.", "Abstract": "Professional societies engage in activities with the aim of nurturing highly talented early career members of their field.

The authors obtained frequency data and analyzed responses using t-tests and chi-squared tests. Associations between the outcomes and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and fellowship type was tested.\nResponses were gathered from 143 individuals who had participated in the Laughlin Fellowship and 22 in the PRITE Fellowship. Respondents felt that that the fellowship experience had been helpful professionally. Laughlin fellows were older and more likely to have assumed a leadership role in professional organizations (60\u00a0% vs 36\u00a0%, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Laughlin fellows also more strongly endorsed professional recognition as a benefit at the time of receiving their award. Survey respondents reported increased participation in professional organizations and assumed leadership roles in The College and other professional organizations subsequent to the fellowship experience.\nOn the whole, fellows were generally positive about their experiences. Many respondents became involved with The College subsequent to their fellowship, but a larger proportion became involved with other organizations, including in leadership roles. Professional societies with early career programs such as the Laughlin Fellowship and the PRITE Fellowship appear to identify and support future leaders as intended, but these leaders may engage more with other professional societies."}, {"Title": "V. M. BEKHTEREV IN RUSSIAN CHILD SCIENCE, 1900S-1920S: \"OBJECTIVE PSYCHOLOGY\"/\"REFLEXOLOGY\" AS A SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT.", "Abstract": "In the early 20(th) century the child population became a major focus of scientific, professional and public interest. This led to the crystallization of a dynamic field of child science, encompassing developmental and educational psychology, child psychiatry and special education, school hygiene and mental testing, juvenile criminology and the anthropology of childhood. This article discusses the role played in child science by the eminent Russian neurologist and psychiatrist Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev. The latter's name is associated with a distinctive program for transforming the human sciences in general and psychology in particular that he in the 1900s labelled \"objective psychology\" and from the 1910s renamed \"reflexology.\" The article examines the equivocal place that Bekhterev's \"objective psychology\" and \"reflexology\" occupied in Russian/Soviet child science in the first three decades of the 20(th) century. While Bekhterev's prominence in this field is beyond doubt, analysis shows that \"objective psychology\" and \"reflexology\" had much less success in mobilizing support within it than certain other movements in this arena (for example, \"experimental pedagogy\" in the pre-revolutionary era); it also found it difficult to compete with the variety of rival programs that arose within Soviet \"pedology\" during the 1920s. However, this article also demonstrates that the study of child development played a pivotal role in Bekhterev's program for the transformation of the human sciences: it was especially important to his efforts to ground in empirical phenomena and in concrete research practices a new ontology of the psychological, which, the article argues, underpinned \"objective psychology\"/\"reflexology\" as a transformative scientific movement."}, {"Title": "Reshaping Time: Recommendations for Suicide Prevention in LBGT Populations.

The folk psychology (FP) view puts our everyday normative conceptual scheme in the driver's seat - on the assumption that it, and it only, tells us what mental disorders are (1). Opposing this, the scientific image (SI) view (2, 3) holds that our understanding of mental disorders must come, wholly and solely, from the sciences of the mind, unfettered by FP. This paper argues that the FP view is problematic because it is too limited: there is more to the mind than FP allows; hence, we must look beyond FP for properly deep and illuminating explanations of mental disorders. SI promises just this. But when cast in its standard cognitivist formulations, SI is unnecessarily and unjustifiably neurocentric. After rejecting both the FP view, in its pure form, and SI view, in its popular cognitivist renderings, this paper concludes that a more liberal version of SI can accommodate what is best in both views - once SI is so formulated and the FP view properly edited and significantly revised, the two views can be reconciled and combined to provide a sound philosophical basis for a future psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Six-year trajectories of post-traumatic stress and severe psychological distress symptoms and associations with timing of trauma exposure, ongoing adversity and sense of injustice: a latent transition analysis of a community cohort in conflict-affected Timor-Leste.", "Abstract": "To identify the 6-year trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and psychological distress symptoms, and examine for associations with timing of trauma exposure, ongoing adversity and with the sense of injustice in conflict-affected Timor-Leste.\nA whole-of-household survey was conducted in 2004 and 2010 in Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste.\n1022 adults were followed up over 6 years (retention rate 84.5%). Interviews were conducted by field workers applying measures of traumatic events (TEs), ongoing adversity, a sense of injustice, PTS symptoms and psychological distress.\nLatent transition analysis supported a 3-class longitudinal model (psychological distress, comorbid symptoms and low symptoms). We derived 4 composite trajectories comprising recovery (20.8%), a persisting morbidity trajectory (7.2%), an incident trajectory (37.2%) and a low-symptom trajectory (34.7%). Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the persistent and incident trajectories reported greater stress arising from poverty and family conflict, higher TE exposure for 2 historical periods, and a sense of injustice for 2 historical periods. The persistent trajectory was unique in reporting greater TE exposure in the Indonesian occupation, whereas the incident trajectory reported greater TE exposure during the later internal conflict that occurred between baseline and follow-up. Compared with the low-symptom trajectory, the incident trajectory reported a greater sense of injustice relating to the periods of the Indonesian occupation and independence. The persistent trajectory was characterised by a sense of injustice relating to the internal conflict and contemporary times. The recovery trajectory was characterised by the absence of these risk factors, the only difference from the low-symptom trajectory being that the former reported a sense of injustice for the period surrounding independence.\nOur findings suggest that the timing of both TE exposure and the focus of a sense of injustice may differentiate those with persisting and new-onset mental health morbidity in settings of recurrent conflict."}, {"Title": "Computational psychiatry as a bridge from neuroscience to clinical applications.", "Abstract": "Translating advances in neuroscience into benefits for patients with mental illness presents enormous challenges because it involves both the most complex organ, the brain, and its interaction with a similarly complex environment. Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction.

The monoamine theory, which hypothesizes that MDD emerges as a result of dysfunctional serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways, has guided the therapy of this illness for several decades. More recently, the involvement of activated immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways and of decreased levels of neurotrophic factors has provided emerging insights regarding the pathophysiology of MDD, leading to integrated theories emphasizing the complex interplay of these mechanisms that could lead to neuroprogression. In this review, we propose an integrative model suggesting that T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of MDD through (i) microglial activation, (ii) interactions with oxidative and nitrosative stress, (iii) increases of autoantibody production and the propensity for autoimmunity, (iv) disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and (v) dysregulation of the gut mucosa and microbiota.

This requires discipline-specific education that is not only grounded in professional practice but also prepares would-be scientists in the application of the sophisticated techniques that characterize today's high research standards. Doctoral-level education is an important primer for future scientific endeavors across disciplines. This study examined 2334 theses published across Sweden in public health, criminology, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, social work, and sociology during the period 1997-2012. Of the theses reviewed, 13% aimed to investigate the effects of interventions. The highest percentage of effectiveness studies was found in nursing, public health, and psychology. The percentage of outcome research increased during the period.

Tracing lines of connection between the history of sociology and the contemporary landscape of biology, the paper argues for a reconfiguration of this relationship beyond popular rhetorics of 'biologization' or 'medicalization'. At the heart of the paper is a claim that, today, there are some potent new frames for re-imagining the traffic between sociological and biological research - even for 'revitalizing' the sociological enterprise as such. The paper threads this argument through one empirical case: the relationship between urban life and mental illness. In its first section, it shows how this relationship enlivened both early psychiatric epidemiology, and some forms of the new discipline of sociology; it then traces the historical division of these sciences, as the sociological investment in psychiatric questions waned, and 'the social' become marginalized within an increasingly 'biological' psychiatry. In its third section, however, the paper shows how this relationship has lately been revivified, but now by a nuanced epigenetic and neurobiological attention to the links between mental health and urban life. What role can sociology play here? In its final section, the paper shows how this older sociology, with its lively interest in the psychiatric and neurobiological vicissitudes of urban social life, can be our guide in helping to identify intersections between sociological and biological attention. With a new century now underway, the paper concludes by suggesting that the relationship between urban life and mental illness may prove a core testing-ground for a 'revitalized' sociology."}, {"Title": "[Intervention of Schizophrenia From the Community Model].", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is a complex disease for which pharmacological management is an insufficient therapeutic measure to ensure adaptation to the community and restoring the quality of life of the patient, with a multidimensional management and community interventions being necessary.\nCase report.\nThis case report illustrates a multidisciplinary treatment response, based on a community care model for mental health from Envigado, Colombia.\nThe management of schizophrenia requires multimodal interventions that include community screening, psychoeducation of individuals, their families and society, addressing different areas of operation that allow adaptation of the subject to his social environment.\nA integrated intervention that can be provided on a Community scale, with the implementation of policies that allow it to be applied."}, {"Title": "[Not Available].", "Abstract": "To analyse sociodemographic characteristics, descriptive psychopathology and therapy in the first decade of service of the Hospital Psiqui\u00e1trico San Isidro del Valle del Cauca, 1958-1968.\nRetrospective descriptive study of a series of case histories of the studied period, and by qualitative analysis and conceptual networks.\nSociodemographic variables were analysed, and it was observed that, although the patient population increased, hospitalisation was reduced due to the implementation of a \"Day Hospital\" and outpatient services.

This condition is known as neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS), which includes apathy, lack of initiative, anhedonia, indifference, blunted affect, and reduced insight into disease. Although this old concept now appears almost forgotten, neuroleptics, whether typical or atypical, can make depression or bipolar disorder resemble other more refractory conditions, readily leading to mistaken diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The authors describe three cases of NIDS superimposed on depressive phase in bipolar disorder with psychosis, where the attending psychiatrist's failure to recognize NIDS prevented patients from receiving effective treatment and achieving remission. All cases achieved remission after reduction of neuroleptics and intensive therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy, for bipolar depression. The concept of NIDS was originally introduced for schizophrenia, and it has rarely been highlighted in other diseases. In recent years, however, atypical antipsychotics are being more often administered to patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists, therefore, should also remember and exercise caution regarding NIDS in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with and without psychosis. The authors believe that the concept of NIDS needs to be reappraised in current psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Justifications for coercive care in child and adolescent psychiatry, a content analysis of medical documentation in Sweden.", "Abstract": "There has been considerable interest in normative ethics regarding how and when coercive care can be justified. However, only a few empirical studies consider how professionals reason about ethical aspects when assessing the need for coercive care for adults, and even less concerning children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine and describe how professionals document their value arguments when considering the need for coercive psychiatric care of young people.\nAll 16 clinics that admitted children or adolescents to coercive care during one year in Sweden were included in the study. These clinics had a total of 155 admissions of 142 patients over one year. Qualitative content analysis with a deductive approach was used to find different forms of justification for coercive care that was documented in the medical records, including Care Certificates.\nThe analysis of medical records revealed two main arguments used to justify coercive care in child and adolescent psychiatry: 1) the protection argument - the patients needed protection, mainly from themselves, and 2) the treatment requirement argument - coercive care was a necessary measure for administering treatment to the patient. Other arguments, namely the caregiver support argument, the clarification argument and the solidarity argument, were used primarily to support the two main arguments. These supportive arguments were mostly used when describing the current situation, not in the explicit argumentation for coercive care. The need for treatment was often only implicitly clarified and the type of care the patient needed was not specified. Few value arguments were used in the decision for coercive care; instead physicians often used their authority to convince others that treatment was necessary.\nOne clinical implication of the study is that decisions about the use of coercive care should have a much stronger emphasis on ethical aspects. There is a need for an ethical legitimacy founded upon explicit ethical reasoning and after communication with the patient and family, which should be documented together with the decision to use coercive care."}, {"Title": "'There's the record, closed and final': Rough for Theatre II as Psychiatric Encounter.", "Abstract": "A co-authored collaboration between a theatre practitioner and a clinical psychiatrist, this paper will examine Rough for Theatre II (RFTII) and Beckett's demonstration of the way records are used to understand the human subject. Using Beckett's play to explore interdisciplinary issues of embodiment and diagnosis, the authors will present a dialogue that makes use of the 'best sources' in precisely the same manner as the play's protagonists. One of those sources will be Beckett himself, as Heron will locate the play in its theatrical context through reflections upon his own practice (with Fail Better Productions, UK) as well as recent studies such as Beckett, Technology and the Body (Maude 2009) and Performing Embodiment in Samuel Beckett's Drama (McMullan 2010); another source will be the philosopher Wilhelm Windleband, whose 1901 History of Philosophy was read and noted upon by Beckett in the 1930s, as Broome will introduce a philosophical and psychiatric context to the exchange. Windelband is now a neglected figure in philosophy; but as one of the key figures of Neo-Kantianism in the late 19(th) century, his work was an important impetus to that of Rickert, Weber and Heidegger. Specifically, Windelband gives us the distinction between idiographic and nomothetic understanding of individuals, an approach that is of relevance to the psychiatric encounter. This academic dialogue will consider tensions between subjectivity and objectivity in clinical and performance practice, while examining Beckett's analysis of the use of case notes and relating them back to Windelband's ideas on the understanding of others. The dialogue took place in 2011 at the University of Warwick, and has since been edited by the authors."}, {"Title": "Commentary: The devastating effects of ignoring child maltreatment in psychiatry--a commentary on Teicher and Samson 2016.", "Abstract": "Despite the numerous studies over the past 30 years that have clarified the devastating effects of child maltreatment on mental and physical health, the role of trauma within the caregiving system remains unrecognized both in our diagnostic systems and in our dominant treatment paradigms. Research of people with histories of caregiver abuse and neglect consistently demonstrates problems with concentration, anger, panic, depression, food intake, drugs, and sleep, as well as decreased Heart RateVariability, higher levels of stress hormones, and reduced or impaired immune response. Their relationship between documented brain changes and psychopathology is complex. Traumatic life experiences during childhood and adolescence are far more common than expected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that child maltreatment may be the most costly public health issue in the United States, Eradicating child abuse in America would\u00a0reduce the overall rate of depression by more than half, alcoholism by two-thirds, and suicide, serious drug abuse, and domestic violence by three quarters. It would also have a significantly positive effect on workplace performance, and vastly decrease the need for\u00a0incarceration. The current practice of applying multiple distinct comorbid diagnoses to traumatized children prevents a comprehensive treatment approach. Approaching their problems from a framework of memories of discreet traumatic ignores the fact that the damage affects the brain's neural circuitry and goes well beyond dealing with discrete painful events. Our great challenge is to learn to utilize the brain's neuroplasticity to reorganize defective brain circuits."}, {"Title": "Editorial: Looking beyond the horizon--innovation in child psychology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "As readers will no doubt be well aware, the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry dedicates an entire issue, once a year, to state-of-the-art authoritative reviews of research on some of the central issues in our field.(1) I like to think that in doing so we have been quietly undertaking a giant Pavlovian conditioning experiment: every year, as the spring flowers start to blossom (in the northern hemisphere at least), the nucleus accumbens of child psychologists and psychiatrists around the world begin to glow in anticipation of intellectual reward."}, {"Title": "Antipsychotic Use in Hospitalized Adults: Rates, Indications, and Predictors.", "Abstract": "To investigate patterns and predictors of use of antipsychotics in hospitalized adults.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nAcademic medical center.\nIndividuals aged 18 and older hospitalized from August 2012 to August 2013, excluding those admitted to obstetrics and gynecology or psychiatry or with a psychotic disorder.\nUse was ascertained from pharmacy charges. Potentially excessive dosing was defined using guidelines for long-term care facilities. A review of 100 records was performed to determine reasons for use.\nThe cohort included 17,775 admissions with a median age 64; individuals could have been admitted more than once during the study period. Antipsychotics were used in 9%, 55% of which were initiations. The most common reasons for initiation were delirium (53%) and probable delirium (12%).

These advances in technology have significantly transformed various aspects of healthcare. The advent of E-health and its influence on healthcare practice also implies that there is a paradigm shift in the way healthcare professionals work. Conventionally, healthcare professionals would have to refer to books and journals for updates in treatment algorithms, but with the advent of technology, they could access this information via the web or via various smartphone applications on the go. In the field of Psychiatry, one of the commonest mental health disorder to date, with significant morbidity and mortality is that of Major depressive disorder. Routinely, clinicians and healthcare professionals are advised to refer to standard guidelines in guiding them with regards to their treatment options. Given the high prevalence of conditions like Major Depressive Disorder, it is thus of importance that whatever guidelines that clinicians and healthcare professionals refer to are constantly kept up to date, so that patients could benefit from latest evidence based therapy and treatment. A review of the current literature highlights that whilst there are a multitude of smartphone applications designed for mental health care, previous systematic review has highlighted a paucity of evidence based applications. More importantly, current literature with regards to provision of treatment information to healthcare professionals and patients are limited to web-based interventions. It is the aim of this technical note to highlight a methodology to which the authors have conceptualized in the implementation of an evidence based mental health guideline applications, known as the `Wiki Guidelines' smartphone application.

However, the increasing availability and feasibility of using imaging modalities, such as diffusion imaging and resting-state fMRI, enable longitudinal mapping of brain development. This shift in the field is opening the possibility of identifying predictive markers of risk or prognosis, and also represents a critical missing element for efforts to promote personalized or individualized medicine in psychiatry (i.e., stratified psychiatry).\nThe present work provides a selective review of potentially high-yield populations for longitudinal examination with MRI, based upon our understanding of risk from epidemiologic studies and initial MRI findings.\nOur discussion is organized into three topic areas: (1) practical considerations for establishing temporal precedence in psychiatric research; (2) readiness of the field for conducting longitudinal MRI, particularly for neurodevelopmental questions; and (3) illustrations of high-yield populations and time windows for examination that can be used to rapidly generate meaningful and useful data.

This objective, however, is often challenged by difficulties in identifying homogeneous clinical populations. Melancholia, a biological and endogenous subtype for major depressive disorder, presents a canonical test case in the search of biological nosology.\nWe employed a unique combination of naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms - resting state and free viewing of emotionally salient films - to search for neurobiological signatures of depression subtypes. fMRI data were acquired from 57 participants; 17 patients with melancholia, 17 patients with (non-melancholic) major depression and 23 matched healthy controls.\nPatients with melancholia showed a prominent loss of functional connectivity in hub regions [including ventral medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior temporal gyrus] during natural viewing, and in the posterior cingulate cortex while at rest. Of note, the default mode network showed diminished reactivity to external stimuli in melancholia, which correlated with the severity of anhedonia. Intriguingly, the subgenual ACC, a potential target for treating depression with deep brain stimulation (DBS), showed divergent changes between the two depression subtypes, with increased connectivity in the non-melancholic and decreased connectivity in the melancholic subsets.\nThese findings reveal neurobiological changes specific to depression subtypes during ecologically valid behavioural conditions, underscoring the critical need to respect differing neurobiological processes underpinning depressive subtypes."}, {"Title": "Treatment no-show in forensic outpatients with ADHD.", "Abstract": "'No-show' is important in today's mental healthcare services, yet in forensic psychiatry, little is known about its relationship to general and disorder-specific patient characteristics.\nThe aim of this article is to determine the prevalence of no-show and any general and disorder-specific features associated with no-show in a cohort of offenders with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder registered at a specialist forensic mental health clinic.\nParticipants were 118 adult men with a mean age just over 32\u2009years (SD 8.75) attending forensic mental health outpatient clinics in the Netherlands who had a primary diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and who had been aggressive and/or delinquent.\nOver a 1-year period, most patients (101, 86%) missed at least one appointment.

Laughter is produced in several different situations: in response to external physical, cognitive, or emotional stimuli; to negotiate social interactions; and also, pathologically, as a consequence of neural damage. For this reason, laughter has attracted researchers from many disciplines. A consequence of this multidisciplinarity is the absence of a holistic vision of this complex behavior: the methods of analysis and classification of laughter, as well as the terminology used, are heterogeneous; the findings sometimes contradictory and poorly documented. This survey aims at collecting and presenting objective measurement methods and results from a variety of different studies in different fields, to contribute to build a unified model and taxonomy of laughter.

If these scores were (sub)clinical, parents were invited to participate in a telephonic interview. This consisted of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS). If the results indicate psychopathology, further psychiatric assessment and, if necessary, treatment is offered.\nThe first response was 55.7% and, if indicated, most of the parents agreed on further diagnostics. On the ASR 2 out of 5 mothers (42.1%) and 1 out of 5 fathers (21.8%) reported problems that could point to a psychiatric disorder. According to the ASR, within this high-risk group 37% of the mothers met the criteria for an axis I diagnosis (less than one month earlier) compared to 70.6% of the fathers.

Initially, research on the placebo effect has focused on the mechanisms of pain and analgesia. The cognitive processes of conditioning and reward anticipation (hope of a relief) were highlighted. The involvement of different neurobiological pathways has been clearly shown: endogenous opioids, CCK, dopaminergic pathways, endocannabinoids, immunological factors... More recently, the field has open towards new perspectives: depression and anxiety, motor disorders, immune system, endocrine system. Intensive research in the field emerges because of its fundamental implications in neuroscience research but also because of the ethical, clinical and therapeutical issues. Moreover, the placebo effect is considered as a main methodological mean issue in clinical trials that allows the demonstration of the efficacy and tolerance of new drugs. In the field of psychiatry, depression is a placebo highly-sensitive disorder: placebo response rates in clinical trials are of the order of 30 % to 40 %. The identification of biological markers of placebo response, such as neuroimaging and quantitative electroencephalography may lead to develop more efficient models in clinical research."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric risk factors predicting post-liver transplant physical and psychiatric complications: a literature review.", "Abstract": "The psychiatric assessment of potential liver transplant recipients is becoming increasingly common in clinical practice. In such assessments, the psychiatrist is invited by the transplant team to assess the patient prior to the patient receiving a transplant liver to identify factors that could predict an unsuccessful post-transplant course, whether this is from a psychiatric or physical perspective. This review examined published research from 2000 to 2014 on psychological risk factors predicting post-transplant physical and psychiatric complications.\nBased on the strength of the evidence available, our review identified four risk factors: mood disorders; social supports; substance misuse; and alcohol dependence. These factors could potentially provide a framework to guide the evaluation and prediction of psychological and physical complications post-liver transplantation."}, {"Title": "Should Psychiatrists Resurrect the Body?", "Abstract": "The current article interrogates the mind-body dualism that characterizes modern psychiatry and contends that the dualism is manifested by the relative neglect by psychiatrists of the body, or soma. The article argues that the state of affairs has several consequences, including psychiatrists' underappreciation of the somatic manifestations of mental disorders and of the therapeutic potential of somatic or body-based therapies. Empirical data attest to the association of a range of mental illnesses with somatic pathologies, as does the fact that a range of somatic therapies, including yoga and t'ai chi, are increasingly being shown to be efficacious in the treatment of a range of mental illnesses. The current article contextualizes contemporary Western psychiatry's relative neglect of the body by drawing on some historical as well as cross-cultural perspectives. Although their overall effect has been minimal, various theoretical perspectives in Western psychiatry, including Jungian thought, psychoanalytical psychosomatics, Reichian and related schools, and the phenomenological tradition, have sought to overcome psychiatry's mind-body dualism. Neither has psychiatry incorporated the values of various non-Western schools of medicine that maintain a far more integrated conceptualization of the relationship between mind and body than is seen in modern Western psychiatry. The field of psychosomatics could potentially influence general psychiatry to reverse its bifurcated mind-body relationship, but that field's increasingly narrow mandate and organizational separation from general psychiatry conspire to militate against the latter's incorporation of psychosomatic medicine's conceptual advances or pragmatic insights in any convincing or enduring manner."}, {"Title": "[Man at the Frontier of his Being: Scope of the Concept of \"Limit Situation\" in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Following Jaspers' Existential Ontology].", "Abstract": "The existential concept of \"limit situation\" was proposed by Jaspers as the inevitable threshold of human beings at their ordinary mode of being, namely Dasein, which has to be crossed to reach Existence as the proper mode of being after having transcended an existential challenge. A failure at facing limit situations indicates that they are ineluctable and have to be assumed.\nThe starting point is the analysis of Jaspers' concept of limit situations, both within the antinomic structure of the human condition as well as the duality of being-in-the-world. An attempt is made here to interpret the ontological determination of the limit situation as an ontic one, which could be relevant to psychiatric and psychotherapeutic practice.\nThe distinction between Dasein and Existence as modes of being is at the basis of Jaspers' existential philosophy. Limit situations cannot be veiled; therefore, they require a transcendence movement of the self in order to overcome enclosures and to reach the mode of being of Existence as authentic selfhood. Jaspers creates an ontological typology of limit situations in which suffering plays a key role. An ontic correspondence for psychiatry and psychotherapy refers to the importance of critical life events, of suicidality, of rigid thought styles and behavior patterns as enclosures; illness is both a limit situation in itself and also its consequence. In anthropological terms, the concepts of existential vulnerability and competence in dealing with limit situations have proved to be rewarding.\nThe ontic correspondence to Jaspers' ontological concept of limit situations suggested by the author makes a fruitful contribution to psychiatry and psychotherapy, because it draws attention to the person-environment fit as a possible predetermined breaking point that could lead to psychopathologically relevant failure. Critical life events understood as relational, as well as existential vulnerability and defense mechanisms biographically illuminated could contribute to an improvement of competence in dealing with limit situations within the psychotherapeutic practice."}, {"Title": "Psychophysiology of threat response, paradigm shifts in psychiatry, and RDoC: Implications for genetic investigation of psychopathology.", "Abstract": "Two articles in this issue seek to further the goal of NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to develop new approaches for investigating mental disorders, using fundamental dimensions that cut across traditional disorder categories and align more closely with mechanisms that underlie psychopathology. One article, by Lang, McTeague, and Bradley, describes the construction of such a disorder cross-crossing dimension of fear response.

Sensory rooms can provide stimulation via sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste in a demand-free environment that is controlled by the patient. The rooms may reduce patients' distress and agitation, as well as rates of seclusion and restraint. Successful implementation of sensory rooms is influenced by the attitudes and approach of staff. This paper presents a study of the experiences of 126 staff members who worked with sensory rooms in a Swedish inpatient psychiatry setting. A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used. Data were collected by a web based self-report 12-item questionnaire that included both open- and closed-ended questions. Our findings strengthen the results of previous research in this area in many ways. Content analyses revealed three main categories: hopes and concerns, focusing on patients' self-care, and the room as a sanctuary. Although staff initially described both negative and positive expectations of sensory rooms, after working with the rooms, there was a strong emphasis on more positive experiences, such as letting go of control and observing an increase in patients' self-confidence, emotional self-care and well-being. Our findings support the important principals of person-centred nursing and recovery-oriented mental health and the ability of staff to implement these principles by working with sensory rooms."}, {"Title": "Influencing Factors on Choosing Psychiatry as a Career: An Exploration in Chinese University Students.", "Abstract": "There is a consistent need of psychiatric professionals in the world including China, and a consistent challenge to recruit more medical students into the psychiatric careers. We aimed to look for factors which have an impact on career-choosing of psychiatry in Chinese university students. We invited 508 non-medical students (NM), 304 medical students without (MO) and 123 medical students with clinical internship experience (MW), to answer a matrix of 43 questions regarding factors influencing career-choosing of psychiatry. Answers to these questions were analyzed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, once the latent factors were identified and structurally-validated, their mean scores in three groups of students were calculated. Five factors with five items each were identified, namely social status inferiority, career importance, practice reward, career preference, and practice stress. NM scored lower than MO and MW did on Social Status Inferiority; NM group scored higher than MO and MW groups did on Career Importance; MW scored lower than NM and MO did on Practice Reward and on Career Preference; Regarding Practice Stress, NM scored higher than MO did, who then in turn, scored higher than MW did. In addition, Practice Stress was positively correlated with advice of the medical educators; and Social Status Inferiority and Career Preference were positively correlated with the psychiatry teaching of the medical educators. Raising career rewards, improving social status, and reinforcing psychiatric education might help to recruit more medical students to specialize in psychiatry practicing."}, {"Title": "EPA guidance on improving the image of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper explores causes, explanations and consequences of the negative image of psychiatry and develops recommendations for improvement. It is primarily based on a WPA guidance paper on how to combat the stigmatization of psychiatry and psychiatrists and a Medline search on related publications since 2010. Furthermore, focussing on potential causes and explanations, the authors performed a selective literature search regarding additional image-related issues such as mental health literacy and diagnostic and treatment issues. Underestimation of psychiatry results from both unjustified prejudices of the general public, mass media and healthcare professionals and psychiatry's own unfavourable coping with external and internal concerns. Issues related to unjustified devaluation of psychiatry include overestimation of coercion, associative stigma, lack of public knowledge, need to simplify complex mental issues, problem of the continuum between normality and psychopathology, competition with medical and non-medical disciplines and psychopharmacological treatment. Issues related to psychiatry's own contribution to being underestimated include lack of a clear professional identity, lack of biomarkers supporting clinical diagnoses, limited consensus about best treatment options, lack of collaboration with other medical disciplines and low recruitment rates among medical students. Recommendations are proposed for creating and representing a positive self-concept with different components. The negative image of psychiatry is not only due to unfavourable communication with the media, but is basically a problem of self-conceptualization. Much can be improved. However, psychiatry will remain a profession with an exceptional position among the medical disciplines, which should be seen as its specific strength."}, {"Title": "Locating the Social Origins of Mental Illness: The Explanatory Models of Mental Illness Among Clergy from Different Ethnic and Faith Backgrounds.", "Abstract": "Clergy have historically provided 'healing' through various spiritual and medical modalities and even in modern, developed welfare economies they may still be an important help-seeking resource. Partnerships between religion and psychiatry are regularly advocated, but there is scant research on clergy explanatory models of illness. This paper aimed to explore their relationship with psychiatry and to examine how clergy in various faith groups conceptualised mental health problems. In this qualitative study using in-depth interviews, these issues were explored with 32 practising clergy in the UK from a range of different Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith organisations and ethnic backgrounds. This paper presents findings related to clergy explanatory models of mental illness and, in particular, how the social factors involved in causation are tinged with spiritual influences and implications, and how the meanings of mental distress assume a social and moral significance in distinctive localised matters."}, {"Title": "Which are the most useful scales for predicting repeat self-harm? A systematic review evaluating risk scales using measures of diagnostic accuracy.", "Abstract": "The aims of this review were to calculate the diagnostic accuracy statistics of risk scales following self-harm and consider which might be the most useful scales in clinical practice.\nSystematic review.\nWe based our search terms on those used in the systematic reviews carried out for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence self-harm guidelines (2012) and evidence update (2013), and updated the searches through to February 2015 (CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO). Methodological quality was assessed and three reviewers extracted data independently. We limited our analysis to cohort studies in adults using the outcome of repeat self-harm or attempted suicide. We calculated diagnostic accuracy statistics including measures of global accuracy. Statistical pooling was not possible due to heterogeneity.\nThe eight papers included in the final analysis varied widely according to methodological quality and the content of scales employed. Overall, sensitivity of scales ranged from 6% (95% CI 5% to 6%) to 97% (CI 95% 94% to 98%). The positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 5% (95% CI 3% to 9%) to 84% (95% CI 80% to 87%). The diagnostic OR ranged from 1.01 (95% CI 0.434 to 2.5) to 16.3 (95%CI 12.5 to 21.4). Scales with high sensitivity tended to have low PPVs.\nIt is difficult to be certain which, if any, are the most useful scales for self-harm risk assessment. No scales perform sufficiently well so as to be recommended for routine clinical use. Further robust prospective studies are warranted to evaluate risk scales following an episode of self-harm. Diagnostic accuracy statistics should be considered in relation to the specific service needs, and scales should only be used as an adjunct to assessment."}, {"Title": "Perception of occupational balance by people with mental illness: A new methodology.", "Abstract": "Aims The aims were to (i) investigate initial construct validity of a tool for assessment of time allocation in occupational balance, and (ii) describe perceived occupational balance and its relationship with socio-demographics, well-being, and personal recovery among people with mental illness. Methods Satisfaction with Daily Occupations and Occupational Balance (SDO-OB) was administered to 226 persons. SDO-OB reflects balance in five occupational domains: work, leisure, home chores, self-care, and overall occupational balance. Indicators for assessing construct validity were: satisfaction with everyday occupations, occupational value, symptom severity, and psychosocial functioning. For the second aim, the data collection included socio-demographics, life quality, self-esteem, self-mastery, and personal recovery. Results Occupational balance ratings indicated the participants were either under-occupied or in balance. Few were over-occupied. Feeling in balance was related to greater well-being and recovery compared with being under-occupied. Risk factors for under-occupation were younger age (in relation to work), and higher education (in relation to overall balance). Conclusions Associations with the indicators suggest initial construct validity. The SDO-OB is promising for assessment of occupational balance among people with mental illness. Being under-occupied was detrimental to well-being and recovery, and this indicates the importance of offering more occupational opportunities for people with mental illness."}, {"Title": "Toward Precision Psychiatry: Statistical Platform for the Personalized Characterization of Natural Behaviors.", "Abstract": "There is a critical need for new analytics to personalize behavioral data analysis across different fields, including kinesiology, sports science, and behavioral neuroscience. Specifically, to better translate and integrate basic research into patient care, we need to radically transform the methods by which we describe and interpret movement data. Here, we show that hidden in the \"noise,\" smoothed out by averaging movement kinematics data, lies a wealth of information that selectively differentiates neurological and mental disorders such as Parkinson's disease, deafferentation, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia from typically developing and typically aging controls. In this report, we quantify the continuous forward-and-back pointing movements of participants from a large heterogeneous cohort comprising typical and pathological cases. We empirically estimate the statistical parameters of the probability distributions for each individual in the cohort and report the parameter ranges for each clinical group after characterization of healthy developing and aging groups. We coin this newly proposed platform for individualized behavioral analyses \"precision phenotyping\" to distinguish it from the type of observational-behavioral phenotyping prevalent in clinical studies or from the \"one-size-fits-all\" model in basic movement science. We further propose the use of this platform as a unifying statistical framework to characterize brain disorders of known etiology in relation to idiopathic neurological disorders with similar phenotypic manifestations."}, {"Title": "Moving Toward Integrative, Multidimensional Research in Modern Psychiatry: Lessons Learned From Fragile X Syndrome.", "Abstract": "The field of psychiatry is approaching a major inflection point. The basic science behind cognition, emotion, behavior, and social processes has been advancing rapidly in the past 20 years. However, clinical research supporting the classification system in psychiatry has not kept up with these scientific advances. To begin organizing the basic science of psychiatry in a comprehensive manner, we begin by selecting fragile X syndrome, a neurogenetic disease with cognitive-behavioral manifestations, to illustrate key concepts in an integrative, multidimensional model. Specifically, we describe key genetic and molecular mechanisms (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acidergic dysfunction and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5-associated long-term depression) relevant to the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome as well as neural correlates of cognitive-behavioral symptoms. We then describe what we have learned from fragile X syndrome that may be applicable to other psychiatric disorders.

This study examined the IL-18 levels, the cognitive function, and their association in schizophrenia. We recruited 70 chronic patients and 75 normal controls and examined the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and IL-18 levels. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was assessed in chronic patients. IL-18 levels were increased in chronic patients as compared to normal controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). RBANS total score and the subscales of immediate memory and delayed memory were lower in patients than controls (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In patients, IL-18 levels were positively associated with RBANS total score and the subscales of immediate and delayed memory (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multiple regression analysis further confirmed that IL-18 was an independent contributor to RBANS total score and the aforementioned two indexes (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The gender of department-based leaders (chair, vice chair, division director) and residency program directors was determined from websites of 950 academic departments of anesthesiology, diagnostic radiology, general surgery, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Each specialty's representation ratio-proportion of leadership roles held by women in 2013 divided by proportion of residents in 1990 who were women-and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A ratio of 1 indicates proportionate representation.\nWomen were significantly underrepresented among chairs for all specialties (ratios 0.60 or less, P\u2264.02) and division directors for all specialties except anesthesiology (ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.87-1.46) and diagnostic radiology (ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.81-1.16). The representation ratio for vice chair was below 1.0 for all specialties except anesthesiology; this finding reached statistical significance only for pathology, pediatrics, and psychiatry. Women were significantly overrepresented as residency program directors in general surgery, anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (ratios greater than 1.19, P\u2264.046). Obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics had the highest proportions of residents in 1990 and department leaders in 2013 who were women.\nDespite having the largest proportion of leaders who were women, representation ratios demonstrate obstetrics and gynecology is behind other specialties in progression of women to departmental leadership. Women's overrepresentation as residency program directors raises concern because education-based academic tracks may not lead to major leadership roles."}, {"Title": "Reducing violence in forensic care - how does it resemble the domains of a recovery-oriented care?", "Abstract": "Forensic psychiatry is characterized by involuntary treatment and risk of violence.

We sought to explore risk factors for psychiatric disorders in children and youth with epilepsy, with emphasis on executive dysfunction, along with seizure-related and psychosocial factors.\nThe cohort consisted of one hundred and one consecutive patients aged 10-19 years with focal (n=52) or genetic generalized (n=49) epilepsy. All were screened for psychiatric symptoms, using part of an extensive questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for both patients and their parents. Participants scoring in the borderline or abnormal range on the SDQ received a psychiatric interview (Kiddie-SADS-PL). All participants underwent a neuropsychological examination, and those with general cognitive abilities (IQ)<70 were excluded.\nForty-seven of 101 participants (46.5%) had a SDQ score in the borderline or abnormal range and underwent a psychiatric evaluation. Of these, 44 (93.6%) met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being ADHD and anxiety. An executive deficit was identified in 26.8% of the participants with a psychiatric diagnosis, but in only 5.4% of those without such a diagnosis (p=0.003). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that executive dysfunction was an independent risk factor for having a psychiatric disorder (OR 8.2, CI 1.8-37.2, p=0.006), along with male gender (OR 2.9, CI 1.2-7.3, p=0.02), and early seizure onset (0.86-that is one year older equals risk of psychiatric disorder reduced by 14%-CI 0.77-0.96, p=0.01). Other epilepsy-related or psychosocial factors were not significantly associated with psychiatric disorders.\nMultiple factors are associated with psychiatric problems in children and youth with epilepsy.

It presents the need for a psychopharmacotherapy education in psychiatric training programmes. Arguments as well as a proposal for a catalogue of learning objectives and an outline of a psychopharmacology curriculum are presented. Methods Based on their experience and on an analysis of the literature, the authors, experts in psychopharmacology-pharmacotherapy teaching, critically analyse the present situation and propose the development of a curriculum at the European level. Results Teaching programmes vary widely between European countries and, generally, teaching of psychopharmacology and pharmacotherapy does not exceed two-dozen hours. This is insufficient if one considers the central importance of psychopharmacology. A psychopharmacology-psychopharmacotherapy curriculum for the professional training of specialists in psychiatry and psychotherapy is proposed.

Neuroimaging studies of the functional architecture of the brain suggest common neural substrates underlying MDD and SUDs. Intrinsic brain activity is organized into a set of functional networks, of which two are particularly relevant to psychiatry. The salience network (SN) is crucial for cognitive control and response inhibition, and deficits in SN function are implicated across a wide variety of psychiatric disorders, including MDD and SUDs. The ventromedial network (VMN) corresponds to the classic reward circuit, and pathological VMN activity for drug cues/negative stimuli is seen in SUDs/MDD. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, including rTMS and tDCS, have been used to enhance cortico-striatal-thalamic activity through the core SN nodes in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and anterior insula. Improvements in both MDD and SUD symptoms ensue, including in comorbid cases, via enhanced cognitive control. Inhibition of the VMN also appears promising in preclinical studies for quenching the pathological incentive salience underlying SUDs and MDD. Evolving techniques may further enhance the efficacy of NIBS for MDD and SUD cases that are unresponsive to conventional treatments."}, {"Title": "Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes): A new model for educating primary care providers about treatment of substance use disorders.", "Abstract": "Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) trains and mentors primary care providers (PCPs) in the care of patients with complex conditions.

We tabulate the number of teleECHO clinic sessions, participants, and CME/CEU (continuing medical education/continuing education unit) credits provided annually. This teleECHO clinic has also been used to recruit physicians to participate in DATA-2000 buprenorphine waiver trainings. Using a database of the practice location of physicians who received the buprenorphine waiver since 2002, the number of waivered physicians per capita in US states was calculated. The increase in waivered physicians practicing in underserved areas in New Mexico was evaluated and compared with the rest of the United States.\nSince 2008, approximately 950 patient cases have been presented during the teleECHO clinic, and more than 9000\u00a0hours of CME/CEU have been awarded. Opioids are the substances discussed most commonly (31%), followed by alcohol (21%) and cannabis (12%). New Mexico is near the top among US states in DATA-2000 buprenorphine-waivered physicians per capita, and it has had much more rapid growth in waivered physicians practicing in traditionally underserved areas compared with the rest of the United States since the initiation of the teleECHO clinic focused on SUDs in 2005.\nThe ECHO model provides an opportunity to promote expansion of access to treatment for opioid use disorder and other SUDs, particularly in underserved areas."}, {"Title": "The differences in temperament-character traits, suicide attempts, impulsivity, and functionality levels of patients with bipolar disorder I and II.", "Abstract": "The primary aim of this study was to compare the differences in temperament-character traits, suicide attempts, impulsivity, and functionality levels of patients with bipolar disorder I (BD-I) and bipolar disorder II (BD-II).\nFifty-two BD-I patients and 49 BD-II patients admitted to Erenk\u00f6y Mental and Neurological Disease Training and Research Hospital psychiatry clinic and fifty age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. A structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Axis I Disorders, Temperament and Character Inventory, Barrett Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), Hamilton Depression Inventory Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Bipolar Disorder Functioning Questionnaire (BDFQ) were administered to patients and to control group.\nNo statistically significant difference in sociodemographic features existed between the patient and control groups (P>0.05). Thirty-eight subjects (37.62%) in the patient group had a suicide attempt. Twenty-three of these subjects (60.52%) had BD-I, and 15 of these subjects (39.47%) had BD-II. Suicide attempt rates in BD-I and II patients were 60.52% and 39.47%, respectively (P<0.05). Comparison of BD-I and II patients with healthy control subjects revealed that cooperativeness (C), self-directedness (Sdi), and self-transcendence (ST) scores were lower and novelty seeking (NS1 and NS2), harm avoidance (HA4), and reward dependence (RD2) subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-I. When BD-I patients were compared with BD-II patients, BIS-11 (attention) scores were higher in patients with BD-II and BIS-11 (motor and nonplanning impulsivity) scores were higher in patients with BD-I. According to BDFQ, relations with friends, participation in social activities, daily activities and hobbies, and occupation subscale scores were lower and taking initiative subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-I. Social withdrawal subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-II.\nIn our study, NS, HA, and RD scores that may be found high in suicide attempters and Sdi scores that may be found low in suicide attempters were as follows: NS1, NS2, HA4, and RD2 subscale scores were high and Sdi scores were low in patients with BD-I, suggesting a higher rate of suicide attempts in this group of patients. In addition, C and Sdi scores that indicate a predisposition to personality disorder were significantly lower in patients with BD-I than patients with BD-II and healthy controls, suggesting a higher rate of personality disorder comorbidity in patients with BD-I. Higher impulsivity and suicidality rates and poorer functionality in patients with BD-I also suggest that patients with BD-I may be more impulsive and more prone to suicide and have poorer functionality in some areas."}, {"Title": "The emergence of psychiatric semiology during the Age of Revolution: evolving concepts of 'normal' and 'pathological'.", "Abstract": "This article addresses some important questions in psychiatric semiology. The concept of a sign is crucial in psychiatry. How do signs emerge, and what gives them validity and legitimacy? What are the boundaries of 'normal' and 'pathological' behaviour and mental experiences? To address these issues, we analyse the characteristics and rules that govern semiological signs and clinical elements. We examine 'normality' from the perspective of Georges Canguilehm and compare the differences of 'normal' in physiology and psychiatry. We then examine the history and the philosophical, linguistic and medical-psychiatric origins of semiology during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (the Age of Revolution). The field of rhetoric and oratory has emphasized the importance of passions, emotions and language as applied to signs of madness. Another perspective on semiology, provided by Michel Foucault, lays stress on the concept of 'instinct' and the axis of voluntary-involuntary behaviour. Finally, we analyse how statistics and eugenics have played an important role in our current conceptualization of the norm and therefore the scientific discourse behind the established clinical signs."}, {"Title": "[Manpower requirements for medical doctors in psychiatric departments of community hospitals--bottom-up calculation for the psychiatric department of Donauspital in Vienna].", "Abstract": "Clinical psychiatry changed dramatically in the past 30 years.

Indeed, the \"biopsycho-social model\" (BPSM) developed by Dr. George L. Engel has been, and remains, the foundational model for academic psychiatry, notwithstanding malign market forces that have undermined the BPSM's use in clinical practice. The BPSM is integrally related to \"centralizing\" and integrative trends in American psychiatry that may be traced to Franz Alexander, Karl Jaspers, and Engel himself, among others.

When I started my psychiatric training almost 50 years ago, the prevailing model for understanding mental disorders was broadly bio/psycho/social in the grand tradition of Pinel and Freud, brought to and adapted in America by Adolph Meyer. When psychiatry is practiced well, it integrates insights from all the different ways of understanding human nature. Unfortunately, the mental health field has since degenerated into a civil war between the biomedical and psychosocial models with little room for compromise or finding middle ground. The inflexible biological reductionists assume that genes are destiny and that there is a pill for every problem: they take a \"mindless\" position. The inflexible psychosocial reductionists assume that mental health problems all arise from unpleasant experience: They take a \"brainless\" position. I have spent a good deal of frustrating time trying to open the minds of extremists at both ends, though rarely making much headway. In my view, however, and where I differ from Decker, the reductionisms do not sort so neatly into alternating historical periods."}, {"Title": "Cyclical swings: The b\u00eate noire of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Progress in psychiatry in the West has been retarded by the proclivity of the discipline to swing violently between 2 approaches to viewing mental illness; that is, emphasizing-to the exclusion of the other-the material-somatic vs the psychical-experiential avenues to knowledge.

We can examine this phenomenon historically by looking at Romantic psychiatry, mid-/late-19th century empirical psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and modern biological psychiatry. Looking at the 2 approaches in treatment today, the gold standard of patient care involves combining empirical/psychological care in 1 person (the psychiatrist) or shared between 2 clinicians working intimately with each other (psychiatrist with psychologist or social worker.) Yet as regards psychiatrists, they are discouraged from paying full attention to the psychological side by the way managed care and third-party payment have combined to remunerate them.

What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two \"flavors\" of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Oral acetate supplementation attenuates N-methyl D-aspartate receptor hypofunction-induced behavioral phenotypes accompanied by restoration of acetyl-histone homeostasis.", "Abstract": "Aberrations in cellular acetate-utilization processes leading to global histone hypoacetylation have been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia.\nHere, we investigated the role of acetate supplementation in the form of glyceryl triacetate (GTA) for the ability to restore the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced histone hypoacetylation and to ameliorate associated behavioral phenotypes in mice.\nTaking cues from the studies in SH-SY5Y cells, we monitored acetylation status of specific lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 (H3K9 and H4K8) to determine the impact of oral GTA supplementation in vivo. Mice treated chronically with MK-801 (10\u00a0days; 0.15\u00a0mg/kg daily) induced hypoacetylation of H3K9 and H4K8 in the hippocampus. Daily oral supplementation of GTA (2.9\u00a0g/kg) was able to prevent this MK801-induced hypoacetylation significantly. Though MK-801-stimulated decreases in acetyl-H3K9 and acetyl-H4K8 were found to be associated with ERK1/2 activation, GTA seemed to act independent of this pathway. Simultaneously, GTA administration was able to attenuate the chronic MK-801-induced cognitive behavior phenotypes in elevated plus maze and novel object recognition tests. Not only MK-801, GTA also demonstrated protective effects against behavioral phenotypes generated by another NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. Acute (single injection) ketamine-mediated hyperactivity phenotype and chronic (10\u00a0days treatment) ketamine-induced phenotype of exaggerated immobility in forced swim test were ameliorated by GTA.\nThe signature behavioral phenotypes induced by acute and chronic regimen of NMDA receptor antagonists seemed to be attenuated by GTA.

Healthy subjects (N = 36) were selected based on their Autism Quotient Spectrum (AQ) score, and AQ scores were assessed for correlations with model parameters and task scores.\nIndividual differences in AQ were inversely correlated with participants' task scores (r = -.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-.68, -.13]). Moreover, AQ scores were significantly correlated with a social weighting parameter that indicated how strongly the decision was influenced by the social cue (r = -.42, 95% CI [-.66, -.19]), but not with other model parameters. Also, more pronounced social weighting was related to higher scores (r = .50, 95% CI [.20, .86]).\nOur results demonstrate that higher autistic traits in healthy subjects are related to lower scores in a learning task that requires social cue integration. Computational modeling further demonstrates that these trait-related performance differences are not explained by an inability to process the social stimuli and its causes, but rather by the extent to which participants take into account social information during decision making."}, {"Title": "Influence of CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms on sertraline metabolism in major depression patients.", "Abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 may cause variability in the metabolism of sertraline, a widely used antidepressant in major depressive disorder treatment.\nThis study investigates the impact of CYP2B6*4 (785A > G), CYP2B6*9 (516G > T), CYP2B6*6 (516G > T + 685G > A) CYP2C19*2 (685G > A), CYP2C19*17 (-3402C > T) polymorphisms on plasma concentrations of sertraline and N-desmethyl sertraline in major depression patients treated with sertraline [n = 50].\nParticipants were patients who admitted to an adult psychiatry outpatient unit at a university hospital.

While most of the components of the method are based on established work, its novelty is that it provides a rigorous consolidated and generalised framework that addresses the whole life-cycle of BN model development. The method is based on two original and recent validated BN models in forensic psychiatry, known as DSVM-MSS and DSVM-P.\nWhen employed with the same datasets, the DSVM-MSS demonstrated competitive to superior predictive performance (AUC scores 0.708 and 0.797) against the state-of-the-art (AUC scores ranging from 0.527 to 0.705), and the DSVM-P demonstrated superior predictive performance (cross-validated AUC score of 0.78) against the state-of-the-art (AUC scores ranging from 0.665 to 0.717).

Therefore, there is a push to develop alternatives to psychotherapy- and medication-based approaches to addiction treatment. Two major cognitive factors have been identified that trigger relapse in addicted patients: attentional biases directed toward drug-related cues, which increase the urge to consume, and impaired response inhibition toward these cues, which makes it more difficult for addicted people to resist temptation. Recent studies on newly detoxified alcoholic patients have shown that by using the appropriate tasks to index these cognitive functions with event-related potentials (ERPs), it is possible to discriminate between future relapsers and nonrelapsers. These preliminary data suggest that the ERP technique has great clinical potential for preventing relapse in alcohol-dependent patients, as well as for addictive states in general. Indeed, ERPs may help to identify patients highly vulnerable to relapse and allow the development of individually adapted cognitive rehabilitation programs. The implementation of this combined approach requires an intense collaboration between psychiatry departments, clinical neurophysiology laboratories, and neuropsychological rehabilitation centers. The potential pitfalls and limitations of this approach are also discussed."}, {"Title": "Contribution of non-genetic factors to dopamine and serotonin receptor availability in the adult human brain.", "Abstract": "The dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission systems are of fundamental importance for normal brain function and serve as targets for treatment of major neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite central interest for these neurotransmission systems in psychiatry research, little is known about the regulation of receptor and transporter density levels. This lack of knowledge obscures interpretation of differences in protein availability reported in psychiatric patients. In this study, we used positron emission tomography (PET) in a twin design to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors, respectively, on dopaminergic and serotonergic markers in the living human brain. Eleven monozygotic and 10 dizygotic healthy male twin pairs were examined with PET and [(11)C]raclopride binding to the D2- and D3-dopamine receptor and [(11)C]WAY100635 binding to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor. Heritability, shared environmental effects and individual-specific non-shared effects were estimated for regional D2/3 and 5-HT1A receptor availability in projection areas. We found a major contribution of genetic factors (0.67) on individual variability in striatal D2/3 receptor binding and a major contribution of environmental factors (pairwise shared and unique individual; 0.70-0.75) on neocortical 5-HT1A receptor binding. Our findings indicate that individual variation in neuroreceptor availability in the adult brain is the end point of a nature-nurture interplay, and call for increased efforts to identify not only the genetic but also the environmental factors that influence neurotransmission in health and disease."}, {"Title": "[Minimal cerebral dysfunctions and ADHD in adulthood].", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is of great importance not only in children but also in adults; however, despite extensive research there are still many unsolved questions with respect to the diagnosis. Patients not only suffer from attention deficits and hyperactivity but also a variety of other problems, such as dyspraxia, problems with stimulus discrimination, dysgrammatism, legasthenia, or motor coordination problems. Furthermore, there are also psychopathological disorders, such as problems with memory, formal thinking, emotional modulation, drive and vegetative stability, in the sense of a psycho-organic syndrome. Such syndromes have long been known in psychiatry under terms, such as complex capacity disorders, minimal cerebral dysfunction (MCD), minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), mild psycho-organic syndrome, psycho-organic axis syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, developmental disorder and developmental biological syndrome. Etiological data with respect to genetics and early childhood brain trauma support the notion of a psychobiological disorder for complex cerebral dysfunction in the sense of a psycho-organic syndrome. Depending on the individual life and work situation, these additional symptoms of ADHD are in many cases of greater relevance for life adjustment than the core symptoms, depending on the individual life and work situations. The concept of minimal cerebral dysfunction describes the ADHD problem better and has a direct bearing on the diagnosis, therapy and sociomedical care of the patients."}, {"Title": "[Guideline-conform psychiatric psychotherapeutic treatment for patients with schizophrenia : A normative evaluation of necessary personnel requirements].", "Abstract": "Although national treatment guidelines and current publications of the German Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) recommend cognitive behavior therapy for all patients with schizophrenia, the implementation of these recommendations in current inpatient and outpatient treatment is only rudimentary.\nThe aim of this study was to systematically search randomized controlled studies (RCTs), meta-analyses and the guidelines of the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Psychosomatics and Neurology (DGPPN) and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in order to assess the number of personnel necessary for psychiatric and therapeutic inpatient treatment in line with present guidelines.

The internalization of emergency psychological interventions is necessary for every mental-health professional. The two primary categories of major manmade disasters in Taiwan over the past decade have been gas explosions and powder burns. Both categories have led to the serious injury of many individuals. The physical deformities and job problems faced by burn patients affect their psychiatric and emotional states both directly and indirectly. The psychiatric comorbidities of burn patients include: major depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with GAD and PTSD comprising the most significant comorbidities in terms of numbers of diagnoses. To reduce psychological problems in the future, mental-health professionals should use appropriate psychological first aid (PFA) interventions in the early stages of treatment and rehabilitation.

While prediction schemes based on symptom clustering and biomarkers have so far not yielded results of sufficient strength to inform clinical decision-making, prediction schemes based on big data predictive analytic models might be more practically useful.\nWe review evidence suggesting that prediction equations based on symptoms and other easily-assessed clinical features found in previous research to predict MDD treatment outcomes might provide a foundation for developing predictive analytic clinical decision support models that could help clinicians select optimal (personalised) MDD treatments. These methods could also be useful in targeting patient subsamples for more expensive biomarker assessments.\nApproximately two dozen baseline variables obtained from medical records or patient reports have been found repeatedly in MDD treatment trials to predict overall treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention v. control) or differential treatment outcomes (i.e., intervention A v. intervention B). Similar evidence has been found in observational studies of MDD persistence-severity. However, no treatment studies have yet attempted to develop treatment outcome equations using the full set of these predictors. Promising preliminary empirical results coupled with recent developments in statistical methodology suggest that models could be developed to provide useful clinical decision support in personalised treatment selection. These tools could also provide a strong foundation to increase statistical power in focused studies of biomarkers and MDD heterogeneity of treatment response in subsequent controlled trials.\nCoordinated efforts are needed to develop a protocol for systematically collecting information about established predictors of heterogeneity of MDD treatment response in large observational treatment studies, applying and refining these models in subsequent pragmatic trials, carrying out pooled secondary analyses to extract the maximum amount of information from these coordinated studies, and using this information to focus future discovery efforts in the segment of the patient population in which continued uncertainty about treatment response exists."}, {"Title": "The Association Between a Sense of Calling and Physician Well-Being: A National Study of Primary Care Physicians and Psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "This study assesses the association between calling and physician well-being, clinical commitment, and burnout.\nIn 2009-2010, a survey was mailed to 1504 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 512 psychiatrists drawn from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile.

Thus, this study aimed to translate and validate a French version of the Acceptability E-scale (AES), a 6-item self-reported questionnaire that evaluates the extent to which patients find E-health systems acceptable. A forward-backward translation of the AES was performed. The psychometric properties of the French AES version, with construct validity, internal structural validity and external validity (Pearson's coefficient between AES scores and depression symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory II) were analyzed. In a sample of 178 patients (mean age=46.51 years, SD=12.91 years), the validation process revealed satisfactory psychometric properties: factor analysis revealed two factors: \"Satisfaction\" (3 items) and \"Usability\" (3 items) and Cronbach's alpha was 0.7. No significant relation was found between AES scores and depression symptoms. The French version of the AES revealed a two-factor scale that differs from the original version.

But the main difficulty is its diagnosis. What resources are available in French which seem to help therapists in this process? We can distinguish the non-dimensional approach, the use of self-administered questionnaires or interviewer-administrated questionnaires. In this paper, for reasons of editing constraints, we are interested only in a non-dimensional approach and direct assessment measures by self-assessment, analysing the strengths and limitations of each and taking into account scientific studies that have been devoted to them and their clinical relevance. We first considered various aspects of non-dimensional approach through suicidal risk factors research, suicidal emergency and suicidal potential concepts, Shea approach, the model of Mann and some recommended evaluations. This type of approach has a number of advantages, but also limitations. Dimensional approach allows going further. In this article, we also discuss the existing self-assessment tools in French as for example dedicated item for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or specific scales such as Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL), Suicidal Probability Scale (SPS), Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and self-administered Suicide Risk Assessment Scale of Ducher (aRSD). These last two seem to be used as a priority regarding result of their validation studies.

That is particularly obvious concerning patients with psychosis. Yet, even for patients featuring delusions with religious content, religious activities and spiritual coping may have a favourable influence. Indeed, patients with psychosis can use religion to cope with life difficulties related to their psychotic condition, in a social perspective but also in order to gain meaning in their lives. Also, religion may be part of explanatory models about their disorder with, in some cases, a significant influence on treatment adhesion.\nThis paper describes a prospective randomized study about a spiritual assessment performed by the psychiatrists of patients with schizophrenia. The outpatient clinics in which the sample was collected are affiliated with the department of psychiatry at the university hospitals of Geneva. Eighty-four outpatients with psychosis were randomized into two groups: an experimental group receiving both traditional treatment and spiritual assessment with their psychiatrist and a control group of patients receiving only their usual treatment. Psychiatrists were supervised by a clinician (PH) and a psychologist of religions (PYB) for each patient in the spiritual assessment group. Data were collected from both groups before and after 3\u00a0months of clinical follow-up.\nSpiritual assessment was well-tolerated by all patients. Moreover, their wish to discuss religious matters with their psychiatrist persisted following the spiritual assessment. Even though clinicians acknowledged the usefulness of the supervision for some patients, especially when religion was of importance for clinical care, they reported being moderately interested in applying spiritual assessments in clinical settings. Compared to the control group, there were no differences observed in the 3\u00a0months' outcome in terms of primary outcome measures for satisfaction with care, yet the attendance at the appointments was significantly increased in the group with spiritual assessment. The same result was found when restricting analyses to patients for whom an intervention was suggested or patients who invested more in religion. Areas of potential intervention were frequent both in a psychiatric and psychotherapeutical perspective.\nSpiritual assessment appears to be useful for patients with psychosis. This is in accordance with the recommendations of the World Psychiatric Association which promotes considering the whole person in clinical care. Spiritual assessment is quite simple to perform, providing that clinicians do not prescribe or promote religion, and that no critical comments are made concerning religious issues. Clinicians do not need to know in depth the religious domains of each of their patients, as it appears that each patient accommodates his/her religious background his/her own way."}, {"Title": "Special Needs: Scholastic Disability Accommodations from K-12 and Transitions to Higher Education.", "Abstract": "The number of students entering post-secondary education with already diagnosed disabilities is on the rise and mirrors the percentage of children in primary and secondary public schools with registered disabilities.

Socio-demographic, clinical, admission and aftercare variables were investigated as possible predictors of readmission at 7, 30 and 90 days after discharge and were analyzed, controlling for dependency among same-patient observations.\nPrevious psychiatric history was the most important predictor of readmissions. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients did not clearly influence readmission. Length of stay (LoS) was significant for readmission at 7 days even after controlling for other predictors and for same-patient dependence, in particular, for patients with previous admissions. Results suggest a protective role of a LoS higher than 28 days. In general, having a contact in community services did not turn out as protective from early readmission.\nThis paper contributes to increase the knowledge about factors that may predict the risk of early readmission. Implications for quality assessment in psychiatry emerged: readmission seems actionable by LoS and not by community follow-up."}, {"Title": "Post-Seclusion and/or Restraint Review in Psychiatry: A Scoping Review.", "Abstract": "It has been suggested that after an incident in which a patient has been placed in seclusion or in restraints, an intervention should be conducted after the event to ensure continuity of care and prevent recurrences.

This descriptive cross sectional study examined the perception and coping strategies of caregivers with a sample of 100 toward aggressive behavior by patients with severe mental illness in the outpatient and inpatient unit of the department of psychiatry in a tertiary care hospital. The data were collected by a semistructured interview using Revised Overt Aggression Scale-modified, Aggressive Behavior and Intervention Checklist, Ways of Coping Checklist-Hindi Adaptation and Impact of Patient Aggression on Carers Scale-Adapted. The caregivers perceived aggression in varying extent from the patients. Majority used problem-focused coping to deal with aggressive behavior. Most of the caregivers perceived insisting to take medicines and talking about patient's illness as the triggers for aggressive behavior which was managed by talking to the patient calmly, lovingly and by leaving the patient alone. The findings strongly suggest aggressive behavior as a frequent problem faced by family members of patient with severe mental illness.

This paper examines the role of psychiatrists in the provision of primary care to the patients they treat. Some recommendations are offered for their involvement in the provision of primary care at three levels of complexity: Level 1--Universal Basic Psychiatric Primary Care; Level 2--Enhanced Psychiatric Primary Care; and Level 3--Fully Integrated Primary Care and Psychiatric Management.

PUI is defined as an excessive preoccupation about and use of the Internet, which can be characterized by more time spent on-line than what was planned, with difficulties leading to distress or significant disorders. The new mode of interaction provided by the Internet facilitates self-disclosure, especially for socially anxious persons who feel safer and more comfortable in on-line compared with face-to-face interactions. Several studies point to the fact that insecure attachment, and particularly preoccupied attachment, is associated with problematic use of the Internet. Preoccupied attachment is characterized by a negative model of self and a positive model of others. Persons with a negative model of self feel anxious in interpersonal relationships. Because self-disclosure is easier on-line, it may play a role in problematic use of the Internet.\nThe aim of the study is to better understand the link between insecure attachment and problematic use of the Internet, by examining the mediating role of self-disclosure.\nParticipants anonymously completed the following self-questionnaires on-line: the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), which assesses problematic use of the Internet, the Relationship Scale Questionnaire (RSQ), which evaluates attachment, and the \"Real-me\" questionnaire, which measures increased self-disclosure on the Internet compared with face-to-face interactions.\nParticipants (n=200, 73\u00a0% women) were recruited via e-mails, social networks, ads in local stores and leaflets in public places, directing them towards a link in which they could complete the on-line questionnaires.\nDescriptive analyses were conducted to examine the main characteristics of participants. A t-test was used to explore gender differences. Main analyses consisted of correlational analyses between attachment, the \"Real-me\", and problematic use of the Internet. A series of regression analyses were then used to test the mediating role of the \"Real-me\" in the link between insecure attachment and problematic use of the Internet.\nResults confirm the associations between problematic use of the Internet and, respectively, preoccupied and fearful attachment. Complete mediation of the \"Real-me\" in the association between negative model of self (attachment) and problematic use of the Internet was also confirmed.\nPreoccupied and fearful attachments are both associated with problematic use of the Internet. These persons have a negative model of self which may hamper their ability to be at ease in face-to-face interactions. Being themselves on the Internet mediates the link between negative model of self and problematic use of the Internet. Resorting to a less threatening environment of exchange may thus explain these insecure individuals' tendency to overuse the Internet. Future research investigating the different activities on the Internet would be useful to better determine whether certain specific activities are more closely linked to problematic use of the Internet among insecure individuals."}, {"Title": "The Effect of a Dedicated Psychiatric Team to Pediatric Emergency Mental Health Care.", "Abstract": "Pediatric emergency department (PED) visits among children and adolescents with acute mental health needs have increased over the past decade with long wait times in the PED awaiting disposition.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new pediatric mental health liaison program with the hypothesis that this model reduces length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization rates among pediatric mental health patients.\nThis was a pre- and postintervention retrospective study of the year prior to (June 2012-June 2013) and the year after (October 2013-October 2014) implementation of a new PED psychiatric team.

By their very nature, some paraphilic disorders may predispose an individual to commit sexual offenses. The biological treatment of paraphilic disorders, then, is of paramount importance for psychiatry and society at large. Three categories of pharmacologic agents commonly used to treat paraphilic disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, synthetic steroidal analogs, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. Each medication uses a different mechanism of action and has different effects on the physiological and psychological features of paraphilic disorders. In general, these medications have limited high-quality research to support their use. Despite this, some authors have proposed treatment algorithms for individuals with paraphilic disorders of varying severity. These guidelines offer clinicians potentially useful, rational approaches to assessing treatment need in individuals with paraphilic disorders. Recent neuroimaging research suggests that functional magnetic resonance imaging may offer further promise in effectively assessing paraphilic disorders to help direct treatment options."}, {"Title": "Sex differences and gender-invariance of mother-reported childhood problem behavior.", "Abstract": "Prevalence and severity of childhood behavioral problems differ between boys and girls, and in psychiatry, testing for gender differences is common practice. Population-based studies show that many psychopathology scales are (partially) Measurement Invariance (MI) with respect to gender, i.e. are unbiased. It is, however, unclear whether these studies generalize towards clinical samples. In a psychiatric outpatient sample, we tested whether the Child Behavior Checklist 6-18 (CBCL) is unbiased with respect to gender. We compared mean scores across gender of all syndrome scales of the CBCL in 3271 patients (63.3% boys) aged 6-18. Second, we tested for MI on both the syndrome scale and the item-level using a stepwise modeling procedure. Six of the eight CBCL syndrome scales included one or more gender-biased items (12.6% of all items), resulting in slight over- or under-estimation of the absolute gender difference in mean scores. Two scales, Somatic Complaints and Rule-breaking Behavior, contained no biased items. The CBCL is a valid instrument to measure gender differences in problem behavior in children and adolescents from a clinical sample; while various gender-biased items were identified, the resulting bias was generally clinically irrelevant, and sufficient items per subscale remained after exclusion of biased items.

For the first time, DSM-III emphasized empirically-based, atheoretical and agnostic diagnostic criteria. New criticisms of the DSM-III and subsequent editions have arisen with a call for a new paradigm shift to replace diagnostic categories with continuous dimensional systems of classification, returning to etiologically-based definitions and incorporating findings from neurobiological science into systems of diagnosis.

OVID-Medline, Embase, and PsychInfo (inception-January 2015) were searched, limiting to English and human studies, using terms relating to \"predict,\" \"outcome,\" \"psychiatry,\" and \"forensic\" to identify primary research articles reporting on predictors of outcome in forensic mental health services not reliant on clinical judgment/self-report.

Factors associated positively, negatively, and showing no relationship with each outcome were extracted and compiled across studies. Of various demographic predictors examined, the most consistent associations were between previous psychiatric admissions and inpatient violence; a more \"severe\" offense and a longer length of stay; and young age and reoffending. Poor performance on tests of cognitive control and social cognition predicted inpatient violence while a neurophysiological measure of impulsivity showed utility predicting reoffending.

Following the inauguration of the so-called \"Law on the Re-Establishment of a Professional Civil Service\" in Nazi Germany on April 7, 1933, hundreds of Jewish and oppositional neurologists, neuropathologists, and psychiatrists were forced out of their academic positions, having to leave their home countries and local knowledge economies and traditions for Canada and the United States.

Furthermore, compliance is a major variable that can affect the efficiency of therapeutics and hospitalizations in psychiatry. A study was carried out in three drug and alcohol rehabilitation hospitalization units to find out if impulsivity can have consequences on compliance.\nThe studied population was composed of 85 patients aged from 18 to 70, hospitalized for one or more addiction disorders in a psychometric hospital in Vannes (France). Impulsivity was measured for all patients with the BIS-11 at the beginning of the rehabilitation program. Because no tool to evaluate a total rehab program compliance existed, a scale, used at the end of the hospitalization, was created to measure patient compliance. This score was composed of two simple numeric scales (one used by the nurses and one used by the patient's psychiatrist) and a coefficient of hospitalization duration that was the ratio of completed to planned days of hospitalization. Correlations were made between the different dimensions: impulsivity and compliance, impulsivity and hospitalization conditions, compliance and hospitalization conditions (voluntary or involuntary, planned by a psychiatrist or not, etc.).\nThe main statistically significant result of the study was a negative correlation existing between the motor dimension of impulsivity and compliance (r=-0.37 and P=0.001). The other dimensions of impulsivity showed no significant correlation with compliance score. The study revealed that the different hospitalization conditions showed no link with compliance or impulsivity.\nThese original results show that motor impulsive patients need an adaptation of the rehabilitation programs.

An underlying question for all etiological models concerns the manner in which an individual's behaviours are organized. Specifically, it becomes crucial to understand how certain individuals come to display maladaptive behaviours in a given environment, especially when considering issues such as offenders' responsibility and their ability to change their behaviours.\nThanks to its ability to generate specific environments, associated with a high experimental control on generated simulations, virtual reality is gaining recognition in forensic psychiatry. Virtual reality has generated promising research data and may turn out to be a remarkable clinical tool in the near future. While research has increased, a conceptual work about its theoretical underpinnings is still lacking. However, no important benefit should be expected from the introduction of a new tool (as innovative as virtual reality) without an explicit and heuristic theoretical framework capable of clarifying its benefits in forensic psychiatry.\nOur paper introduces self-regulation perspective as the most suitable theoretical framework for virtual reality in forensic psychiatry. It will be argued that virtual reality does not solely help to increase ecological validity. However, it does allow one to grant access to an improved understanding of violent offending behaviours by probing into the underlying mechanisms involved in the self-regulation of behaviours in a dynamical environment. Illustrations are given as well as a discussion regarding perspectives in the use of virtual reality in forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[Malaise in psychiatry and its history].", "Abstract": "The main hypothesis of this paper is the presence of malaise in psychiatry. The malaise has two sides: on one hand, the end of psychiatry hegemony that dominated the theoretical field of psychiatry until the 1990s. The loss of influence of psychoanalysis is due to its inability to be submitted to any kind of assessment. On the other hand, the supremacy of neurosciences. The idea is not to underestimate the importance of neurosciences but rather to affirm that they occupy the whole theoretical field of psychiatry. This is an unusual situation that is specific to our time. Indeed, this monism has succeeded to an epistemological dualism that has existed throughout the history of psychiatry. In this article, we'll try to draw a history of dualism in psychiatry. Firstly, with Pinel, we find a tension between a metaphysical philosophical pole and a physiological one. Pinel's philosophy has something to do with Condillac's ideology as Pinel applies the analytical method to mental diseases. Under Cabanis's influence, the author of the famous Rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme, this ideology is under pressure with physiologism. As a materialist, he gives an essential part to the brain that distributes pieces of information throughout the body because he thinks that mind influences body. Secondly, dualism lies between the doctrine of localizations defended by Gall and the theory of degeneration elaborated by Magnan. Gall, in Anatomie et physiologie du syst\u00e8me nerveux en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, seeks to know how bumps or hollows that are found on the skull are shaped. Gall is for the theory of delocalizations. He is the counterpart of Magnan who wrote a work about Les D\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s, that takes its part in the physiological trend with the famous theory of degeneration. For him, degeneration means the imperfect state of a subject whose cerebral functions are in a noticeably imperfect state. Thirdly, with Henry Ey, dualism starts to be less important. Indeed, he tends a monist synthesis with its organodynamic model described in Des id\u00e9es de Jackson \u00e0 un mod\u00e8le organodynamique en psychiatrie. Indeed, he is inspired by the English neurologist Jackson to assert that there are levels of conscience structuring where negative symptomatology appears through its dissolution. Current monism with neuroscience domination sets fundamental epistemological issues. Perhaps neurosciences were setting an impossible task to achieve while following Changeux's intuition. In L'homme neuronal, this latter was developing the idea that to each psychic function, one could associate a neuron. This is a way to go back to Gall who doesn't seem to us to be heuristic. Indeed, let's first introduce the fact that there is no specific cortical area just as the most recent works have shown. Therefore, saying that a cerebral area is correlated to a symptom or a function is no more than relying on parallelism theory. Thus, Bergson, from whom we took the analysis, showed the futility of such a concept and the apporias to which it leads. The research of precise cerebral areas implied in mental diseases, as important as it is, leaves open the question of meaning. The meaning of the disease raises many economic, cultural, psychological and social factors. Thus, we can formulate the hypothesis that psychiatry should be between two complementary poles. First, the pole of neurosciences whose researches are fundamental for research in disease etiology and the development of a new medicine. Second, there is a pole which is more polymorphous and that would deal with the question of meaning. We think that each of these poles should have their own investigation field and their specific methods. We defend the idea that creating subjects such as neuropsychoanalysis is an illusion."}, {"Title": "Letter Reversals, Default Mode, and Childhood ADHD.", "Abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the relationship of static reversals, handedness and gender to reaction time variability (RTV) in a sequentional sample of 1,109 children referred to a child psychiatry clinic for investigation of possible ADHD. <b>Method:</b> A DSM-III ADHD diagnosis and ADHD severity ratings (mild, moderate, and severe) by the present investigator was recorded.

Personal acquaintance with people who have mental illness appears to be the only significant factor that reduces medical professionals' socially restrictive attitudes towards them."}, {"Title": "A Computational Analysis of Aberrant Delay Discounting in Psychiatric Disorders.", "Abstract": "Impatience for reward is a facet of many psychiatric disorders. We draw attention to a growing literature finding greater discounting of delayed reward, an important aspect of impatience, across a range of psychiatric disorders. We propose these findings are best understood by considering the goals and motivation for discounting future reward. We characterize these as arising from either the opportunity costs of waiting or the uncertainty associated with delayed reward. We link specific instances of higher discounting in psychiatric disorder to heightened subjective estimates of either of these factors. We propose these costs are learned and represented based either on a flexible cognitive model of the world, an accumulation of previous experience, or through evolutionary specification. Any of these can be considered suboptimal for the individual if the resulting behavior results in impairments in personal and social functioning and/or in distress. By considering the neurochemical and neuroanatomical implementation of these processes, we illustrate how this approach can in principle unite social, psychological and biological conceptions of impulsive choice."}, {"Title": "User participation in district psychiatry. The social construction of 'users' in handovers and meetings.", "Abstract": "An ideal in mental health care is user participation. This implies inclusion and facilitation by clinicians to enable users to participate in decisions about themselves and in the design of suitable treatment. However, much of the work of clinicians consists of handovers and other meetings where patients are not present. It is therefore interesting to study how the patient perspective is handled in such meetings and whether it forms a basis for user participation. We conducted fieldwork in three different inpatient wards in Norwegian District Psychiatric Centres. We used an interactional perspective in our analysis, where speech acts, framing and footing were key concepts. The findings show that the talk in the handovers and meetings contained five main themes and that there was a clear correlation between what was said and how it was said, and whether clinicians related to the content in a decisive, person-centred or indecisive manner. We discuss potential participation statuses for patients and their limited opportunity to influence the talk and possible decisions about themselves. Our conclusion is that handover meetings primarily function as an aid in organising clinicians' work and could ultimately be seen as counteracting user participation."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic Misconception in Psychiatry Research: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic misconception (TM) denotes the phenomenon in which research subjects conflate research purpose, protocols and procedures with clinical treatment. We examined the prevalence, contributory factors, clinical associations, impact, and collated solutions on TM within psychiatric research, and made suggestions going ahead. Literature search for relevant empirical research papers was conducted until February 2015. Eighty-eight reports were extracted, of which 31 were selected, summarised into different headings for discussion of implications and collated solutions of TM. We found variable and high rates of TM (ranging from 12.5% to 86%) in some psychiatry research populations. Contributory factors to TM included perceived medical roles of researchers, media, research setting and subject factors. Greater TM in affective, neurodevelopmental and psychotic spectrum conditions were associated with demographic variables (such as lower education, increased age), clinical factors (such as poor insight, cognitive deficits, increased symptoms, poorer self-rated quality of health), and social functioning (such as decreased independence). Inattention to TM may lead to frustration, negative impression and abandonment of participation in psychiatry research. Strategies such as the employment of a neutral educator during the informed consent process and education modules may be effective in addressing TM. Further research is warranted to examine the different TM facets, specific clinical correlates and more effective management strategies."}, {"Title": "Chickens and eggs-how should we interpret environment-behavior associations?", "Abstract": "As usual, the research published in this issue of the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry contains impressive state-of-the-science studies of child and adolescent psychopathology and related issues.

This method, which has been developed by sleep specialists, is a time-consuming and difficult process. Generally, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used in sleep scoring. In this study, a new complex classifier-based approach is presented for automatic sleep scoring using EEG signals. In this context, complex-valued methods were utilized in the feature selection and classification stages. In the feature selection stage, features of EEG data were extracted with the help of a dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). In the next phase, five statistical features were obtained. These features are classified using complex-valued neural network (CVANN) algorithm. The Taguchi method was used in order to determine the effective parameter values in this CVANN. The aim was to develop a stable model involving parameter optimization. Different statistical parameters were utilized in the evaluation phase. Also, results were obtained in terms of two different sleep standards. In the study in which a 2nd level DTCWT and CVANN hybrid model was used, 93.84% accuracy rate was obtained according to the Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) standard, while a 95.42% accuracy rate was obtained according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard.

However, the neural mechanisms that explain these characteristic features remain unclear. Using a computational multilevel approach, we propose that ADHD is caused by impaired gain modulation in systems that generate this phenotypic increased behavioural variability. Using Marr's three levels of analysis as a heuristic framework, we focus on this variable behaviour, detail how it can be explained algorithmically, and how it might be implemented at a neural level through catecholamine influences on corticostriatal loops. This computational, multilevel, approach to ADHD provides a framework for bridging gaps between descriptions of neuronal activity and behaviour, and provides testable predictions about impaired mechanisms."}, {"Title": "Loss of Temper and Irritability: The Relationship to Tantrums in a Community and Clinical Sample.", "Abstract": "This study explores the relationship of irritability to tantrums and loss of temper in a community and clinical sample.\nThe community sample, recruited via commercial mailing lists, consisted of 462 6-year-olds whose parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA). Tantrums were assessed in the oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) section of the PAPA. Irritability was assessed in the depression section to identify persistently irritable and/or angry mood. The clinic sample, drawn from a child psychiatry clinic, included 229 consecutively referred 6-year-olds from 2005 through 2014 whose parents completed the CBCL and Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI). Temper loss and irritability items came from the ODD and depression sections of the CASI, and tantrum description was taken from an irritability inventory. Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) and the CBCL Dysregulation Profile were examined in both samples. Logistic and multiple regression were used to compare rates of diagnosis, CBCL subscales, CGAS, and tantrum quality between children with tantrums only and tantrums with irritability.\nAlmost half (45.9%) of clinic children had severe tantrums; only 23.8% of those were said to be irritable. In the community, 11% of children had tantrums, but 78.4% of those were called irritable. However, irritability in the clinic, although less common, was associated with aggressive tantrums and substantial impairment. In contrast, irritability was associated with only a relatively small increase in impairment in the community sample.\nIrritability may have different implications in community versus clinic samples, and tantrums assessed in the community may be qualitatively different from those seen in clinics."}, {"Title": "Risk Factors for Readmission on an Adult Inpatient Psychiatric Unit.", "Abstract": "Readmission rates have been proposed as a possible quality metric for inpatient psychiatry.

The extension of the right to complain has played a role in the acceptance of querulous behaviour. Judicial bodies and other government organisations are being kept busier than ever because people who feel they have been denied justice became entangled in interminable litigation. Gradually, querulous behaviour causes the initial sense of injustice to disappear and querulous patients are damaged economically, socially and personally and experience suffering and function less efficiently.\nTo describe the history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, possible psychodynamic hypotheses and possible ways of treating querulous behaviour.<br/>\nWe studied the literature using PubMed, PsychInfo, Google and Google Scholar.\nThere seems to be a spectrum with fluent transitions from normal complaining behaviour, querulous behaviour which is based on a paranoid, narcissistic or obsessive-compulsive personality structure, to severe pathologies like a delusional disorder. There is little evidence that pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy is effective. Nevertheless, there are opportunities for administering psychiatric treatment in order to alleviate the loss and suffering for the patients and their next-of-kin.\nQuerulous behaviour is an old clinical concept that still has relevance today for the individual patient, complaints officers and society in general. Our current diagnostic systems provide sufficient opportunities for diagnosing patients correctly. Patients may be best served by judicial mediation at an early stage, combined with psychiatric treatment aimed at controlling emotions and restricting harmful behaviour."}, {"Title": "[Forensic assessments from the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology in retrospect; applications of genetics and neuroscience, in 2000 and 2009].", "Abstract": "Developments in neurosciences and genetics are relevant for forensic psychiatry.\nTo find out whether and how genetic and neuroscientific applications are being used in forensic psychiatric assessments, and, if they are, to estimate to what extent new applications will fit in with these uses.\nWe analysed 60 forensic psychiatric assessments from the Netherlands Institute of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology, Pieter Baan Center, and 30 non-clinical assessments from 2000 and 2009.\nWe found that (behavioral) genetic, neurological and neuropsychological applications played only a modest role in forensic psychiatric assessment and they represent different phases of the implementation process. Neuropsychological assessment already occupied a position of some importance, but needed to be better integrated. Applications from neurology were still being developed.

Thus, they are not integrated into psychosocial networks and medical support. This has a significant impact on patient-centered care in a domestic environment. In this article a model project with home visits to patients with dementia and anosognosia is described.\nA total of 55 home visits were carried out. The aim of this project was the integration into the existing healthcare services in order to safeguard the domestic environment. These visits focused on advice and information for the patients and their caregivers initiating the visits. Sociodemographic data of the patient cohort and the satisfaction of the caregiving relatives and general practitioners are presented.\nSubjects with dementia were found to be in advanced stages of the disease, caring situations were complex and required assistance.

We argue that the field will be unable to address these challenges within psychiatry's standard neo-Kraepelinian (DSM) perspective. At the same time the current corrective, based in molecular genetics and cognitive neuroscience, is also likely to flounder due to its neglect for psychiatry's syndromal structure. We suggest adopting a new approach long used in reliability engineering, which also serves as a synthesis of these approaches. This approach, known as fault tree analysis, can be combined with extant neuroscientific data collection and computational modeling efforts to uncover the causal structures underlying the cognitive and affective failures in people with schizophrenia as well as other complex psychiatric phenomena. By making explicit how causes combine from basic faults to downstream failures, this approach makes affordances for: (1) causes that are neither necessary nor sufficient in and of themselves; (2) within-diagnosis heterogeneity; and (3) between diagnosis co-morbidity."}, {"Title": "[Factitious disorders in dermatology: Value of the dissociative state concept].", "Abstract": "Factitious disorders in dermatology consist of intentionally self-inflicted skin lesions that vary in morphology and distribution and occur on surfaces readily accessible to the patient's hands. They tend to be a chronic condition that waxes and wanes according to the circumstances of the patient's life. Patient management poses a particular challenge to the clinician and the prognosis is considered poor. The aetiopathogenesis of factitious disorders in dermatology is not completely understood. We present a case in which we suggested the occurrence of factitious behaviour during a dissociative state, and we briefly describe our diagnostic and therapeutic approach.\nA 48-year-old unemployed woman was referred to our department of psychiatry by her dermatologist for suspected factitious disorder. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1 and had been hospitalized repeatedly for confirmed diabetic ketoacidosis. The onset of the disease was related to marital discord with her spouse. Numerous skin lesions had appeared on her face, arms, legs, neck and back. These lesions resulted in multiple hospital admissions and in amputation of her left leg. The condition had worsened considerably after her separation from her husband. During the initial conversation, the patient was unable to provide a clear history of the disease. She denied any knowledge of the circumstances in which these skin lesions appeared, and she did not admit self-infliction. Her mood was depressed and her speech was slow. We suspected that our patient was herself causing her skin lesions while in a dissociative state. Several arguments militate in favour of our hypothesis, particularly her history of childhood maltreatment and the association of traumatic life events with simultaneous deterioration of the skin. The explanation of the dissociative mechanism helped us to strengthen the therapeutic relationship. Within a few days, we noted a slow regression of the lesions, but the patient was still unable to explain how the lesions had occurred.\nThe pathophysiology of factitious disorders in dermatology is poorly understood. It has strong ties with other psychiatric disorders, and according to several authors, skin lesions occur in dissociative states, after which patients do not remember how the skin change started. Management of this disease is challenging.

Frequent questions about psychotropic drugs come from experienced senior physicians in disciplines like psychiatry, geriatrics, general practice and neurology. The physicians often ask about specific drug use in pregnancy or breastfeeding, drug combinations and interactions, drug switching and formulations, and drug-withdrawal reactions.\nThere is a lack of relevant information in drug monographs and guidelines to inform answers to the questions posed for the care of individual patients.

The Composite International Diagnostic Interview evaluated a 12-month history of anxiety and depressive disorders.\n8.2% of our sample had at least moderate difficulty in forming and maintaining close relationships due to a medical condition. In bivariate analyses, younger age, Latino ethnicity, less education, worse financial status, more chronic illnesses, physical health and discomfort, and problems with mobility, home management, and self-care were associated with this social impairment. In multivariable analyses accounting for possible confounders, there was a dose-dependent relationship between social impairment and the prevalence of anxiety and depression.\nData are cross-sectional and our analyses are therefore unable to determine cause-and-effect relationships.\nAmong adults with one or more medical conditions, social impairment attributed to medical illness was associated with a significantly greater odds of anxiety and depression.

There was very limited evidence for access to support before crisis point. There was evidence of benefits for liaison psychiatry teams in improving service-related outcomes in emergency departments, but this was often limited by potential confounding in most studies. There was limited evidence regarding models to improve urgent and emergency access to crisis care to guide police officers in their Mental Health Act responsibilities.

Expression of mRNA of the wild-type candidate gene was analysed in human postmortem brain specimens, adipose tissue, muscle and liver. Expression of RNA in lymphocytes in patients and controls was additionally analysed. The variant protein was expressed in, and purified from, HEK293 cells to assess its effect on protein folding and function.\nWe identified a single heterozygous missense variant, c.1337A>G (p.Tyr446Cys), in transducin \u03b2-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) as disease-causing in all patients. TBL1XR1 mRNA expression was demonstrated in pituitary, hypothalamus, white and brown adipose tissue, muscle and liver. mRNA expression is lower in lymphocytes of two patients compared with the four controls. The mutant TBL1XR1 protein assembled correctly into the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)/ silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptors (SMRT) complex, suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism. This contrasts with loss-of-function germline TBL1XR1 deletions and other TBL1XR1 mutations that have been implicated in autism. However, autism is not present in individuals with Pierpont syndrome.\nThis study identifies a specific TBL1XR1 mutation as the cause of Pierpont syndrome. Deletions and other mutations in TBL1XR1 can cause autism.

Discontinuation of placebo responders identified during a placebo run-in is often recommended to avoid failures of clinical trials in the presence of high placebo effects. Evidence for the benefit of this approach is ambiguous.\nWe investigate under which conditions a placebo lead-in can be beneficial in the context of continuous data, assuming that the data in the placebo run-in and the treatment stage follow a bivariate normal distribution. Placebo responders are defined as patients with an effect during placebo lead-in which is larger than a pre-defined threshold on the absolute value or the absolute or relative change from baseline or a combination thereof.\nData are less variable under either placebo or test treatment after placebo responders have been removed. Whether the effect of test over placebo increases or decreases after enrichment for placebo non-responders depends on the parameters of the distribution, in particular the covariance structure, and the threshold in the definition of placebo responders.\nThe results apply in the continuous case, and the binary or ordinary case is not studied. The findings explain to some extent the ambiguity in the assessments of the usefulness of placebo lead-in periods in clinical trials; however, besides the clear statement on variability reduction, it is not straightforward to judge upfront whether placebo lead-in is useful.

Postoperative vitamin deficiencies may cause nystagmus, optic neuropathy, nyctalopia, and/or ophthalmoparesis weeks to years after surgery."}, {"Title": "The two-process model of sleep regulation: a reappraisal.", "Abstract": "In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle."}, {"Title": "Using a Retreat to Develop a 4-Year Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Curriculum.", "Abstract": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations experience significant health disparities, yet medical schools report devoting little educational time to the care of this population. In light of this, one School of Medicine utilized a daylong retreat to design a 4-year sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) curriculum.\nThe participants completed pre-and post-surveys on their perspectives and knowledge towards SOGI learning, and the school's curriculum database was reviewed 2\u00a0years later to ascertain the degree of implementation of the proposed curriculum.\nSignificant improvements were observed in participants' confidence in creating an SOGI curriculum, knowledge of SOGI teaching resources, and where in the curriculum SOGI competencies are and should be taught. A 6-month follow-up survey yielded a lower response rate, but suggested strong ongoing support for the new curriculum and some continuing challenges to implementing the proposed curriculum.

The response rate was 43 of 120 programs. Both large more research intensive and smaller more clinical departments responded.\nMajorities of departments reported that funding decreases negatively impacted faculty recruitment, research, faculty retention, and teaching programs. Approximately, one-third reported laying-off non-tenured faculty members and almost half, staff members. Graduate Medical Education (GME) funding was also a challenge. Departments reported responding by attempting to develop alternative funding sources. Few departments in the sample were doing significant fund raising.\nAcademic departments find themselves stressed financially and are constricting some functions that are thought important. They are, in general, not able to replace lost funding. The research enterprise appears to be disproportionately affected and results in problems recruiting faculty. GME programs thus far seem less affected.

Users need to be familiar with computer terminal commands, the Linux environment, and various software tools and scripts. Analysis workflows have to be optimized and experimentally validated to extract biologically meaningful data. Moreover, as larger datasets are being generated, their analysis requires use of high-performance servers.\nTo address these needs, we developed CANEapp (application for Comprehensive automated Analysis of Next-generation sequencing Experiments), a unique suite that combines a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and an automated server-side analysis pipeline that is platform-independent, making it suitable for any server architecture. The GUI runs on a PC or Mac and seamlessly connects to the server to provide full GUI control of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) project analysis. The server-side analysis pipeline contains a framework that is implemented on a Linux server through completely automated installation of software components and reference files. Analysis with CANEapp is also fully automated and performs differential gene expression analysis and novel noncoding RNA discovery through alternative workflows (Cuffdiff and R packages edgeR and DESeq2). We compared CANEapp to other similar tools, and it significantly improves on previous developments. We experimentally validated CANEapp's performance by applying it to data derived from different experimental paradigms and confirming the results with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CANEapp adapts to any server architecture by effectively using available resources and thus handles large amounts of data efficiently. CANEapp performance has been experimentally validated on various biological datasets. CANEapp is available free of charge at http://psychiatry.med.miami.edu/research/laboratory-of-translational-rna-genomics/CANE-app .\nWe believe that CANEapp will serve both biologists with no computational experience and bioinformaticians as a simple, timesaving but accurate and powerful tool to analyze large RNA-seq datasets and will provide foundations for future development of integrated and automated high-throughput genomics data analysis tools. Due to its inherently standardized pipeline and combination of automated analysis and platform-independence, CANEapp is an ideal for large-scale collaborative RNA-seq projects between different institutions and research groups."}, {"Title": "Allosteric signaling through an mGlu2 and 5-HT2A heteromeric receptor complex and its potential contribution to schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can form multiprotein complexes (heteromers), which can alter the pharmacology and functions of the constituent receptors. Previous findings demonstrated that the Gq/11-coupled serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and the Gi/o-coupled metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor-GPCRs that are involved in signaling alterations associated with psychosis-assemble into a heteromeric complex in the mammalian brain. In single-cell experiments with various mutant versions of the mGlu2 receptor, we showed that stimulation of cells expressing mGlu2-5-HT2A heteromers with an mGlu2 agonist led to activation of Gq/11 proteins by the 5-HT2A receptors. For this crosstalk to occur, one of the mGlu2 subunits had to couple to Gi/o proteins, and we determined the relative location of the Gi/o-contacting subunit within the mGlu2 homodimer of the heteromeric complex. Additionally, mGlu2-dependent activation of Gq/11, but not Gi/o, was reduced in the frontal cortex of 5-HT2A knockout mice and was reduced in the frontal cortex of postmortem brains from schizophrenic patients. These findings offer structural insights into this important target in molecular psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Functional Assessment in End-Stage Renal Disease: Enhancing Quality of Life.", "Abstract": "Why do functional assessments in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) matter? Multiple studies show that new dialysis patients undergo a substantial decline among activities of daily living. Moreover, poor functional status in ESRD patients is associated with early morality. That is why CMS has developed new criteria to assess ESRD patients in regards to their functional, psychologic, and cognitive capabilities. Functional assessments by health providers have been used in field of Rehabilitation Medicine for over 50 years; rehabilitation physicians have found them effective in establishing goals and monitoring improvement. Assessments can provide guidance by identifying the needs and types of intervention most suited for patients. Impairments can be addressed with referrals to physical therapy for gross motor issues, occupational therapy for self-care problems, psychiatry for mental disorders, and neurology for cognitive deficits. The more accurate the assessments over time, the more targeted and effective the therapies become.

A total of 884 patients were assessed and of these, 137 had a final diagnosis of functional neurological illness, equating to an incidence of 15% of all patients seen. Functional disorders were the third most common presentation overall. Patients with functional disorders were younger, more likely to be female and had a higher rate of current psychiatric comorbidity compared to other neurology patients. Sensory symptoms were the most common manifestation (48%) followed by limb weakness (37%) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (14%). Outcome information was available for 49% of patients at an average of 3months follow-up. 45% had some improvement in their symptoms, 43% had static symptoms and 12% had worsening of symptoms.

The therapeutic endpoints are abstract measures of cognitive and behavioral performance, for which we have a very limited understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Existing preclinical disease models are also limited in their translational fidelity. Recently, there have been active discussions on the use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a catalyzing research tool in psychiatry, but very few review articles in the field have given specific considerations to their use at the interface between psychiatric research and drug discovery. Here, we discuss recent perspectives emerging from this interface. For physicians and researchers on the clinical side, we explain how iPSC-based experimental approaches are placed at the crossroads with psychiatric genetics and how representative studies in the field are addressing biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. For researchers who directly work with iPSCs and aspire to develop new research techniques, we direct their attention to the utility of this approach for unmet needs in drug discovery workflows."}, {"Title": "A Course on Terror Medicine: Content and Evaluations.", "Abstract": "The development of medical school courses on medical responses for disaster victims has been deemed largely inadequate. To address this gap, a 2-week elective course on Terror Medicine (a field related to Disaster and Emergency Medicine) has been designed for fourth year students at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey (USA). This elective is part of an overall curricular plan to broaden exposure to topics related to Terror Medicine throughout the undergraduate medical education.\nA course on Terror Medicine necessarily includes key aspects of Disaster and Emergency Medicine, though the converse is not the case. Courses on Disaster Medicine may not address features distinctively associated with a terror attack. Thus, a terror-related focus not only assures attention to this important subject but to accidental or naturally occurring incidents as well.\nThe course, implemented in 2014, uses a variety of teaching modalities including lectures, videos, and tabletop and hands-on simulation exercises. The subject matter includes biological and chemical terrorism, disaster management, mechanisms of injury, and psychiatry. This report outlines the elective's goals and objectives, describes the course syllabus, and presents outcomes based on student evaluations of the initial iterations of the elective offering.\nAll students rated the course as \"excellent\" or \"very good.\" Evaluations included enthusiastic comments about the content, methods of instruction, and especially the value of the simulation exercises.

Little is known about the patients of these networks with regard to utilisation of physicians and associated factors. We interviewed 560 caregivers of people with dementia in 13 different DNs in Germany in 2013 and assessed socio-demographics, clinical data and physician utilisation. Networks were categorised in predominantly medical DNs and community-oriented DNs. Descriptive and multivariate statistical models were used to identify associated factors between DNs and users' data. Overall, the users of networks received high rates of physician care; 93% of the sample stated at least one contact with a primary care physician within the last 6\u00a0months, and 74% had been treated by a specialist (neurology/psychiatry physician). Only 5% of the sample had no contact with a physician in the 6\u00a0months preceding the interview. Females showed a lower odds for physician specialist consultations (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.641). Users of medical DNs receive greater specialist consultations overall (OR\u00a0=\u00a08.370). Compared to the German general population and people with dementia in other settings, users of DNs receive physician care more regularly, especially with regard to the consultations of neurologist/psychiatrists. Therefore, DNs seem to perform a supportive role within the integration of physician healthcare.

Aims The aims were to assess satisfaction among patients acutely admitted with psychosis, to compare satisfaction in voluntarily versus involuntarily admitted patients, and to assess the influence of symptom load and insight. Methods The UKU Consumer Satisfaction Rating Scale (UKU-ConSat) was used. A total of 104 patients completed the UKU-ConSat at discharge/follow-up (between 6-11 weeks after admittance if not discharged earlier) (mean duration of stay 4 weeks), thus corresponding to the end of the acute treatment phase. Results A total of 88.4% had total scores above zero (satisfied). Only three of the eight single items were statistically significantly different among patients admitted voluntarily versus involuntarily, and only the information item score remained significantly different in adjusted analyses. Insight level at admittance, and an increasing level of insight during the acute phase were positively associated with patient satisfaction, whereas levels and changes in positive and negative psychosis symptoms were indirectly related to satisfaction via this process of insight. Conclusions The vast majority of the acutely admitted patients were satisfied with treatment. There were few differences between the involuntarily and voluntarily admitted patient groups, except that the involuntary care group was clearly less satisfied with the information provided. Poor insight had a major negative impact on treatment satisfaction in psychosis.

The deinstitutionalization of the mental healthcare system was implemented in Denmark in the late 1970s with the intention of increasing out-patient treatment. One of the aims in the reorganization was to treat the patient in the local environment rather than during long-term hospitalization. This study focuses on the changes in the utilization of hospital facilities.\nUsing register data from secondary healthcare treatment of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Denmark 1970-2012, we analysed the development in the use of hospital facilities.\nOur major finding was a 220% increase between 1970 and 2012 in the total number of hospital admissions due to schizophrenia each year, while at the same time the number of annual schizophrenia bed days was reduced by 76%. Furthermore, the readmission rate within a year after discharge with a diagnosis of schizophrenia reached 70% in 2012 compared to 51% in 1970. Finally, the total bed occupancy continued to rise over the four decades and has exceeded 100% in several years since 1999.\nThe findings indicate that the reorganization of the Danish mental healthcare system has created a problem of 'revolving door' schizophrenia patients' who since the 1970s have been increasingly hospitalized but for shorter periods. Possible explanations of the findings are premature discharge of patients with schizophrenia due to lack of beds or/and that community psychiatry has not been providing adequate relapse prevention."}, {"Title": "Mortality trends in cardiovascular causes in schizophrenia, bipolar and unipolar mood disorder in Sweden 1987-2010.", "Abstract": "People with severe mental illness have increased risk for premature mortality and thus a shorter life expectancy.

Our experiments reveal a rMS-induced reduction in GABAergic synaptic strength (2-4\u2009h after stimulation), which is Ca(2+)-dependent and accompanied by the remodelling of postsynaptic gephyrin scaffolds. Furthermore, we present evidence that 10-Hz rMS predominantly acts on dendritic, but not somatic inhibition.

A wealth of data shows that ADHD symptoms respond well to pharmacological treatment. Stimulant medications, including amphetamine and methylphenidate, are most commonly used to treat ADHD. However, with the approval of atomoxetine (Strattera(\u00ae), [ATX]) by the US Food and Drug Administration in late 2002, an effective non-stimulant option became available. The US Food and Drug Administration approved ATX for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults. Although the effect size of ATX is generally lower than that of stimulants, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice Parameter for the treatment of ADHD lists ATX as a first-line treatment option. ATX is widely prescribed and accounted for 6% of the prescriptions of ADHD visits in the US in 2010. Numerous trials have found that ATX improves quality of life and emotional lability in addition to core ADHD symptoms. Although some improvement may be seen in a patient as early as one week after the initiation of treatment, ATX generally takes longer to have a full effect. The median time to response using 25% improvement in ADHD symptoms in pooled trials was 3.7 weeks. Data from these trials indicate that the probability of symptom improvement may continue to increase up to 52 weeks after treatment is initiated.

Depression (BDI) scores were 2.53 points higher (95\u00a0% CI 0.47-4.60; P\u2009=\u20090.02) over 6\u00a0months if CSF HIV RNA was detectable at a prior study visit in fully adjusted models including age, sex, race, education, plasma HIV RNA, duration and adherence of CART, and lifetime depression diagnosis by Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria. Persistent CSF but not plasma HIV RNA is associated with an increased risk for new-onset depression.

A recent paper described 13 LR-related blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response contrast patterns observed during an emotional face recognition task that might reflect cognitive processes contributing to LR and that might themselves predict adverse alcohol outcomes (Paulus et\u00a0al., Biol Psychiatry 2012; 72: 848). This paper evaluates the predictive implications of those functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns.\nOf 120 subjects from Paulus and colleagues (2012), 114 (57 low and high LRs; ~50% females) were interviewed 5\u00a0years later at age 25. Correlations between baseline fMRI patterns and alcohol-related outcomes were evaluated, and regression analyses were used to determine if BOLD response contrasts incremented over LR in predicting outcomes.\nBaseline fMRI patterns in 5 of 13 baseline regions of interest correlated with adverse outcomes. Such patterns in insular regions, particularly the left anterior insula, and the right frontal gyrus, added to LR in predicting alcohol problems. The relationships remained robust when exact binomial procedures were used, but, reflecting the small sample size, it was not possible to adequately consider Bonferroni corrections.\nThe data suggest that fMRI BOLD response contrasts predicted heavier drinking and alcohol problems 5\u00a0years later, even after considering baseline low LRs. Future work will focus on whether fMRI results can predict outcomes in larger samples and among young nondrinkers, as well as how the imaging results increase understanding of the processes through which LR operates."}, {"Title": "Development of fixed dose combination tablets of aripiprazole plus divalproex sodium and their simultaneous determination using HPLC-UV.", "Abstract": "A vast majority of psychiatric patients are effectively treated with combination of drugs to improve efficacy and adherence, but due to limited research and development in fixed dose combination (FDC) in psychiatry, these products are not commonly available. The aim of this study is to prepare cost effective FDC tablets containing aripiprazole and divalproex sodium. Two batches of fixed dose combination tablets, FDC1 and FDC2, were successfully prepared using wet granulation technique. Furthermore, aripiprazole tablets A1 and A2 and divalproex tablets D1 were also formulated as reference to compare the in vitro availability profile. An accurate and simple isocratic HPLC method was established and validated for the simultaneous quantification of aripiprazole and valproic acid in the FDC tablets. A reversed-phase C18 (250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6\u2009mm) column in isocratic mode was used. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 0.32% KH2PO4 (60:40, v/v), flow rate was set at 1.0\u2009mL/min and the detection was performed at 210\u2009nm. Average percent recoveries of aripiprazole and valproic acid were 96.0 and 95.5%, respectively, meeting the official requirements. The newly developed FDC product may be used for the better therapeutic outcomes of combined use of aripiprazole and valproic acid, which may improve patient adherence."}, {"Title": "[The Pharmacist as Gatekeeper of Prescription Drug Abuse: Return to \"Community Scientists\"].", "Abstract": "\u00a0\u00a0The non-medical use or abuse of prescription drugs, including benzodiazepines, is a growing health problem in Japan. An association between prescription drug overdose and suicide risk has also been reported. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has expected pharmacists to act as \"gatekeepers\", facilitating early identification of individuals at high risk of prescription drug abuse including overdose, supplying medication counseling to patients, and helping to introduce these patients to appropriate medical care. Prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines are widely used in psychiatry. However, these drugs are prescribed not only by psychiatrists but also by other healthcare professionals including primary care physicians. Moreover, in recent years, the dispensing of prescriptions has moved rapidly from inside to outside hospitals, with prescription drugs being dispensed mainly at community pharmacies. Although all healthcare professionals including hospital pharmacists can play a role in preventing prescription drug abuse, the role of the community pharmacist is vital in addressing this problem. Formerly, community pharmacists were recognized as \"community scientists\", low-threshold accessible healthcare advisors. Now, community pharmacists should return to the role of community scientists to prevent prescription drug abuse. This article begins by reviewing the current situation of prescription drug abuse and dependence in Japan. The role of pharmacists as gatekeepers in preventing prescription drug abuse is then examined. Finally, this article discusses the effect of intervention in the form of gatekeeper training for community pharmacists."}, {"Title": "Admission Volume and Quality of Mental Health Care Among Danish Patients With Recently Diagnosed Schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "The relationship between admission volume and the quality of mental health care remains unclear. This study examined the association between admission volume of psychiatric hospital units and quality of mental health care among patients with recently diagnosed schizophrenia (past year) admitted to units in Denmark.\nIn a nationwide population-based cohort study, 3,209 patients admitted to psychiatric hospital units between 2004 and 2011 were identified from the Danish Schizophrenia Registry. Admission volume was categorized into four quartiles according to the individual unit's average caseload volume per year during the study period: low volume (quartile 1, \u226475 admissions per year), medium volume (quartile 2, 76-146 admissions per year), high volume (quartile 3, 147-256 admissions per year) and very high volume (quartile 4, >256 admissions per year). Quality of mental health care was defined as having received processes of care recommended in guidelines.\nCompared with patients admitted to low-volume psychiatric hospital units, patients admitted to very-high-volume units were more likely to receive high overall quality of mental health care (\u226580% of recommended processes of care) (risk ratio [RR]=1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.03-1.91) and to receive several specific processes of care, including assessment of psychopathology by a specialist in psychiatry (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.10) and psychoeducation (RR=1.16, CI=1.05-1.28). Moreover, patients admitted to high-volume units were more likely to have a suicide risk assessment at discharge (RR=1.14, CI=1.07-1.21).\nAdmission to very-high-volume and high-volume psychiatric hospital units was associated with a greater chance of receiving guideline-recommended processes of care among patients admitted with recently diagnosed schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "An Experimental Comparison of Telepsychiatry and Conventional Psychiatry for Parolees.", "Abstract": "Many offenders treated for psychiatric disorders while incarcerated are paroled to counties where psychiatric care is limited, leading some correctional departments to offer psychiatric treatment via videoconferencing (\"telepsychiatry\").

Satisfaction with treatment, therapeutic alliance, medication adherence, and psychological functioning were measured. Follow-up data were collected from 60 of the 71 (85%) patients (N=20, telepsychiatry; N=40, control condition).\nFindings revealed high satisfaction with telepsychiatry overall and no significant group differences in medication adherence or psychological functioning.

However, little is known about the diagnostic effects of implementing such an interview into the standard diagnostic procedure of a child psychiatric clinic. Therefore, we reviewed discharge diagnoses of psychiatric patients (age: 8-12 years; combined sample of inpatients and day hospital patients) over two intervals before and after implementing the semi-structured diagnostic interview K-SADS-PL as a diagnostic tool during intake. Each interval was a two year period spanning from 2009-2010 (pre sample; n=177) and from 2012-2013 (post sample; n=132). The number of diagnoses per patient and the co-morbidity rate increased significantly in the post sample. Furthermore, the percentage of children with a nonspecific diagnosis \"other mixed disorders of conduct and emotions\" (ICD-10: F92.8) decreased significantly after using the K-SADS-PL. Regarding the main diagnostic categories, a significant increase in the number of anxiety disorders and stress-related and somatoform disorders was found in the post sample. The results suggest that implementing a semi-structured interview into the daily routine of child psychiatry may have a substantial impact on discharge diagnoses. Practical implications are discussed and ideas for future research are given."}, {"Title": "Neuropharmacology beyond reductionism - A likely prospect.", "Abstract": "Neuropharmacology had several major past successes, but the last few decades did not witness any leap forward in the drug treatment of brain disorders. Moreover, current drugs used in neurology and psychiatry alleviate the symptoms, while hardly curing any cause of disease, basically because the etiology of most neuro-psychic syndromes is but poorly known. This review argues that this largely derives from the unbalanced prevalence in neuroscience of the analytic reductionist approach, focused on the cellular and molecular level, while the understanding of integrated brain activities remains flimsier. The decline of drug discovery output in the last decades, quite obvious in neuropharmacology, coincided with the advent of the single target-focused search of potent ligands selective for a well-defined protein, deemed critical in a given pathology. However, all the widespread neuro-psychic troubles are multi-mechanistic and polygenic, their complex etiology making unsuited the single-target drug discovery. An evolving approach, based on systems biology considers that a disease expresses a disturbance of the network of interactions underlying organismic functions, rather than alteration of single molecular components. Accordingly, systems pharmacology seeks to restore a disturbed network via multi-targeted drugs. This review notices that neuropharmacology in fact relies on drugs which are multi-target, this feature having occurred just because those drugs were selected by phenotypic screening in vivo, or emerged from serendipitous clinical observations. The novel systems pharmacology aims, however, to devise ab initio multi-target drugs that will appropriately act on multiple molecular entities. Though this is a task much more complex than the single-target strategy, major informatics resources and computational tools for the systemic approach of drug discovery are already set forth and their rapid progress forecasts promising outcomes for neuropharmacology."}, {"Title": "Human compulsivity: A perspective from evolutionary medicine.", "Abstract": "Biological explanations address not only proximal mechanisms (for example, the underlying neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder), but also distal mechanisms (that is, a consideration of how particular neurobiological mechanisms evolved). Evolutionary medicine has emphasized a series of explanations for vulnerability to disease, including constraints, mismatch, and tradeoffs. The current paper will consider compulsive symptoms in obsessive-compulsive and related disorders and behavioral addictions from this evolutionary perspective. It will argue that while obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is typically best conceptualized as a dysfunction, it is theoretically and clinically valuable to understand some symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in terms of useful defenses. The symptoms of behavioral addictions can also be conceptualized in evolutionary terms (for example, mismatch), which in turn provides a sound foundation for approaching assessment and intervention."}, {"Title": "Gabapentin: Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal.", "Abstract": "To identify case reports and studies regarding patients who abused, became dependent on, or experienced withdrawal from gabapentin.\nA PubMed literature search (1993 to October 2015) was performed using the search terms gabapentin, withdrawal, dependence, and addiction. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.\nAll English-language case reports and studies were evaluated.\nA total of 18 case reports or case series were identified regarding addiction to or withdrawal from gabapentin. All the cases of addiction were in patients who had a previous history of alcohol, cocaine, or opioid abuse. On average, the patients were taking more than 3000 mg/d (600-8000 mg/d). Two surveys reported that the misuse of gabapentin was 1.1% in the general population and 22% in drug abuse treatment centers. Withdrawal, when reported, occurred within 12 hours to 7 days of discontinuation of the medication.\nThere have been numerous documented cases of gabapentin abuse, dependence, and withdrawal. Even though gabapentin is sometimes considered as a treatment option for alcohol and substance abuse, it is important to monitor for drug-seeking behaviors. A history of alcohol or substance abuse appears to be an important part of a patient's medical history when evaluating their risk for addiction and dependence behaviors. Health care providers need to be aware of this risk in their patients and monitor their patients for signs of abuse and dependence along with withdrawal symptoms."}, {"Title": "Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A New Diagnostic Approach to Chronic Irritability in Youth.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2014; 171:918-924 with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Emotion Dysregulation in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2014; 171:276-293, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Treatment of Maternal Depression in a Medication Clinical Trial and Its Effect on Children.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2015; 172:450-459, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing)."}, {"Title": "Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Eating Disorders.", "Abstract": "(Reprinted from the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry</i> 2015;54(5):412-425 with permission from the Academy)."}, {"Title": "Healer, Witness, or Double Agent? Reexamining the Ethics of Forensic Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In recent years, psychiatrists have become ever more prevalent in American courtrooms. Consequently, the issue of when the usual rules of medical ethics should apply to forensic psychiatric encounters has taken on increased importance and is a continuing topic of discussion among both legal and medical scholars. A number of approaches to the problem of forensic psychiatric ethics have been proposed, but none adequately addresses the issues that arise when a forensic encounter develops therapeutic characteristics. This article looks to the rules governing the lawyer-client relationship as a model for a new approach to forensic psychiatric ethics. This new model focuses on the expectations of the evaluee and the ways in which the evaluating psychiatrist shapes those expectations to determine how and when the rules of medical ethics should apply to forensic psychiatric encounters. This article describes and analyzes three previously proposed approaches to that question and the closely related question of when and how a doctor-patient relationship can form in the context of a forensic psychiatric evaluation. It also explains why each of these prior approaches does not sufficiently address the issues that arise when a forensic encounter takes on therapeutic characteristics. Finally, it proposes a new approach that draws inspiration from the rules governing the lawyer-client relationship."}, {"Title": "[The Current Issues of Crime Victim Support from a Clinical Point of View].", "Abstract": "This paper reviews part of an educational lecture at the 111th Annual Meeting of the Jap- anese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN), under the identical title by the author.

Second, introducing a case report of a rape victim diagnosed as PTSD, comments are made on symptoms, such as avoidance and emotional numbing as part of dissociation. It is common for clinicians, even for patients themselves, to fail to notice these symptoms.

Liberman introduced \"Personal Support Specialists\" as a role of psychiatrists who support patients' lives and help them discover the meaning of life, as well as helping with daily activities and personal difficulties. They need to have multiple perspectives on medical, subjective, social, and life recoveries. Important areas to help patients practically are job-assis- tance, supporting love and marriage, and independent living in the community. I usually use Seikatsu-Rinsho (The way of Living Learning), cognitive behavioral therapy, and Seikatsu-ryouhou (Life-centered Therapy) by Hiroshi Utena as basic principles in my practice. Recently, I shed light on an -individual value system to evolve these principles. Reflecting on two recovery stories I co-encountered, contents of psychiatric interviews and roles of psychiatrists are discussed. There remain many difficulties which modern psychiatry has not resolved, such as negative symptoms and marked disabilities in social life.

The Committee, however, was disbanded in 1967 after its final meeting in Kanazawa. The Okinawa Psy- chiatric Committee was newly launched in 1971 to replace the previous committee, and I was appointed the Director in charge of this concern, along with Nagasaki University Professor Ryo Takahashi, who was serving as the Committee Chairperson. Since then, I have been involved with the matter of dispatching psychiatrists to Okinawa. Specifically, we began our activities by visiting Okinawa to gain a grasp of the actual sta- tus of various problems affecting dispatched psychiatrists, and to draw up future plans. We made an investigatory trip to Okinawa on December 21-27, 1971. On the main island of Oki- nawa, we visited the then Ryukyu government office, the Japanese government's local office, public and private mental hospitals, almost all public health centers, as well as the Ryukyu Mental Health Association. We also visited relevant facilities on Miyako and Ishigaki islands. Through visits such as these, we made an effort to find out on the actual status of local psychiatric medicine at the time, and the roles that the dispatched psychiatrists had played up to that point. We also worked on learning to what extent the people concerned in Okinawa were aware of the current situation, and what they hoped to gain from our Society. We tried to hold as many meetings as possible with our Society's local members as well as those who were already working as dispatched psychiatrists, and set up opportunities to exchange opinions. What became clear through our visits was that the dispatched psychiatrists were eager to go out and practice in the field, as needed, without being tied down to treating patients inside hospitals. Based on local inspections such as these, we drew up a written report that helped to resume and re-establish the system of sending psychiatrists to Okinawa. Besides playing the public role described above, I took a personal interest in the system of resident nurses, which had disappeared after the return of Okinawa to mainland Japan, as I felt, that they had played a significant role. In any event, I feel it worth mentioning that the system of sending psychiatrists to Okinawa not only helped support psychiatric medicine in Okinawa, but also became a model for volunteer activities in the wake of earthquakes that occurred later on in other areas of Japan."}, {"Title": "[Background of Okinawa's Acceptance of Dispatched Physicians and Its Current Status].", "Abstract": "In response to the Japanese government's decision to dispatch psychiatrists to Okinawa to improve a significant delay in the establishment of psychiatry there following World War II, the Okinawa Psychiatric Care Cooperation Committee (former Okinawa Psychiatric Care Committee) was established by the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology to ensure the stable dispatch of physicians. A total of 83 psychiatrists were dispatched to Okinawa, and they markedly contributed to the development of psychiatry in the prefecture.

I also recognized important points of view about culture and psychiatry. I spent five years in Touhoku and then the East Japan Disaster hit area.

Based on the \"opinions of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology Board of Directors following the official recognition of mental disorders as important diseases under the Medical Service Law's medical care plan\" (September 28, 2011), investigations were conducted focusing on three aspects : locations of medical care plan discussions, public awareness of medical care information, and target values. Medical care plans of the 47 prefectures were collected. A ques- tionnaire regarding the mental disorder care plan decision process was sent to each prefecture, and answers were received from -those in charge of each jurisdiction. Among the 45 prefec- tures that responded, the mental disorder care planning groups held an average of 3 meetings. The largest number of meetings held was 7 (in 3 prefectures), and 2 meetings or fewer were held in 15 prefectures. No meeting was held in 7 prefectures. Locations in which the promotion of regional medical care cooperation regarding mental disorders was discussed were recorded by less than half of the medical care plans. The names of the medical facilities that were recorded in many of the medical care plans included various functions, such as \"facilities for emergency psychiatric care\" and \"dementia medical centers.\" However, medical care functions specific to various mental disorders and medical facility names including these functions were only recorded in approximately half of the medical care plans. Regarding target values for promoting medical care plans, the vast majority of prefectures recorded that the \"average in- patient discharge rates occurred in under 1 year.\"A relatively large number of prefectures also recorded \"suicide mortality rates\". and the \"number of dementia medical centers\" ; however, there were hardly any records concerning \"rates of in-patient hospitalization for medical care and protection lasting more than 1 year.\" Moreover, there were few records regarding the \"number of patients (per 100,000 of population) hospitalized for medical care and protection each year\" and the \"percentage of patients receiving care in protective room isolation.\" While prefectural medical care plan contents are varied, definite improvements of psychiatric care through medical care planning are finally underway. Mental disorder medical care plans based on the Medical Service Law operate together with related documents such as the guideline based on the Mental Health and Welfare Act, Article 41 ; disability welfare plans based on the Comprehensive Support for Persons with Disabilities Act ; and long-term care plans based on the Long-term Care Insurance Act. Further implementation and assessment, and continued revision based on this assessment, are needed with regard to these related plans and guidelines."}, {"Title": "[History and Current Status of Birth Cohort Studies in the UK, and Feasibility in Japan].", "Abstract": "Birth cohort studies are conducted by prospectively following the participants with a spe- cific characteristic background from their birth or prenatal birth, and can explore the causal relationship of various factors with outcomes. In the UK, birth cohort studies with long-term follow-ups have been launched every ten years, which have provided many significant results and related useful policy recommendation. However, these have not necessarily intended to be launched as the national project with long-term observations, rather existing birth cohorts are accept to continue because of the excellent results and survey condition. In 1990s, birth cohort studies have been revalued as national resources, and widely used by domestic and international researchers. As the contribution to psychiatry and mental health, most of the cohort studies have been conducted to identify risk factors for onset of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. Nowadays, broader studies were conducted and highly evaluated for the relationships between physical and psychological illnesses, and biological studies. Recent cohort studies also showed that cognitive abilities in childhood or adolescence was similar between those who later developed schizophrenia and those who experienced psychotic symptoms, sug- gesting that a spectrum in psychiatric diseases would be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology. In Japan, birth cohort studies which findings could be reflected on policy implications have been required as national resources. However, as there have been no birth cohort studies that have conducted for long-term follow-ups, there are little techniques and knowledge for launching and continuing a birth cohort study with low attrition, and providing evidences to society. It is necessary to establish these techniques and knowledge by learning from the UK cases within the cultural and social contexts in Japan. High quality routine studies including examination have been implemented in Japan in various fields such as perinatal and infant care, schools, work places, medical care, and the central and local governments. Supplementation of those data will be needed for high quality birth cohort studies.

As for 1), our facility offers a hospitalization for examination program, which uses near-infrared spectroscopy as a biomarker useful for the auxiliary diagnosis of psy- chiatric disease and selection of the treatment method. University psychiatric departments also play a major role in neuropsychiatry, such as through the use of Epilepsy Monitoring Units (EMU) to differentiate between epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). Additionally, hospitalizations for examination programs are being implemented for psychosocial and employment support for psychiatric patients, and the diagnosis and evaluation of develop- mental disorders. With regard to 2), our facility has a psychiatric liaison-consultation team. In addition to providing consultation for all departments on delirium, anxiety, and depression, they are actively committed to various transplant treatments. There is also a strong cooperative relationship between the critical care center and psychiatric department. Of the patients hospi- talized for physical conditions and emergencies, over ten percent require psychiatric support, and without the psychiatric department, many patients with severe physical diseases cannot be treated. As such, the medical fees for psychiatric departments in universities and general hospitals should be evaluated appropriately. We would like to propose an \"Advanced Psychiat- ric Treatment Development Management Center\" (tentative name) to manage the following cycle : a) every university psychiatric department will develop and offer model projects utiliz- ing their respective expertise and specialties ; b) after collecting information on best practices, they will establish evidence through multicenter research, Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data, and others ; c) they will progress to advanced medical treatments and insurance coverage ; and d) they will continue to improve quality.

However, I think there is a constant need for psychiatric departments of general hospitals, because the number of psychiatric departments of general hospitals with no psychiatric beds is increasing, even though the number of psychiatric departments of general hospitals with psychiatric beds is decreasing. Recently, there has been a trend of reevaluating psychiatry in medical care, such as in the medical treatments fees or in health care planning, so we cannot talk about medical care without involving psychiatry. The participation of gen- eral hospital psychiatry with a medical cooperation function is necessary for psychiatric reform from hospital-based to community-based psychiatry, as well as for the promotion of self-suffi- cient medical care in local communities based on medical cooperation. For psychiatry corre- sponding to high-grade acute medical care, the existence of general hospital psychiatry is nec- essary which has close contact with medical care and has a psychiatric acute care function, and adequate measures should be adopted in the national medical care fee and medical policies for the enhancement of general hospital psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[The Report of the Survey to the Members of the Society about the Functional Dissociation of the Psychiatric Hospital beds].", "Abstract": "In 2014, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare published the guideline on the policy of the psychiatric hospitals.

This may be because of the influence of K. Jasper's General Psycho- pathology. However, from the mid-19th to early 20th century, when modern psychiatry was estab- lished, some excellent hypotheses concerning the pathogenesis of mental symptoms were pro- posed, although it was difficult to verify these hypotheses because of technical limitations. The purpose of this article was to review the historical development of symptomatology in psycho- sis with reference to the pathogenesis. W. Griesinger (1845, 1861) distinguished between the etiology and pathogenesis of a disease, and stated that every mental disease is a manifestation of brain disease. Subsequent investigators elaborated on this view : C. Wernicke (1894, 1906) proposed the disconnection of the association tracts, and P. Flechsig (1894, 1920) regarded the late myelinating \"association areas\"' (this term was from Flechsig) as the field of the mind. J. H. Jackson (1895) proposed the evolutionary and hierarchical organization of the nervous system. E. Kraepelin (1913) speculated on the hypoactivity of the frontal cortex-the highest cerebral centers according to Jackson's terminology-and hyperactivity of the temporal speech cortex as the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms in dementia praecox, which were found to be the case based on neuroimaging methods over sixty years later. Currently, the pathogenesis of mental symptoms is being investigated from the viewpoint of the dysfunctions of neural cir- cuits, such as cortico-limbic, cortico-thalamic, or cortico-striatal circuitry."}, {"Title": "[The Conceptual Framework and Science of Personal Recovery].", "Abstract": "While objectively measurable outcomes have been emphasized in modern psychiatry, sub- jective or patient-reported outcome measures have attracted renewed interest recently.

It has been recognized in recent years that diet and nutrition may be an important factor con- tributing to psychiatric morbidity, and that prevention or treatment of psychiatric disorders could be conducted by addressing diet and nutrition. Against this background, in 2013 we founded the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research (ISNPR). The aim of the present paper is to provide a set of practical recommendations for the prevention and treat- ment of depression based on the ISNPR statement and the review by Opie et al. Here, we introduce Opie's five key dietary recommendations and state our hypotheses for improving mental health: (1) follow traditional dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean, Norwegian, or Japanese diet (2) increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole-grain cereals, nuts, and seeds; (3) consume higher amounts of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids; (4) replace unhealthy foods with wholesome nutritious foods ; (5)limit intake of processed foods, fast foods, commercial baked goods, and sweets ; and (6) be mindful of probiotic gut bacteria. The pos- sible biological mechanisms by which nutrition might affect mental state are not known in depth, and full associations between nutrition and mental disorders have not been examined in randomized controlled trials. However, the existing evidence suggests that a combination of healthy dietary practices may reduce the risk of developing depression. As dietary practices and lifestyle can be changed by individuals at any time, new integrated approaches to mental health from the viewpoint of diet and nutrition-that is, nutritional psychiatry-could be appli- cable to a wide population. Gathering the findings of high-quality studies and implementing nutritional psychiatry within clinical practice are important tasks for the future."}, {"Title": "[Your Partnership for Psychiatry and Neuroscience in the World -An Integrated Perspective on Mental Illness-].", "Abstract": "Human disease structure has constantly changed in close association with the times and society. Nowadays, there are so many\"brain and mind problems\"against a background of social issues. In developed countries including Japan, mental illnesses have seriously affected the lives and health of patients and their families. It is historically clear that stigma towards mental ill- nesses and a fragile mental health service have led to the existing situation. Therefore, to achieve the development of psychiatry in the future, we need to ruminate over the possibility of prevention, early intervention, and treatment and recovery to reduce stigma towards mental illnesses while regarding them as brain diseases. Based on the point of view that cognitive impairment could largely influence social functioning, and by introducing schizophrenia as a representative cognitive illness, we would like to discuss the remaining problems and future directions of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "[How to Learn and Practice Psychotherapies -A Proposal from the Japan Psychotherapy Week-].", "Abstract": "In the JSPN postgraduate training guideline for certified psychiatrists, cognitive-behav- ioral therapy (CBT) is to be referred to, understood, and explained in psychotherapeutic treatments of certain mental disorders. The Japanese Association for Cognitive Therapy has annually sponsored the Cognitive Therapy Workshop for mental health professionals since 2000. The Japan Psychotherapy Week (JPW) has been a dream project of the present author to provide opportunities to learn such psychotherapies as psychoanalysis, Morita therapy, and CBT at the same place during the same periods of time, simultaneously or sequentially. The idea of the JPW has two sources: Differential therapeutics in psychiatry on one hand, and the Japan Digestive Disease Week on the other hand. The JPW2015 \"East Meets West\" was held at a traditional hotel in Kobe in the evenings of February 21 and 28, 2015. As described in Plato's Symposium, the audience was served food and drinks while listening to the speaker talk about psychoanalysis, Morita therapy, and CBT. The first evening began with making a toast, followed by opening remarks about the author's intentions regarding the JPW, based on excerpts from Zeami's Fushihaden (the Flowering Spirit). Two well-known psychiatrists majoring in CBT and Morita therapy gave an address, entitled: \"What is a desirable encounter of East with West?\" and \"On psychotherapy having roots\", respectively. In the second evening, a prominent psychiatrist in the field of psychoanal- ysis gave a lecture on\"The power of words in psychotherapy\". After drinking a toast, excerpts from Plato's Symposium were presented to identify Eros as a \"great daimon\" mediating between immortal gods and mortal human beings. The cognitive therapist showed how cognitive therapy has the power of incorporating ele- ments of interpersonal, behavioral, and psychodynamic approaches. The JPW has nothing to do with psychotherapy integration. Instead, cognitive therapy, as an intermediary, will vanish in the process of the JPW. When established, the JPW will further develop the psychotherapeutic competence of psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "[The Importance of Remaining a Psychiatric Medical Specialist].", "Abstract": "As a member of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology's Committee to Improve the Medical Specialist System, I have used the Committee's discussions as my start- ing point for describing what action needs to be taken to update psychiatric medical specialist qualifications under the new medical specialist framework while retaining its key principles. The gist of the reform of the medical specialist system is that tasks such as clearing up confusion at clinical sites and restoring the public's trust in physicians should not be assigned to outside institutions. Instead, groups of physicians will themselves set up and run a self-reg- ulating organization that sets out their ideals as to quality, etc., and holds the profession to these ideals. To prevent any loss of professional pride and autonomy, they must establish, on their own initiative, a highly transparent system that the general public will accept, and which will support and develop high-quality medical professionals. In other words, building a system such as this cannot be considered separately from the process of educating specialized medical doctors. Medical specialists are expected to continue undergoing appropriate training and to maintain and enhance their competencies. Qualification as a medical specialist shows that the individual is continuing to undergo training to enhance his or her excellence as a medical spe- cialist and, at the same time, ensures his or her professional value. The key requirement for updating medical specialist qualifications is for the individual to be engaged in medical practice. Medical care provided at departments of psychiatry differs somewhat from that offered by other clinical departments and/or fields, since it covers a broad range of areas that can extend outside the clinical services offered at hospitals. Knowledge, skills and attitudes as a psychiatric medical specialist are evaluated based on a review of case reports. In addition to psychiatry-related content, training must cover themes related to pro- fessionalism such as medical ethics and legislation, as well as subjects necessary to obtain the latest medical knowledge such as clinical research and evidence-based medicine (EBM). Physi- cians intending to newly qualify as medical specialists need to be engaged in some sort of research, and to have the competency to compile and present the outcomes of their studies, as well as having a proven track record. Out of consideration to the actual circumstances, in the field of psychiatry, academic achievement is not a necessary condition for updating medical specialist qualifications. Japanese Medical Specialty Board supports this position. As defined in the upcoming reform of the medical specialist system, a medical specialist is a personal qualification. At the same time, it is individuals who play a role as a member of an autonomous group, responsible for maintaining the value of this qualification."}, {"Title": "[Future Perspective on the Specialty Certification Examination for Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The system of the specialty certification of psychiatry of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) was established in 2005, and certification examination has been conducted since 2009. The Japanese Medical Specialty Board was established in 2014 in order to develop a new common specialty certification system encompassing 19 medical fields, and the training under the new system will be initiated in 2017. Under the new system, a core medical institution heads a group of medical institutions that consist of some hospitals and clin- ics for the specialty training program, and the core institution is responsible for the training and education of each resident. The committee of the certification examination of psychiatry in JSPN is responsible for administration of the examination. The aims of the examination, consisting of written and oral tests, are to assess knowledge, skills, and the attitude as a psychiatrist and decide whether or not an examinee meets the standards. Because the missions of the specialists are to treat severe and serious cases appropriately as well as to provide people with standard treatment, the role of the oral examination to assess clinical skills is important. However, there is not enough time or manpower to enrich the oral examination under the existing circumstances. Therefore, it is indispensable to assess the skills and attitudes of residents regu- larly and objectively in the training program. We need to discuss the specialty certification examination thoroughly in order to gain an image of the future of psychiatry in Japan."}, {"Title": "[Curriculum of the New Certificate Psychiatrist System of the Japanese Board of Psychiatry-What Items are Applied Each Year for Three Years, and How Training Psychiatrists are Evaluated-].", "Abstract": "The new certificate psychiatrist system of the Japanese Board of Psychiatry is discussed from the viewpoint of the improvement of the current certificate psychiatrist system. In the new system, training items are applied each year for three years. Actually general items and particular disease items of the current training book are rearranged in the new sys- tem. The results of training psychiatrists are evaluated multi-dimensionally and two-way com- municatively. The instructing doctor evaluates the performance of training psychiatrists at the time of completing the program at all training hospitals and gives some feedback to the psy- chiatrists. Staff with multiple occupations also evaluate the training psychiatrists. The training psychiatrists also evaluate the instructing doctors and training program.

Although the so-called 'Yamauchi Report' eventually determined the professional accreditation system in 1994, it was not until 2006 that the first Psychiatric Specialist was accredited. Recently, the system that has been operated for 10 years is markedly changing. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) launched an explanatory committee to discuss what a Psychiatric Specialist ought to be, and published a report in April 2013, which led to the inauguration of The General Incorporated Association of Japanese Medical Specialty Board as a trusted third party in May 2014. Thereafter, it set up a new training and accreditation system for Psychiatric Specialists, which is starting in 2017. With such situation in mind, in this paper, I explore the qualities a Psychiatric Specialist needs to acquire and the sort of professional training they shall undertake. I discuss reforming educational programs in medical schools, a clearer picture of a Specialist that the Psychiatric Specialist Investigative Commission at the MHLW and the Japanese Medical Specialty Board suggested, and the way a Psychiatric Specialist ought to be, which the Japanese Society of Psy- chiatry and Neurology has been considering. I emphasize that the methodology to achieve the goal is changing markedly along with the globalization of medical education; however, the phi- losophy, mission, and outcome of the Psychiatric Specialist system should not change."}, {"Title": "[Renewal of Certification as a Japanese Board-Certified Psychiatrist].", "Abstract": "Medical specialists certified by the Japanese Medical Specialty Board are defined as medi- cal doctors who have been appropriately and extensively trained, provide standard medical care, and are trusted by patients, responding to citizens' needs to receive standard and safe treatment. In accordance with this definition, a committee of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology has discussed the criteria for renewal since late 2014 so that the new criteria will not be markedly different from the previous ones. The major changes include the following: 1) adoption of the credit-based system in place of the point-based system, 2) making part of the courses mandatory, and 3) requiring five instead of two clinical reports as proof of clinical practice. The credits needed to renew certification as a Japanese Board-Certified Psychiatrist are calculated based on proof of clinical practice, across-specialty courses, psychiatry-specific courses, academic achievements, and activities other than clinical practice. In total, 50 credits in 5 years are required to renew the certification. In the case of exceptional circumstances where renewal in a timely manner is not possible (e.g., studying abroad for research, taking sick leave, taking maternity leave, caring for a fam- ily member, etc.), there are two options to choose from: one is to declare a state of suspension, whereby one's certification is temporarily unused, and the other is to use substitutional means, such as using self-learning in place of clinical practice. The committee intends to adopt measures as effectively as possible in order to avoid con- fusion regarding the new criteria among psychiatrists about to renew their certification, and also to minimize the discrepancy between the renewal process for the Board-Certified Psychi- atrists as stipulated by the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology and the require- ments for Medical Specialists."}, {"Title": "[New Board Certification System in Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) decided to establish the new board certification system in June 2015 under the guidelines proposed by the Japanese Medical Specialty Board (JMSB). After repeated consultations with the JMSB, the JSPN released the new rules and bylaws of the New Board Certification System in November 2015. The new certification system will be implemented in April 2017, in which 4-500 trainees will start the new three-year training in psychiatry under the new program. The first accredi- tation of the qualified trainees will be approved by the JMSB in 2020. From then, all fellows approved by the JSPN are expected to renew their qualification under the guidelines proposed by the JMSB. I regard designing the board certification system as one of the most important endeavors of the JSPN, and the ad hoc committee has worked toward the goal of designing a new certifica- tion system acceptable to the JMSB, which will stimulate and promote the improved training and education of psychiatrists. In this paper, I report the present situation of the new certification system as of February 2016."}, {"Title": "[Outcomes of Psychiatric Board System under the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, and the New Board System under the Japanese Medical Specialty Board].", "Abstract": "The Psychiatric Board System under the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology was started in 2004. Over the last 10 years, psychiatrists who had worked in the field of psy- chiatry and were recognized as having the necessary training took the board examination, and 10,498 psychiatrists acquired the Psychiatric Specialty Board certification. On the other hand, new psychiatrists who trained according to a special curriculum for more than 3 years took the board examination, and 762 psychiatrists obtained certification through the Psychiatric Specialty Board. According to principle of this system, the Psychiatric Board System should resolve several issues, such as the kind of training facility, issues with medical teaching staff and training pro- grams, the examination system, and the renewal system.

It addresses the pros and cons of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI), and the author of this article suppored the use of LAIs on the basis of their efficacy. Based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), LAIs were similar to oral antipsychotics in terms of relapse prevention. However, in the RCTs, selection bias and alterations in treatment ecology have to be taken into consideration, in that patients in the RCTs are more likely to be adherent. For example, various treatment experiences in RCTs, such as reminders, assessments, and/or incentives, could have improved patients' adher- ence. In contrast, mirror image studies, which compare the equivalent duration before and after the initiation of a new treatment, may reflect the effectiveness of LAIs in real-world clini- cal settings. In mirror image studies, the hospitalization risk and rate significantly decreased after the introduction of LAIs. LAIs as a treatment option should be discussed with patients, especially those who have adherence problems and/or who prefer LAIs."}, {"Title": "[Details not Mentioned Yet - Recent Data regarding the Pressburg-Years of Jakab Fischer].", "Abstract": "We published above in written form the papers submitted on the Jakab Fischer Memorial Session held at the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Semmelweis University, Budapest on 23th September 2014, with the title Psychiatric Therapy and Education at the Beginning of the 20th Century in Hungary.

This study explores how patients take the initiative in decision-making over treatment in outpatient psychiatric consultations in Japan. Using the methodology of conversation analysis, we analyze 85 video-recorded ongoing consultations and find that patients select between two practices for taking the initiative in decision-making: making explicit requests for a treatment and displaying interest in a treatment without explicitly requesting it. A close inspection of transcribed interaction reveals that patients make explicit requests under the circumstances where they believe the candidate treatment is appropriate for their condition, whereas they merely display interest in a treatment when they are not certain about its appropriateness. By fitting practices to take the initiative in decision-making with the way they describe their current condition, patients are optimally managing their desire for particular treatments and the validity of their initiative actions. In conclusion, we argue that the orderly use of the two practices is one important resource for patients' participation in treatment decision-making."}, {"Title": "How language shapes psychiatric case formulation.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe, analyse, and discuss the process of formulation in the specific context of mental health (MH). Formulation is a fundamental element of the work of psychiatrists and other MH clinicians that is expected to be mastered during training. The literature, however, shows that formulation is rarely explicitly addressed in the psychiatric curriculum; rather, it is implicitly developed through modelling, and/or clinical practice. This paper focuses on case formulation in one MH context in Australia. It tracks the iterative formulation of one patient in a hospital emergency department. The analysis uses resources from systemic functional linguistics (SFL) situated within a broader framework of discourse analysis. It highlights patterns of lexical relations and nominalisation as well as the range of conjunctions. These make explicit how the clinicians talk about the patient's illness and shape their developing understanding into a logical formulation. We see applications of this work for the training of mental health professionals. These data make explicit the ways in which the participating clinicians use language in the process of formulation. By bringing this process to the level of consciousness, it can be discussed and evaluated and become a pedagogic resource."}, {"Title": "The birth of modern psychiatry - Hans Jacob Schou and the Dianalund Sanatorium.", "Abstract": "Hans Jacob Schou (1887-1952) was a well-educated Danish specialist in nervous diseases. He was persuaded in 1922 to take over the leadership of the only large scale private institution in Denmark for patients with nervous diseases, The Colony of Philadelphia, near Dianalund, on the island of Zealand. He pioneered a development of this conservative institution into a modern charity hospital for patients with all kinds of nervous and mental disorders. His newly erected sanatorium (1928) for neurotic patients came to symbolize the need for inclusion of all patients - disregarding the seriousness of their illness and disregarding their social status - in the realm of Danish psychiatry. Thus, Schou created the foundations for modern Danish psychiatry."}, {"Title": "An analysis of the functioning of mental healthcare in northwestern Poland.", "Abstract": "Modern psychiatry faces numerous challenges related with the change of the epidemiology of mental disorders and the development of knowledge in this area of science. An answer to this situation is to be the introduction of community psychiatry. The implementation of this model in Poland was the aim of the National Mental Health Protection Programme. The aim of the study was to analyse the functioning of mental healthcare using the example of the West Pomeranian Province in Poland.\nThe analysis relied on a qualitative method. Three group interviews in an interdisciplinary advisory panel were conducted. People representing various areas acting for people with mental disorders participated in each meeting. Based on the conclusions that were drawn, PEST and SWOT analyses of functioning of mental healthcare were performed.\nWithin the analysis of the macro-environment of mental healthcare, the influence of the following factors was evaluated through PEST analysis: political and legal, economic, socio-cultural, and technological. All of these factors were assessed as negative for the functioning of mental healthcare. Then, a SWOT analysis was performed to indicate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the functioning of mental healthcare.\n1. Mental healthcare is more influenced by external factors than by internal factors. 2. Macro-environmental factors influence the functioning of mental healthcare in a significantly negative manner. 3. The basic problem in the functioning of mental healthcare is insufficient funding. 4.

The pipeline for Ghanaian psychiatrists remains restricted for the foreseeable future given the low expressed interest in the field by junior medical trainees. The few senior psychiatric specialists are overextended with clinical and professional duties leaving them with minimal time to teach and mentor trainees.

They bind to 3'-untranslated regions of their mRNA targets, inhibiting the transcripts' translation and/or destabilizing them. Chronic drug abuse induces changes of miRNAs expression in the brain, which is thought to contribute to addictive behaviors. Lots of miRNAs have been identified to play critical roles in the development of drug addiction. Moreover, miRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in a broad array of biologic processes, including regulation of the cell cycle, oncogenic transformation, immune cell regeneration and differentiation, and psychiatry disorders. We hypothesized that chronic drug abuse leads to aberrant expression of several miRNAs, and then aberrant miRNAs influence the innate and adaptive immunity, especially differentiation and function of T cells and B cells, through down-regulated miRNAs' target gene expression. Characterization of miRNA actions is important and has high potential effect for the management of drug addiction and immunity diseases. miRNAs are potential biomarkers, and the modulation of their expression can be used for therapeutic purposes."}, {"Title": "Mental hygiene movement as a (r)evolutionary trend in public health in interwar Kaunas and Vilnius from 1918 to 1939.", "Abstract": "The health care system of the interwar period is distinguished by its revolutionary attempts to overcome social diseases and social hardships in general. In the researches published after the Second World War, different and in some cases even contradicting ideas on mental hygiene and eugenics were mixed together and were associated - almost exclusively - with the Nazi's racist ideology, totalitarian, or authoritarian regimes. The assessments of social-medical policy of the interwar period in the Baltic region also became rather one-sided. Felder's recent study (1) gives the impression that changes in psychiatry in Lithuania were caused by the Nazi's eugenics as a single agent. However, there were other factors. One of the most significant ones was the mental hygiene movement that will be discussed in this paper.\nIn this research we used descriptive and comparative methods.\nAfter the First World War, the problem of treatment of the mentally ill was a medical and a social issue that required a completely new approach both in Lithuania and in Vilnius. The most notable manifestation of such a new attitude in psychiatry was a mental hygiene movement. University scientists in Vilnius and Kaunas were discussing issues of mental hygiene.\nThe mental hygiene movement of the early 20th century played an important role in the later development in psychiatry and medical sciences.

Data were analysed thematically to generate a service user-defined model of COC. In a cross-sectional survey, health and social care professionals (n\u00a0=\u00a0184) defined COC; responses were analysed thematically. Service user and professional definitions were conceptually mapped and compared to identify similarities and differences.\nThere was crossover between the service user and professional derived models of COC. Both contained temporal, quality, systemic, staff, hospital and needs-related elements of COC. Service users prioritized access, information, peer support and avoiding services; health professionals most frequently referred to staff, cross-sectional and temporal COC. Service users alone identified service avoidance, peer support and day centres as COC elements; professionals alone identified cross-sectional working.\nImportant similarities and differences exist in service user and professional conceptualizations of COC. Further research is necessary to explore these differences, prior to integrating service user and professional perspectives in a validated COC framework which could enable the development and evaluation of interventions to improve COC, informing policy and practice."}, {"Title": "Update of Inpatient Treatment for Refractory Chronic Daily Headache.", "Abstract": "Chronic daily headache (CDH) is a group of headache disorders, in which headaches occur daily or near-daily (>15\u00a0days per month) and last for more than 3\u00a0months. Important CDH subtypes include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache. Other headaches with shorter durations (<4\u00a0h/day) are usually not included in CDH. Common comorbidities of CDH are medication overuse headache and various psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Indications of inpatient treatment for CDH patients include poor responses to outpatient management, need for detoxification for overuse of specific medications (particularly opioids and barbiturates), and severe psychiatric comorbidities. Inpatient treatment usually involves stopping acute pain, preventing future attacks, and detoxifying medication overuse if present. Multidisciplinary integrated care that includes medical staff from different disciplines (e.g., psychiatry, clinical psychology, and physical therapy) has been recommended. The outcomes of inpatient treatment are satisfactory in terms of decreasing headache intensity or frequency, withdrawal from medication overuse, reducing disability, and improving life quality, although long-term relapse is not uncommon. In conclusion, inpatient treatment may be useful for select patients with refractory CDH and should be incorporated in a holistic headache care program."}, {"Title": "Association between history of suicide attempts and family functioning in bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "To investigate the association between history of suicide attempts (SA) and family functioning in bipolar disorder (BD) patients.\nThirty-one BD type I patients with lifetime history of SA, 31 BD type I with no lifetime history of SA, participating in the Outpatient Clinic of the Bipolar Disorder Program at the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo Medical School were recruited for this study. We used the Family Assessment Device (FAD) to evaluate family functioning. We compared these two groups on demographic and clinical variables to identify which variables were associated with family functioning impairment. Fifty-one relatives of the same patients were also asked to complete a FAD.\nBD patients with SA presented more psychiatric hospitalizations, higher frequency of psychotic symptoms, and higher scores on depressive, manic, and suicidal ideation than BD patients without SA. BD patients with SA presented significantly higher scores in several subscales of the FAD, including Problem Solving (p=0.042), Communication (p=0.009), Roles (p=0.006), and General Functioning (p=0.025), when compared with BD patients without SA. Relatives of BD patients with SA presented significantly higher scores in Communication, Roles, Affective Responsiveness, and General Functioning than relatives of BD patients without SA.\nCross-sectional study and long time elapsed since last SA.\nHistory of SA in BD is associated with worse family functioning in several domains of FAD, including Problem Solving, Communication, Roles, and General Functioning. As suicide attempts are routinely assessed in clinical practice, these findings may help to identify patients with poorer family functioning and may suggest a role for environmental risk factors in suicidal behavior among BD patients."}, {"Title": "The self-regulating brain and neurofeedback: Experimental science and clinical promise.", "Abstract": "Neurofeedback, one of the primary examples of self-regulation, designates a collection of techniques that train the brain and help to improve its function. Since coming on the scene in the 1960s, electroencephalography-neurofeedback has become a treatment vehicle for a host of mental disorders; however, its clinical effectiveness remains controversial. Modern imaging technologies of the living human brain (e.g., real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging) and increasingly rigorous research protocols that utilize such methodologies begin to shed light on the underlying mechanisms that may facilitate more effective clinical applications. In this paper we focus on recent technological advances in the field of human brain imaging and discuss how these modern methods may influence the field of neurofeedback. Toward this end, we outline the state of the evidence and sketch out future directions to further explore the potential merits of this contentious therapeutic prospect."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry for Inpatient Consultations at a Separate Campus of an Academic Medical Center.", "Abstract": "Many hospitals do not have regular access to psychiatry consult services. This is well understood as a common shortage at nonacademic community hospitals (especially in rural environments, and may also be a problem at noncontiguously located smaller hospitals that are affiliated with academic medical centers in urban settings. The authors sought to deliver timely inpatient psychiatric consultation-liaison services via telemedicine to a local but physically separated hospital affiliated with an academic medical center.\nThe authors collaborated with an office dedicated to the advancement of telemedicine technology at their academic medical center. They developed a telemedicine-based care model to deliver inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry consultations to an affiliated (but physically separate) small academic hospital that did not have its own on-site consultation-liaison psychiatry team.\nThe authors were able to successfully complete 30 consultations, each within 24\u2009h. Only 1 patient was ultimately unwilling to participate in the telemedicine interview. As consultations were accomplished on same day as request, patient length of stay was unaffected.\nThis pilot study suggests that telemedicine is a viable model for inpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry services to hospitals without on-site psychiatry resources and represents a viable alternative model of service delivery."}, {"Title": "Social (pragmatic) communication disorders and autism spectrum disorder.", "Abstract": "Changes have been made to the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the recent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and similar changes are likely in the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) due in 2017.

This growth came with questions on the quality criteria needed to evaluate this work, and numerous guidelines were published. These guidelines, however, include many discrepancies, both in terms of vocabulary and structure. Many expert evaluators also decry the absence of consensual and reliable evaluation tools. To address this gap, we present the results of an evaluation of 58 existing guidelines in four major health science fields (medicine and epidemiology; nursing and health education; social sciences and public health; psychology/psychiatry, research methods and organization) by expert (n = 16) and peer (n = 40) users (e.g., article reviewers, experts allocating funds, editors). This research was conducted between 2011 and 2014 at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. Experts met during three workshops spread over this period. A series of 12 consensual essential criteria, along with definitions, stemmed from a question in a semi-qualitative evaluation questionnaire that we developed. Although there is consensus on the name of the criteria, we highlight limitations on the ability to compare specific definitions of criteria across health science fields. We conclude that each criterion must be explained to come to broader consensus and identify definitions that are easily operational and consensual to all fields examined."}, {"Title": "The transformation of American psychiatric nosology at the dawn of the twentieth century.", "Abstract": "Between 1896, when Kraepelin published his first formulation of dementia praecox (DP), and 1917, when the American Medico-Psychological Association issued the first official American psychiatric nosology that contained DP and manic-depressive insanity (MDI)--Kraepelin's key categories--psychiatric nosology in the United States underwent a transformation. I describe and contextualize historically this process using Thomas Clouston, a Scottish Psychiatrist and widely-read textbook author, as a representative pre-Kraepelinian diagnostician. Clouston used three major diagnostic categories based on symptomatic presentation--mania, melancholia and paranoia--all derived from the beginnings of modern psychiatry in the early nineteenth century. He observed that these categories contained good-outcome cases and those progressing to 'secondary dementia'. Kraepelin designed his categories of DP and MDI to reflect putative distinct disease processes reflected in their course and outcome. Although Clouston and Kraepelin each saw similar patients, their nosologies started from different first principles: symptomatic presentation versus presumed etiology. Driven largely by social forces with American psychiatry, Kraepelin's system spread throughout the United States in the succeeding decades replacing older diagnostic approaches typified by Clouston's. In 1896, American psychiatry was demoralized as the idyllic asylums had become overcrowded, isolated scientific backwaters. Kraepelin's nosology was derived from and was championed by individuals working in high-status research-based university psychiatric clinics. It brought excitement, the promise of subsequent research breakthroughs and the high prestige then associated with German biomedicine. Scientific research comparing the older and Kraepelinian diagnostic systems played little role in this transition. Using empirical methods to guide changes in our diagnostic system is a recent development in the history of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Lobotomies and Botulism Bombs: Beckett's Trilogy and the Cold War.", "Abstract": "The article argues that Beckett's Trilogy stages the effects of a lobotomy operation on a potentially politically subversive writer, and that the consequences of the operation can be traced in both the retreat of the narrator(s) of the Trilogy into the mind and into comatose mental states and in the detail of the operation itself, based on the 'icepick' lobotomies performed by neurologist Walter Freeman in the late 1940s and early 1950s. To write about extreme psychiatric situations in the post-war period is necessarily to invoke the political uses of psychosurgery with which this article engages.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) exploits diverse mechanisms to activate or suppress congeneric gene expression, with regulatory variation associated with stress-related disorders in psychiatry and gastroenterology.\nDuring acute and chronic stress, corticotropin-releasing hormone drives secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the pituitary, ultimately leading to the release of cortisol (human) and corticosterone (rodent) from the adrenal glands. Cortisol binds with the GR in the cytosol, translocates to the nucleus, and activates the NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 [GR]) gene. This review focuses on the rapidly developing observations that cortisol is responsible for driving circadian and ultradian bursts of transcriptional activity in the CLOCK (clock circadian regulator) and PER (period circadian clock 1) gene families, and this rhythm is disrupted in major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and stress-related gastrointestinal and immune disorders. Glucocorticoid receptor regulates different sets of transcripts in a tissue-specific manner, through pulsatile waves of gene expression that includes occupancy of glucocorticoid response elements located within constitutively open spatial domains in chromatin. Emerging evidence supports a potentially pivotal role for epigenetic regulation of how GR interacts with other chromatin regulators to control the expression of its target genes. Dysregulation of the central and peripheral GR regulome has potentially significant consequences for stress-related disorders affecting the brain-gut axis."}, {"Title": "A cross-platform solution for light field based 3D telemedicine.", "Abstract": "Current telehealth services are dominated by conventional 2D video conferencing systems, which are limited in their capabilities in providing a satisfactory communication experience due to the lack of realism. The \"immersiveness\" provided by 3D technologies has the potential to promote telehealth services to a wider range of applications. However, conventional stereoscopic 3D technologies are deficient in many aspects, including low resolution and the requirement for complicated multi-camera setup and calibration, and special glasses. The advent of light field (LF) photography enables us to record light rays in a single shot and provide glasses-free 3D display with continuous motion parallax in a wide viewing zone, which is ideally suited for 3D telehealth applications. As far as our literature review suggests, there have been no reports of 3D telemedicine systems using LF technology. In this paper, we propose a cross-platform solution for a LF-based 3D telemedicine system. Firstly, a novel system architecture based on LF technology is established, which is able to capture the LF of a patient, and provide an immersive 3D display at the doctor site. For 3D modeling, we further propose an algorithm which is able to convert the captured LF to a 3D model with a high level of detail. For the software implementation on different platforms (i.e., desktop, web-based and mobile phone platforms), a cross-platform solution is proposed. Demo applications have been developed for 2D/3D video conferencing, 3D model display and edit, blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, and patient data viewing functions. The demo software can be extended to multi-discipline telehealth applications, such as tele-dentistry, tele-wound and tele-psychiatry. The proposed 3D telemedicine solution has the potential to revolutionize next-generation telemedicine technologies by providing a high quality immersive tele-consultation experience."}, {"Title": "A Gesture Recognition System for Detecting Behavioral Patterns of ADHD.", "Abstract": "We present an application of gesture recognition using an extension of dynamic time warping (DTW) to recognize behavioral patterns of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We propose an extension of DTW using one-class classifiers in order to be able to encode the variability of a gesture category, and thus, perform an alignment between a gesture sample and a gesture class. We model the set of gesture samples of a certain gesture category using either Gaussian mixture models or an approximation of convex hulls. Thus, we add a theoretical contribution to classical warping path in DTW by including local modeling of intraclass gesture variability. This methodology is applied in a clinical context, detecting a group of ADHD behavioral patterns defined by experts in psychology/psychiatry, to provide support to clinicians in the diagnose procedure. The proposed methodology is tested on a novel multimodal dataset (RGB plus depth) of ADHD children recordings with behavioral patterns. We obtain satisfying results when compared to standard state-of-the-art approaches in the DTW context."}, {"Title": "The Art and Science of Learning, Teaching, and Delivering Feedback in Psychosomatic Medicine.", "Abstract": "The teaching and learning of psychosomatic medicine has evolved with the better understanding of effective teaching methods and feedback delivery in medicine and psychiatry.\nWe sought to review the variety of teaching methods used in psychosomatic medicine, to present principles of adult learning (and how these theories can be applied to students of psychosomatic medicine), and to discuss the role of effective feedback delivery in the process of teaching and learning psychosomatic medicine.\nIn addition to drawing on the clinical and teaching experiences of the authors of the paper, we reviewed the literature on teaching methods, adult learning theories, and effective feedback delivery methods in medicine to draw parallels for psychosomatic medicine education.\nWe provide a review of teaching methods that have been employed to teach psychosomatic medicine over the past few decades.

In this review, cross-disciplinary data in a rapidly evolving field that bridges neurology and psychiatry are synthesized to identify shared biologic mechanisms. The relationship between these debilitating, lifelong conditions is examined at the clinical, genetic, and neurophysiologic levels in humans and in animal models. Scopus and PubMed searches were used to identify relevant literature. Clinical observations have prompted speculation about the interdependence of autism and epilepsy, but causal relationships have proved difficult to determine. Despite their heritability, the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy has remained largely elusive until the advent of next-generation sequencing. This approach has revealed that mutations that are either causal or confer an increased disease risk are found in numerous different genes, any one of which accounts for only a small percentage of cases. Conversely, even cases with identical clinical phenotypes can be genetically heterogeneous. Candidate gene identification has facilitated the development of mouse genetic models, which in parallel with human studies have implicated shared brain regions and circuits that mediate disease expression. Diverse genetic causes of ASD and epilepsy converge on cortical interneuron circuits as one important mediator of both disorders. Cortical interneurons are among the most diverse cell types in the brain and their unique chemical and electrical coupling exert a powerful inhibitory influence on excitatory neurons via the release of the neurotransmitter, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These multifaceted approaches have validated theories derived from the field of developmental neurobiology, which propose that the neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations are caused by an altered ratio of excitation to inhibition in the cortex."}, {"Title": "Erratum.", "Abstract": "P\u00e9rez-San-Gregorio M.

To meet the methodological criteria for the highest quality guidelines (S3 criteria) as defined by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF) the following criteria were realized: (1) a systematic search, selection and appraisal of the international literature, (2) a structured process to reach consensus and (3) inclusion of all relevant representatives of future guideline users.\nMore than 60 clinical experts and researchers analyzed the scientific literature. In total 41 international and national guidelines (23 for alcohol and 18 for tobacco) were used. Moreover, 83 systematic Cochrane reviews (alcohol 28, tobacco 55) and 5863 articles (alcohol 2213, tobacco 3650) were analyzed.

Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (also called semantic dementia) are two clinical variants of frontotemporal dementia with overlapping but distinct anatomical substrates known to cause profound changes in decision-making. We investigated whether abnormal decision-making in these syndromes could be more precisely characterized in terms of dissociable abnormalities in patients' subjective evaluations of valence (positive versus negative outcome) and of time (present versus future outcome). We presented 28 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 14 patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease (as disease controls), and 61 healthy older control subjects with experimental tasks assaying loss aversion and delay discounting. In general linear models controlling for age, gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination score, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were less averse to losses than control subjects (P < 0.001), while patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia discounted delayed rewards more steeply than controls (P = 0.019). There was no relationship between loss aversion and delay discounting across the sample, nor in any of the subgroups. These findings suggest that abnormal behaviours in neurodegenerative disease may result from the disruption of either of two dissociable neural processes for evaluating the outcomes of action. More broadly, these findings suggest a role for computational methods to supplement traditional qualitative characterizations in the differential diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' Comfort Using Computers and Other Electronic Devices in Clinical Practice.", "Abstract": "This report highlights findings from the Study of Psychiatrists' Use of Informational Resources in Clinical Practice, a cross-sectional Web- and paper-based survey that examined psychiatrists' comfort using computers and other electronic devices in clinical practice. One-thousand psychiatrists were randomly selected from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile and asked to complete the survey between May and August, 2012. A total of 152 eligible psychiatrists completed the questionnaire (response rate 22.2\u00a0%). The majority of psychiatrists reported comfort using computers for educational and personal purposes. However, 26\u00a0% of psychiatrists reported not using or not being comfortable using computers for clinical functions. Psychiatrists under age 50 were more likely to report comfort using computers for all purposes than their older counterparts. Clinical tasks for which computers were reportedly used comfortably, specifically by psychiatrists younger than 50, included documenting clinical encounters, prescribing, ordering laboratory tests, accessing read-only patient information (e.g., test results), conducting internet searches for general clinical information, accessing online patient educational materials, and communicating with patients or other clinicians. Psychiatrists generally reported comfort using computers for personal and educational purposes. However, use of computers in clinical care was less common, particularly among psychiatrists 50 and older. Information and educational resources need to be available in a variety of accessible, user-friendly, computer and non-computer-based formats, to support use across all ages.

We present a model for teaching and communicating suicide risk assessments without categorical predictions. Instead, we propose risk formulations which synthesize data into four distinct judgments to directly inform intervention plans: (1) risk status (the patient's risk relative to a specified subpopulation), (2) risk state (the patient's risk compared to baseline or other specified time points), (3) available resources from which the patient can draw in crisis, and (4) foreseeable changes that may exacerbate risk.

The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution of psychotic symptoms and potential bias in symptoms assessed via semi-structured interview using a cohort of 3,389 African American and 5,692 Caucasian participants who were diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. In this cohort, the diagnosis of schizophrenia was relatively more common, and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type was less relatively common, among African Americans than Caucasians. With regard to symptoms, relatively more African Americans than Caucasians endorsed hallucinations and delusions symptoms, and this pattern was striking among cases diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective-bipolar disorder. In contrast, the relative endorsement of psychotic symptoms was more similar among cases diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder-depressed type. Differential item function analysis revealed that African Americans with mild psychosis over-endorsed \"hallucinations in any modality\" and under-endorsed \"widespread delusions\" relative to Caucasians. Other symptoms did not show evidence of racial bias. Thus, racial bias in assessment of psychotic symptoms does not appear to explain differences in the proportion of symptoms between Caucasians and African Americans. Rather, this may reflect ascertainment bias, perhaps indicative of a disparity in access to services, or differential exposure to risk factors for psychosis by race. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "A reply to Wang T, Shan L, Du L, Feng J, Xu Z, Staal WG, Jia F.

Treatment strategies in this complex domain change over time and do not always follow evidence-based guidelines.\nPrescription data of in-patients suffering from acute mania in the time period from 2005 to 2012 were obtained from the database of the Drug Safety Program in Psychiatry (Institut f\u00fcr Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie; AMSP). Data were collected on two index dates per year. Changes over time were analyzed comparing the time periods 2005/06 and 2011/12.\nAmong 1650 patients (mean \u00b1SD; age: 48.9\u00b114.91 years; 53.1% females) 54.1% received anticonvulsants, 74.5% second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), 17.8% first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), 29.1% lithium, 44.1% benzodiazepines and 14.5% antidepressants. Prescription of SGAs increased from 70% to 79% (p=0.005), while prescription of FGAs and anticonvulsants decreased from 19% to 13% (p<0.05) and 59% to 46% (p<0.001), respectively. Only 30% of patients received monotherapy with one mood stabilizer. We observed an impact of gender, age and psychotic symptoms on treatment strategy. 36.8% of the women\u226440 years received valproate.\nFollow-up data are missing and no differentiation between acute and maintenance treatments could be made due to the cross-sectional design. Additionally, our findings do not necessarily translate to outpatients or to other countries.\nCombination therapies represent standard clinical practice. Though many results reflect clinical necessity, the high number of antidepressant prescriptions or valproate use in women of child-bearing age should be judged critically. Further prospective studies should focus on real-world prescription practice in acute mania to evaluate efficacy and safety of common practice.

However, to date, only one study investigated the relationship between these two constructs. Thus, we aimed to further reveal adult attachment's association with affective temperaments.\nAffective temperament and adult attachment dimensions of 1469 Hungarian university students were assessed with self-report measures (Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa and San Diego autoquestionnaire and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, respectively). Age and measured variables were compared between genders with ANOVAs. Associations between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments were examined with Pearson's correlations and partial correlations; the moderation effect of age and gender on these relationships was tested with PROCESS macro. Using Fisher r-to-z transformation, we also compared our results with the findings of the previous study. Cohen's ds were used to report effect size and Cronbach's alphas were computed as indices of internal reliability.\nSignificant correlations were found between attachment dimensions and affective temperaments. Correlations were especially robust between attachment anxiety and depressive, cyclothymic and anxious temperaments. Contrasted with the results of the previous study, hyperthymic temperament was negatively related to attachment avoidance and anxious temperament was significantly more strongly correlated with attachment anxiety in our study.\nWe used a previous version of the adult attachment measure. Our sample differed from the target sample in several ways. Participants were not screened for mental disorders.\nFindings highlight that adult attachment dimensions are significantly associated with affective temperaments."}, {"Title": "Assessing the connection between organophosphate pesticide poisoning and mental health: A comparison of neuropsychological symptoms from clinical observations, animal models and epidemiological studies.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry and psychology are beginning to recognize the importance of lead, mercury and heavy metals as causal partners in the development of mental disorders. Further, mental health researchers and clinicians are embracing the idea that the combined effects of genetics and environmental exposures can result in perturbations in brain neurochemistry leading to psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this review is to examine the biological foundations for the epidemiological observations previously identified by reviewing the toxicology literature and relating it to epidemiological studies addressing the role of poisoning with organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in neurobehavioral and neuropsychological disorders. The goal of this review is to raise awareness in the mental health community about the possibility that affective disorders might be the result of contributions from environmental and occupational pesticide poisoning."}, {"Title": "[The potential role of microbiota in major psychiatric disorders: Mechanisms, preclinical data, gastro-intestinal comorbidities and therapeutic options].", "Abstract": "While forecasts predict an increase in the prevalence of mental health disorders in the worldwide general population, the response rate to classical psychiatric treatment remains unsatisfactory. Resistance to psychotropic drugs can be due to clinical, pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic factors. Among these factors, recent animal findings suggest that microbiota may have an underestimated influence on its host's behavior and on drug metabolism that may explain ineffectiveness or increased side effects of psychiatric medications such as weight gain. The following issues were identified in the present review: (i) microbiota dysbiosis and putative consequences on central nervous system functioning; (ii) chronic microbiota dysbiosis-associated illnesses in humans; (iii) microbiota-oriented treatments and their potential therapeutic applications in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of psychiatric drugs.", "Abstract": "The contribution of the CYP3A5 enzyme to the metabolism of clinically used drugs has been established only for a few CYP3A substrates, such as the immunosuppressant tacrolimus, while for drugs used in the field of psychiatry its role is still vague.\nWe herein discuss all published data on the contribution of CYP3A5 and its polymorphisms to the metabolism of antipsychotics and antidepressants that are known to be metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, as well as of carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug used as mood stabilizer. Published papers from 1990 to April 2015 were retrieved from PubMed and Scopus by use of the keywords CYP3A5, CYP3A, gene polymorphism, antipsychotics, psychiatry, pharmacogenomics, haloperidol, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, antidepressants, and carbamazepine.\nAvailable evidence is only sparse and no firm conclusions can be drawn on whether CYP3A5 enzyme exhibits affinity and metabolic capacity similar to CYP3A4 for these drugs. Nevertheless, the role of CYP3A5 should be studied further, since there is evidence suggesting that CYP3A5 potentially catalyses alternative metabolic pathways that may give rise to intermediate metabolites with yet unknown pharmacologic properties and may also limit drug bioavailability through intestinal first pass metabolism. Additionally, expression of CYP3A5 may overcome CYP3A4 drug-drug interactions.\nOverall, CYP3A5 is an overlooked polymorphic enzyme and its potential in improving psychiatric pharmacogenomics remains to be explored. The impact of CYP3A5 pharmacogenetics in the clinical setting merits the attention of both researchers and clinicians."}, {"Title": "Early Detection of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders in Dermatology.", "Abstract": "Many skin diseases are associated with mental disorders. When the psychological symptoms are mild, as is often the case in dermatology, it can be difficult to distinguish between normality and the manifestations of a mental disorder. To facilitate the distinction we review the concept of mental disorder in the present article. It is also important to have instruments that can facilitate early detection of psychological disease, i.e. when the symptoms are still mild. Short, simple, self-administered questionnaires have been developed to help dermatologists and other health professionals identify the presence of a mental disorder with a high degree of certainty. In this article, we focus on the questionnaires most often used to detect the 2 most common mental disorders: anxiety and depression. Finally, we describe the circumstances in which it is advisable to refer a dermatological patient to a psychiatrist, who can diagnose and treat the mental disorder in accordance with standard protocols."}, {"Title": "The Moral Career of 'Outmates': Towards a History of Manufactured Mental Disorders in Post-Socialist China.", "Abstract": "This study focuses on 'manufactured mentally ill' (bei jingshenbing, [symbol in text]) individuals in post-socialist China. In Chinese society, bei jingshenbing is a neologistic catchphrase that refers to someone who has been misidentified as exhibiting symptoms of mental illness and has been admitted to a mental hospital. Specifically, it refers to those individuals who were subjected to unnecessary psychiatric treatment during the first decade of the twenty-first century. Based on archival analysis and ethnographic fieldwork, this study addresses the ways in which the voices of bei jingshenbing victims and those who support them reveal China's experiences with psychiatric modernity. It also discusses the active role of these individuals in knowledge production, medical policymaking, and the implications for reforming the psychiatric and mental health systems in post-socialist China."}, {"Title": "Constructing Patient Stories: 'Dynamic' Case Notes and Clinical Encounters at Glasgow's Gartnavel Mental Hospital, 1921-32.", "Abstract": "This article contextualises the production of patient records at Glasgow's Gartnavel Mental Hospital between 1921 and 1932. Following his appointment as asylum superintendent in 1921, psychiatrist David Kennedy Henderson sought to introduce a so-called dynamic approach to mental health care. He did so, primarily, by encouraging patients to reveal their inner lives through their own language and own understanding of their illness. To this effect, Henderson implemented several techniques devised to gather as much information as possible about patients. He notably established routine 'staff meetings' in which a psychiatrist directed questions towards a patient while a stenographer recorded word-for-word the conversation that passed between the two parties. As a result, the records compiled at Gartnavel under Henderson's guidance offer a unique window into the various strategies deployed by patients, but also allow physicians and hospital staff to negotiate their place amidst these clinical encounters. In this paper, I analyse the production of patient narratives in these materials. The article begins with Henderson's articulation of his 'dynamic' psychotherapeutic method, before proceeding to an in-depth hermeneutic investigation into samples of Gartnavel's case notes and staff meeting transcripts. In the process, patient-psychiatrist relationships are revealed to be mutually dependent and interrelated subjects of historical enquiry rather than as distinct entities. This study highlights the multi-vocal nature of the construction of stories 'from below' and interrogates their subsequent appropriation by historians."}, {"Title": "'No \"Sane\" Person Would Have Any Idea': Patients' Involvement in Late Nineteenth-century British Asylum Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In his 1895 textbook, Mental Physiology, Bethlem Royal Hospital physician Theo Hyslop acknowledged the assistance of three fellow hospital residents. One was a junior colleague. The other two were both patients: Walter Abraham Haigh and Henry Francis Harding. Haigh was also thanked in former superintendent George Savage's book Insanity and Allied Neuroses (1884). In neither instance were the patients identified as such. This begs the question: what role did Haigh and Harding play in asylum theory and practice? And how did these two men interpret their experiences, both within and outside the asylum? By focusing on Haigh and Harding's unusual status, this paper argues that the notion of nineteenth-century 'asylum patient' needs to be investigated by paying close attention to specific national and institutional circumstances. Exploring Haigh and Harding's active engagement with their physicians provides insight into this lesser-known aspect of psychiatry's history. Their experience suggests that, in some instances, representations of madness at that period were the product of a two-way process of negotiation between alienist and patient. Patients, in other words, were not always mere victims of 'psychiatric power'; they participated in the construction and circulation of medical notions by serving as active intermediaries between medical and lay perceptions of madness."}, {"Title": "Animal Magnetism, Psychiatry and Subjective Experience in Nineteenth-Century Germany: Friedrich Krau\u00df and his Nothschrei.", "Abstract": "Friedrich Krau\u00df (1791-1868) is the author of Nothschrei eines Magnetisch-Vergifteten [Cry of Distress by a Victim of Magnetic Poisoning] (1852), which has been considered one of the most comprehensive self-narratives of madness published in the German language. In this 1018-page work Krau\u00df documents his acute fears of 'mesmerist' influence and persecution, his detainment in an Antwerp asylum and his encounter with various illustrious physicians across Europe. Though in many ways comparable to other prominent nineteenth-century first-person accounts (eg. John Thomas Perceval's 1838 Narrative of the Treatment Experienced by a Gentleman or Daniel Paul Schreber's 1903 Memoirs of my Nervous Illness), Krau\u00df's story has received comparatively little scholarly attention. This is especially the case in the English-speaking world. In this article I reconstruct Krau\u00df's biography by emphasising his relationship with physicians and his under-explored stay at the asylum. I then investigate the ways in which Krau\u00df appropriated nascent theories about 'animal magnetism' to cope with his disturbing experiences. Finally, I address Krau\u00df's recently discovered calligraphic oeuvre, which bears traces of his typical fears all the while showcasing his artistic skills. By moving away from the predominantly clinical perspective that has characterised earlier studies, this article reveals how Friedrich Krau\u00df sought to make sense of his experience by selectively appropriating both orthodox and non-orthodox forms of medical knowledge. In so doing, it highlights the mutual interaction of discourses 'from above' and 'from below' as well as the influence of broader cultural forces on conceptions of self and illness during that seminal period."}, {"Title": "Childhood household dysfunction, school performance and psychiatric care utilisation in young adults: a register study of 96\u2005399 individuals in Stockholm County.", "Abstract": "Exposure to childhood household dysfunction increases the risk of psychiatric morbidity. Although school performance also has been linked with psychiatric morbidity, limited research has considered school performance as a mediating factor. To address this gap in the literature, the current register study examined whether school performance mediates the association between childhood household dysfunction (experienced between birth and age 14\u2005years) and psychiatric care utilisation in young adulthood.\nWe used a Swedish cohort of 96\u2005399 individuals born during 1987-1991. Indicators of childhood household dysfunction were familial death, parental substance abuse and psychiatric morbidity, parental somatic disease, parental criminality, parental separation/single-parent household, public assistance recipiency and residential instability. Final school grades from the 9th year of compulsory school were used to create five categories. Estimates of risk of psychiatric care utilisation (measured as inpatient, outpatient and primary care) after the age of 18\u2005years were calculated as HRs with 95% CIs. Mediation was tested with the bootstrap approach.\nCumulative exposure to childhood household dysfunction was positively associated with psychiatric care utilisation. Specifically, individuals exposed to three or more indicators with incomplete school grades had the highest risk (HR=3.7 (95% CI 3.3 to 4.1) after adjusting for demographics), compared to individuals exposed to no indicators with highest grades. School performance was found to mediate the relationship.\nOur findings suggest that future efforts to prevent or mitigate the negative effects of childhood household dysfunction on psychiatric morbidity may benefit from integration of strategies that improve school performance among vulnerable youth."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' Attitudes Toward Non-Pharmacologic Factors Within the Context of Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy.", "Abstract": "Recent meta-analyses of antidepressant clinical trials have suggested that up to 82\u00a0% of response can be attributed to non-medication-related factors. The present study examines psychiatrists' attitudes regarding non-pharmacologic factors within the context of antidepressant pharmacotherapy.\nA web-based, 20-question cross-sectional survey was distributed to 101 staff psychiatrists and 48 post-graduate trainees in psychiatry at an academic hospital in Boston, MA. Demographics, practice characteristics, beliefs about non-pharmacologic factors affecting prescribing practices, perceived response and remission rates, and opinions about the need for further investigations in the psychopharmacology process were assessed.\nOverall completion rate was 53\u00a0%. The final sample included 79 responses. The medians for clinician-perceived response rates (54\u00a0%) and remission rates (33\u00a0%) were in agreement with published rates. The reported median of the what portion of clinical outcomes is believed to be due to placebo effects (26\u00a0%) was numerically lower than suggested by literature. The contribution of the active ingredients of medications was perceived to be significantly higher than the contribution of patient characteristics and clinician characteristics. A longer time since graduation from medical school was significantly associated with higher belief in the effect of the active ingredients of antidepressant medications and with less perceived importance of placebo effects.\nThese findings suggest a discrepancy between empirical evidence and psychiatrists' beliefs on the impact of placebo effects on clinical outcomes. Educating antidepressant prescribers about the evidence based on psychosocial mediators of placebo effects' contribution to outcome may represent a promising strategy for improving clinical outcomes."}, {"Title": "Altered cognitive response to serotonin challenge as a candidate endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder.", "Abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) implicates dysfunction of orbitofrontal and insula-related circuitry and of the serotonin system.

In contrast, patients receiving a scripted diagnosis and psychiatric consultation demonstrated decreased PNES frequency accompanied by improved quality of life (QOL). Patients also receiving weekly phone calls not only demonstrated decreased PNES frequency and improvements in QOL but also exhibited improved mood.\nThese findings demonstrate that providing diagnostic information regarding PNES is insufficient by itself to meaningfully affect patient outcome. Structured feedback and psychiatric consultation appeared adequate to significantly reduce PNES frequency and improve aspects of quality of life, while the addition of a weekly phone contact also led to improved mood."}, {"Title": "The Chauvet 2014 Meeting Report: Psychiatric and Psychosocial Evaluation and Outcomes of Upper Extremity Grafted Patients.", "Abstract": "Under the auspices for the International Society on Hand and Composite Tissue Allotransplantation, a section of The Transplantation Society (IHCTAS), a meeting was convened on March 21-22, 2014 in Paris to review the following areas that were deemed significant in the understanding of the psychosocial evaluation and outcomes of upper extremity transplant recipients: required domains of the evaluation, screening instruments, clinical monitoring pretransplant, clinical monitoring posttransplant, patient and team expectations, body image, psychiatric complications, functional goals and quality of life, ethics and media relations.

Little is known about the effects of this warning and similar ones (e.g., by the Food and Drug Administration) on antidepressant prescribing in inpatients with acute medical illness, who are theoretically at high risk of QTc prolongation. The main objective of our study is to examine the effect of the Health Canada warning on citalopram/escitalopram prescribing patterns in the consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry setting.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study including 275 randomly selected inpatients with medical illness assessed by the psychiatric C-L team of a large Canadian academic hospital between 2008 and 2014. We grouped patients based on whether they were assessed by the C-L team before or after the citalopram Health Canada warning. Our primary outcome was change in citalopram/escitalopram prescribing patterns.\nWe found that of patients seen before the Health Canada warning, a significantly higher number were prescribed citalopram/escitalopram (44.1% vs. 22.3%, \u03c7(2) = 14.835, p < 0.001), even after controlling for confounders.

The prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in this population (n=67, 13%) was higher than in the general population. The most common association was medication (n=39, 58%), particularly Risperidone (n=19). Illicit substance use (n=10, 15%), and physical conditions (n=12, 18%) may also have contributed. However, only 44 (66%) received follow-up for their hyperprolactinaemia. There was a statistically significant difference in the sample means of those that did receive follow-up and those who did not, suggesting a degree of bias in patients selected to receive follow-up.

There is growing consensus that the field of psychiatry would benefit from more familiarity with neuroscience and neuropsychiatry. Yet there remain numerous factors impeding the integration of these domains of knowledge into general psychiatry.The authors make recommendations to move the field forward, focusing on the need for advocacy by psychiatry and medical organizations and changes in psychiatry education at all levels. For individual psychiatrists, the recommendations target obstacles to attaining expanded neuroscience and neuropsychiatry education and barriers stemming from widely held, often unspoken beliefs. For the system of psychiatric care, recommendations address the conceptual and physical separation of psychiatry from medicine, overemphasis on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and on psychopharmacology, and different systems in medicine and psychiatry for handling reimbursement and patient records. For psychiatry residency training, recommendations focus on expanding neuroscience/neuropsychiatry faculty and integrating neuroscience education throughout the curriculum.Psychiatry traditionally concerns itself with helping individuals construct meaningful life narratives.

A positive association with suicide attempt was reported for younger patients, females, lower educated, smokers, those with higher scores on depressive symptoms and higher functional disability and those with anxiety comorbidity and familial history of suicidality in first- and second-degree relatives. Anxiety disorder comorbidity was the stronger predictor of current suicide risk. No associations were found with polymorphisms within COMT and BDNF genes, whereas significant associations were found with variations in rs13515 (MAPK1) and rs6740584 (CREB1) polymorphisms. From a clinical perspective, our study proposes several clinical characteristics, such as increased depressive symptomatology, anxiety comorbidity, functional disability and family history of suicidality, as correlates associated with suicide. Genetic risk variants in MAPK1 and CREB1 genes might be involved in a dysregulation of inflammatory and neuroplasticity pathways and are worthy of future investigation."}, {"Title": "From Alienism to ACOs: Integrating Psychiatry, Again.", "Abstract": "This column describes the gradual integration of psychiatrists into mainstream general medical care, from their exile as \"alienists\" in isolated asylums to their current roles in accountable care organizations.

Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) offers a promising framework for inferring the effective connectivity among brain regions and thus unraveling the neural mechanisms of both normal cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. While the benefit of such approaches depends heavily on their reliability, systematic analyses of the within-subject stability are rare. Here, we present a thorough investigation of the test-retest reliability of an fMRI paradigm for DCM analysis dedicated to unraveling intra- and interhemispheric integration among the core regions of the face perception network. First, we examined the reliability of face-specific BOLD activity in 25 healthy volunteers, who performed a face perception paradigm in two separate sessions. We found good to excellent reliability of BOLD activity within the DCM-relevant regions. Second, we assessed the stability of effective connectivity among these regions by analyzing the reliability of Bayesian model selection and model parameter estimation in DCM. Reliability was excellent for the negative free energy and good for model parameter estimation, when restricting the analysis to parameters with substantial effect sizes. Third, even when the experiment was shortened, reliability of BOLD activity and DCM results dropped only slightly as a function of the length of the experiment. This suggests that the face perception paradigm presented here provides reliable estimates for both conventional activation and effective connectivity measures. We conclude this paper with an outlook on potential clinical applications of the paradigm for studying psychiatric disorders.

The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the PBQ in a sample of Spanish postpartum women. Eight hundred forty mothers were recruited in the postpartum visit (4-6 weeks after delivery): 513 from a gynecology unit (forming the general population sample) and 327 mothers from a perinatal psychiatry program (forming the clinical sample). All women were assessed by means of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the PBQ. Neither the original four-factor structure nor alternative structures (Reck et al. 2006; Wittkowski et al. 2010) were replicated by the confirmatory factor analyses. An exploratory factor analysis showed a four-factor solution. The Schmid-Leiman transformation found a general factor that accounted for 61% of the variance of the PBQ. Bonding impairment showed higher associations with depressive symptomatology in both samples. The Spanish version of the PBQ showed adequate psychometric properties for use with clinical and general populations of Spanish postpartum women. The results suggest that the PBQ could be summarized by a general factor and confirm the utility of the use of the total score for detecting bonding impairment."}, {"Title": "The Hidden Ethics Curriculum in Two Canadian Psychiatry Residency Programs: A Qualitative Study.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the hidden ethics curriculum in two postgraduate psychiatry programs.\nResearchers investigated the formal, informal, and hidden ethics curricula at two demographically different postgraduate psychiatry programs in Canada.

They identified the formal, informal, and hidden curricula at each program for six ethics topics and grouped the topics under two thematic areas. They tested the applicability of the themes against the specific examples under each topic. Results pertaining to one of the themes and its three topics are reported here.\nDivergences occurred between the curricula for each topic. The nature of these divergences differed according to local program characteristics. Yet, in both programs, choices for action in ethically challenging situations were mediated by a minimum standard of ethics that led individuals to avoid trouble even if this meant their behavior fell short of the accepted ideal.\nEffective ethics education in postgraduate psychiatry training will require addressing the hidden curriculum.

In part, the challenge relates to adolescents being in various stages of puberty and development, which may limit the use of certain pharmacological agents due to their potential side effects. In addition, most of the published treatment programmes have used cognitive behavioural interventions, family therapies and psychoeducational interventions. Psychological treatment is predicated in adolescents on the notion that sexually deviant behaviour can be controlled by the offender, and that more adaptive behaviours can be learned.

Questions are typically defined in binary terms (e.g. 'open' v 'closed') that may have limited application in practice.\nTo undertake a detailed examination of the types of questions psychiatrists ask patients and explore their association with the therapeutic alliance and patient adherence.\nA coding protocol was developed to classify questions from 134 out-patient consultations, predominantly by syntactic form. Bivariate correlations with measures of patient adherence and the therapeutic alliance (psychiatrist-rated) were examined and assessed using generalised estimating equations, adjusting for patient symptoms, psychiatrist identity and amount of speech.\nPsychiatrists used only four of ten question types regularly: yes/no auxiliary questions, 'wh-' questions, declarative questions and tag questions.

An issue related to poor prognosis in patients with chronic illness relates to the accumulation of lactate levels in blood, leading to patients that become critically ill. It is suggested that haloperidol and olanzapine, as common therapy for schizophrenia, are associated with increased levels of blood lactate, which may contribute towards the extra-pyramidal side effects.\nIn this study, 88 patients attending the psychiatry outpatient clinic of Mansoura University Hospital, under treatment with typical APs (chlorpromazine or haloperidol) or the atypical APs (risperidone, olanzapine or quetiapine) were followed over a three-month period. Blood lactate levels were assessed at diagnosis, ten days and 90 days after the start of AP treatment. Extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPSs) were studied in participants during the course of this study.\nChlorpromazine and haloperidol caused significant increases in lactate levels within the first ten days of therapy, while after 90 days, all APs showed significant increases in arterial blood lactate levels in comparison with the first baseline measurement (for all APs, p-values <0.0001). Dystonia was reported by patients on chlorpromazine, haloperidol and risperidone therapies, while Parkinsonian-like manifestations were reported with all APs tested except for quetiapine. Both dystonia and Parkinsonian-like manifestations were also observed alongside the significant increases in arterial blood lactate levels in comparison to patients on therapy not displaying EPSs.\nThese findings suggest elevated blood lactate levels may serve as early biomarkers for occurrence of extra-pyramidal symptoms in patients on chronic APs treatment."}, {"Title": "Medical Student Education in State Psychiatric Hospitals: A Survey of US State Hospitals.", "Abstract": "State hospitals may be underutilized in medical education.

In addition, the study investigates the relationship between total engagement and its subscales, resident satisfaction, and a depression screen.\nRecruitment of 53/79 residents from three psychiatry residency programs in Illinois was completed. The residents were administered a questionnaire consisting of the UWES, the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (Prime-MD) depression screen, and a residency satisfaction scale. Statistical analysis using independent samples t test and a one-way analysis of variance was used to assess differences on engagement total score and subscales and satisfaction scale. A logistic regression was used with the engagement subscales and the satisfaction scale as predictors of belonging to the depressed or non-depressed group.\nPsychiatry residents scored in the high range for total engagement and all its subscales except for vigor which was in the moderate range. Residents who screened positive for depression reported lower total engagement than those who were negative on the depression screen. Vigor was the only significant predictor (p\u2009=\u2009.004) of being in the depressed group after logistic regression. Total engagement and the subscale of dedication significantly predicted overall residency satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.473, p\u2009=\u2009.016).\nHigher total UWES-15 and its subscales of vigor and dedication are correlated with a lower rate of screening positive for depression and higher residency satisfaction.

In two companion papers, we present a list of problems nominated by clinicians and researchers from different disciplines as candidates for future scientific investigation of mental disorders. These problems are loosely grouped into challenges concerning nosology and diagnosis (this Personal View) and problems related to pathogenesis and aetiology (in the companion Personal View).

Is addiction caused by the gods, the substance, the individual's vulnerability, or psychological or social factors? Luther, Calvin, and Catholic Church leaders viewed moderate alcohol use as God's gift; used intemperately, it was a moral transgression. The founders of modern scientific psychiatry rejected moral explanations for addiction in favor of an early biological model. The first two versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-I and DSM-II) stigmatized addiction by listing it with other societally disapproved disorders stemming from personality disorder. DSM-III espoused atheoretical, descriptive diagnoses but required tolerance or withdrawal to diagnose dependence. Substance dependence in DSM-III-R included physiological and behavioral symptoms and reflected the substance dependence syndrome. DSM-IV's emphasis on biology in its concept of dependence was unchanged from its immediate predecessors. DSM-5 declared that all drugs taken in excess have in common the direct activation of the brain reward system.

However, whilst sleep disturbances have been linked to depression, this relationship has not received much attention in DLB. The present cross-sectional study addresses this by examining whether depressive symptoms are specifically associated with subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in DLB, and by examining other contributory factors.\nDLB patients (n\u2009=\u200932) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Motor and cognitive functioning was also assessed. Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between GDS-15, ESS and PSQI scores.\nGDS-15 scores were positively associated with both ESS (r\u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and PSQI (r\u2009=\u20090.59, p\u2009<\u20090.001) scores.\nSubjective poor sleep and daytime sleepiness were associated with depressive symptoms in DLB. Given the cross-sectional nature of the present study, the directionality of this relationship cannot be determined, although this association did not appear to be mediated by sleep quality or daytime sleepiness. Nevertheless, these findings have clinical relevance; daytime sleepiness or poor sleep quality might indicate depression in DLB, and subsequent work should examine whether the treatment of depression can reduce excessive daytime sleepiness and improve sleep quality in DLB patients. Alternatively, more rigorous screening for sleep problems in DLB might assist the treatment of depression. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

As day-based remuneration systems may be an incentive to extend treatment, it is necessary to measure and analyze the future development of the number of cases and the duration of treatment.\nThis article surveys admission and discharge decisions of psychiatric and psychosomatic facilities. The distribution of admissions and discharges throughout the days of the week were analyzed to search for evidence of a systematic extension of treatment over the weekend.\nThe analysis is based on data from the Versorgungsrelevante Indikatoren in der Psychiatrie und Psychosomatik (VIPP, treatment-relevant indicators in psychiatry and psychosomatics) project database, which contains routine data from psychiatric and psychosomatic facilities. On this basis the distributions of admissions and discharges throughout the days of the week were analyzed on aggregate and diagnosis-specific levels.\nPatients were mostly admitted to hospitals within the first 3 weekdays. The discharge mostly took place on Fridays and not as a financial incentive on Mondays. Regarding the patient length of stay a 7-day cycle can be observed, which may indicate the importance of medical and organizational factors in discharge decisions.\nThe results do not show evidence for a systematic extension of treatment over the weekend.

When unaddressed, it produces adverse outcomes. With its research primarily conducted in Caucasians, its applicability to non-Caucasians is uncertain. We explore the existence and the characteristics of pre-death grief in a multi-ethnic Asian population using an established pre-death grief scale-Marwit-Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI).\nSeventy-two dementia family caregivers were recruited from a tertiary hospital. Existence of pre-death grief was shown by its measurability on MM-CGI, together with good internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Characteristics of pre-death grief were explored through multivariate linear regression of MM-CGI and by comparing MM-CGI scores with those from the original US study using one-sample T-test.\nIn the Asian context, pre-death grief was measurable in a reliable and valid manner. Risk factors of pre-death grief included caring for patients with severe dementia, spousal relationship and secondary or below education. Influence of culture was palpable-Asians had more worries and felt isolation, and certain ethnicity showed more pre-death grief.\nPre-death grief is applicable even to the non-Caucasian population. It bears much similarity to that in Caucasians. Yet, its expression is modified by culture. Clinicians working with non-Caucasian populations need to be sensitive to its presence and to the influence of culture on its expression. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

Scientific as well as political factors have influenced how the military has addressed the mental health needs resulting from these wars. Two important differences between mental health care delivered during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and previous wars are the degree to which research has directly informed care and the consolidated management of services. The U.S. Army Medical Command implemented programmatic changes to ensure delivery of high-quality standardized mental health services, including centralized workload management; consolidation of psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric nursing, and social work services under integrated behavioral health departments; creation of satellite mental health clinics embedded within brigade work areas; incorporation of mental health providers into primary care; routine mental health screening throughout soldiers' careers; standardization of clinical outcome measures; and improved services for family members. This transformation has been accompanied by reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations and improved continuity of care. Challenges remain, however, including continued underutilization of services by those most in need, problems with treatment of substance use disorders, overuse of opioid medications, concerns with the structure of care for chronic postdeployment (including postconcussion) symptoms, and ongoing questions concerning the causes of historically high suicide rates, efficacy of resilience training initiatives, and research priorities.

We also review new genetic models for mania, namely knockout mice for genes involved in neurotransmission, synapse formation, and intracellular signaling pathways. Furthermore, we review recent trends in preclinical models for mania that may aid in the comprehension of mechanisms underlying the neuroprogressive and recurring nature of BD.

In this controlled interventional study, 22 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls performed a standardized aerobic endurance training on bicycle ergometers over 12\u00a0weeks. Another group of 21 patients with schizophrenia played table soccer. Endurance capacity was measured with incremental cycle ergometry before and after the intervention and 3\u00a0months later. A specific set of outcome parameters was defined. The training stimuli can be assumed to be similar in both endurance groups. Endurance capacity improved significantly in the endurance groups, but not in the table soccer group. Patients and healthy controls showed comparable adaptations to endurance training, as assessed by physical working capacity and maximal achieved power. Differences were found in changes of performance at a lactate concentration of 3\u00a0mmol/l. Endurance training was feasible and effective in both groups. The principles and types of training that are usually applied to healthy controls need to be verified in patients with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, patients benefited from endurance training in terms of improvement of endurance capacity and reduction in the baseline deficit in comparison with healthy controls. Therefore, endurance training should be implemented in future therapy programs.

Multifactorial processes can contribute to their development and progression. Purinergic neurotransmission and neuromodulation in the brain have attracted increasing therapeutic interest in the field of psychiatry. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides are well recognized as signaling molecules mediating cell to cell communication. The actions of ATP are mediated by ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptor subfamilies, whilst the actions of adenosine are mediated by P1 (A1 or A2) adenosine receptors. Purinergic mechanisms and specific receptor subtypes have been shown to be linked to the regulation of many aspects of behavior and mood and to dysregulation in pathological processes of brain function. In this review the recent knowledge on the role of purinergic receptors in the two most frequent psychiatric diseases, major depression and schizophrenia, as well as on related animal models is summarized. At present the most promising data for therapeutic strategies derive from investigations of the adenosine system emphasizing a unique function of A2A receptors at neurons and astrocytes in these disorders. Among the P2 receptor family, in particular P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors were related to disturbances in major depression and schizophrenia, respectively.

A conversation analysis was undertaken to examine the interactional detail between the children, parents, and practitioners.\nThe findings indicated that claims to knowledge were managed in three ways. First, practitioners positioned children as 'experts' on their own health and this was sometimes accepted. Second, some children resisted this epistemic position, claiming not to have the relevant knowledge. Third, some children's claims to knowledge were negotiated and sometimes contested by adult parties who questioned their competence to share relevant information about their lives in accordance with the assessment agenda.\nThrough question design, the practitioner was able to position the child as holding relevant knowledge regarding their situation. The child was able to take up this position or resist it in various ways.\nThis has important implications for debates regarding children's competence to contribute to mental health interventions.

In psychiatry and neurology, however, proven evidence that TDM should be used for treatment with the multiple neuropsychiatric medications is restricted to few compounds. Well-designed clinical trials on medical and economic benefits of TDM are rare. The use of TDM is limited in most countries to few antiepileptics, especially carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, some mood stabilizers, especially lithium and valproic acid, some antidepressants, especially tricyclic antidepressants and some antipsychotics, primarily clozapine because these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. On the other hand, specific indications and distinct problems can make TDM most useful for individualized pharmacotherapy with almost any neuropsychiatric drug. Potential benefits of TDM can, however, only be reaped if the method is adequately integrated into the clinical treatment process. The TDM expert group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) issued consensus guidelines for the best practice of TDM in psychiatry and neurology. A first version was published in 2004. These guidelines were extended in 2011 and are actually updated (see: www.agnp.de).

This editorial will focus on the broader impact of this discipline as an example of successful translational neuroscience overcoming the brain-mind-body trichotomy."}, {"Title": "Recurrent copy number variations as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders: critical overview and analysis of clinical implications.", "Abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) encompass a spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations. Chromosomal regions 1q21.1, 3q29, 15q11.2, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, 16p13.1 and 22q11 harbour rare but recurrent CNVs that have been uncovered as being important risk factors for several of these disorders. These rearrangements may underlie a broad phenotypical spectrum, ranging from normal development, to learning problems, intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia (SZ). The highly increased risk of developing neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with some of these CNVs makes them an unavoidable element in the clinical context in paediatrics, neurology and psychiatry. However, and although finding these risk loci has been the goal of neuropsychiatric genetics for many years, the translation of this recent knowledge into clinical practice has not been trivial. In this article, we will: (1) review the state of the art on recurrent CNVs associated with NDs, namely ASD, ID, epilepsy and SZ; (2) discuss the models used to dissect the underlying neurobiology of disease, (3) discuss how this knowledge can be used in clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Research leadership: should clinical directors be distinguished researchers?", "Abstract": "Clinical directors established research-led healthcare by combining research, teaching and clinical excellence within the teaching hospitals. This research culture created high clinical standards, which benefited patients, the workforce and healthcare organisations. The current paper explores this research leadership role for clinical directors. It reviews studies arising from the theory of expert leadership, which focuses on the relationship between a leader's core knowledge and organisational performance. More specifically, we examine the expert leader's research track record, the associations with their organisation's performance, and the influence of research activity on clinical excellence.\nDistinguished researchers still lead the most prestigious teaching hospitals and the most trusted departments of psychiatry in the United States where the clinical directorate structure originated. It is also known that good scholars can improve research output when appointed to leadership positions. This suggests that the clinical director's research track record should be a consideration at a time when research is being embedded in Australia's local health networks. A clinical director's leadership may influence the research performance of their department and contribute to the quality of mental healthcare."}, {"Title": "[Is delusion a reasonable scientific term? Reflections on psychopathology in the psychiatry of the twenty-first century].", "Abstract": "Delusion is a central but difficult and controversial term in psychiatry. Similar to the term schizophrenia at the nosological level, the basic questions in the specialty are linked in the debate on delusion at the clinical psychopathological level, beginning with epistemological and methodological aspects up to concrete embodiment of the physician-patient relationship. The text of this article reflects this development from the nineteenth century up to the present day and makes reference to the lively discussion on the future directions of psychiatric research triggered by the research domain criteria (RDoC). Under certain prerequisites, including in particular an extensive understanding of psychopathology, delusion is considered to be a reasonable scientific term, also in the future."}, {"Title": "Sociodemographic and Clinical Features of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: A Chart Review.", "Abstract": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a novel diagnosis listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) to encompass chronic and impairing irritability in youth, and to help its differentiation from bipolar disorders. Because it is a new entity, treatment guidelines, as well as its sociodemographic and clinical features among diverse populations, are still not elucidated. Here, DMDD cases from three centers in Turkey are reported and the implications are discussed.\nThe study was conducted at the Abant Izzet Baysal University Medical Faculty Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Bolu), and American Hospital and Bengi Semerci Institute (Istanbul) between August 2014 and October 2014. Records of patients were reviewed and features of patients who fulfilled criteria for DMDD were recorded. Data were analyzed with SPS Version 17.0 for Windows. Descriptive analyses, \u03c7(2) test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used for analyses. Diagnostic consensus was determined via Cohen's \u03ba constants. p was set at 0.01.\nThirty-six patients (77.8 % male) fulfilled criteria for DMDD. \u03ba value for consensus between clinicians was 0.68 (p\u2009=\u20090.00). Mean age of patients was 9.0 years (S.D.\u2009=\u20092.5) whereas the mean age of onset for DMDD symptoms was 4.9 years (S.D.\u2009=\u20092.2). Irritability, temper tantrums, verbal rages, and physical aggression toward family members were the most common presenting complaints.\nDiagnostic consensus could not be reached for almost one fourth of cases. Most common reasons for lack of consensus were problems in clarification of moods of patients in between episodes, problems in differentiation of normality and pathology (i.e., symptoms mainly reported in one setting vs. pervasiveness), and inability to fulfill frequency criterion for tantrums."}, {"Title": "Markers of subsyndromal depression in very old persons.", "Abstract": "To investigate factors associated with subsyndromal depression (SSD) in very old persons, and to develop a model for prediction of SSD among very old persons.\nA cross-sectional, population-based study was undertaken on 85-year-old persons in Sweden. Data were collected from a postal questionnaire, assessments in the participants' homes and at reception visits. Depressiveness was screened with GDS-15 (Geriatric Depression Scale), and the results were classified into three outcome categories: non-depression (ND), SSD and syndromal depression. Data were analysed with binary logistic, ordinal logistic and linear regression.\nWith univariate logistic regression 20 factors associated with SSD were identified in very old persons, and the four hypothesized domains--sociodemographic factors, declining physical functioning, neuropsychiatric factors and existential factors--significantly related to SSD. The multivariate logistic model included seven independent factors that increase the likelihood of SSD instead of ND (lower self-perceived health, life not meaningful, problems with self-care, use of tranquilizing medication, no contact with neighbours, history of affective disorder and history of stroke). The ordinal logistic and the linear regression models resulted in seven partly different factors for predicting SSD and depressiveness, in the very old.\nThe identified markers may help clinicians with the detection, prevention and treatment of SSD in very old persons. The findings indicate the importance of a comprehensive functional approach to diagnosing and treating depressiveness in this population, and the findings might be interpreted as offering support for the coexistence of a dimensional and a categorical view on depressive disorders."}, {"Title": "Experiences of Domestic and School Violence Among Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatients.", "Abstract": "The experience of cumulative childhood adversities, such as exposure to domestic violence or abuse by caregivers, has been described as risk factor for poor mental health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood.

We were using the Childhood Trauma Interview (CTI) in order to obtain information on the kind of violence. Seventy-five percent of all patients had reported experiences of violence.

There is increasing evidence to suggest that the continuum may begin with Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). This theory can be important in developing interventions for suicide prevention. However, in India, consistent usage of definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors is lacking. In the present study, we reviewed definitions of various forms of self-directed violent behaviors that have been investigated in India. Further, we compared the usage of these definitions with the usage by WHO. Additionally, we reviewed NSSI research in India. Thirty-eight publications were identified by a comprehensive electronic search undertaken in Indian psychiatry, psychology, and mental health-related databases. Inconsistent definitions of eight self-directed violent behaviors were observed in Indian literature. Agreement on consistent definitions of various forms of self-directed behaviors is essential. Based on the findings of the current review, it can be suggested that culturally relevant large-scale research on NSSI in India is required to confirm the limited evidence that suggests high prevalence of NSSI in India."}, {"Title": "An introduction to the partial least squares approach to structural equation modelling: a method for exploratory psychiatric research.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry and psychology, relationship patterns connecting disorders and risk factors are always complex and intricate. Advanced statistical methods have been developed to overcome this issue, the most common being structural equation modelling (SEM). The main approach to SEM (CB-SEM for covariance-based SEM) has been widely used by psychiatry and psychology researchers to test whether a comprehensive theoretical model is compatible with observed data. While the validity of this approach method has been demonstrated, its application is limited in some situations, such as early-stage exploratory studies using small sample sizes. The partial least squares approach to SEM (PLS-SEM) has risen in many scientific fields as an alternative method that is especially useful when sample size restricts the use of CB-SEM.

An estimate of cases occurring in remote islands might bring the rate for the whole French Polynesia around 94 per 100,000. NFSB was more prevalent in females; rates for both genders were highest in the age group 25-35 years and 15-24 years. The main suicide method was drug poisoning by psychotropic drugs. The most frequent psychiatric disorder was mood disorder (45.3%); however, 26% of subjects had no 'major' psychiatric disorders, with 14.5% without a psychiatric diagnosis or only reactive disorders (F43-11.7%).

To address this issue, we investigated the ability of these indoleamines to mitigate the behavioral phenotypes associated with NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction in mice. We demonstrated that exogenous MLT and NAS treatments attenuated the NMDAR antagonist (ketamine) induced immobility in the forced swim test (FST) but not the classical striatum-related hyperlocomotor activity phenotype. The MLT/NAS-mediated protection of the phenotype in FST could be correlated to the ability of these indoleamines to counteract the deleterious effects of chronic ketamine on pro-survival molecular events by restoring the activities in MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in the hippocampus. MLT seems to modulate these pathways by promoting accumulation of the mature form of BDNF above the control (vehicle-treated) levels, perhaps via MLT receptor-dependent mechanisms and in the process overcoming the ketamine-induced down-regulation of BDNF. In contrast, NAS appears to partly restore the ketamine-induced decrease of BDNF to the control levels. In spite of this fundamental difference in modulating BDNF levels in the upstream events, both MLT and NAS seem to overlap in the TrkB-induced downstream pro-survival mechanisms in the hippocampus, providing protection against NMDAR-hypofunction related cellular events. Perhaps, this also signifies the physiological importance of robust MLT synthesizing machinery that converts serotonin to MLT, in ensuring positive impact on hippocampus-related symptoms in psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Impact of Imaging and Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers on Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia Diagnosis within a Late-Onset Frontal Lobe Syndrome Cohort.", "Abstract": "The criteria for behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) incorporate MRI and [18F]-FDG-PET.

The psychiatric expert is commissioned to determine whether or not the accused has a mental disorder and to specify whether or not it affected discernment at the time of offense. Nowadays, psychiatric expertise is coming under more and more criticism, particularly regarding divergences between experts.\nOur objectives were to find points of divergence between experts, try to understand causes and suggest ways to try to reduce them.\nFor this we conducted a study, between July 2012\u00a0and January 2013, with psychiatric experts of the Court of Appeal of Aix-en-Provence through semi-structured interviews. We focused on a limited context: psychiatric expertise of responsibility for schizophrenic persons accused of murder. We questioned the experts about the issue of criminal liability of a person with schizophrenia in general but also in clinical situations we thought particularly involved in disagreements.\nWe recruited a population of 17\u00a0psychiatrists, mostly males of average age of 58\u00a0years, working mostly in the department of adult psychiatry of a hospital. We highlighted the differences between the experts, first with regards to the issue of liability in general. Experts divided seemed to keep in majority (52.9\u00a0%) the alternative between abolition and alteration of discernment when faced with a schizophrenic person accused of murder. The differences were even more pronounced in specific contexts. Thus, the fact that the person had suffered from delirium at the time of the offense led half of the experts (47.1\u00a0%) to conclude a systematic abolition of discernment, while the other half made such a conclusion when the delirium was directly linked to the facts. Discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment, drug abuse or existence of premeditation changed the conclusions of the experts in half the cases, more in the sense of an increased accountability in the cases of drug abuse or premeditation, and in the direction of a reduction of liability in case of cessation of treatment. The denial of facts by the accused caused fewer disagreements between experts. Among experts, 76.5\u00a0% had already observed differences, which, according to them, were based primarily on schools of thought, or personal views (64.7\u00a0%), which could distort clinical evaluation and especially forensic interpretation of the relationship between pathology and facts. The experts thought it was possible and desirable to reduce differences and proposed different solutions for this, especially the return to dual expertise and colleges of experts.\nOur results were consistent with those in the literature. Based on proposals from experts and data from the literature, we identified five perspectives likely to reduce differences: first it would be useful to put in place a better specific training in forensic psychiatry and expertise, not only theoretical but also in terms of practical training through tutoring. We would identify a jurisprudence in forensic psychiatric assessment and identify consensual points. It would be good to allow experts to acquire sufficient experience not just through tutorials but also by statutory changes. Moments of exchange between experts -\u00a0including a return to dual expertise and the organization of work meeting\u00a0- could also reduce differences. Finally, we propose legislative changes: not only to rewrite the paragraph 2\u00a0of Article 122-1\u00a0of the French Penal Code, but also to give priority to the expertise of responsibility on the expertise of dangerousness.\nWe showed that there were differences between the experts mainly concerned with the forensic interpretation, and that they seemed linked to schools of thought or to personal views of each expert.

In universities, for example, there is longitudinal evidence that research-focused scholars make the best leaders; results from a hospital study show that doctors instead of professional managers are most closely associated with the best performing institutions. To explain these patterns, and raise hypotheses, a theory of expert leadership (TEL) has been developed that might explain these patterns. In this paper the framework for expert leadership is applied to psychiatry.\nThe TEL proposes that psychiatric leaders, as opposed to non-expert managers, improve organizational performance through several channels. First, experts' knowledge influences organizational strategy. Second, having been 'one of them', a psychiatrist understands how to create the optimal work environment for psychiatric teams, through appropriate goal-setting, evaluation and support. These factors are positively associated with workers' wellbeing and performance. Third, exceptional psychiatrist-leaders are likely to set high standards for hiring. Fourth, leaders' credibility extends their influence among core workers, and also signals organizational priorities to stakeholders.

Do our educational practices meet the needs and the expectations of patients and their families? These questions led us to carry out this qualitative and prospective study concerning the representations of patient education of the main actors in psychiatry.\nThis work aims to assess the representations of patient education of the main actors in psychiatry, in particular to assess convergences and divergences.\nThis is a qualitative and prospective study. Qualitative data are speeches from caregivers working in psychiatry, patients suffering from a psychiatric pathology and their families. The three populations studied were defined by precise characteristics. The sample was diversified by a variable related to the study theme: experience or not in patient education. Speeches were collected during interviews, which were carried out by the same person. Interviews were semi-structured by a thematic guide, which defined the themes to be explored. The three main themes are: the concept of patient education, the objectives of patient education, and the caregiver/patient relationship. We analysed the content of the speeches with a lexical reference table that we elaborated from the literature of experts in patient education. We also realised a transverse analysis in order to assess convergences and divergences between the different speeches.\nThirty-two interviews were realised with fifteen caregivers (six psychiatrists and nine nurses), ten patients and seven families. In the speeches of the different populations, we found the expected element of language for all the themes explored. Unexpected ideas were also found in the speeches of the various groups. We could find convergences and divergences concerning these unexpected ideas between and within each group. Regarding convergences, all the groups mentioned the unexpected idea of the problem of social representations of psychiatric diseases. The three groups also approached the need to develop the work with families. Patients and families entrusted their feeling that there would be a lack of exchange with some caregivers. Patients and caregivers evoked the paternalistic attitude of some caregivers. Finally, both caregivers and family approached their questions regarding the caregiver/patient relationship during care without the patient's consent. We found several divergences in the caregivers' speeches. These divergences seemed to be correlated with the experience in patient education in psychiatry. They concerned the scope of patient education in psychiatry, the differences perceived between patient education in psychiatry or in somatic cares, and the diagnostic announcement to the patient. This last unexpected idea was the main point of divergence between caregivers and patients.\nResults of this study showed that the representations of caregivers, patients and their families correlate with the experts' ideas regarding patient education. The analysis of the different speeches highlighted several unexpected ideas, which constitute themes of reflection about patient education. Some of these themes concern in particular the medical domain of psychiatry such as the questions about caregiver/patient relationship during care without the patient's consent and restraint. Another theme of psychiatry specific reflection is the differences perceived by some caregivers between their practices and the patient education in somatic care. Others themes of reflection highlighted all the medical specialities: the need to develop the work with families, the problem of the social representations of diseases, the scopes of patient education and the diagnostic announcement to the patient.\nThis study highlighted several themes of reflection about patient education in psychiatry. We should include this theme of reflection in our practices in order to respond more precisely to the needs and the expectations of the patients and their families."}, {"Title": "The effect of treating obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure on depression and other subjective symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) frequently present with symptoms of depression and anxiety. The objective of this study is to determine if treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) improves symptoms of depression and anxiety. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of PAP that contained a validated measure of depression severity. Meta-analysis was conducted for depression, anxiety, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), quality of life (QoL) and respiratory variables. The systematic review included 33 reports. Pre-post-test analysis of PAP showed a moderate effect size (Hedge's g, 95% CI) for depression 0.524 [0.401-0.647], but a low effect size compared to oral placebo (0.355 [0.187-0.524]) and no effect when compared to dental appliances (0.107 [-0.72-0.287]) and sham PAP (-0.049 [-0.292-0.194]). Anxiety, EDS, and QoL showed similar improvement in pre-post-test analysis, but a lack of superiority to dental appliances and sham PAP. PAP was superior to all comparators for respiratory variables. PAP has a moderate clinical effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety in OSA, but it is not superior to dental appliances or sham PAP. The improvement in subjective symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, may be mediated by patient expectations and contact with healthcare providers."}, {"Title": "Older peoples' narratives of use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs.", "Abstract": "Studies revealed that misuse of drugs and alcohol is an increasing phenomenon among older people (aged 65 years and above), and we know that such misuse is a risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, we do not know to what extent older people have experiences, understanding and knowledge about the use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs.\nTo investigate older peoples' experiences with and reflections on the use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs among older people.\nQualitative interviews with 16 older people were performed during 2013 and 2014. The sample included informants aged from 65 to 92 years from 11 municipalities. The data were analysed by using the phenomenological hermeneutic method.\nThe first theme that arose from the informants' narratives was to be a part of a culture in change that details the informants' experiences with and reflections on the cultural changes regarding the use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs. This theme is divided into three subthemes: to use and attitudes toward use, to trivialise use and risks of use, and to disclaim responsibility for use and misuse. The second theme, to explain use and misuse involved reasons for the use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs. It included the subthemes: to be afraid, to be lonely, and to be informed.\nThe study revealed that most informants had experiences with the use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs, but disclaimed any challenges with their use. The use was trivialised and seen as something older people just do. They disclaimed responsibility for their own psychotropic use as their general practitioners were defined as the responsible persons. Moreover, the study showed that the informants had poor knowledge about the risk of use and misuse of alcohol and psychotropic drugs."}, {"Title": "International Committee on Mental Health in Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety.", "Abstract": "Studies measuring psychological distress in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have found high rates of both depression and anxiety. Psychological symptoms in both individuals with CF and parent caregivers have been associated with decreased lung function, lower body mass index, worse adherence, worse health-related quality of life, more frequent hospitalisations and increased healthcare costs. To identify and treat depression and anxiety in CF, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society invited a panel of experts, including physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, a pharmacist, parents and an individual with CF, to develop consensus recommendations for clinical care. Over 18\u2005months, this 22-member committee was divided into four workgroups: Screening; Psychological Interventions; Pharmacological Treatments and Implementation and Future Research, and used the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome methodology to develop questions for literature search and review. Searches were conducted in PubMed, PsychINFO, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Psychiatry online and ABDATA by a methodologist at Dartmouth. The committee reviewed 344 articles, drafted statements and set an 80% acceptance for each recommendation statement as a consensus threshold prior to an anonymous voting process.

Yet they typically require that psychiatric-assisted dying could come to question in the cases of autonomous, or rational, psychiatric patients only. Given that also non-autonomous psychiatric patients can sometimes suffer unbearably, this limitation appears questionable. In this article, I maintain that restricting psychiatric-assisted dying to autonomous, or rational, psychiatric patients would not be compatible with endorsing certain end-of-life practices commonly accepted in current medical ethics and law, practices often referred to as 'passive euthanasia'."}, {"Title": "How Do Clinicians Prefer Cultural Competence Training?

Content analysis identified most and least helpful educational methods by reason. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis compared clinician characteristics to method preferences.\nMost frequently, clinicians named case-based behavioral simulations as \"most helpful\" and video as \"least helpful\" training methods. Bivariate and logistic regression models, first unadjusted and then clustered by country, found that each additional year of a clinician's age was associated with a preference for behavioral simulations: OR\u2009=\u20091.05 (95\u00a0% CI: 1.01-1.10; p\u2009=\u20090.025).\nMost clinicians preferred active behavioral simulations in cultural competence training, and this effect was most pronounced among older clinicians. Effective training may be best accomplished through a combination of reviewing written guidelines, video demonstration, and behavioral simulations.

The short version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D) was used to evaluate their mental health status. Pain intensity was rated on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10 by patients and physicians. Patients with a previously diagnosed psychiatric disorder were compared to those without or with newly diagnosed psychiatric symptoms, based on PHQ-D results. Pain and psychopharmacological medication were assessed. Opioid doses were converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs).\nSome 68 patients were included. Previously undetected psychiatric symptoms were identified in 38% (26 of 68), preexisting psychiatric comorbidities were evident in 25% (17), and no psychiatric symptoms were observed in 37% (25). Patients with a preexisting psychiatric comorbidity received antidepressants and benzodiazepines significantly more often than patients without or with previously undetected psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.001). Patient and physician median NRS ratings of pain intensity correlated significantly (p = 0.001). Median NRS rating showed no significant difference between patients with preexisting, previously undetected, or without psychiatric symptoms. OMEs did not differ significantly between preexisting, without, or previously undetected psychiatric symptoms. Patients with undetected and preexisting psychiatric comorbidities had a greater impairment in their activities of daily living than patients without psychiatric symptoms (p = 0.003).\nUndetected psychiatric comorbidities are common in patients receiving palliative care. Screening for psychiatric symptoms should be integrated into standard palliative care to optimize treatment and reduce the psychosocial burden of the disease."}, {"Title": "Marginal revenue and length of stay in inpatient psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This study examines the changes in marginal revenue during psychiatric inpatient stays in a large Swiss psychiatric hospital after the introduction of a mixed reimbursement system with tariff rates that vary over length of stay. A discrete time duration model with a difference-in-difference specification and time-varying coefficients is estimated to assess variations in policy effects over length of stay. Among patients whose costs are fully reimbursed by the mixed scheme, the model demonstrates a significant effect of marginal revenue on length of stay. No significant policy effects are found among patients for whom only health insurance rates are delivered as mixed tariffs and government contributions are made retrospectively. The results indicate that marginal revenue can affect length of stay in inpatient psychiatry facilities, but that the reduction in marginal revenue must be sufficiently large."}, {"Title": "The University of Manitoba Psychiatry Toolkit: Development and Evaluation.", "Abstract": "The authors developed and measured the subsequent utilization of a web-based point-of-care information tool and meta-search filter, the University of Manitoba Psychiatry Toolkit, as well as conduct an evaluation of its impact on physicians' information seeking.\nEvaluation entailed analysis of toolkit web page utilization data from user visits to the web-based toolkit, as well as an online survey distributed to psychiatrists and resident trainees to assess information gathering behaviors and attitudes regarding various sources of medical information.\nElectronic resources and colleagues were the preferred sources for gathering health information, while inadequate time and search skills were ranked as important barriers.

Problem Solving Therapy (PST) has emerged as a promising psychotherapy for MDD in older adults, although the efficacy of PST in this population has not been well described. We examined the effectiveness of PST for the treatment of MDD in older adults in a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nWe searched electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials comparing PST to a control condition or other treatment for MDD in adults with an average age of 60 years or older. We used meta-analysis to arrive at pooled summary measures of the efficacy of PST when compared to control conditions on the change in depressive symptoms and other outcomes.\nNine studies with a total of 569 participants (290 PST, 279 control) met inclusion criteria. Most studies administered PST in person and were between 6 and 12 weeks in duration. Meta-analysis of six studies evaluating the effect of PST on depression using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression identified a significant reduction in depression associated with PST (pooled mean difference =\u2009-6.94, 95%CI -10.91 to -2.97, d = 1.15, P = 0.0006).

Two major problems are of interest when analyzing behavior. First, we wish to automatically categorize observed behaviors into a discrete set of classes (i.e., classification). For example, to determine word production from video sequences in sign language. Second, we wish to understand the relevance of each behavioral feature in achieving this classification (i.e., decoding). For instance, to know which behavior variables are used to discriminate between the words apple and onion in American Sign Language (ASL). The present paper proposes to model behavior using a labeled graph, where the nodes define behavioral features and the edges are labels specifying their order (e.g., before, overlaps, start). In this approach, classification reduces to a simple labeled graph matching. Unfortunately, the complexity of labeled graph matching grows exponentially with the number of categories we wish to represent. Here, we derive a graph kernel to quickly and accurately compute this graph similarity. This approach is very general and can be plugged into any kernel-based classifier. Specifically, we derive a Labeled Graph Support Vector Machine (LGSVM) and a Labeled Graph Logistic Regressor (LGLR) that can be readily employed to discriminate between many actions (e.g., sign language concepts). The derived approach can be readily used for decoding too, yielding invaluable information for the understanding of a problem (e.g., to know how to teach a sign language). The derived algorithms allow us to achieve higher accuracy results than those of state-of-the-art algorithms in a fraction of the time. We show experimental results on a variety of problems and datasets, including multimodal data."}, {"Title": "Correlates of major medication side effects interfering with daily performance: results from a cross-sectional cohort study of older psychiatric patients.", "Abstract": "Polypharmacy is common among older persons who are also vulnerable to side effects.

For the AGNP-TDM, written by 14 authors from German speaking countries, the number of self-citations was 83 (39%). Most citations were found in the following categories: reviews in clinical pharmacology (85 times), clinical pharmacological studies in patients (49). Four out of the 74 different AGNP-TDM citing journals displayed 41% of the citations. The ILAE-TDM was published by five European authors and four authors from the USA. Europe (40) and North America (15) had the highest citation rates.

The diagnostic cutoff was established as 16/17 (sensitivity 97.43, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 98.48%). Factor analysis identified 3 factors, accounting for 76% of total variance: \"sadness-anhedonia\" comprising apparent sadness, reported sadness, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal ideas; \"anxiety\" with reduced sleep and inner tension; and \"vegetative symptoms\" with reduced appetite.\nThe MADRS has diagnostic utility in major depression in PD.

In this article, we have explored how mental health professionals working within a forensic psychiatric unit construct the issue of patient sexuality in order to ascertain the range of sexual possibilities open to patients. Drawing on interviews with twenty four participants--psychiatrists and clinical psychologists (clinical staff), we examined how participants made sense of patient sexuality and their clinical judgments in relation to them. Using a thematic analysis, we were able to identify a number of relevant themes emerging, including a) what the limits of acceptable sexual behaviour were judged to be, b) discrimination against transgender and same sex relationships, c) vulnerability among female patients and therapeutic efficacy, and d) an abject fear of patient pregnancy. Furthermore, a general concern throughout was the putative professional conflict between the clinical and ward staff. Further discussion regarding the potential for clearer policy on patient sexuality and further training for professionals is developed in the final section."}, {"Title": "Annual Research Review: Threats to the validity of child psychiatry and psychology.", "Abstract": "Suggestions have been made that many claims concern false-positive findings in the field of child psychology and psychiatry.\nThe literature was searched for concepts and findings on the validity of child psychiatry and psychology.

FPSE utilizes a flexible fabric surface as the substrate platform for creating sol-gel hybrid organic-inorganic sorbent coatings. FPSE media can be introduced directly into the sample containing the target analyte(s), requiring no need for prior sample pretreatment or clean-up. Benzodiazepines were selected as model analytes because they represent one of the most widely used therapeutic drugs in psychiatry and are also amongst the most frequently encountered drugs in forensic toxicology. The chromatographic separation of target analytes was performed on a LiChroCART-LiChrospher\u00ae100 RP-18e (5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4 mm) analytical column, operated at room temperature.

Irritability was significantly associated with social friction (arguments with friends, family, or colleagues) and a functional disability variable (found was unable to do something wanted to do), and poor self-perceived health was also associated with the same functional disability variable. Excessive worry, despite being among the least reported symptoms, was significantly associated with distress.\nThese findings suggest that individual GAD symptoms are differentially associated with aspects of clinical significance relevant to daily life, such as social, occupational, and functional ability. The differential impact of individual symptoms on functional status may be diluted when using symptom sum scores.

In a geriatric care unit of a psychiatric hospital, the pharmacist, in close cooperation with the various health professionals, takes part in the optimization of drug therapy of these patients during cross-professional consultation meetings. From 2009 to 2011, an evaluation of professional practices was run through a targeted clinical audit on the theme of \"prescription drugs at the age of 75 and over\". The main objective of this study is to measure the differences between the practices and the guidelines for prescription drugs concerning the elderly, and then to analyze and amend these differences. The secondary objective is to gather data on the prescription drugs for the elderly in the particular context of a psychiatric unit.\nThe evaluation was performed using two standards: the evaluation chart of prescriptions of the Professional College of French Geriatrics (CPGF) and the French National Authority for Health and the list of Laroche et al. In the first round, after analyzing the prescriptions of 105\u00a0patients, the gap between practice and accepted standards led to the definition of three areas of improvement on the associations of neuroleptics, on the use of anticholinergic drugs and on the prescription of benzodiazepines, the latter being subject of another communication. After reassessment, the prescriptions of 101\u00a0patients were thereafter analyzed in relation to the identified areas of improvement.\nPatient samples of both phases were statistically homogeneous. Between the two evaluations, the percentage of prescriptions with at least two neuroleptics remained stable, the decline was not significant (18.1% to 13.9%, P\u22650.05). However, it was observed that the second suggested a \"conditional\" decline with dosages less than or equal to those recommended for the elderly dosages. The proportion of patients who did not take anticholinergic drugs increased from 30% to 60% (P\u22640.01). In parallel to the improvement of these criteria, it was noted that the average number of psychotropic drugs prescribed was significantly reduced (from 3.3 to 2.79\u00a0psychotropic/patients, P=0.078).\nThe involvement of a pharmacist in cross-professional meetings of a care unit of psychiatry for the elderly has contributed in setting up a clinical audit focused on the drug management of these patients. This work enabled measurement of the progress made in the use of anticholinergic drugs, following the guidelines. In the mean time, it has been highlighted that the standards used are difficult to comply with regarding some criteria. For instance, the use of neuroleptics in the case of elderly patients hospitalized in the unit of psychiatry and not in the unit of geriatrics requires specific adjustments. Indeed, there are patients whose disorders have led to psychiatric hospitalization, which may require a combination of two neuroleptics. This paved the way for us to develop, within a working group representative of all professionals involved, a list fitting our medical practice and integrated into a guidebook adapted to the drug therapy management of elderly patients in psychiatry. The approach being successful, this targeted clinical audit will be extended to patients aged 75\u00a0years and over, hospitalized in other care units of the hospital."}, {"Title": "Integrating Behavioral Health into Primary Care.", "Abstract": "Depression is one of the more common diagnoses encountered in primary care, and primary care in turn provides the majority of care for patients with depression. Many approaches have been tried in efforts to improve the outcomes of depression management. This article outlines the partnership between the University of Washington (UW) Neighborhood Clinics and the UW Department of Psychiatry in implementing a collaborative care approach to integrating the management of anxiety and depression in the ambulatory primary care setting. This program was built on the chronic care model, which utilizes a team approach to caring for the patient. In addition to the patient and the primary care provider (PCP), the team included a medical social worker (MSW) as care manager and a psychiatrist as team consultant. The MSW would manage a registry of patients with depression at a clinic with several PCPs, contacting the patients on a regular basis to assess their status, and consulting with the psychiatrist on a weekly basis to discuss patients who were not achieving the goals of care. Any recommendation (eg, a change in medication dose or class) made by the psychiatrist was communicated to the PCP, who in turn would work with the patient on the new recommendation. This collaborative care approach resulted in a significant improvement in the number of patients who achieved care plan goals.

Psychiatric follow-up was not considered necessary in 61% of cases. Focus groups revealed that prior to experiencing joint consultations, PCPs considered mental health problems to be the domain of psychiatrists and outside their own area of competence. Joint consultations helped to demystify the role of psychiatrists, reduce their anxiety and increase PCPs' confidence in dealing with patients' mental health problems.\nJoint consultations enabled PCPs to shift away from a dichotomous view of somatic versus mental health problems and their management, and towards a more integrated view.\nJoint consultations provide a useful strategy for training primary care physicians in the management of mental health problems.

As current treatments are estimated to address only one-third of the disease burden of depressive disorders, there is a need for new approaches to prevent depression or to delay its progression. While in its early stages, converging evidence from laboratory, population research, and clinical trials now suggests that dietary patterns and specific dietary factors may influence the risk for depression. However, largely as a result of the recency of the nutritional psychiatry field, there are currently no dietary recommendations for depression.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide a set of practical dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression, based on the best available current evidence, in order to inform public health and clinical recommendations.\nFive key dietary recommendations for the prevention of depression emerged from current published evidence. These comprise: (1) follow 'traditional' dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean, Norwegian, or Japanese diet; (2) increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, wholegrain cereals, nuts, and seeds; (3) include a high consumption of foods rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; (4) replace unhealthy foods with wholesome nutritious foods; (5) limit your intake of processed-foods, 'fast' foods, commercial bakery goods, and sweets.\nAlthough there are a number of gaps in the scientific literature to date, existing evidence suggests that a combination of healthful dietary practices may reduce the risk of developing depression. It is imperative to remain mindful of any protective effects that are likely to come from the cumulative and synergic effect of nutrients that comprise the whole-diet, rather than from the effects of individual nutrients or single foods. As the body of evidence grows from controlled intervention studies on dietary patterns and depression, these recommendations should be modified accordingly."}, {"Title": "Association of traumatic brain injury with subsequent neurological and psychiatric disease: a meta-analysis.", "Abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, and other illnesses.

Reviewers abstracted the data and assessed study designs and characteristics.\nFifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a significant association of prior TBI with subsequent neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the development of any illness subsequent to prior TBI was 1.67 (95% CI 1.44-1.93, p < 0.0001). Prior TBI was independently associated with both neurological (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.83, p < 0.0001) and psychiatric (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.50-2.66, p < 0.0001) outcomes.

This association was present when examining only studies of mild TBI and when considering the influence of study design and characteristics. Analysis of a subset of studies demonstrated no evidence that multiple TBIs were associated with higher odds of disease than a single TBI.\nHistory of TBI, including mild TBI, is associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric illness.

In Denmark, healthcare delivery packages are increasingly used for assessment of patients. A package is a tool for creating coordination, continuity and efficient pathways; each step is pre-booked, and the package has a well-defined content within a predefined category of diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how assessment processes took place within the context of healthcare delivery packages.\nThe study used a constructivist Grounded Theory approach. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in three specialized units: a mental health unit and two multiple sclerosis clinics in Southern Denmark, which all used assessment packages. Several types of data were sampled through theoretical sampling. Participant observation was conducted for a total of 126h. Formal and informal interviews were conducted with 12 healthcare professionals and 13 patients. Furthermore, audio recordings were made of 9 final consultations between physicians and patients; 193min of recorded consultations all in all. Lastly, the medical records of 13 patients and written information about packages were collected. The comparative, abductive analysis focused on the process of assessment and the work made by all the actors involved. In this paper, we emphasized the work of healthcare professionals.\nWe constructed five interrelated categories: 1. \"Standardized assessing\", 2. \"Flexibility\", which has two sub-categories, 2.1. \"Diagnostic options\" and 2.2. \"Time and organization\", and, finally, 3. \"Resisting the frames\". The process of assessment required all participants to perform the predefined work in the specified way at the specified time. Multidisciplinary teamwork was essential for the success of the process. The local organization of the packages influenced the assessment process, most notably the pre-defined scope of relevant diseases targeted by the package. The inflexible frames of the assessment package could cause resistance among clinicians. Moreover, expert knowledge was an important factor for the efficiency of the process. Some types of organizational work processes resulted in many patients being assessed, but without being diagnosed with at package-relevant disease.\nLimiting the grounds for using specialist knowledge in structured health care delivery may affect specialists' sense of professional autonomy and can result in professionals employing strategies to resist the frames of the packages.

The scale had a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha\u2009=\u20090.88) and was without ceiling or floor effects. Students rated the integration of psychiatry into the practice of surgery and its subspecialties as less relevant than its integration into other specialties; however, scores were not biased by students' interest in procedural vs. non-procedural specialties.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM 5) defines delirium as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition that develops over a short period of time and fluctuates. Possible causes of delirium are manifold: usually delirium is considered to develop in a multifactorial way, caused by inalterable parameters, such as advanced age and pre-existing cognitive impairment and precipitated by modifiable parameters, such as the use of certain drugs or substance withdrawal. Delirium is a serious condition with a pronounced impact on morbidity, mortality and costs to the healthcare system. Circumstances and drugs that might precipitate or worsen delirium should therefore be avoided whenever possible. A list of drugs that might have a detrimental influence on the emergence and duration of delirium has been created using the terms \"delirogenity\" and \"delirogenic\" to describe the potential of a drug or withdrawal to cause or worsen delirium. The results are novel and noteworthy, as their focus is on substances relevant to European pharmacotherapy. Furthermore, they represent a methodical consensus from a group of experts of a wide variety of professions relevant to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of delirium, such as nursing, pharmacy, pharmacology, surgical and internal medicine, neurology, psychiatry, intensive care and medicine, with working, teaching and scientific experience in several European countries practicing both in primary and secondary care."}, {"Title": "Musculoskeletal Medicine Is Underrepresented in the American Medical School Clinical Curriculum.", "Abstract": "Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are common, and their burden on the healthcare system is increasing as the general population ages. It is essential that medical students be well prepared to evaluate and treat MSK disorders in a confident manner as they enter the workforce. Recent studies and the American Association of Medical Colleges have raised concern that medical schools may not give sufficient instruction on this topic. Other authors have shown that preclinical instruction has increased over the past decade; however, it is unclear if required clinical instruction also has followed that trend.\nThe purposes of this study were: (1) to assess the presence and duration of required or selective instruction in a MSK medicine specialty within the clinical years of undergraduate medical education; and (2) to assess the current state of requirements of clinical clerkships or rotations in other surgical and nonsurgical fields for comparison with the initial findings.\nThe web sites of all 141 US medical schools were assessed to determine the content of their clinical curricula for the 2014-2015 academic year; five were excluded because they had not yet had a graduating class by the conclusion of the 2014-2015 academic year. Complete information on required rotations was obtained through the schools' web sites for all 136 (100%) medical schools. For selective experience during the surgery clerkships, complete information was available for 130 of the remaining 136 (96%) web sites.\nMean (in weeks, \u00b1 SD) duration of core clerkships were as follows: internal medicine (10 \u00b1 2), surgery (8 \u00b1 2), pediatrics (7 \u00b1 1), obstetrics/gynecology (6 \u00b1 1), and psychiatry (5 \u00b1 1). Other common required clerkships were: family medicine (required in 96% [131 of 136] of schools, mean duration of 6 \u00b1 2 weeks), neurology (81% [110], 4 \u00b1 1), and emergency medicine (55% [75], 3 \u00b1 1). Required MSK instruction, at a mean of 2 \u00b1 1 weeks, was only present in 15% (20 of 136) of medical schools. In addition, clinical MSK instruction was offered as a selective (eg, students pick from a selection of subspecialties such as orthopaedics, plastics, or urology during a general surgery clerkship) in 34% (44 of 130) of all medical schools. This is less than other non-core specialties: geriatrics/ambulatory care (required in 40% [54 of 136] of schools, mean duration of 3 \u00b1 1 weeks), critical care (30% [41], mean of 3 \u00b1 1 weeks), radiology (26% [35], mean of 3 \u00b1 1 weeks), anesthesiology (23% [31], mean of 2 \u00b1 1 weeks), and other surgical subspecialties (19% [26], mean of 3 \u00b1 1weeks).\nTraditional core clerkships continue to be well represented in the clinical years, whereas three newer specialties have gained a larger presence: family medicine, neurology, and emergency medicine; these comprise the \"big eight\" of clinical clerkships. Given the high prevalence and burden of MSK disorders, required experience in MSK medicine continues to be underrepresented. Further discussion at a national level is needed to determine appropriate representation of MSK medicine specialties during the clinical years."}, {"Title": "Life Stressors and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a Seriously Mentally Ill Jail Population.", "Abstract": "Inmates represent a vulnerable population with increased rates of trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Change scores on the PSC-AS were larger among patients with ADHD diagnoses than those with non-ADHD diagnoses.

This study compares the prevalence of a measure of well-being, symptoms of common mental disorder (CMD), lifetime suicidal ideation, harmful alcohol and drug use among inner city non-heterosexual and heterosexual individuals. It is the first UK study which aims to quantify how much major, everyday and anticipated discrimination; lifetime and childhood trauma; and coping strategies for dealing with unfair treatment, predict excess mental ill health among non-heterosexuals. Further, inner city and national outcomes are compared.\nSelf-report survey data came from the South East London Community Health study (N = 1052) and the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (N = 7403).\nAdjustments for greater exposure to measured experiences of discrimination and lifetime and childhood trauma had a small to moderate impact on effect sizes for adverse health outcomes though in fully adjusted models, non-heterosexual orientation remained strongly associated with CMD, lifetime suicidal ideation, harmful alcohol and drug use. There was limited support for the hypothesis that measured coping strategies might mediate some of these associations. The inner city sample had poorer mental health overall compared with the national sample and the discrepancy was larger for non-heterosexuals than heterosexuals.\nChildhood and adult adversity substantially influence but do not account for sexual orientation-related mental health disparities. Longitudinal work taking a life course approach with more specific measures of discrimination and coping is required to further understand these associations.

In many accounts, from nineteenth century medical journals to twenty-first century popular films, a medicine deemed at once 'Western' and universal is granted the ability to diagnose neurotic afflictions, but rendered incapable of curing them, while bodily techniques referred to as 'Indian' are granted efficacy. In this article, I explore the subtleties and implications of this recurrent knowledge paradigm. I argue that a particular arrangement-one in which difference is established through equivalence-undergirds the terms by which medicine comes to be viewed as a cultural encounter. As these progressive formulations are often founded on stories about women's madness, I ask, what are the implications of an arguably pragmatic ethos founded on an uneven-and deeply gendered-resolution to postcolonial knowledge problems?"}, {"Title": "Shared decision making for psychiatric medication management: beyond the micro-social.", "Abstract": "Mental health care has lagged behind other health-care domains in developing and applying shared decision making (SDM) for treatment decisions. This is despite compatibilities with ideals of modern mental health care such as self-management and recovery-oriented practice, and growing policy-level interest. Psychiatric medication is a mainstay of mental health treatment, but there are known problems with prescribing practices, and service users report feeling uninvolved in medication decisions and concerned about adverse effects. SDM has potential to produce better tailoring of psychiatric medication to individuals' needs.\nThis conceptual review argues that several aspects of mental health care that differ from other health-care contexts (e.g. forms of coercion, questions about service users' insight and disempowerment) may impact on processes and possibilities for SDM. It is therefore problematic to uncritically import models of SDM developed in other health-care contexts. We argue that decision making for psychiatric medication is better understood in a broader way that moves beyond the micro-social focus of a medical consultation. Contextualizing specific medication-related consultations within longer term relationships, and broader service systems enables recognition of the multiple processes, actors and agendas that shape how psychiatric medication is prescribed, managed and used, and which may facilitate or impede SDM.\nA broad conceptualization of decision making for psychiatric medication that moves beyond the micro-social can account for why SDM in this domain remains a rarity. It has both conceptual and practical utility for evaluating research evidence, identifying future research priorities and highlighting fruitful ways of developing and implementing SDM in mental health care."}, {"Title": "Balint groups - helping trainee psychiatrists make even better use of themselves.", "Abstract": "The paper presents a pilot study of Balint group work to establish it as a potential training tool in psychiatry.

They began to feel supported by their colleagues and experienced the method as an effective way to manage stress and anxiety.

Most treatments were administered in line with local clinical guidelines and were rated as effective. Psychiatrists preferred unilateral ECT in the first instance with stimulus dosing based on patients' seizure thresholds. Approximately a quarter of unilateral courses were switched later to bitemporal placement, most probably because of insufficient progress. Bilateral treatments were associated with a larger number of treatments, less improvement in scores on mood and cognitive scales, and more refusals to continue treatment than unilateral-only ECT.\nBrief pulse unilateral ECT proved more effective than bitemporal and bifrontal ECT for most aged patients, especially when coupled with stimulus dosing based on seizure threshold."}, {"Title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry: which knowledge and skills do primary care physicians need to have? A survey in general practitioners and paediatricians.", "Abstract": "Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a key role in the initial assessment and management of children and adolescents with mental health problems. However, it is unclear whether current medical education curricula sufficiently equip PCPs for this task. The aim of this study was to investigate, which child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP)-related skills and knowledge PCPs say they require in their daily practice. A questionnaire was generated, employing a modified two-step Delphi approach. Besides socio-demographic items, the questionnaire contained 17 CAP-related knowledge items and 13 CAP-related skills items, which had to be rated by importance in daily practice. The questionnaire was distributed to 348 office-based paediatricians and 500 general practitioners (GPs) in Germany. The overall return rate was 51.3% (435/848). Regarding CAP-related knowledge, both paediatricians and GPs rated somatoform disorders and obesity as highly important for daily practice. Moreover, paediatricians also deemed regulatory disorders during infancy (e.g. crying, sleep disorders) as important, while GPs assessed knowledge on paediatric depression as relevant. For paediatricians and GPs, the most relevant CAP-related skills were communicating with children and adolescents and their parents. Additionally, paediatricians rated differentiating between non-pathologic and clinically relevant behaviour problems very relevant, while GPs considered basic psychotherapeutic skills essential. The CAP-related knowledge and skills perceived relevant for doctors in primary care differ from the majority of current medical school CAP curricula, which cover mainly typical, epitomic CAP disorders and are predominantly knowledge-oriented. Therefore, medical education in CAP should be amended to reflect the needs of PCPs to improve healthcare for children and adolescents with mental health problems."}, {"Title": "Early memories: Clinical relevance and significance.", "Abstract": "The purpose of this research was to examine earliest memories in patients with a mental disorder and their clinical relevance to diagnosis and treatment.\nA semi-structured early memory questionnaire was developed and 50 patients with anxiety, depression or a psychotic disorder were interviewed.

It is a crisis of its diagnostic systems despite - perhaps because - of the recurrent claims about the extent of diagnosable 'brain disorders'. It is a crisis of its explanatory systems despite - perhaps because - of its current wager on the brain as the ultimate locus for explanations of mental disorders. It is a crisis of its therapeutic capacities despite - perhaps because - more and more people are making use of its primary mode of intervention focussed on the brain - psychiatric drugs. In this editorial, I will suggest that this triple crisis of diagnosis, explanation and therapeutics arises from the dominant reductionist approaches to the role of neurobiology in psychiatry that priorities the analysis of brain mechanisms, at the expense of an understanding of the whole living organism in its milieu, and the processes which social experience shapes neurobiology from the moment of conception if not before. I shall suggest a different approach that starts from the experience of persons coping with adversity in their forms of life. This approach does not require giving up on our search for plausible explanations of mental health problems that engage neurobiological mechanisms, but it begins from a commitment to understanding, and hence intervening in, the ways in which social adversity shapes and blights the lives of so many of our fellow citizens."}, {"Title": "\"The Glamour of Arabic Numbers\": Pliny Earle's Challenge to Nineteenth-Century Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A well-established interpretation associates the nineteenth-century psychiatrist Pliny Earle's deflation of high cure rates for insanity with the onset of a persistent malaise in patient treatment and public health policy during the Gilded Age.

Clinical accounts describe avoidance strategies including apparently strategic use of distraction or socially shocking behaviour, and obsessive need for control, reflected in domineering behaviour to peers and adults. Educational and management approaches effective for PDA reportedly differ from those for 'typical' autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and include novelty, humour and flexibility. Identification of PDA in individuals with ASD may have important implications for management (Eaton and Banting, J Learn Disabil Offending Behav 3:150-157, 2012). Despite increasing interest, no clinician-rated instrument for PDA has been developed. Here, items relevant to PDA were identified from the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorder (DISCO) (Wing et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 43:307-325, 2002). The most PDA-specific subset of relevant DISCO items was selected, based on low endorsement in general across a sample of 153 individuals assessed for possible ASD using the DISCO. Having selected 11 DISCO PDA items for the measure, a subset of individuals with a high number of these features was identified (N = 27). Consistent with Newson's descriptions, this high scoring group was characterised by lack of co-operation, use of apparently manipulative behaviour, socially shocking behaviour, difficulties with other people, anxiety and sudden behavioural changes from loving to aggression. All but one case met criteria for an ASD.

Identification of subsets of individuals that may demonstrate increased propensity for posttraumatic symptoms and who may share genetic vulnerabilities for gene-environment interactions can enhance efforts to understand, predict, and prevent these phenomena. A sample of 11,489 cases from the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC), a NIMH-managed data repository for the investigation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, was used for this study. Cases were excluded if TBI was deemed causal to their mental illness. A k-means clustering algorithm was used to probe differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder associated with variables including onset age, hallucinations, delusions, head injury, and TBI. Cases were separated into an optimum number of seven clusters, with two clusters including all cases with brain injury. Bipolar disorder with psychosis and TBI were significantly correlated in one cluster in which 72% of cases were male and 99.2% sustained head injury. This cluster also carried the longest average period of unconsciousness. This study demonstrates an association of TBI with psychosis in a subset of bipolar cases, suggesting that traumatic stressors may have the ability to impact gene expression in a vulnerable population, and/or there is a heightened occurrence of TBI in individuals with underlying psychosis. Further studies should more closely examine the interplay between genetic variation in bipolar disorder and susceptibility to psychosis following TBI. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, {"Title": "Changing Trends in Treatment of Acute Mania: Experience of a Tertiary Centre Over a Decade.", "Abstract": "We investigated trends over a decade in the prescription of lithium, antiepileptics, and antipsychotic agents at discharge for patients hospitalised for acute mania.

We begin by summarising the current state of knowledge regarding FTLD, including the recent discovery of FTLD-causative genetic mutations. Clinicopathological correlations in FTLD are subsequently discussed, while emphasising that clinical syndromes of FTD are dictated by the distribution of FTLD pathology in the brain. We then review a large number of cases with suspected and confirmed bvFTD that had previously been diagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder. The clinical and neuroscientific implications of this overlap are discussed, focusing on the importance of early diagnosis for clinical and therapeutic reasons. We propose that largely due to the paucity of biomarkers for primary psychiatric disorders, and the limited use of FTLD-related biomarkers by psychiatrists at present, it is very difficult to separate patients with early bvFTD from those with primary psychiatric disorders based on clinical grounds. Furthermore, specific limitations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 criteria for bvFTD may inadvertently discourage recognition of bvFTD in mental health settings. Clinically, more research is needed to develop tools that allow early differentiation of bvFTD from primary psychiatric disease, as bvFTD therapies will likely be most effective in the earliest stages of disease. From a neuroscience perspective, we argue that bvFTD provides an excellent paradigm for investigating the neural basis of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "An Illness of Power: Gender and the Social Causes of Depression.", "Abstract": "There is considerable discourse surrounding the disproportionate diagnosis of women with depression as compared to men, often times cited at a rate around 2:1. While this disparity clearly draws attention to gender, a focus on gender tends to fall away in the study and treatment of depression in neuroscience and psychiatry, which largely understand its workings in mechanistic terms of brain chemistry and neurological processes. I first consider how this brain-centered biological model for depression came about. I then argue that the authoritative scientific models for disorder have serious consequences for those diagnosed. Finally, I argue that mechanistic biological models of depression have the effect of silencing women and marginalizing or preventing the examination of social-structural causes of depression, like gender oppression, and therein contribute to the ideological reproduction of oppressive social relations. I argue that depression is best understood in terms of systems of power, including gender, and where a given individual is situated within such social relations.

This study aimed to evaluate experimentally whether clinicians' judgements about a patient with panic disorder were influenced by an inappropriately suggested diagnosis of comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nAn experimental design was used to evaluate clinician's judgements when the nature of the information they were given was varied to imply BPD comorbidity.\nTwo hundred and sixty-five clinicians watched a video-recorded assessment of a woman describing her experience of uncomplicated 'panic disorder' and then rated her present problems and likely prognosis. Prior to watching the video recording, participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions with written information including the following: (1) her personal details and general background; (2) the addition of a behavioural description consistent with BPD; and (3) the further addition of a 'label' (past BPD diagnosis).\nThe BPD label was associated with more negative ratings of the woman's problems and her prognosis than both information alone and a behavioural description of BPD 'symptoms'.\nRegardless of potential actuarial value of such diagnoses, it is concluded that clinicians can be overly influenced by past diagnostic labels in the context of an apparent current comorbid problem, although such biases appear to be less likely if a description of the relevant behaviours is used instead. Thus, the label, rather than the behaviour it denotes, may be stigmatizing in mental health professionals.\nDiagnostic labels can have an inappropriately negative effect on clinicians' judgements not only of treatment variables such as engagement and response but also risk issues and interpersonal effectiveness. Diagnostic labels can have a greater effect on clinicians' judgements than a behavioural description or clinical presentation. Clinicians should therefore be cautious both in the use of diagnostic labels to describe patients and ensure that these are still valid, and also be mindful of the influence that such labels can have on their own clinical judgements and constantly seek to challenge these.

They received supervision and support from the research team. The study was based on focus-group interviews with a total of 13 staff members at four day centres. Narrative analysis with a thematic approach was used. A first round resulted in one narrative per centre. These centre-specific narratives were then integrated into a common narrative that covered all the data.\nA core theme emerged: User involvement permeated the implementation process and created empowerment. It embraced four themes forming a timeline: \"Mix of excitement, worries and hope\", \"Confirmation and development through dialogue, feedback and guidance\", \"The art of integrating new activities and strategies with the old\", and \"Empowerment-engendered future aspirations\".\nThe users' involvement and empowerment were central for the staff in accomplishing the desired changes in services, as were their own reflections and learning.

Oxidative stress (OxS) is a state of imbalance between oxidative processes and antioxidant defenses, which may play an important role in the pathophysiology and disease course of bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of lithium, administered alone or in combination with haloperidol, on selected OxS parameters in human plasma in vitro.\nThe OxS parameters evaluated were thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Plasma samples from healthy volunteers were incubated with drug concentrations used in psychiatry.\nIncubation of plasma with lithium or haloperidol alone did not produce statistically significant changes of TBARS levels in comparison with control samples. However, significantly higher TBARS levels were observed in samples incubated with haloperidol plus lithium compared to control, haloperidol, or lithium samples. The TAC value did not differ between samples.\nLithium does not influence OxS parameters in human plasma in vitro during short-term observation when applied at concentrations used in psychiatry. However, lithium increased the TBARS level in the samples when given in combination with haloperidol, which may be one of the mechanisms behind the neurotoxicity associated with combined lithium and haloperidol administration."}, {"Title": "Text mining applications in psychiatry: a systematic literature review.", "Abstract": "The expansion of biomedical literature is creating the need for efficient tools to keep pace with increasing volumes of information. Text mining (TM) approaches are becoming essential to facilitate the automated extraction of useful biomedical information from unstructured text. We reviewed the applications of TM in psychiatry, and explored its advantages and limitations. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using the CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases. In this review, 1103 papers were screened, and 38 were included as applications of TM in psychiatric research. Using TM and content analysis, we identified four major areas of application: (1) Psychopathology (i.e. observational studies focusing on mental illnesses) (2) the Patient perspective (i.e. patients' thoughts and opinions), (3) Medical records (i.e. safety issues, quality of care and description of treatments), and (4) Medical literature (i.e. identification of new scientific information in the literature). The information sources were qualitative studies, Internet postings, medical records and biomedical literature. Our work demonstrates that TM can contribute to complex research tasks in psychiatry. We discuss the benefits, limits, and further applications of this tool in the future.

Putative mechanisms include heritable genetic factors, de novo mutations, and epigenetic mechanisms. Few studies have explored phenotypic features associated with APA. The Genomic Psychiatry Cohort established a clinically characterized repository of genomic samples from subjects with a Sz-BP diagnosis or unaffected controls, 12,975 with parental age information. We estimated relative risk ratios for Sz, schizoaffective depressed and bipolar types (SA-D, SA-B), and BP with and without history of psychotic features (PF) relative to the control group, comparing each paternal age group to the reference group 20-24 years. All tests were two-sided with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Subjects with fathers age 45+ had significantly higher risk for all diagnoses except for BP w/o PF. APA also bore no significant relation to family psychiatric history. In conclusion, we replicated APA as a risk factor for Sz. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of APA in a BP sample stratified by psychosis history, extending this association only in BP w/PF. This suggests that phenotypic expression of the APA effect in Sz-BP spectrum is psychosis, per se, rather than other aspects of these complex disorders. The lack of a significant relationship between paternal age and familial disease patterns suggests that underlying mechanisms of the paternal age effect may involve a complex interaction of heritable and non-heritable factors.

We hypothesized that PTSD in adolescents exposed to a single sexual trauma may function as a chronic stressor leading to HPA-axis dysregulation.\nThe objective of this study was to assess dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) and cortisol levels in female adolescents |with single sexual trauma-related PTSD compared to healthy controls.\nWe assessed 20 female adolescent (age 12-18) single sexual trauma victims with PTSD from the Ondokuz Mayis University Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry between December 2013 and December 2014. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Child Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index (CPSRI). Blood cortisol and DHEA-S were measured in 20 female adolescent sexual abuse victims with PTSD and 20 healthy adolescents after 12-h fasting using the chemiluminescence method.\nCompared to age-matched controls, female adolescent sexual abuse victims with PTSD had significantly lower DHEA-S levels (U = 70.00, Z = - 3.517, p = 0.01, r = 0.55). There was also a significant negative correlation between DHEA-S and CDI scores (Spearman r = - 0.522, p < 0.01).\nDecreased DHEA-S levels and correlation with depressive symptoms are evidence for a dysregulated HPA-axis in female adolescent single sexual trauma victims with PTSD.

By using a previously used reliable approach, we explored the frequency and extent of brain pathology in a large group of institutionalized offenders who had not previously been considered to be suffering from structural brain damage and compare it to healthy, non-offending subjects. MRI and CT brain scans from 148 male inpatients of a high-security mental health institution (offense type: 51 sex, 80 violent, 9 arson, and 8 nonviolent) that were obtained due to headache, vertigo, or psychological complaints during imprisonment were assessed and compared to 52 non-criminal healthy controls. Brain scans were assessed qualitatively with respect to evidence of structural brain damage. Each case received a semiquantitative rating of \"normal\" (=0), \"questionably abnormal\" (=1), or \"definitely abnormal\" (=2) for the lateral ventricles, frontal/parietal cortex, and medial temporal structures bilaterally as well as third ventricle. Forensic inpatients displayed signs of brain damage to a significantly higher degree than healthy controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Even after adjustment for age, in the patients, being younger than the controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), every offender type group displayed a higher proportion of subjects with brain regions categorized as definitely abnormal than the non-criminal controls. Within the forensic inpatients, offense type groups did not significantly differ in brain pathology. The astonishingly high prevalence of brain pathology in institutionalized inmates of a high-security mental health institution who previously had not been considered to be suffering from an organic brain syndrome raises questions on whether such neuroradiological assessment might be considered as a routine procedure in newly admitted patients. Furthermore, it highlights that organic changes, detectable under clinical routine conditions, may play a role in the development of legally relevant behavioral disturbances which might be underestimated."}, {"Title": "Application and implications of Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) certificate use in acute generalist settings.", "Abstract": "Objective This retrospective study aimed to explore the appropriate application and implications of Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) (MHA) certificate use in a metropolitan generalist hospital in New South Wales. Methods A de-identified MHA certificate review was undertaken within acute generalist medical and surgical specialties between June 2012 and May 2013. To assess differences, data were separated into two categories according to whether certificates were completed by psychiatry trainees or generalist medical officers. Analysis of indications for detention was also undertaken and qualitatively matched against legislative criteria. Results A total of 43 MHA certificates were included in the review, which highlighted missing elements in most certificates. Differences were found when professional consensus by the researchers was used to match documentation to legislative criteria. The researchers disagreed with nine of the 16 indications (mental illness/mental disorder) by the generalist medical officers and only one indication by a psychiatry trainee. Six of the certificates appeared to be related to lack of capacity and need for treatment of medical conditions, thus more related to Guardianship Act 1987 (NSW) applications. Conclusion This study highlights inconsistencies in legislative knowledge and requirements between professional groups. Education and training opportunities have been identified to ensure greater consistency in application of the MHA, preservation of patient rights and avoidance of stigma. MHA use in this setting should be exercised with caution and by appropriately trained individuals. What is known about the topic? The MHA and its state and territory counterparts provide for the treatment, care and support of people who have a mental illness and the protection of a person's rights therein. Despite not being intended for application in generalist facilities, mental health legislation is widely used in generalist facilities and certificates are completed by generalist health professionals with limited training in this area of practice. What does this paper add? This study adds to the limited body of knowledge in relation to MHA detention in acute generalist facilities. Disparate preparation of medical officers in the use of this legislation has been identified, which has potential wider implications for patients beyond immediate care. What are the implications for practitioners? Inadequate attention to correct completion of MHA certificates and associated documentation could potentially invalidate detention, leaving healthcare professionals and institutions open to litigious claims that restrictive or coercive practices subsequent to the certificate's completion were technically unlawful. Further, detention under the MHA, albeit temporarily, has potential human rights issues attached and wrongful detention could lead to longstanding issues relating to stigma."}, {"Title": "Managing Stigma Effectively: What Social Psychology and Social Neuroscience Can Teach Us.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric education is confronted with three barriers to managing stigma associated with mental health treatment. First, there are limited evidence-based practices for stigma reduction, and interventions to deal with stigma against mental health care providers are especially lacking. Second, there is a scarcity of training models for mental health professionals on how to reduce stigma in clinical services. Third, there is a lack of conceptual models for neuroscience approaches to stigma reduction, which are a requirement for high-tier competency in the ACGME Milestones for Psychiatry. The George Washington University (GWU) psychiatry residency program has developed an eight-week course on managing stigma that is based on social psychology and social neuroscience research. The course draws upon social neuroscience research demonstrating that stigma is a normal function of normal brains resulting from evolutionary processes in human group behavior. Based on these processes, stigma can be categorized according to different threats that include peril stigma, disruption stigma, empathy fatigue, moral stigma, and courtesy stigma. Grounded in social neuroscience mechanisms, residents are taught to develop interventions to manage stigma. Case examples illustrate application to common clinical challenges: (1) helping patients anticipate and manage stigma encountered in the family, community, or workplace; (2) ameliorating internalized stigma among patients; (3) conducting effective treatment from a stigmatized position due to prejudice from medical colleagues or patients' family members; and (4) facilitating patient treatment plans when stigma precludes engagement with mental health professionals. This curriculum addresses the need for educating trainees to manage stigma in clinical settings. Future studies are needed to evaluate changes in clinical practices and patient outcomes as a result of social neuroscience-based training on managing stigma."}, {"Title": "[MVT - A Multiprofessional Behavioural Therapy Program for Inpatient Treatment of Depression in Old Age].", "Abstract": "Depression in old age is common but patients are rarely treated in specialized units implementing a psychotherapeutic treatment approach.\nA multiprofessional behavioral therapy program (MVT) for inpatient treatment of depressive elderlies was conceptualized, implemented and evaluated at a specialized unit of a hospital for psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nPreliminary analyses indicated that various behavioral group interventions were well accepted by patients.\nThe implementation of a psychotherapeutic therapy program specifically designed for depressed elderly inpatients is feasible and could be more broadly applied to improve clinical practice for this patient group."}, {"Title": "Anxiety among older psychiatric patients: a hidden comorbidity?", "Abstract": "Our aims were to explore prevalence of anxiety among patients admitted to departments of geriatric psychiatry for treatment of various diagnoses and to examine how often anxiety was registered as a previous or ongoing diagnosis.\nIn all, 473 patients admitted to one of five departments of geriatric psychiatry were included in a quality register and examined according to a standardized protocol.

In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods."}, {"Title": "Agreement between physicians and liaison psychiatrists on depression in old age patients of a general hospital: influence of symptom severity, age and personality.", "Abstract": "Comorbid depressive episodes are common among general hospital inpatients.

The aim of the study was first to determine the degree of agreement between primary care physicians' and liaison psychiatrists' evaluation of depression, and second, to analyze how patients' clinical presentation and personality traits influence this degree of agreement.\nAgreement was defined as the matching of the physicians' initial referral for depressive mood and the actual diagnosis of a major depressive disorder evaluated by the consultation-liaison service in 148 inpatients aged 60+ years. Nature and severity of psychiatric symptoms were rated on the HoNOS65+ scale and patients' personality traits were assessed with the Big Five Inventory.\nForty percent of the patients referred for depressive mood were indeed diagnosed with major depression. Agreement between physicians and psychiatrists was most likely in patients with more severe depressive symptoms and younger age. In contrast, risk for non-agreement was increased for patients with more open personalities, yet lower levels of neuroticism, who were referred for depressive mood even though they presented another or even no psychiatric disorder.\nThese data reveal that the detection of late-life depression in general hospitals may be critically influenced by age, symptoms severity and personality traits."}, {"Title": "Translating Neurogenomics Into New Medicines.", "Abstract": "Brain disorders remain one of the defining challenges of modern medicine and among the most poorly served with new therapeutics.

But does this reflect a broader dimensional relationship within the general population? A clearer understanding of this relationship might inform improvements in mental health service provision. However, ascertainment and referral bias means that there is limited value in conducting further research with clinically referred samples. We, therefore, conducted a cross-sectional population-based study investigating children's manual coordination using an objective computerised test. These measures were related to teacher-completed responses on a behavioural screening questionnaire [the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. We sampled 298 children (4-11 years old; 136 males) recruited from the general population. Hierarchical (logistic and linear) regression modelling indicated significant categorical and continuous relationships between manual coordination and overall SDQ score (a dimensional measure of psychopathology). Even after controlling for gender and age, manual coordination explained 15 % of the variance in total SDQ score. This dropped to 9 % after exclusion of participants whose SDQ responses indicated potential mental health problems. These results: (1) indicate that there is a clear relationship between children's motor and mental health development in community-based samples; (2) demonstrate the relationship's dimensional nature; and (3) have implications for service provision."}, {"Title": "\"A world crazier than us\": Vanishing social contexts and the consequences for psychiatric practice in contemporary Romania.", "Abstract": "Since the end of Communism, mental health care in Romania has increasingly sought to align its practices with idealized models of Western psychiatric practice. Much of this realignment has been made possible by accessing and integrating new pharmaceuticals into psychiatric hospital settings. Less straightforward have been the painful attempts to create a system modeled on international standards for training and certifying psychotherapists. Unfortunately, the political, economic, infrastructural, and epistemological environment of the Romanian mental health care system has prevented many other reforms. This paper examines the ironic trajectory that Romanian psychiatry has taken since the end of state socialism. Specifically, this paper shows how psychiatric practice in most places (outside of university-training hospitals) is increasingly disconnected from a concern with the social conditions that surround mental illness during a period when social upheaval is profoundly impacting the lives of many people who receive mental health care. Thus, as the contribution of social problems to the suffering of those with mental illnesses has increased, some Romanian mental health practitioners have moved away from a concern with these social problems under the guise of aligning their psychiatric practices with (imagined) Western standards of biomedical care. The paper provides a brief history of Romanian psychiatry and explores contemporary challenges and contradictions in many Romanian psychiatric treatment settings through the case study of a 31-year-old Romanian female diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Homicide committed by psychiatric patients: Psychiatrists' liability in Italian law cases.", "Abstract": "Interest in psychiatrists' professional liability in Italy has increased in recent years because of the number of medical malpractice claims.

If the assumptions used to derive the prevalence estimate are invalid or if the uncertainty surrounding these assumptions is not properly accounted for in the statistical inference procedure, then the point estimate may be inaccurate and the confidence interval may not be a true reflection of the precision of the estimate. We examine these potential pitfalls in the context of a recent high-profile finding by Kim et al. (2011, Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in a total population sample. American Journal of Psychiatry 168: 904-912), who estimated that autism spectrum disorder affects 2.64% of children in a South Korean community. We reconstructed the study's methodology and used Monte Carlo simulations to analyze whether their point estimate and 95% confidence interval (1.91%, 3.37%) were reasonable, given what was known about their screening instrument and sample. We find the original point estimate to be highly assumption-dependent, and after accounting for sources of uncertainty unaccounted for in the original article, we demonstrate that a more reasonable confidence interval would be approximately twice as large as originally reported. We argue that future studies should give serious consideration to the additional sources of uncertainty introduced by a two-phase design, which may easily outstrip any expected gains in efficiency."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry Resident Quality of Life.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate psychiatry resident physician quality of life.\nA voluntary, anonymous, 10-min survey was e-mailed to residents from all 14 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.

We selected a random sample of 40 pieces and performed a qualitative analysis to identify the prominent ideas and themes in this sample.\nMedical students found their experience attending an AA meeting to be educationally valuable. They reported their familiarity with AA prior to this experience was largely limited to popular media depictions. Students reported understanding alcoholism as a disease with both biological and psychosocial components. They were often concerned with the presence of religiosity and spirituality at the meetings. Following the experience, students felt more comfortable referring patients to AA and identified empathy, honesty, and openness as crucial contributors to the efficacy of AA.\nStudents felt that attending an AA meeting during their psychiatry clerkship was an educationally valuable experience. Medical students' familiarity with addiction treatment is limited, and attending an AA meeting may be helpful in increasing their comfort with treating addicted patients in the future. In addition, educators may want to explicitly address the spirituality issue related to some treatment programs to increase the likelihood that future physicians feel comfortable referring their patients to recovery programs."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of a National Online Educational Program in Geriatric Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This study provides evaluation results of an online study group (OSG) for geriatric psychiatry continuing professional development.\nThe OSG is an interactive, expert-facilitated, asynchronous educational experience for psychiatrists and residents in Canada. A retrospective web survey assessed self-efficacy, knowledge in geriatric psychiatry, comfort with online learning, and perceived effectiveness of the instructional methods. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and descriptive statistics were calculated.\nTwenty-nine (of 50) participants (58\u00a0%) completed the questionnaire. Although only 48\u00a0% of respondents reported improved perceived knowledge, 79\u00a0% reported improved efficacy beliefs, and 76\u00a0% reported improved comfort with online learning. Most (79\u00a0%) would consider taking OSG again, and 93\u00a0% would recommend it to others.\nThe OSG was well-received, with greater benefits for self-efficacy with the material and comfort with online learning than for perceived knowledge itself.

The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of Japanese child and adolescent psychiatrists with off-label prescribing to children and/or adolescents (hereafter referred to as \"children\") and to identify the factors associated with these experiences.\nA prospective questionnaire was sent to 1628 psychiatrists belonging to the Japanese Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether demographic characteristics or categories of psychotropic medications were able to independently predict patient refusals of off-label prescribing.\nThe final sample included 447 psychiatrists, and 93% of the respondents (416/447) had experiences with off-label prescribing to children. In addition, 39.7% of the respondents (165/416) experienced patient refusal of off-label prescribing when they informed the children and/or parents of the prescribing. The most commonly prescribed off-label psychotropic medications were antipsychotics (82.0%). Patient refusal was significantly more frequent when the respondents informed parents (p=0.02) and children (p<0.01) about off-label prescribing than when they did not. A stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that informing parents (odds ratio [OR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-6.82) or children (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.12-2.58) about off-label prescribing and antidepressant use (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.25-7.10) increased the odds of patient refusal of off-label prescribing; however, prescribers' years in practice decreased the odds (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1).\nOff-label prescribing of psychotropic medications is common among child and adolescent psychiatrists in Japan. Furthermore, the psychiatrists' experiences with patient refusal of off-label prescribing were significantly associated with informing the parents/patients about off-label prescribing, particularly with regard to use of antidepressants. Further studies are required to support the development of decision making among clinicians."}, {"Title": "Severe Intellectual Disability: Systematic Review of the Prevalence and Nature of Presentation of Unipolar Depression.", "Abstract": "The diagnosis of depression in severe and profound intellectual disability is challenging. Without adequate skills in verbal self-expression, standardized diagnostic criteria cannot be used with confidence. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the assessment and diagnosis of unipolar depression in severe and profound intellectual disability. The review aimed to examine the methods used to assess for depression. The secondary aim was to explore the frequency and symptoms of depression.\nThe PRISMA (2009) Checklist for systematic review was followed, and a search of electronic databases was undertaken. Nine studies were included in the qualitative synthesis from over 2000 records identified.\nThe quality of the studies was assessed and scored, with a wide range of results. Individual studies scored between 2 and 7 of a maximum possible score of 8. The diagnostic tools utilized by each of the studies were assessed and compared.\nIn terms of the methods used to assess for depression, results were varied. This was due to the heterogeneous nature of the individual study designs. The Aberrant Behaviour Checklist consistently showed promise, in particular when combined with other instruments or clinical examination. Qualitative analysis of the selected studies has shown a wide variation in the quality of primary research in this field, with more required to make firm conclusions regarding the diagnosis, frequency and presentation of depression in severe and profound intellectual disability."}, {"Title": "Research Review: Use of EEG biomarkers in child psychiatry research - current state and future directions.", "Abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) and related measures have a long and productive history in child psychopathology research and are currently experiencing a renaissance in interest, particularly for use as putative biomarkers.\nFirst, the recent history leading to the use of EEG measures as endophenotypes and biomarkers for disease and treatment response are reviewed. Two key controversies within the area of noninvasive human electrophysiology research are discussed, and problems that currently either function as barriers or provide gateways to progress. First, the differences between the main types of EEG measurements (event-related potentials, quantitative EEG, and time-frequency measures) and how they can contribute collectively to better understanding of cortical dynamics underlying cognition and behavior are highlighted. Second, we focus on the ongoing shift in analytic focus to specific cortical sources and source networks whose dynamics are relevant to the clinical and experimental focus of the study, and the effective increase in source signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that may be obtained in the process.\nUnderstanding of these issues informs any discussion of current trends in EEG research. We highlight possible ways to evolve our understanding of brain dynamics beyond the apparent contradictions in understanding and modeling EEG activity highlighted by these controversies.

Typically observed in a therapeutic trial, the placebo effect may have a major influence on the effectiveness of rTMS. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the magnitude of the placebo effect observed in controlled studies of rTMS treatment of AVH, and to determine factors that can impact the magnitude of this placebo effect, such as study design considerations and the type of sham used.The study included twenty-one articles concerning 303 patients treated by sham rTMS. A meta-analytic method was applied to obtain a combined, weighted effect size, Hedges's g. The mean weighted effect size of the placebo effect across these 21 studies was 0.29 (P < .001). Comparison of the parallel and crossover studies revealed distinct results for each study design; placebo has a significant effect size in the 13 parallel studies (g = 0.44, P < 10(-4)), but not in the 8 crossover studies (g = 0.06, P = .52). In meta-analysis of the 13 parallel studies, the 45\u00b0 position coil showed the highest effect size. Our results demonstrate that placebo effect should be considered a major source of bias in the assessment of rTMS efficacy. These results fundamentally inform the design of further controlled studies, particularly with respect to studies of rTMS treatment in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Collaborative Depression Care in a Safety Net Medical Home: Facilitators and Barriers to Quality Improvement.", "Abstract": "Little is known about how to integrate primary care with mental/behavioral services outside of clinical trials.

The model focused on universal screening for symptoms, risk stratification based on symptom severity, care management for intensive follow-up, and psychiatry consultation. CCM increased rates of primary care physician encounters, timely follow-up for monitoring symptoms of depression, and documentation of treatment response.

In the interest of 'force protection' and optimising operations, a key component of UN PKOs is healthcare and medical treatment. The expectation is that UN PKO medical support will conform to the general intent and structure of UN PKOs. To do so requires effective policies and planning informed by a review of medical aspects crucial to UN PKOs. The intent of this article is to report on a review of principal medical aspects practical to post-Cold War UN PKOs.\nThis review was assembled through a comprehensive, grounded, systematic iterative inquiry of open-source articles.\nThis inquiry revealed that the principal medical aspects in post-Cold War UN missions were the following: (1) the changed nature of UN PKOs, (2) new challenges in terms of proximity and distance to medical care, (3) expanded need for preventive medicine and disease contagion prevention and (4) increased propensity for psychological morbidity and need for intervention.\nPost Cold War, the dramatically changed nature of UN PKOs has resulted in new challenges mainly in terms of medical logistics, preventive medicine and psychiatry. The changed nature of post-Cold War UN PKOs altered the character of medical support most notably regarding (1) a need for emphasis on immediate response proximate to medical events and rapid transport over long distances and traversing barriers to higher levels of care, (2) proactive contagion and hazard identification and prevention and (3) interventions designed to reduce psychological morbidity. Recommendations are offered about possible courses of action in terms of addressing trends found in identified medical aspects of PKOs."}, {"Title": "The Putative Role of Viruses, Bacteria, and Chronic Fungal Biotoxin Exposure in the Genesis of Intractable Fatigue Accompanied by Cognitive and Physical Disability.", "Abstract": "Patients who present with severe intractable apparently idiopathic fatigue accompanied by profound physical and or cognitive disability present a significant therapeutic challenge. The effect of psychological counseling is limited, with significant but very slight improvements in psychometric measures of fatigue and disability but no improvement on scientific measures of physical impairment compared to controls. Similarly, exercise regimes either produce significant, but practically unimportant, benefit or provoke symptom exacerbation. Many such patients are afforded the exclusionary, non-specific diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome if rudimentary testing fails to discover the cause of their symptoms. More sophisticated investigations often reveal the presence of a range of pathogens capable of establishing life-long infections with sophisticated immune evasion strategies, including Parvoviruses, HHV6, variants of Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma, and Borrelia burgdorferi. Other patients have a history of chronic fungal or other biotoxin exposure. Herein, we explain the epigenetic factors that may render such individuals susceptible to the chronic pathology induced by such agents, how such agents induce pathology, and, indeed, how such pathology can persist and even amplify even when infections have cleared or when biotoxin exposure has ceased. The presence of active, reactivated, or even latent Herpes virus could be a potential source of intractable fatigue accompanied by profound physical and or cognitive disability in some patients, and the same may be true of persistent Parvovirus B12 and mycoplasma infection. A history of chronic mold exposure is a feasible explanation for such symptoms, as is the presence of B. burgdorferi. The complex tropism, life cycles, genetic variability, and low titer of many of these pathogens makes their detection in blood a challenge. Examination of lymphoid tissue or CSF in such circumstances may be warranted."}, {"Title": "The Educational Impact of Exposure to Clinical Psychiatry Early in an Undergraduate Medical Curriculum.", "Abstract": "The medical school at Swansea University provides compulsory early exposure to clinical education through short learning opportunities in the clinical setting (LOCS). These are 3-4-h sessions chosen by students from a list of over 900. Students are required to complete ten LOCS in each of their first 2 years of medical school, with at least one per year being in psychiatry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the educational experience of students undertaking LOCS in psychiatry, in part to understand whether this experience affects student understanding of psychiatry and the likelihood that they will pursue it as a career.\nA mixed methods approach was used. Qualitative focus group discussions were conducted with medical students to explore perceptions of psychiatry and experiences of psychiatry LOCS. Findings informed the development of a structured quantitative survey aimed at a larger sample of students.\nSix qualitative themes emerged: (1) limited exposure to psychiatry, (2) organizational issues, (3) positive LOCS experiences, (4) stigma, (5) anticipated emotional burden, (6) psychiatry at odds with current understanding of medicine. Questionnaire data showed that psychiatry is not a popular future career choice when compared to other specialties. Psychiatry LOCS are extremely popular with students and have a positive effect on their understanding of the specialty but did little to influence their stated likelihood of pursuing psychiatry as a career.\nEarly exposure to clinical psychiatry through LOCS gives students positive experiences, which improve understanding and awareness of psychiatry. They do not, however, affect stated career intentions for psychiatry as a profession."}, {"Title": "From culture to symptom: Testing a structural model of \"Chinese somatization\".", "Abstract": "\"Chinese somatization\" has been frequently discussed over the past three decades of cultural psychiatry, and has more recently been demonstrated in cross-national comparisons. Empirical studies of potential explanations are lacking, however. Ryder and Chentsova-Dutton (2012) proposed that Chinese somatization can be understood as a cultural script for depression, noting that the literature is divided on whether this script primarily involves felt bodily experience or a stigma-avoiding communication strategy. Two samples from Hunan province, China-one of undergraduate students (n = 213) and one of depressed psychiatric outpatients (n\u2009=\u2009281)-completed the same set of self-report questionnaires, including a somatization questionnaire developed in Chinese. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that Chinese somatization could be understood as two correlated factors: one focusing on the experience and expression of distress, the other on its conceptualization and communication. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that traditional Chinese cultural values are associated with both of these factors, but only bodily experience is associated with somatic depressive symptoms. This study takes a first step towards directly evaluating explanations for Chinese somatization, pointing the way to future multimethod investigations of this cultural script."}, {"Title": "International military operations and mental health--A review.", "Abstract": "Volunteering in international military missions has been scrutinized for its effects on mental health.

FD is usually classified as a mental disorder involving deliberate and hidden feigning or inducement of illness, in order to achieve patient status. Both the nature of the disorder and the approach to treatment are controversial and under-researched. It is argued that FD should be classified as a mental disorder; may well expose the patient to extreme risk; can warrant paternalistic interventions, in order to fulfil duty of care. Moreover, treatment of FD is inherently paternalistic and therefore raises interesting questions about justifications and type of paternalistic interventions in psychiatry both for FD and in general. A brief account of key questions concerning psychiatry and paternalism is followed by some case histories of FD, the clinical dilemmas posed and the question of how this disorder might warrant paternalistic interventions. In order to answer this question, two things are considered: the legitimacy and character of FD as a mental disorder; possible frameworks for and types of paternalistic interventions. To conclude, it is argued that there are no compelling reasons for rejecting the use of paternalistic interventions for FD, but that further investigation of FD and type and frameworks for psychiatric paternalism, in relation to FD and other mental disorders, are urgently needed."}, {"Title": "Correspondence of DNA Methylation Between Blood and Brain Tissue and Its Application to Schizophrenia Research.", "Abstract": "Given the difficulty of procuring human brain tissue, a key question in molecular psychiatry concerns the extent to which epigenetic signatures measured in more accessible tissues such as blood can serve as a surrogate marker for the brain. Here, we aimed (1) to investigate the blood-brain correspondence of DNA methylation using a within-subject design and (2) to identify changes in DNA methylation of brain-related biological pathways in schizophrenia.We obtained paired blood and temporal lobe biopsy samples simultaneously from 12 epilepsy patients during neurosurgical treatment. Using the Infinium 450K methylation array we calculated similarity of blood and brain DNA methylation for each individual separately. We applied our findings by performing gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) of peripheral blood DNA methylation data (Infinium 27K) of 111 schizophrenia patients and 122 healthy controls and included only Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites that were significantly correlated across tissues.Only 7.9% of CpG sites showed a statistically significant, large correlation between blood and brain tissue, a proportion that although small was significantly greater than predicted by chance. GSEA analysis of schizophrenia data revealed altered methylation profiles in pathways related to precursor metabolites and signaling peptides.Our findings indicate that most DNA methylation markers in peripheral blood do not reliably predict brain DNA methylation status. However, a subset of peripheral data may proxy methylation status of brain tissue. Restricting the analysis to these markers can identify meaningful epigenetic differences in schizophrenia and potentially other brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Evaluating a new model of nurse-led emergency department mental health care in Australia; perspectives of key informants.", "Abstract": "Mental health nurse services have existed in Emergency Departments (ED) for many years.

This paper presents the qualitative component from the evaluation.\nThe new service was met with high levels of approval by patients and staff. MHLN team members were challenged by their new role but considered the service reduced waiting times, provided therapeutic benefits, and enhanced communication and support for emergency staff.\nA nurse practitioner-led extended hours MHLN service embedded within the ED team structure provides prompt and effective access to specialised mental health care for people with 'undifferentiated health problems' and removes a significant workload from nursing and medical staff."}, {"Title": "Longitudinal studies: An essential component for complex psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Most psychiatric syndromes are chronic and lifetime in course. Kraepelin's seminal work pointed out a century ago that longitudinal/lifetime assessments were powerful aids in differentiating dementia praecox from manic-depressive disorder. Despite this, clinical research investigations in psychiatry have historically emphasized short-term and cross-sectional approaches. This review of an array of longitudinal studies supports that they are arguably an essential component of psychiatric investigations, but that they must be coupled with other approaches. The use of standardized, validated, repeated assessments in a disease over the course of time must be incorporated with pathophysiology investigations to identify underlying mechanisms, biomarker studies, comparative effectiveness clinical trials to identify the best treatments for different causes, and translational strategies to provide the right treatments to the right patients at the right time. Strategies for incorporating longitudinal assessments into newer diagnostic proposals, such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), are discussed."}, {"Title": "Career Development Institute with Enhanced Mentoring: A Revisit.", "Abstract": "The need for innovative methods to promote training, advancement, and retention of clinical and translational investigators in order to build a pipeline of trainees to focus on mental health-relevant research careers is pressing. The specific aim of the Career Development Institute for Psychiatry is to provide the necessary skill set and support to a nationally selected broad-based group of young psychiatrists and PhD researchers to launch and maintain successful research careers in academic psychiatry. The program targets such career skills as writing, negotiating, time management, juggling multiple demanding responsibilities, networking, project management, responsible conduct of research, and career goal setting. The current program builds on the previous program by adding a longitudinal, long-distance, virtual mentoring, and training program, seen as integral components to sustaining these career skills.\nCareer development activities occur in four phases over a 24-month period for each annual class of up to 18 participants: online baseline career and skills self-assessment and goal setting, preparations for 4-day in-person workshop, long-distance structured mentoring and online continued learning, peer-mentoring activities, and post-program career progress and process evaluation. Program instructors and mentors consist of faculty from the University of Pittsburgh and Stanford University as well as successful past program graduates from other universities as peer mentors. A comprehensive website facilitates long-distance activities to occur online. Continued training occurs via webinars every other month by experts discussing topics selected for the needs of each particular class. Personally assigned mentors meet individually bimonthly with participants via a secure web-based \"mentor center\" that allows mentor dyads to collaborate, share, review, and discuss career goals and research activities.\nPreliminary results after the first 24 months are favorable. Almost uniformly, participants felt the program was very helpful. They had regular contact with their long-distance mentor at least every 2\u00a0months over the 2-year period. At the end of the 2-year period, the majority of participants had full-time faculty appointments with K-award support and very few were doing primarily clinical work.\nThe longitudinal program of education, training, mentoring, peer support, and communications for individuals making the transition to academic research should increase the number of scientists committed to research careers in mental health."}, {"Title": "Training Psychiatry Addiction Fellows in Acupuncture.", "Abstract": "Acupuncture has been studied as an adjunct for addiction treatments.

While underlying mechanisms are still incompletely understood, several lines of evidence suggest a relevant functional overlap with retinoic acid (RA), a highly potent small molecule exhibiting a great variety of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in the adult central nervous system (CNS). RA homeostasis in the adult CNS is tightly controlled through local RA synthesis and cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated inactivation of RA. Here, we hypothesized that minocycline may directly affect RA homeostasis in the CNS via altering local RA degradation.\nWe used in vitro RA metabolism assays with metabolically competent synaptosomal preparations from murine brain and human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells as well as viable human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell cultures.\nWe revealed that minocycline potently blocks RA degradation as measured by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and in a viable RA reporter cell line, even at low micromolar levels of minocycline.\nOur findings provide evidence for enhanced RA signalling to be involved in minocycline's pleiotropic mode of action in the CNS.

We prospectively recruited participants with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) diagnosis of schizophrenia presenting to the Clinic for Psychiatry during a 2-year period. We used the Modified Overt Aggression Scale to assess the aggression and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to assess the clinical characteristics of participants. One out of three patients with schizophrenia (31%) was aggressive and hostile at the time of presentation. Socio-demographic variables (such as gender, age, duration of illness, and number of hospitalizations) were poor predictors of aggression for schizophrenic patients. The level of aggression was not associated with the clinical characteristics in aggressive and hostile hospitalized schizophrenic patients. However, there was a weak negative association between the level of aggression and the PANSS Negative Scale ( p < .01).

To this end, it adopts a qualitative method of study based on the administration of ad hoc interviews to intercultural couples who consulted our Child Neuropsychiatry Service because of language disorders in their children. One of the main consequences, when the child of an intercultural couple presents a language disorder and a diagnostic process has to be initiated, may be interruption of the transmission of the second language, especially if it is the mother's language. The decision to do this, which may be taken on the advice of teachers and health professionals, but also because the parents themselves often attribute their child's language disorder to his bilingual condition, affects not only the relationship between the mother and her child, but also processes in the construction of parenthood and in the structuring of the child's personality and the plurality of his affiliations.

Participants' memory for the pairs was then tested while listening to either the same or different music. Participants also made subjective ratings about how distracting they found each song to be.\nDespite the fact that all participants rated music as more distracting to their performance than silence, only older adults' associative memory performance was impaired by music. These results are most consistent with the theory that older adults' failure to inhibit processing of distracting task-irrelevant information, in this case background music, contributes to their memory impairments.\nThese data have important practical implications for older adults' ability to perform cognitively demanding tasks even in what many consider to be an unobtrusive environment."}, {"Title": "Experiences of Patients in Acute and Closed Psychiatric Wards: A Systematic Review.", "Abstract": "To obtain insight into the patients' experiences during treatment in an acute, closed psychiatric ward.\nA systematic literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane.\nTen articles were selected.

The out-of-hours setting offers specific challenges, and trainees are expected to cope despite being underprepared. We hyphothesised that simulation-based training would increase trainees' competence and confidence in approaching high-risk out-of-hours scenarios.\nA pilot study focused upon the first cohort of psychiatry trainees joining the North East London NHS Foundation Trust in 2012. During their induction (and prior to any clinical duties) each trainee took part in five high-risk clinical scenarios, assessed by a senior psychiatrist and service-user representative. The trainees were required to complete a survey exploring their confidence across nine core psychiatric clinical domains, both before and after the simulation training.\nThe simulation training increased trainee confidence in all nine clinical domains. Before the simulation training, over half of the nine trainees self-rated themselves as having 'no confidence' in six of the nine clinical competencies. After the training, confidence levels had significantly increased, with only two of the competencies scoring any 'no confidence' ratings. There were mixed feelings by trainees on the use of service-user representatives in the training of doctors. Junior doctors have limited experience in psychiatry before starting their training placements\nWe found that high-fidelity simulation training is a useful tool to prepare junior trainees in psychiatry to familiarise themselves with some of the high-risk scenarios that they are likely to encounter during out-of-hour on-call duties. We showed that this intervention increased trainees' confidence across a range of core psychiatric skills. This has significant implications in the provision of safe and effective patient care."}, {"Title": "Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are associated with psychiatric comorbidities, behavioral and clinical problems: a population-based study of Brazilian school children.", "Abstract": "Pediatric-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is underdiagnosed, and many affected children are untreated. The present study seeks to evaluate the presence and the clinical impact of OCD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in a large sample of school-age children. In Phase I, we performed an initial screening using the Family History Screen (FHS). In Phase II, we identified an \"at-risk\" sample, as well as a randomly selected group of children. A total of 2,512 children (6-12 years old) were assessed using the FHS, the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Data analyses included descriptive and multivariate analytical techniques. 2,512 children (mean age: 8.86 \u00b1 1.84 years; 55.0% male) were categorized into one of the three diagnostic groups: OCD (n = 77), OCS (n = 488), and unaffected controls (n = 1,947). There were no significant socio-demographic differences (age, gender, socioeconomic status) across groups. The OCS group resembled the OCD on overall impairment, including school problems and delinquent behaviors. However, the OCD group did have significantly higher rates of several comorbid psychiatric disorders, including separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, and major depressive disorder, than OCS or unaffected controls. Moreover, the OCD group also scored higher than the SDQ, as well as on each of CBCL items rated by the parent. Our findings suggest that there is a psychopathological continuum between OCS and OCD in school-aged children.

Data included Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ). Chi-squared test and t-test were used to compare women with men for variables with parametric distributions, and Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric distribution. Adjustments for potential confounders (age, level of education, ethnicity and comorbidites) were made by logistic regression models (for discrete variables) or analysis of covariance.\nThe female-to-male ratio (i.e., 844 women, 489 men) for any anxiety disorder was 1.73 : 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63-1.83), with the strongest skewness for post-traumatic stress disorder (2.80 : 1) and the smallest one for social phobia (1.18 : 1).

The neglected dimension of external validity.", "Abstract": "Systematic reviews have traditionally focused on internal validity, while external validity often has been overlooked. In this study, we systematically reviewed determinants of external validity in the accumulated randomized controlled trials of social skills group interventions for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. We extracted data clustered into six overarching themes: source population, included population, context, treatment provider, treatment intervention, and outcome. A total of 15 eligible randomized controlled trials were identified. The eligible population was typically limited to high-functioning school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder, and the included population was predominantly male and Caucasian. Scant information about the recruitment of participants was provided, and details about treatment providers and settings were sparse. It was not evident from the trials to what extent acquired social skills were enacted in everyday life and maintained over time. We conclude that the generalizability of the accumulated evidence is unclear and that the determinants of external validity are often inadequately reported. At this point, more effectiveness-oriented randomized controlled trials of equally high internal and external validity are needed. More attention to the determinants of external validity is warranted when this new generation of randomized controlled trials are planned and reported.

In adjusted analyses, individuals with vestibular vertigo had an eightfold increased odds of 'serious difficulty concentrating or remembering' (OR 8.3, 95% CI 4.8 to 14.6) and a fourfold increased odds of activity limitation due to difficulty remembering or confusion (OR 3.9, 95% CI 3.1 to 5.0) relative to the rest of the US adults. Individuals with vestibular vertigo also had a threefold increased odds of depression (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.9 to 3.9), anxiety (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) and panic disorder (OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.9 to 4.0).\nOur findings indicate that vestibular impairment is associated with increased risk of cognitive and psychiatric comorbidity. The vestibular system is anatomically connected with widespread regions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Loss of vestibular inputs may lead to impairment of these cognitive and affective circuits. Further longitudinal research is required to determine if these associations are causal."}, {"Title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation and neuroplasticity genes: implications for psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and well-tolerated brain stimulation technique with promising efficacy as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia and for several other psychiatric disorders. tDCS modulates neuroplasticity; psychiatric disorders are established to be associated with neuroplasticity abnormalities. This review presents the summary of research on potential genetic basis of neuroplasticity-modulation mechanism underlying tDCS and its implications for treating various psychiatric disorders.\nA systematic review highlighting the genes involved in neuroplasticity and their role in psychiatric disorders was carried out. The focus was on the established genetic findings of tDCS response relationship with BDNF and COMT gene polymorphisms.\nSynthesis of these preliminary observations suggests the potential influence of neuroplastic genes on tDCS treatment response. These include several animal models, pharmacological studies, mentally ill and healthy human subject trials.\nTaking into account the rapidly unfolding understanding of tDCS and the role of synaptic plasticity disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders, in-depth evaluation of the mechanism of action pertinent to neuroplasticity modulation with tDCS needs further systematic research. Genes such as NRG1, DISC1, as well as those linked with the glutamatergic receptor in the context of their direct role in the modulation of neuronal signalling related to neuroplasticity aberrations, are leading candidates for future research in this area. Such research studies might potentially unravel observations that might have potential translational implications in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Is death our business? Philosophical conflicts over the end-of-life in old age psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Old age psychiatrists work with end-of-life (EOL) issues and encounter patient deaths, but death and dying have received limited focus in old age psychiatry training and research. This qualitative study explores old age psychiatrists' experience of and approach to working with patients at the EOL.\nAustralian old age psychiatrists were purposively sampled and interviewed in-depth. Data saturation was achieved after nine participant interviews. Verbatim transcripts were analysed for themes, which were independently verified.\nTwo dichotomous overarching themes were identified. Death is not our business reflected participants' experience of working in a mental health framework and incorporated four themes: death should not occur in psychiatry; working in a psychiatric treatment model; keeping a distance from death and unexpected death is a negative experience. Death is our business reflected participants' experience of working in an aged care context and incorporated four themes: death is part of life; encountering the EOL through dementia care; doing EOL work and expected death is a positive experience.\nParticipants reported conflict because of the contradictory domains in which they work. They were comfortable working with patients at the EOL when death was expected, particularly in dementia. By contrast, they struggled with death as an adverse outcome in circumstances influenced by mental health culture, which was characterised by risk management, suicide prevention and a focus on recovery. This study has implications for models of care underpinning old age psychiatry. An integrated person-centred model of care may provide a contextually appropriate approach for practice."}, {"Title": "Discontinuing the Use of PRN Intramuscular Medication for Agitation in an Acute Psychiatric Hospital.", "Abstract": "This study examined the impact of eliminating intramuscular PRN medication for agitation on patient and staff safety in an acute psychiatric inpatient setting. The current retrospective chart review investigated the use of PRN medications (oral and intramuscular) to treat acute agitation, including aggression, and related outcomes before and after a mandated change in PRN practice that required real time physician input before administration of intramuscular medications. The use of both oral and intramuscular PRN medications dramatically decreased following implementation of the mandated change in practice. In particular, the use of intramuscular PRNs for agitation decreased by about half. Despite this decrease, the assault rate in the hospital was unchanged, and the utilization of restraint and seclusion continued to decrease. It is possible to reduce the utilization of PRN medications for agitation without broadly compromising safety on acute care psychiatric inpatient units."}, {"Title": "Hospital revisit rate after a diagnosis of conversion disorder.", "Abstract": "To estimate the hospital revisit rate of patients diagnosed with conversion disorder (CD).\nUsing administrative data, we identified all patients discharged from California, Florida and New York emergency departments (EDs) and acute care hospitals between 2005 and 2011 with a primary discharge diagnosis of CD. Patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of seizure or transient global amnesia (TGA) served as control groups. Our primary outcome was the rate of repeat ED visits and hospital admissions after initial presentation. Poisson regression was used to compare rates between diagnosis groups while adjusting for demographic characteristics.\nWe identified 7946 patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of CD. During a mean follow-up of 3.0 (\u00b11.6) years, patients with CD had a median of three (IQR, 1-9) ED or inpatient revisits, compared with 0 (IQR, 0-2) in patients with TGA and 3 (IQR, 1-7) in those with seizures. Revisit rates were 18.25 (95% CI, 18.10 to 18.40) visits per 100 patients per month in those with CD, 3.90 (95% CI, 3.84 to 3.95) in those with TGA and 17.78 (95% CI, 17.75 to 17.81) in those with seizures. As compared to CD, the incidence rate ratio for repeat ED visits or hospitalisations was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93) for seizure disorder and 0.32 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.34) for TGA.\nCD is associated with a substantial hospital revisit rate. Our findings suggest that CD is not an acute, time-limited response to stress, but rather that CD is a manifestation of a broader pattern of chronic neuropsychiatric disease."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of abuse in mentally ill patients visiting outpatient setting in a tertiary care hospital in India.", "Abstract": "In a developing country such as India, the abuse of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders has been underreported. The aim of this study was to detect abuse in chronically ill psychiatric patients visiting a psychiatric outpatient setting in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India.\nA cross-sectional descriptive written survey was carried out on 406 patients. A self-administered questionnaire for patient abuse was developed in Hindi based on the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire that encompassed questions regarding physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\nOf the 406 patients, 294 (72%) suffered from abuse, with 64% experiencing emotional abuse, 39% physical abuse and 21% sexual abuse. In chronically ill psychiatric patients, a significant association was found between education and abuse, with most abuse occurring among senior secondary pass outs (i.e. 11-12 years of education) and least among junior high school pass outs (6-8 years of education). A majority (74%) of these patients lived in urban areas (p\u2009=\u2009.020). A significant association was also found between abuse and the psychiatric diagnosis of the patient, with 53% suffering from depression, 66% anxiety disorder, 81% bipolar disorder, 94% psychotic disorder, 86% obsessive compulsive disorder, 44% sexual disorder and 12% other psychiatric disorders.\nThere is a need to create awareness in society in order to prevent abuse. Screening for abuse in routine psychiatric practice is of utmost importance so that timely interventions can be given, thereby preventing its deleterious health consequences."}, {"Title": "Instrumental Assessment of Bradykinesia: A Comparison Between Motor Tasks.", "Abstract": "Bradykinesia, a common symptom in psychiatry, is characterized by reduced movement speed and amplitude. Monitoring for bradykinesia is important, as it has been associated with reductions in quality of life and medication compliance. Subtle forms of bradykinesia have been associated with treatment response in antipsychotic-na\u00efve first episode patients. Therefore, accurate and reliable assessment is of clinical importance. Several mechanical and electronic instruments have been developed for this purpose. However, their content validity is limited. This study investigated which tasks, or combinations thereof, are most suitable for assessing bradykinesia instrumentally. Eleven motor tasks were assessed using inertial sensors. Their capability of distinguishing bradykinetic patients with schizophrenia ( n = 6) from healthy controls ( n = 5) was investigated. Seven tasks significantly discriminated patients from controls. The combination of tasks considered most feasible for the instrumental assessment of bradykinesia was the gait, pronation/supination, leg agility and flexion/extension of elbow tasks (effect size = 2.9)."}, {"Title": "Attitude of an Egyptian Sample of Medical Students Toward Psychiatry in Comparison to Previous Studies Using the Attitudes Towards Psychiatry (ATP-30) Questionnaire.", "Abstract": "This study aims to determine the attitude of medical students toward psychiatry at the College of Medicine, Menoufia University, Egypt, and to compare it with previous similar studies in other countries.\nFour hundred medical students, randomly selected from four different years, completed the Attitudes Towards Psychiatry (ATP-30) in a cross-sectional study.\nThe mean ATP score was 99.31; 76.3% of the students had favorable attitudes toward psychiatry and 29.5% considered psychiatry as a potential career choice.\nA generally positive attitude toward psychiatry was found among medical students in Menoufia University.

However, epidemiological and correlational studies of PLEs showed mixed findings - it is observed that different studies use a wide variety of definitions of PLEs, as well as different assessment tools that are designed to capture such described experiences. The differences in definitions and assessment tools adopted could contribute to the discrepancy of findings. The current review aims to examine the definitions and assessment tools adopted in the studies of PLEs.\nLiterature search was conducted between October 2013 and February 2014 using three search engines: Medline, Web of Science and PubMed.\nA total of 76 papers met the selection criteria and were included in the current review. It is found that the majority of papers reviewed defined PLEs quantitatively using assessment tools and do not have a specific phenomenological definition, whereas assessment tools adopted have a wide variety. Furthermore, phenomenological studies of PLEs were rare.\nThe variations in definitions and assessment tools of PLEs might contribute to mixed findings in researches. Reaching to a consensus through the study of phenomenology of PLEs is essential to further advancement of the research in this area."}, {"Title": "What Do Medical Students Perceive as Meaningful in the Psychiatry Clerkship Learning Environment? A Content Analysis of Critical Incident Narratives.", "Abstract": "In order to better understand the professional development of medical students during their psychiatry clerkship, this study identifies common themes and characteristics of students' critical incident narratives which are designed to capture a recount of clerkship experiences they perceived as meaningful.\nA total of 205 narratives submitted by psychiatry clerkship students in 2010-2011 were subjected to a thematic analysis using a methodological approach and adaptation of categories derived from prior similar research. Descriptive content analysis was also carried out to assess the valence of the narrative content, characters involved, and whether there was evidence that the experience changed students' perspectives in some way.\nNarratives contained a variety of positive (19%) and negative content (24%) and many contained a hybrid of both (57%). The most common theme (29%) concerned issues of respect and disrespect in patient, clinical, and coworker interactions. In general, the majority (68%) of students' meaningful experience narratives reflected a change in their perspective (e.g., I learned that...). Narratives containing positive and hybrid content were associated with a change in students' perspective (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u200910.61, df\u2009=\u20092, p\u2009<\u20090.005).\nMedical students are keenly aware of the learning environment. Positive and hybrid critical incident narratives were associated with a stated change in their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors due to the experience. Understanding the events that are meaningful to students can also provide rich feedback to medical educators regarding the ways in which students perceive clinical learning environments and how to best foster their professional development."}, {"Title": "The Time is Now: Improving Substance Abuse Training in Medical Schools.", "Abstract": "This commentary highlights the growing demand for substance abuse prevention and treatment, summarizes the literature regarding the current insufficiencies in substance abuse training in medical schools, and suggests strategies to address this gap in physician education. The authors describe how the combination of mandated coverage for substance abuse services and expanding treatment needs means that more physicians, regardless of their patient populations, will be faced with addressing the problem of substance use. The authors review the literature on substance abuse training in medical schools, which indicates insufficient exposure to this topic. The authors describe how current substance abuse training at medical schools is focused on transmitting scientific knowledge with relatively little education or training in attitudes and skills central to effective prevention and treatment. Given the gap between clinical need and physician education, the authors suggest several strategies for medical schools to increase training in substance abuse knowledge, attitudes, and skills, which will enhance the practice of evidence-based care. The authors posit that medical curricular reform, combined with initiatives to change clinical culture around substance abuse, will translate into improved rates of screening, shorter overall length of treatment, effective referrals for continued treatment, and increased access to care for individuals who use substances and so reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with substance use."}, {"Title": "Teaching Cultural Competence to Psychiatry Residents: Seven Core Concepts and Their Implications for Therapeutic Technique.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the Tulane Model for teaching cultural competence to psychiatry residents in order to outline an innovative approach to curricula development in academic psychiatry. The authors focus on the didactic experience that takes place during the first and second postgraduate years and present seven core concepts that should inform the emerging clinician's thinking in the formulation of every clinical case. The authors discuss the correspondence between each core concept and the Outline for Cultural Formulation, introduced in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and updated in DSM-5. The authors illustrate how each of the core concepts is utilized as a guideline for teaching residents a process for eliciting culturally relevant information from their patients and their personal histories and how to apply that knowledge in the assessment and treatment of patients in clinical settings."}, {"Title": "Psychiatrists' and Psychiatry Residents' Attitudes Toward Transgender People.", "Abstract": "Gender minority groups, such as transgender individuals, frequently encounter stigma, discrimination, and negative mental health outcomes, which can result in contact with mental health professionals. Recent studies suggest that negative attitudes toward transgender individuals are prevalent and measurable within the general population. The Genderism and Transphobia scale (GTS) measures anti-transgender feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. The purpose of this study was to use the GTS to conduct an investigation of psychiatrists' attitudes toward transgender individuals.\nA cross-sectional survey of n\u2009=\u2009142 faculty members and residents from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Manitoba was conducted. Respondents completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions and the GTS. Responses were analyzed descriptively and compared to previously published data on the GTS.\nThere was a trend for psychiatrists and psychiatry residents within this sample to endorse less negative attitudes toward transgender people compared to other published data using a sample of undergraduate students. Descriptive analyses suggest that psychiatrists' and psychiatry residents' GTS scores may be related to gender identity, political ideology, religiosity, and levels of both professional and personal contact.\nThese data evoke optimism regarding psychiatrists' and psychiatry residents' attitudes toward transgender individuals. Additional larger-scale studies comparing this medical specialty group with other specialty groups will further elucidate factors that modify physician attitudes toward this patient population. These findings may contribute to the development of educational strategies to ensure that the transgender population receives medical treatment without stigma or attitudinal compromise."}, {"Title": "Comparing the driving behaviours of individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and those with Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Assessing driving aptitude in dementia patients is critically important for both patient and public safety. However, there have been only a few reports on the driving behaviours and accident risk of patients with dementia, especially frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Therefore, we compared the characteristics of driving behaviours in patients with FTLD and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe subjects were 28 FTLD and 67 AD patients who visited the Department of Psychiatry, Kochi Medical School Hospital. We conducted semi-structured interviews with their families and caregivers about traffic accident history and changes in patient driving behaviours after dementia onset and then compared the findings between the two groups.\nOverall changes in driving behaviours were reported in 89% (25/28) and 76% (51/67) of the FTLD and AD patients, respectively (P = 0.17). In the FTLD group, difficulty in judging inter-vehicle distances, ignoring road signs and traffic signals, and distraction were reported in 50% (14/28), 61% (17/28), and 50% (14/28) of patients, respectively, and 75% (21/28) patients had caused a traffic accident after dementia onset. The risk of causing an accident was higher in the FTLD group than in the AD group (odds ratio = 10.4, 95% confidence interval = 3.7-29.1). In addition, the mean duration between dementia onset and a traffic accident was 1.35 years in the FTLD group compared with 3.0 years in the AD group (P < 0.01).\nPatients with FTLD were more likely to show dangerous driving behaviours than those with AD, and the risk of causing a traffic accident may be higher in patients with FTLD from an early disease stage."}, {"Title": "Off-label prescribing of psychotropic drugs in a Danish child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to describe the level of off-label treatment with psychotropic drugs at a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic in Denmark. We performed a cross-sectional study assessing records on patients treated with medicine at two outpatient clinics at the child and adolescent psychiatric ward, on 1 day in 2014. Prescriptions of drugs from ATC group N05-N06 were classified according to label status. Six hundred and fifteen drug prescriptions distributed on nine different drugs were prescribed to 503 children eligible for this study. Overall results showed that 170 of the 615 prescriptions were off-label, which corresponds to 27.6 %. Attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) drugs were prescribed 450 times (73.2 %) of which 11 prescriptions were off-label (2.4 %). Other psychotropic drugs comprised 165 (26.8 %) prescriptions and of these 159 (96.4 %) were off-label. With 106 prescriptions, melatonin was the most prescribed of these drugs; all prescriptions were off-label. The main reasons for classifying prescriptions as off-label were age and indication of treatment. This cross-sectional study reveals that medical treatment of children with other psychotropic drugs than ADHD drugs is usually off-label. ADHD drugs were, as the only drug group, primarily prescribed on-label. Although off-label prescription may be rational and even evidence based, the responsibility in case of, e.g. adverse drug reactions is a challenge, and clinical trials in children should be incited."}, {"Title": "Factors Influencing Medical School Graduates Toward a Career in Psychiatry: Analysis from the 2011-2013 Association of American Medical Colleges Graduation Questionnaire.", "Abstract": "Various factors influence choice of medical specialty.

Common polymorphisms have too small an effect on risk for psychiatric disorders as defined by clinical phenomenology to guide clinical practice. To identify polymorphic effects that are large and reliable enough to serve as biomarkers requires detailed analysis of a polymorphism's biology across levels of complexity from molecule to cell to circuit and behavior. Emphasis on behavioral domains rather than clinical diagnosis, as proposed in the Research Domain Criteria framework, facilitates the use of mouse models that recapitulate human polymorphisms because effects on equivalent phenotypes can be translated across species and integrated across levels of analysis. A knockin mouse model of a common polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) provides examples of how such a vertically integrated translational approach can identify robust genotype-phenotype relationships that have relevance to psychiatric practice."}, {"Title": "Effect of individualized social activities on quality of life among older adults with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in a geriatric psychiatry facility.", "Abstract": "The study examined the effect of an individualized social activities intervention (ISAI) on quality of life among older adults with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in a geriatric psychiatry facility.\nThis randomized control trial consisted of 52 older adults (M = 70.63, SD = 5.62) with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in a geriatric inpatient psychiatry facility.

Clinically, he reported seeing vivid, saturated colors and caricature-like objects. The patient described perceiving objects or people in motion as moving faster than normal. He reported living in a dream-like state and feeling numb and detached from other people and his surroundings. Upon pharmacotherapy initiation, facility transfer, and subsequent discharge from an acute psychiatry unit, he ultimately committed suicide. Although hallucinogen abuse is common in the United States, this case suggests that HPPD maybe significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated.

A total of 110 cases of SCD in relation to a stressful event such as altercation (45%), physical restraint (31%) in police custody (10%), exams/school/job stress (7.27%), receiving bad news (4%), or a car accident without injuries (2.73%) were retrospectively investigated. The majority of the subjects experiencing SCD were male (80.91%). The mean age was 36\u2009\u00b1\u200916 years (range 5-82 years). Twenty-three cases (20.91%) were psychiatric patients on antipsychotic medication.\nFifty-three per cent of cases died with a negative autopsy and a morphologically normal heart, indicating sudden adult death which is linked to cardiac channelopathies predisposing to stress-induced SCD. Cardiomyopathy was found in 16 (14.5%) patients and coronary artery pathology in 19 (17%) patients, with atherosclerosis predominating in older patients.\nThis study highlights SCD during psychological stress, mostly in young males where the sudden death occurred in the absence of structural heart disease. This may reflect the proarrhythmic potential of high catecholamines on the structurally normal heart in those genetically predisposed because of cardiac channelopathy. Structural cardiomyopathies and coronary artery disease also feature prominently. Cases of SCD associated with altercation and restraint receive mass media attention especially when police/other governmental bodies are involved. This study highlights the rare but important risk of SCD associated with psychological stress and restraint in morphologically normal hearts and the importance of an expert cardiac opinion where prolonged criminal investigations and medico-legal issues often ensue."}, {"Title": "A Thorn in the Flesh?

Members of staff identify the care of mentally disordered offenders in general psychiatric units as either \"a parking space\" or a very difficult or frightening course, where staff members tend to behave like pleasers in order to avoid risks of conflict or physical violence. Either way, it seems hard to provide sufficient mental health care.\nNationwide training and teaching as well as knowledge exchange between specialized forensic psychiatry and general psychiatry are recommended. Further exploration is needed on patient perspectives and on avenues to increase efficiency and decrease bottlenecks throughout the clinical pathways.

Excluded were those admitted directly to the intensive care unit; obstetric, psychiatry, or palliative wards; or medical day units. At admission, the main nutrition evaluation was subjective global assessment (SGA). Body mass index (BMI) and handgrip strength (HGS) were also performed to assess other aspects of nutrition. Additional information was collected from patients and charts review during hospitalization.\nOne thousand fifteen patients were enrolled: based on SGA, 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42%-48%) were malnourished, and based on BMI, 32% (95% CI, 29%-35%) were obese. Independent contributors to malnutrition at admission were Charlson comorbidity index > 2, having 3 diagnostic categories, relying on adult children for grocery shopping, and living alone. The median (range) LOS was 6 (1-117) days. After controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and disease-related factors and treatment, malnutrition at admission was independently associated with prolonged LOS (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.86). Other nutrition-related factors associated with prolonged LOS were lower HGS at admission, receiving nutrition support, and food intake < 50%.

Several well-controlled studies, along with open-label case series, have established that ketamine can have rapid antidepressant effects. Additionally, data exist showing benefits of ketamine in post-traumatic stress disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder. However, improvements in these conditions tend to be short-lived with single infusions of ketamine. Of concern, ketamine has been associated with neurotoxicity in pre-clinical rodent models and is well-known to cause psychotomimetic effects and addiction in humans. While ketamine has been proven safe for use in sub-anesthetic doses administered once or a few times, the safety profile of prolonged use has not been established. Aspects of safety, possible mechanisms of action, and future directions of ketamine research are discussed in addition to the clinical literature on its use in psychiatric conditions."}, {"Title": "Patient-provider communication over social media: perspectives of adolescents with psychiatric illness.", "Abstract": "Social media is an increasingly dominant platform for communication, especially among adolescents. Statements from professional bodies and a growing body of empirical evidence support a role for social media in improving provider-patient interactions. In psychiatry, particular concerns exist about the suitability of this style of communication. Very limited data are available exploring how patients would like to incorporate social media into their communication with their psychiatric providers.\nWe conducted a qualitative study with 20 adolescents attending the Yale Psychiatric Hospital Intensive Outpatient Programme. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.\nParticipants highlighted how social media could allow for constant access to a mental health provider, provide a less anxiety-provoking mode of communication, and allow for them to be monitored in a more on-going fashion. However, participants also identified many potential risks associated with these applications, including the potential for anxiety if a provider was not able to respond immediately, and a sense that online interactions would be less rich overall.\nOur findings suggest that adolescents are open to the idea of communicating with mental health providers over social media and are able to describe a number of instances where this could be of value. The risks participants described, as well as concerns raised by existing literature, indicate the need for further work and protocol development in order for social media to be a feasible tool for communication between providers and adolescents with psychiatric illness."}, {"Title": "Treatment approaches of palliative medicine specialists for depression in the palliative care setting: findings from a qualitative, in-depth interview study.", "Abstract": "Treatment of depression in the palliative care setting is complicated by varied treatment preferences, a small body of research, and unique challenges associated with the end-of-life. Little is known about the treatment practices of medical practitioners in this setting.\nThis study aimed to investigate and characterise the treatment approaches of palliative medicine specialists for depression.\nSemistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore explanatory models of depression from palliative medicine specialists, including a focus on treatment. Verbatim interview transcripts were analysed for themes.\nPalliative medicine specialists practising in Australia were recruited and purposively sampled. Nine participants were interviewed to reach data saturation.\nFive themes were identified in relation to treatment of depression: (1) guiding principles of treatment; (2) treatment approaches; (3) factors underpinning treatment decisions; (4) difficulties arising in treatment; and (5) interdisciplinary roles. Participants described five distinct treatment approaches, consisting of biological orientation, psychosocial orientation, combination approach, undifferentiated approach and ambivalence. Treatment decisions were contingent on patient, depression, clinician and sociocultural factors. Difficulties included discomfort with treating depression, being inadequately equipped and confronting therapeutic limitations. Treating depression was considered to require multidisciplinary team effort.\nPalliative medicine specialists' treatment approaches are linked to their concepts of and causal explanations for depression. Future treatment guidelines could aim to consider specific varieties of depression, be more differentiated in treatment modality and type, and consider decision-shaping factors.

Use of antidepressants and referrals].", "Abstract": "The majority of patients who have a first depressive episode are treated by Primary Care physicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of antidepressants and referrals to mental health and the treatment modifications made by psychiatrists.\nA descriptive, retrospective study was conducted on patients from 64 Primary Care clinics, distributed in five Spanish provinces. The clinical history data, regarding use of antidepressants, criteria for referral, and response of psychiatric services were evaluated from June 2008 to June 2011.\nThe study included 324 patients. The most commonly prescribed medication was escitalopram, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) making up 73.5% of the total. More than two-thirds (69.7%) of the patients were on treatment for at least 6 months, with no reason recorded for the 40.4% drop-outs. A large majority of professionals (76.9%) wait at least 3 weeks before modifying the medication, especially changing antidepressant. The Primary Care physicians referred 39.2% of patients to psychiatry, although much of these referrals (43.9%) had no justification. There was a lower referral rate to psychology (23.1%). An antidepressant was given to a large number of patients on multiple medications, without taking into account the risk of interactions in a high percentage.\nThe Primary Care physician appropriately uses the antidepressants of the first choice, but does not pay attention to the risks in complex patients. There must be an appropriate duration of treatment and an improvement of the criteria for referral to mental health services."}, {"Title": "Fear, danger and aggression in a Norwegian locked psychiatric ward: Dialogue and ethics of care as contributions to combating difficult situations.", "Abstract": "Fear and aggression are often reported among professionals working in locked psychiatric wards and also among the patients in the same wards.

However, there was anecdotal evidence that the ethics rounds were viewed as a positive experience and that they stimulated ethical reflection.\nThe aim of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of how the ethics rounds were experienced and why the intervention in the form of ethics rounds did not succeed in improving the ethical climate for the staff.\nAn exploratory and descriptive design with a qualitative approach was adopted, using individual interviews.\nA total of 11 healthcare personnel, working in two different psychiatry outpatient clinics and with experience of participating in ethics rounds, were interviewed.\nThe study was based on informed consent and was approved by one of the Swedish Regional Ethical Review Boards.\nThe participants were generally positive about the ethics rounds. They had experienced changes by participating in the ethics rounds in the form of being able to see things from different perspectives as well as by gaining insight into ethical issues. However, these changes had not affected daily work.\nA crucial question is whether or not increased reflection ability among the participants is a good enough outcome of ethics rounds and whether this result could have been measured in patient-related outcomes. Ethics rounds might foster cooperation among the staff and this, in turn, could influence patient care.\nBy listening to others during ethics rounds, a person can learn to see things from a new angle.

There are only a few studies on the economic added value provided by a liaison psychiatry team. In addition to this, only a few psychiatric pathologies are coded as they should be, hence we make the assumption of an additional development provided by a specialised team.\nOver a short period of 4months, in three departments of the Toulouse University Hospital Centre, the added value to the general pricing system of liaison psychiatry was studied. The population was represented by all the consecutive requests for consultations from patients over 18years old, men and women, hospitalised at that time. These three departments frequently request consultations with the psychiatry liaison team. They set a diagnostic, and if this is associated with a higher Homogeneous Group of Patients (HGP), it provides added value.\nFifty-two patients benefited from a psychiatric consultation over 4months. The results highlight a development of \u20ac\u00a08630.43 for the traumatology department, \u20ac\u00a03325.03 for the internal medicine department, and \u20ac\u00a0513.61 for the haematology department over the study period.

The changed legal bases now require the use of alternatives before applying coercion as a \"last resort\". In this study we investigated whether and which alternatives are applied by psychiatrists in order to prevent coercive measures in general psychiatric hospitals and which factors are associated with their application.\nA sample of 343 psychiatrists was recruited by contacting psychiatric hospitals throughout Germany. In an online-survey attitudes to coercive measures and the use of alternatives to coercion were assessed by self-report.\nBefore initiating their most recent coercive measures almost half (46%) of the participants employed only 2 or less alternatives. Patient related, individual and structural factors were reported as reasons for the failure of such measures. The use of alternatives was associated with a more positive assessment of their effectiveness as well as a more negative attitude towards coercive measures.\nAlternative measures are applied by many psychiatrists, but are not standard practice.

To date, no data are available on the use of caffeine citrate during ECT. This retrospective case series was done to demonstrate utilization of caffeine citrate as a substitute for caffeine and sodium benzoate in optimizing ECT.\nMedical records were reviewed to identify patients who received ECT and caffeine citrate. Physician notes were reviewed to determine the parameters of the ECT procedure, the seizure length, and the dose of caffeine citrate. Each chart was thoroughly studied to find the relationship between seizure duration and dose of caffeine citrate.\nOf the 12 ECT treatments utilizing caffeine citrate, 9 achieved at least 1 session lasting >30 seconds with an average seizure duration of 35 seconds. Increase in seizure duration ranged from -41% to 276% with an average increase of 48%. Only 3 treatment sessions utilizing caffeine citrate showed no increase in seizure duration. Doses ranged from 120 to 600 mg of both oral and parenteral caffeine citrate. Although increase in seizure duration was achieved for the majority of the ECT sessions, no dose-response correlation could be made. No significant adverse reactions were noted with the use of caffeine citrate during ECT.\nIt was determined that, much like caffeine and sodium benzoate, caffeine citrate does increase the seizure duration. However, this response did vary due to many reasons including small sample size, concomitant medications, duration of illness, and number of ECTs they received in the past and how long ago they received the last ECT. Further research is required to elucidate the effect of these variables on seizure duration."}, {"Title": "Factors related with unintentional injuries in children with newly diagnosed attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the factors associated with unintentional injury in children newly diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

The authors describe the design, implementation, and mixed-methods analysis of a peer-to-peer psychiatry e-learning partnership between UK and Somaliland students arising from a global mental health link between the two countries.\nMedical students at King's College London and Hargeisa and Amoud universities, Somaliland, were grouped into 24 pairs. Participants aimed to complete ten fortnightly meetings to discuss psychiatry topics via the website MedicineAfrica. Students completed initial and final evaluations including Attitudes toward Psychiatry (ATP-30) questions, a stigma questionnaire, and brief evaluations after each meeting.\nQuantitative findings demonstrated that enjoyment, interest, and academic helpfulness were rated highly by students in Somaliland and moderately by students in the UK. Somaliland students' attitudes to psychiatry were significantly more positive post-participation, whereas UK students' attitudes remained stable. Qualitative findings identified more gains in factual knowledge for Somaliland students, whereas UK students reported more cross-cultural learning. Reasons for non-completion and student-suggested improvements emphasized the need to ensure commitment to the program by participants.\nThis partnership encouraged students to consider global mental health outside the standard medical education environment, through an e-learning format solely utilizing existing resources.

This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders."}, {"Title": "Comparison Between a Typical Undergraduate Psychiatry Program in China and Canada--an Approach to Inform Psychiatry Education Reform in China.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry as a field and undergraduate psychiatry education (UPE) specifically have historically been in the periphery of medicine in China, unlike the relatively central role they occupy in the West.

Nevertheless, a psychiatrist of psychologist may doubt whether OCD patients who refuse treatment understand their disease and the consequences of not being treated, which could result in tension between respecting the patient's autonomy and beneficence. The purpose of this article is to develop a notion of competence that is grounded in clinical practice and corresponds with the experiences of patients with obsessions and/or compulsions. We present a naturalistic case study giving both the patient's and the therapist's perspective based on in-depth interviews and a narrative analysis. The case study shows that competence is not merely an assessment by a therapist, but also a co-constructed reality shaped by the experiences and stories of patient and therapist. The patient, a medical student, initially told her story in a restitution narrative, focusing on cognitive rationality. Reconstructing the history of her disease, her story changed into a quest narrative where there was room for emotions, values and moral learning. This fitted well with the therapist's approach, who used motivational interventions with a view to appealing to the patient's responsibility to deal with her condition. We conclude that in practice both the patient and therapist used a quest narrative, approaching competence as the potential for practical reasoning to incorporate values and emotions."}, {"Title": "The Systems SOAP Note: A Systems Learning Tool.", "Abstract": "Systems-based practice (SBP) is the only Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) competency concerned with public health and is relatively neglected in residency curricula.

The authors also found that 83.3% of general, 87.8% of child/adolescent, and 94.7% of addiction psychiatry training directors reported that motivational interviewing should be taught during general psychiatry residency.\nMotivational interviewing skills are considered important for general psychiatrists and widely offered by training programs. Competency in motivational interviewing skills should be considered as a graduation requirement in general psychiatry training programs."}, {"Title": "A Call to Restructure Psychiatry General and Subspecialty Training.", "Abstract": "Dire shortages of psychiatrists with special expertise in geriatrics, substance abuse, forensics, and psychosomatics create barriers to care for populations with complex mental disorders and pose a significant public health concern. To address these disparities in access to care, we propose streamlining graduate medical education to increase efficiency and enhance cost-effectiveness while simultaneously increasing the number of psychiatric subspecialists in these key areas. We propose that trainees interested in subspecialties complete their general training in 3 years, while meeting ACGME required milestones, and then utilize their 4th year to complete subspecialty fellowship training. Eligible trainees would then qualify for psychiatry subspecialty certification and general psychiatry ABPN certification at the end of 4 years."}, {"Title": "Vallejo-N\u00e1gera (1926-1990) and the concept of 'soteric neurosis': a forgotten sketch of hoarding disorder in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum literature.", "Abstract": "Juan Antonio Vallejo-N\u00e1gera, psychiatrist, painter and writer, wrote a widely adopted textbook of psychiatry in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries, particularly during the 1970s, the famous Introducci\u00f3n a la psiquiatr\u00eda. There, he advanced the concept of soteric neurosis, a condition regarded as a 'mirror image' of phobias and similar to the diagnostic entity described in DSM-5 under the heading of hoarding disorder. Indeed, much earlier than the recent nosological discussions on hoarding, Vallejo-N\u00e1gera already reported soteric neurosis to be distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder and to be associated with excessive attachment to objects and positive affect (pleasure), leading to accumulation, decreased treatment seeking, increasing interference in daily activities and blurred boundaries with normality. Vallejo-N\u00e1gera also made several predictions, including the propensity soteric neurosis patients may have towards the development of separation anxiety, obesity and other 'masked' symptoms. In the light of his original and insightful contributions to the concept of hoarding disorder, it would be interesting to assess his hypotheses in future studies."}, {"Title": "Humphry Fortescue Osmond (1917-2004), a radical and conventional psychiatrist: The transcendent years.", "Abstract": "This article describes the life and work of the psychiatrist Humphry Osmond who pursued a radical path as a psychiatrist while he remained within the establishment. To the public mind however, he is best known as the man who introduced Aldous Huxley to mescaline and coined the iconic word psychedelic. From an early stage of his career, Henry Osmond embraced new ideas to break the nexus in psychiatry at a time when neither biological nor psychoanalytic treatments were shown to have much benefit. To do this, he joined the radical social experiment in health in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan where he initiated a range of innovations that attracted international attention, as well as controversy over his espousal of the use of hallucinogens better to understand the experiences of psychotic patients."}, {"Title": "The Mechanisms Underlying the ASD Advantage in Visual Search.", "Abstract": "A number of studies have demonstrated that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are faster or more successful than typically developing control participants at various visual-attentional tasks (for reviews, see Dakin and Frith in Neuron 48:497-507, 2005; Simmons et al. in Vis Res 49:2705-2739, 2009). This \"ASD advantage\" was first identified in the domain of visual search by Plaisted et al. (J Child Psychol Psychiatry 39:777-783, 1998). Here we survey the findings of visual search studies from the past 15\u00a0years that contrasted the performance of individuals with and without ASD. Although there are some minor caveats, the overall consensus is that-across development and a broad range of symptom severity-individuals with ASD reliably outperform controls on visual search. The etiology of the ASD advantage has not been formally specified, but has been commonly attributed to 'enhanced perceptual discrimination', a superior ability to visually discriminate between targets and distractors in such tasks (e.g. O'Riordan in Cognition 77:81-96, 2000). As well, there is considerable evidence for impairments of the attentional network in ASD (for a review, see Keehn et al. in J Child Psychol Psychiatry 37:164-183, 2013). We discuss some recent results from our laboratory that support an attentional, rather than perceptual explanation for the ASD advantage in visual search. We speculate that this new conceptualization may offer a better understanding of some of the behavioral symptoms associated with ASD, such as over-focusing and restricted interests."}, {"Title": "Agreement Among Categorical, Dimensional, and Impairment Criteria for ADHD and Common Comorbidities.", "Abstract": "To compare the results of categorically based versus dimensionally based scoring algorithms for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV)-referenced teacher rating scale for assessing ADHD and commonly co-occurring conditions and to determine their relative agreement with ratings of symptom-induced impairment.\nTeachers completed Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R (CASI-4R) ratings for 1,092 youth (ages 6-18 years) referred to a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient service. Caseness was determined according to DSM-IV symptom count (categorical model) and T-score (dimensional model) criteria.\nAgreement between symptom count and T-score cutoffs was generally good (kappa \u2265 0.61) for ADHD-Inattentive, ADHD-Hyperactive-Impulsive, ADHD-Combined (except adolescent females), Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct Disorder, but this was not the case for anxiety and depressive disorders where only 15% of kappas were good. Agreement of impairment cutoff with T-score and symptom count cutoffs ranged from poor to good.\nIn general, although in many cases CASI-4R categorical and dimensional scoring algorithms generated similar results, there was considerable variability across disorders, age groups, scoring method, and in some cases, gender. Moreover, symptom counts and T-scores are not a proxy for assessing impairment suggesting that each scoring strategy likely provides unique information for clinical decision-making."}, {"Title": "Hoarding in Children With ADHD.", "Abstract": "Although evidence suggests that hoarding may be associated with symptoms of ADHD, no study has examined this relationship in children.\nParticipants included 99 youth diagnosed with ADHD (and a parent) seen in a general outpatient psychiatry clinic. Children completed the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Child Version, the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Parents completed the Children's Saving Inventory and Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale-Parent Version.\nInattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were the only indicator that differentiated those with and without clinically significant hoarding. Symptoms of ADHD, but not nonhoarding obsessive-compulsive symptoms, significantly predicted hoarding. Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were uniquely associated with individual hoarding features. Hoarding symptoms mediated the relationship between ADHD and oppositionality.\nThese findings contribute to the growing literature about the association between hoarding and ADHD."}]
