Although the literature on this topic has been growing, some specialties, in particular psychiatry, have been underrepresented.\nWe developed a didactic and experiential QI curriculum within a US psychiatry residency program that included a seminar series and development of QI projects. Evaluation included resident knowledge using the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool, implementation of resident QI projects, and qualitative and quantitative satisfaction with the curriculum.\nOur curriculum significantly improved QI knowledge in 2 cohorts of residents (N\u2009\u200a=\u200a\u200916) as measured by the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool. All resident QI projects (100%) in the first cohort were implemented. Residents and faculty reported satisfaction with the curriculum.\nOur curriculum incorporated QI education through didactic and experiential learning in a moderately sized US psychiatry residency program. Important factors included a longitudinal experience with protected time for residents to develop QI projects and a process for developing faculty competence in QI. Further studies should use a control group of residents and examine interprofessional QI curricula."}, {"Title": "Prevalence of depression in tuberculosis patients in comparison with non-tuberculosis family contacts visiting the DOTS clinic in a Nigerian tertiary care hospital and its correlation with disease pattern.", "Abstract": "Background Individuals with chronic diseases such as tuberculosis often have comorbid de-pression that requires frequent hospitalisations. This poses great challenges to the care of such patients.Objective This study aimed at determining the prevalence of depression in tuberculosis patients in comparison with non-tuberculosis controls, and its correlation with disease pattern.Method Eighty-eight patients with tuberculosis and 81 family members visiting the DOTS Centre at University College Hospital Ibadan Centre were screened for depression. Severity of depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Scale and was compared with severity of pulmonary tuberculosis.Results The prevalence of depression was 45.5% among patients and 13.4% among family members. Depression was more prevalent among patients that were elderly (P = 0.001), with extensive disease (P = 0.01), of long duration (P = 0.03), those with category 2 tuberculosis (P = 0.003), those from a nuclear family (P = 0.01) and patients that were unmarried (P = 0.02).Conclusion The impact of chronic diseases such as tuberculosis extends beyond physical impairment. It includes behavioural consequences, in this instance depression, for both the patient and the primary care givers. Thus, the care of patients with tuberculosis should be comprehensive and include consultative-liaison psychiatric care."}, {"Title": "Practicing evidence-based psychiatry. 3. Interpreting treatment guidelines.", "Abstract": "Practicing evidence-based medicine (EBM) requires the ability to evaluate relevant evidence for the purpose of making an evidence-based treatment decision. Broadly, there are three available sources of information available to the practicing clinician: individual studies, literature reviews, and practice guidelines. In the first two articles in the series, we described the threats-to-validity (T2V) approach in evaluating evidence and specifically discussed the different threats to validity in applying the findings of a single study or a systematic review to an individual patient. In this article, we describe the elements of a treatment practice guideline and evaluate threats to validity at each of these steps. We illustrate the method by evaluating a practice guideline relevant to the treatment question presented in a clinical vignette. We briefly review practice guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, discuss recommendations from an exemplar guideline about antipsychotic choice in patients with schizophrenia and consider application of its conclusions to the question of which antipsychotic to select for the particular patient with schizophrenia utilizing the T2V approach."}, {"Title": "Overcoming cultural barriers to deliver comprehensive rural community mental health care in Southern India.", "Abstract": "To describe obstacles overcome in establishing and implementing a comprehensive community psychiatry program in rural India.\nStudies in low income countries point to a significant association of common mental disorders with female gender, low education, poverty, lack of access to running water in the home, and experiencing hunger.

This also affects the patient who has to cope with the reality of having a body that bursts into the subject's consciousness as a vital threat, as source of discomfort and inability and being a body (Marcel). The human body in its dual aspect has been and is a great unknown, if not a great outrage in spite of the fact that we are our body and our body is each of us. We sometimes do not feel as we are and thus a confrontation arises, sometimes more normal, others more morbid. This forces the physician to face complex ethics considerations and the scientist to accept a personal identity disorder. Dualism considers that there are two substances in us, one that distinguishes us from other beings and from the rest of the individuals of the human species, the soul, the psychic life, mind or consciousness, and another more insubstancial one, the body. The aim of the first substance is to dominate the body, to survive it after death when it is, already a corpse is meant to become putrefied, is buried, incinerated or thrown to the depth of the sea. This dualism aims to explain the origin of the evil and the attitude to defeat it and it does so efficiently. This anthropology has very ancient roots (the Upvanishads, in the orphic texts, in Plato), it is the core of Gnostic thought and the foundation of the modern science since Descartes. Some monist perspectives are a masked dualism or a mereologic fallacy, according to which, the brain is conscious, when that what is conscious is the subject, although the subject, with the brain could not be conscious. Therefore, a new perspective is proposed, chiasmatic or janicular monism, that considers the adaptive value of focusing on the reality from two perspectives, as physical universe and the world of interpersonal relationships. In the agnosias and in the phantom limb there is a confrontation between the body object and the body subject that has made it possible to investigate how the perception of the own body is and how the brain generates the schema and the body image. The study of the body experience, from the phenomenology and the anthropological psychiatry perspective, has made it possible to go greater in-depth into the knowledge of the alterations of the experience of the own body in different mental diseases, especially in those in which a confrontation between the body and the personal identity arises makes it necessary to consider the process of individual identification and a category of personal identity disorders that would include body dysmorphic disorder, erythrophobia, anorexia nervosa, body integrity identity as well as the gender-type disorders (transsexualism, nonfetishistic transvestism, gender identity disorder during childhood).

Several mechanisms underlie this shift, including deinstitutionalization of mental health patients and extraordinary progress in neurosciences, imaging technologies and psychology, just no name a few. This development has put in evidence specific needs for training and education. A review and comparison of forensic psychiatry training in several European countries, U.S.A. and Brazil is made.\nA mixed approach was used, including a) systematic literature review (Pubmed search, 1989-2009) and cross-reference search and inclusion; b) specific online sites search (e.g. medical associations or scientific societies responsible for forensic psychiatry training); c) direct contact with psychiatrists and forensic psychiatrists.\nForensic psychiatry training is still a heterogeneous field. While not all countries have specialization, subspecialization or competency certification in forensic psychiatry, there has been, however, a definite shift towards its individuation as a specific technico-scientific area. This contributes to an improvement in quality standards and promotes research.

A number of clinical presentations involving family aspects may be seen in clinical practice in a range of diagnoses (Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, depression or any other psychiatric disorder in the elderly). As a consequence, there is a growing trend towards working with families in geriatric psychiatry. Marital issues are not a frequent target for specific clinical intervention, but couple therapy may be useful regardless of age. The effectiveness of family systems therapy has not been widely evaluated in psychogeriatrics, so far. However, it may be a powerful resource when family dynamics must be addressed, mostly in families where dysfunctional circularities precede the outburst of severe clinical problems. More often, family psychoeducation will be the first indication, in different formats, settings and levels of intensity. However, context reading and systemically-informed work are not restricted to classical family therapy and do not imply it. Is has been suggested that family psychoeducation should sometimes include a stronger family systems perspective. Structured and feasible family assessments should always precede interventions. Indeed, they are a first step of the intervention itself, while necessarily reviewed through the course of family work. Ageism perhaps still influences to some extent health professionals' attitudes, including the ones of family therapists, leading to the underutilization of family approaches in the elderly. However, working with families remains a core process in geriatric psychiatry and family therapy may be a powerful resource in particular cases."}, {"Title": "[Mental health of college students: experience of the university psychiatric outpatient clinic of Hospital de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o].", "Abstract": "The mental health of college students has been raising major awareness, due to the increased prevalence and severity of psychiatric disorders in this population.

As drugs have become the more dominant treatment in psychiatry and primary care, this approach is increasingly criticized as limited in scope, lacking in robust outcomes and too heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. Our objective is to show that recent advances in neurobiology are clarifying that learning and environmental experiences, such as psychotherapy, change brain circuits as do drugs. The leading notion of how therapeutic effects occur in psychiatric disorders is that they happen when symptoms are reduced by improving the efficiency of information processing in hypothetically malfunctioning brain circuits.\nWith this formulation of psychiatric symptoms and their relief, it is not surprising that both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology can be clinically effective for treating psychiatric disorders, or indeed that combining them can be therapeutically synergistic. Psychotherapy, including a new spinoff of cognitive behavioural therapy called trial-based therapy, like many other forms of learning, can hypothetically induce epigenetic changes in brain circuits that can enhance the efficiency of information processing in malfunctioning neurons to improve symptoms in psychiatric disorders, just like drugs.\nPsychotherapies can be conceptualized as epigenetic 'drugs', or at least as therapeutic agents that act epigenetically in a manner similar or complementary to drugs. These findings are leading to a paradigm shift in psychiatry such that psychotherapy is experiencing a come-back as various standardized, brief, goal-directed psychotherapies are being integrated with drug treatment of psychiatric disorders by psychopharmacologists who have traditionally relied on a drugs-only approach."}, {"Title": "Ascertainment of early onset eating disorders: a pilot for developing a national child psychiatric surveillance system.", "Abstract": "\u2002 A Child & Adolescent Psychiatric Surveillance System was established as part of a British Paediatric Surveillance Unit study of early onset eating disorders (EOED).\n\u2002 A study of EOED presenting to paediatricians was undertaken through the BPSU over 15\u2003months in 2005-06.\n\u2002 Monthly report cards compliance was 83%, identifying 208 EOED cases.

These therapeutic advances provide a new challenge for clinicians in the choice of medication for patients with bipolar disorder. In this context, tools have been developed for making medical decisions in the management of bipolar disorder: guidelines.\nGuidelines for bipolar disorder were compared on the basis of their construction methodology (evidence-based treatment guidelines or consensus-based treatment guidelines), results and recommendations for clinical practice.\nThere are differences between guidelines for treating bipolar disorder. For the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the severity of the manic episode is a primary endpoint of the decision-making tree for the choice of therapy. On the other hand, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that the choice of the initial treatment, in the case of manic episode, should be based first on the current patient's treatment (history of anti-manic therapy) while the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) emphasizes the clinical classification of the type of mania. The sequencing of medication in the guidelines may vary according to the construction methodology, the date of elaboration, the geocultural context and experts' position. Recent guidelines consider the last randomized controlled trials (RCT) as those of aripiprazole in the treatment of mania, recommending it in first line as anti-manic agent. The recent updated WFSBP guidelines changed in its construction methodology taking into account the negative studies or those showing non-superiority compared to placebo. Thus, a recent study of non-superiority of lithium monotherapy compared to placebo in the treatment of bipolar depression downgraded lithium from level of evidence B to D. During recent years, a large number of RCT have demonstrated superior efficacy (particularly in mania treatment) of lithium or valproate combined with second-generation antipsychotic compared with lithium or valproate monotherapy. Consequently, according to geocultural context or experts' position, some guidelines recommended medication combinations in first line (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment) and other guidelines considered monotherapy in first line (except for particular cases) to promote tolerance and good therapeutic alliance (WFSBP). Malhi et al. recommended a sequencing of medication based on the benefit risk ratio for the management of each phase of bipolar disorder. These differences between guidelines may cause difficulties for clinicians in choosing clinical practice guidelines.\nWhile there are a large number of guidelines for bipolar disorder, the recommendations may vary depending on multiple factors. It seems interesting to conduct a comparative study of guidelines for bipolar disorder on the basis of a validated scale (AGREE) or completed by other items such as date of elaboration and number of proposed recommendations. However, the methodological understanding of guidelines remains the central element for practitioners in their choice of guidelines.

Completed detention renewals from a National Health Service (NHS) Trust were systematically collected over 12 months (n = 47). Second professionals identified on Form H5 were requested to return a questionnaire designed to explore the role and the eligibility, knowledge base and attitudes of those fulfilling it, in comparison to the requirements as described in the code of practice and in relation to the stated purpose of the role. Twenty-eight second professionals completed questionnaires, giving a response rate of 60%. Several factors were identified which appeared to conspire against the notion that the aim of the role had been achieved in a meaningful way. The reasons underlying this included tokenistic statutory paperwork and a clear lack of specific training. Training needs identified included increasing legal knowledge and raising awareness of the ethical issues associated with a statutory role with a responsible nature. The findings challenge the assumption of readiness in those being asked to act in the generic statutory role of the second professional and highlight the potential for difficulties in the process of moving towards a cultural change of distributed responsibility in psychiatry, both in terms of the introduction of generic statutory roles in the absence of training and also with relevance to the changing nature of traditionally defined professional roles as suggested by new ways of working."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of diet and life style in etiopathogenesis of senile dementia: A survey study.", "Abstract": "Mind and body are inseparable entities and influences each other until death. Many factors such as stress, anxiety, depression, negative thoughts, unhealthy life style, unwholesome diet etc., disturb mental and physical wellbeing. Senile dementia is the mental deterioration, i.e, loss of intellectual ability associated with old age. It causes progressive deterioration of mental faculties, e.g., memory, intellect, attention, thinking, comprehension and personality, with preservation of normal level of consciousness. Two major types of senile dementia have been identified, namely that due to generalized atrophy in the cortical area of the brain (Alzheimer's type) and that due to vascular disorders mainly due to stroke. According to DSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders), the essential feature of dementia is the development of multiple cognitive deficits that include memory impairment and at least one of the following cognitive disturbances such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or a disturbance in executive function. For the present study, a standardized questionnaire in the form of proforma incorporating types of foods (madhura, amla and lavana rasayukta ahara etc.) and life style (divaswapna, ratrijagarana and manasika bhavas etc) is prepared. To assess manasika bhava, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, and standardized gradations of anumana pariksha of manasika bhavas mentioned by Charaka at Vimana Sthana 4/8 were adopted. In this study, most of the patients had disturbed sleep, tendency to indulge in defective dietary habits and kapha vitiating diets and life style. On Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, patients had anxiety, tension, depression, difficulty in concentration, and memory. On Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, these patients had anxiety, depression, and hypochondriasis.

Oxidative stress results from an oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, an excess of oxidants and/or a depletion of antioxidants. There are numerous studies that indicate that free radicals (FRs) damage neurons, and then play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression. Active oxygen can cause considerable damage and disrupt the important physiological functions of proteins, lipids, enzymes and DNA. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible differences in the concentration of tromboxane B2, 8-OHdG and protein carbonyls, as significant markers of oxidative damage, and urate, albumin and total protein concentrations as antioxidative molecules in PTSD patients in comparison to the healthy control group. The study included 74 male participants who were active soldiers in the Croatian armed forces from 1991 to 1995. 46 subjects with chronic and current PTSD were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry of Dubrava University Hospital during 2010, 28 healthy subjects were recruited in the same period during the regular medical examination at the Dubrava University Hospital. Study results have shown that there is no statistically significant difference in urinary concentrations of 8-OHdG, serum thromboxane B2, and serum urates between two studied groups.

It was then that the effect of one's immediate environment on human emotions, mood, and recovery became the subject of many scientific studies, and the role of architectural design in the care and treatment of psychiatric patients gained much attention. Over the years significant evidence has been accumulated of the effect of architectural design on humans.

We will then consider the possible mechanisms of action of the placebo effect, with a view to improving understanding of this issue. Finally, we will analyse data relating to placebos used in psychiatry and, more specifically, for schizophrenic patients. In an extensive review of the literature, we identified the various factors playing a role in the appearance of placebo effects in general medicine. As well as purely factual elements, such as the disorder, the sex of the subject and the treatment given, the placebo effect is strongly correlated with the quality of the relationship between the doctor and patient and with the capacity of the patient to communicate and establish a link. The attitude of the doctor, the temperament of the subject and the expectations and beliefs of each also contribute to the appearance and extent of a placebo effect. We then investigated placebo effects in psychiatry, particularly in depressed patients (the most widely studied condition) where studies have shown particular efficacy. We also addressed the use of placebos in schizophrenia: the placebo effect in patients with this disorder is essentially used as a tool for assessing new molecules to be released onto the market but the phenomenon itself has been little studied, if at all. Thus, it is of particular interest to consider in detail the use of placebos in schizophrenia, to try to gain a deeper understanding of the factors involved. This will allow potential specific effects associated with placebo use in this disorder to be established, improving the integration of placebos into therapy and to optimize the efficacy of treatment prescribed, taking into account mental state; indeed, the placebo effect is present in all treatments, whether involving a placebo or an active compound."}, {"Title": "[Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of dissociative disorders and somatoform disorders in Burkina Faso].", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of dissociative and somatoform disorders in the psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Yalgado Ou\u00e9draogo, in Burkina Faso.\nWe carried out a retrospective and descriptive study over five years, from January 2003 to December 2007, of patients admitted in the psychiatric department for dissociative and somatoform disorders.

Although much attention has been paid to addressing challenges inherent to the on-call experience, such as limiting the amount of on-call hours and call frequency, equal attention should be paid to team dynamics.

Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis.\nOf 154 surveys distributed, 111 were returned (72% response rate). Nearly one-third of chief resident respondents indicated that more than 50% of their program's emergency psychiatry training was provided during on-call periods. A minority indicated that they were aware of the ACGME program requirements for emergency psychiatry training. While training in emergency psychiatry occurred in many programs through rotations-different from the on-call period-direct supervision was available during on-call training only about one-third of the time.\nThe findings suggest that about one-third of psychiatry residency training programs do not adhere to the ACGME standards for emergency psychiatry training. Enhanced knowledge of the ACGME requirements may enhance psychiatry residents' understanding on how their programs are fulfilling the need for more emergency psychiatry training.

Focusing on adult care, a comparative assessment of the resources allocated to general psychiatric care and specialist care was conducted, in addition to a comparative assessment of the resources allocated to each of the hospital's four local centers. Geographical accessibility to extramural facilities was also assessed. A study of the characteristics of each general psychiatry clinic revealed significant disparities. The paper highlights several issues: the poor knowledge of psychiatric epidemiological data relating to the population within the catchment area, the difficulty of assessing non-consolidated data or indicators from multiple sources, and the limited and partial nature of geographical data for characterizing and evaluating health care in the hospital's peripheral clinics.

Service-utilization for 247 inpatients was analyzed. The results were controlled for diagnosis, demographic variables, type of service system, localization of inpatient admissions, and length of hospitalization.\nMost inpatients in the area with the decentralized care model also utilized outpatient consultations, whereas a considerable number of inpatients in the area with a partly centralized model did not enter outpatient care at all. Type of service system, localization of inpatient admission, and length of hospitalization predicted inpatients' utilization of outpatient consultations. The results are discussed in the light of systems integration, particularly management-arrangements and clinical bridging over the transitional phase from inpatient to outpatient care.\nInpatients' utilization of outpatient services differed between an area with a decentralized care model in comparison to an adjacent area with a partly centralized care model. In the areas studied, extensive decentralization of the psychiatric services positively affected coordination of inpatient and outpatient services for people with severe psychiatric disorders.

In all past civilizations discordance of mental harmony of an individual is interpreted from the physiological aspect. Psychopathologic expression was not considered an illness, so social attitudes about psychiatric patients in the past were non-medical and generally speaking inhuman. Hospitals did not follow development of medicine for admission of psychiatric patients in past civilizations, not even in the antique era. According to historic sources, the first hospital that was meant for mental patients only was established in the 15th century, 1409 in Valencia (Spain). Therefore mental patients were isolated in a special institution-hospital, and social community rejected them. Only in the new era psychopathological behaviour begins to be treated as an illness. Therefore during the 19th century psychiatry is developed as a special branch of medicine, and mental disorder is more and more seen according to the principals of interpretation of physical illnesses.

The diagnostic categories in the DSM-IV-TR corresponding to \"acute psychosis\" were brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizo-affective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features. Although brief psychotic disorder is representative of \"acute psychosis\" in the DSM-TR, it lacks in clinical usefulness, because its diagnostic criteria, based on no historical background, lack clinical validity in terms of symptom definition and duration (1 month>). On the other hand, in the ICD-10, a diagnostic category of acute transient psychotic disorder was based on the traditional \"acute psychosis\" concept that has been bred in the European Psychiatry. Among the acute transient psychotic disorders, acute polymorphic psychotic disorder is the diagnostic category made according to traditional concept of \"bouff\u00e9es d\u00e9lirantes\" and cycloid psychosis. It is a clinically useful diagnostic category, because it could predict favorable episode outcome, if a person with fairly good premorbid social adaptation presents acute onset of polymorphic psychotic symptoms.

Until the late 1990s, Japanese psychiatrists focused almost exclusively on psychosis and endogenous depression, the latter being severe enough to require conventional forms of antidepressants, known as tricyclic antidepressants, and even hospitalization. At this time, people's attitude toward depression was generally unfavorable. Indeed, the Japanese word for clinical depression, utubyo, has a negative connotation, implying severe mental illness. This situation, however, changed immediately after fluvoxiamine (Luvox-Fujisawa, Depromel-Meiji Seika), the first selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) to receive approval in Japan, was introduced in 1999. In order to aid the drug's acceptance by the Japanese public, pharmaceutical companies began using the catchphrase kokoro no kaze, which literally means \"a cold of the soul\". Thus armed with this phrase, the pharmaceutical industry embarked on a campaign to lessen the stigma surrounding depression. According to national data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of patients with a diagnosis of mood disorder increased from 327,000 in 1999 to 591,600 in 2003. At the same time, antidepressant sales have sextupled, from\\14.5 billion in 1998 to\\87 billion in 2006, according to statistics from GlaxoSmithKline. Recently, the pharmaceutical industry has shifted its focus from depression to bipolar disorder. Historically, Japanese psychiatrists have been familiar with Emil Kraepelin's \"manic depressive insanity\" (1899), whose definition was much narrower than that of its contemporary counterpart, bipolar disorder. Thus far, perhaps due partly to the reference in Kraepelin's definition of \"manic depressive\" disorder, Japanese psychiatrists have rather conservatively prescribed mood stabilizers for persons with frequent mood swings. Japanese psychiatrists can learn a great deal from their experience with the aggressive marketing of antidepressants. In the case of depression, over-medication arguably did more harm than good. The same risk exists with bipolar disorder. Disease mongering may occur whenever the interests of a pharmaceutical company exceed the expected benefits from the proposed pharmacotherapy on those affected by the putative bipolar disorder. In cases that are not severe enough for aggressive medication, psychiatrists should propose natural alternatives, such as an alteration of lifestyle and psychotherapy."}, {"Title": "[Gender dysphoria in pervasive developmental disorders].", "Abstract": "Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are characterized by two essential symptoms: impairment in social interaction, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. PDD include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). These three disorders are sometimes termed autism spectrum disorders. A recent epidemiological survey demonstrated that the rate of PDD may be almost 1% and that many PDD cases might not be diagnosed properly in childhood. Erik Erikson described eight stages of psychosocial development through which a normally developing human should pass from infancy to adulthood. In the theory, an adolescent shows 'Identity vs. Role Confusion'. It has been reported that individuals with PDD often have identity crises which sometimes include gender dysphoria. This phenomenon might be related to the so-called identity diffusion in youth. When they reach their young youth, it has been said that subjects with PDD realize their uniqueness and differences compared to others, and, as a result, they may develop confusion of identity which could be exhibited as gender identity disorder. A recent study demonstrated that, amongst 204 children and adolescents who visited a GID clinic in the Netherlands, 7.8% were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders after a careful diagnostic procedure by a multi-disciplinary team. Taken together, PDD and GID seem closely related to each other. In this paper, we present four PDD cases with gender dysphoria and related symptoms: 1) a girl with PDD who repeatedly asserted gender identity disorder (GID) symptoms in response to social isolation at school, 2) a junior high school boy with PDD and transvestism, 3) a boy diagnosed with Asperger's disorder who developed a disturbance of sexual orientation, and 4) a boy with Asperger's disorder and comorbid childhood GID. Many of the clinical symptoms related to gender dysphoria might be explained by the cognitive characteristics and psychopathology of PDD. The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology published guidelines for the assessment and treatment of GID in 1997, and revised them in 2006. As a result, GID has become well known as a clinical entity in Japan, and there have been an increasing number of Japanese patients complaining of gender dysphoria. It is important to consider an underlying diagnosis of PDD when encountering patients with gender dysphoria."}, {"Title": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive and relatively painless tool that has been used to study various cognitive functions as well as to understand the brain-behavior relationship in normal individuals as well as in those with various neuropsychiatric disorders. It has also been used as a therapeutic tool in various neuropsychiatric disorders because of its ability to specifically modulate distinct brain areas. Studies have shown that repeated stimulation at low frequency produces long-lasting inhibition, which is called as long-term depression, whereas repeated high-frequency stimulation can produce excitation through long-term potentiation. This paper reviews the current status of rTMS as an investigative and therapeutic modality in various neuropsychiatric disorders. It has been used to study the cortical and subcortical functions, neural plasticity and brain mapping in normal individuals and in various neuropsychiatric disorders. rTMS has been most promising in the treatment of depression, with an overall milder adverse effect profile compared with electroconvulsive therapy. In other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, mania, epilepsy and substance abuse, it has been found to be useful, although further studies are required to establish therapeutic efficacy. It appears to be ineffective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder. There is a paucity of studies of efficacy and safety of rTMS in pediatric and geriatric population. Although it appears safe, further research is required to optimize its efficacy and reduce the side-effects. Magnetic seizure therapy, which involves producing seizures akin to electroconvulsive therapy, appears to be of comparable efficacy in the treatment of depression with less cognitive adverse effects."}, {"Title": "A Cross-sectional Descriptive Study of Prevalence and Nature of Psychiatric Referrals from Intensive Care Units in a Multispecialty Hospital.", "Abstract": "The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in general hospital range from 20% to 60%.

There is a limited literature on the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in patients admitted in the intensive care units (ICUs).\nThe aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence and nature of comorbid psychiatric illness in the cases referred from ICUs.\nCross-sectional observational study.\nThis study included all the consecutive patients referred from different ICUs to psychiatry department for consultation during the four-year period from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2003, assessment was done by psychiatrist and diagnosis was made using ICD-10.\nDescriptive statistics.\nThere were 309 (1.97%) referrals from ICUs to psychiatry department during the period of study. Among the referred patients, diagnosis of organic mental disorders was the commonest psychiatric diagnosis present in 104 (33.65%) patients followed by suicidal attempt in 101 (32.69%); anxiety disorders in 40 (12.94%); depressive disorders in 21 (6.8%); Psychotic illness in 10 (3.24%); other psychiatric illnesses in 28 (9.06%); and nil psychiatric illness in 5 (1.62%) patients.\nPrevalence of psychiatric referrals from ICUs was low. This could be due to stigma and lack of awareness among physicians.

However, these drugs have separate set of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Therefore, this study was carried out to assess these ADRs, which can have impact on long-term compliance and achieving successful treatment.\nA prospective study of analysis of ADR of atypical antipsychotic drugs was carried out in the psychiatry outpatient department. Patients of psychotic disorder (any age, either sex), who were prescribed atypical antipsychotic drugs, were included. Those who were prescribed conventional antipsychotics or combinations of antipsychotics were excluded from the study. Apart from spontaneously reported ADRs, a questionnaire related to the likely ADR was used and patients' responses were recorded in the case record form.\nTotally 93 ADRs were recorded from 84 prescriptions. Majority of the ADRs (82 out of 93) were seen with risperidone and olanzepine, as they were the commonly prescribed drugs. Weight gain, dizziness, sleep disturbance and appetite disturbance accounted for nearly 78% of the total events. With risperidone (at 4-6 mg/day) and olanzepine (at 10-15 mg/day), gastrointestinal and sleep disturbance were observed in the initial (within 7 days to 2-3 months after treatment) course of treatment, while EPS, fatigue, seizure, increased frequency of micturition and dizziness were observed after long-term (3-9 months) use.\nThe present study adds to the existing information on the prevalence of adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs.

The forthcoming fifth edition of the manual (DSM-5) represents an opportunity to not only update diagnostic information in concert with recent advances in the science and practice of psychiatry, but also to more strongly consider the integration of systematically gathered patient self-assessments of symptom severity.\nTo present information on planned changes to the DSM diagnostic assessment strategies that incorporate patient-reported data.\nActivities of the DSM-5 work groups and study groups related to patient-reported assessments are summarized. These activities include critical reviews of past research, reviews of assessment instruments, development of assessment strategies incorporating dimensional assessments of patients' clinical symptoms, and testing of proposed strategies.\nLimitations of the current DSM diagnostic assessment system are discussed. With the current approach to diagnosis used in DSM-IV, clinicians must decide whether a patient meets the diagnostic criteria set forth for a disorder and then diagnose the disorder as present or absent. This categorical approach to the diagnostic threshold constricts the range of clinical information that may be of high importance to treatment planning, prognosis, and monitoring treatment outcomes. Advantages to incorporation of a dimensional assessment strategy are also discussed. A dimensional approach to psychiatric diagnosis provides clinicians with more information, and with standardized dimensional rating scales, can give patient self-reports a greater role in the clinical process. A description of the proposed methods for integrating dimensional assessments into DSM-5 is presented. Initial pilot testing of these changes to DSM indicate that clinicians and patients/patient informants found the dimensional measures to be useful, simple, and relevant to clinical care.\nThe introduction of patient-reported symptom assessments as part of the DSM would represent a major change in psychiatric practice, with implications for patient care, mental health policy, and health care funding. The ultimate goal of such a change is to increase patient satisfaction with care and improve treatment outcomes. These goals will be the subject of continuing evaluation after the DSM-5 is published.\nThe use of patient-reported dimensional assessments of symptom severity will aid in more comprehensive and systematized characterizations of baseline clinical status and subsequent changes in clinical status with treatment.\nThe use of principles of evidence-based medicine and measurement-based care are likely to increase in the United States as health care reform measures are put into place. The DSM-5 proposals for patient-reported measures can serve as an initial method for gauging the outcomes of treatments.\nAs with previous editions of the DSM, the changes implemented in DSM-5 will continue to be the focus of research efforts after publication. Results from this research will serve as the basis for further refinements in measurement recommendations."}, {"Title": "Philosophical whitewashing. Ludwig Binswanger (1881-1966) and the sterilisation of manic-depressive patients.", "Abstract": "The Swiss psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger is known as the founder of the Daseinsanalyse (existential analysis) and more generally for having applied contemporary philosophical concepts and theories to psychiatry. The fortune of the philosopher Binswanger constituted a formidable obstacle to a historical scrutiny of his actual clinical practice. In the long run, the philosopher overshadowed the psychiatrist. The present paper takes the move from a \"minor\" work, an essay on the sterilisation of manic-depressive patients Binswanger published in 1938. This essay represents a rare exception in Binswanger's scientific production in many respects: for its editorial collocation, for the subject (a concrete medical intervention) and the complete absence of philosophical references. Nevertheless, or precisely for this reason, the essay has been largely ignored by the scholarship, both of Swiss eugenics and of Binswanger himself. This paper explores the epistemological circumstances of this negligence and its historiographic significance, with special attention to the philosophical-anthropological refashioning of a psychiatric myth."}, {"Title": "[Classification of mental disorders--a conceptual framework for the ICD-11].", "Abstract": "The World Psychiatric Association (WPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) are currently engaging in the revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).

These experts asserted that a child's decision to rely on his or her left hand was a reflection of a defiant personality that could best be corrected by forcible switching. The methods used to retrain left-handers were often tortuous, including restraining a resistant child's left hand. In contrast, those who saw left-handedness as inherited, but natural, not only disapproved of forced switching, but also often warned of its putative negative consequences, especially stuttering. These claims were given credence in the 1930s by influential University of Iowa researchers, including psychiatrist S. T. Orton, psychologist L. E. Travis, and their students. From the late 1920s until the 1950s, the Iowa researchers published articles and books connecting the etiology of stuttering to forcing natural left-handers to write and perform other tasks with their right hand. Based on their clinical studies these practitioners concluded that stutterers displayed weak laterality. The Iowa group also published detailed case studies of patients whose stuttering was putatively cured by the restoration of their left-handedness. By the late-1940s, the connection between stuttering and retraining evaporated, due in large part to the growing dominance of psychoanalytic psychiatry. Despite robust statistical and clinical evidence, the connection between forced hand switching and stuttering has largely been forgotten. Recent imaging studies of stutterers, however, have suggested that stuttering is tied to disturbed signal transmission between the hemispheres. Similar to the Iowa researchers of the 1930s, current investigators have found connections between stuttering and weak laterality."}, {"Title": "[Psychoeducation, a project of therapeutic alliance for nursing staff and families].", "Abstract": "Patient therapeutic education is growing in France because of the undeniable epidemiological, sociological and economic stakes involved even in psychiatry.

The study undertaken at Jury hospital on 3 \"CMP\" (Medico-psychological centre) and alongside the families involved underlines the importance of the therapeutic link between the care staff and the families for the introduction of such a method and suggests indicators to measure the impact of the programmes, although these remain to be validated on a larger scale. The study confirms the need to structure an institutional project so as to guarantee its continued existence.

The question posed was how these characters or personality types could be useful in the process of informing the cancer patient. The aim of this paper was to describe the emotional-hyperthymic character or type of personality thoroughly, so that any physician can make a diagnosis and tailor the information strategy to the patient's needs. The qualitative method of research through groups with doctors and nurses was used, while the research within groups lasted for 5 years. The degree of patients' denial varied between \"large\" and \"very large\" and sometimes was \"medium\".

Brains are no longer seen as rational systems that are plagued with emotional disorders reflecting primitives inherited from our animal ancestors. Brains are dynamical systems that continually create patterns by acting intentionally into the environment and shaping themselves in accord with the sensory consequences of their intended actions. Emotions are now seen not as reversions to animal behaviors but as the sources of force and energy that brains require for the actions they take to understand the world and themselves. Humans are unique in experiencing consciousness of their own actions, which they experience as conscience: guilt, shame, pride and joy. Chaotic brain dynamics strives always for unity and harmony, but as a necessary condition for adaptation to a changing world, it repeatedly lapses into disorder. The successes are seen in the normal unity of consciousness; the failures are seen in the disorders that we rightly label the schizophrenias and the less severe character disorders. The foundation for healthy unity is revealed by studies in the evolution of brains, in particular the way in which neocortex of mammals emerged from the primitive allocortex of reptiles. The amazing facts of brain dynamics are now falling into several places. The power-law connectivity of cortex supports the scale-free dynamics of the global workspace in brains ranging from mouse to whale. That dynamics in humans holds the secrets of speech and symbol utilization. By recursive interactions in vast areas of human neocortex the scale-free connectivity supports our unified consciousness. Here in this dynamics are to be sought the keys to understanding and treating the disorders that uniquely plague the human mind."}, {"Title": "[A state without memory.

To do this, renowned psychiatrists who held public positions built a black legend over the most emblematic insane asylum of the country, pointing out as the main cause of failure the constraint to which patients were subjected. In doing so, they resembled the mental hospital to a prison and the insane to a social threat, because they reduced that institution's function and denied the many experiences that would ?t in it: a place of confinement and refuge, a therapeutic and knowledge production space. Even though Mexican psychiatry was professionalized in the space of the asylum, the State wanted to erase the memory of that past to suggest the establishment of a new era in mental health, where the patients would no longer be subject to any restrictions which could curtail their freedom. Overcoming the asylum model meant creating \"open door\" therapeutic alternatives, but the decision was to distort the past to exalt the future."}, {"Title": "[The evolution of psychiatry in Uruguay].", "Abstract": "Uruguay, a country in South America situated between Brazil and Argentina, has a population of 3 million, a literacy rate of 97%, and health coverage of 87% . Treatment of patients with mental disturbances has existed throughout its history. From colonial times and in the Spanish religious tradition, treatment of mental alienation had recourse to the \"madhouse\" of the Charity Hospital in Montevideo (1788). Half a century after independence the National Lunatic Asylum was built (1880), and the field of psychiatry began to develop, centred on the asylum-hospital. Within a French medical heritage, institutions such as the Chair of Psychiatry (1907) and the Society of Psychiatry (1923) were created; their academic activities permanently invigorated the growth of this branch of medicine.

However, many of the current \"models of anxiety\" in animals do not deal with pathology itself, but only with extreme forms of anxiety which are still in the normal, adaptive range. These models have certainly provided a lot of information on brain and behavioral mechanisms which could be involved in the etiology and physiopathology of anxiety disorders, but are usually not satisfactory when confronted directly with clinical syndromes. Further progress in this field will probably depend on the finding of endophenotypes which can be studied in both humans and animals with common methodological approaches. The emphasis should be on individual differences in vulnerability, which have to be included in animal models. Finally, progress will also depend on refining theoretical constructs from an interdisciplinary perspective, including psychiatry, psychology, behavioral sciences, genetics, and other neurosciences."}, {"Title": "Psychotropic medication use in children and adolescents in an inpatient setting.", "Abstract": "Medication can be an effective part of treatment for several psychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence but its use should be based on a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and treatment plan. The aim of this study was to evaluate psychotropic medication use for children and adolescents treated as inpatients and to compare it with principles of rational pharmacotherapy, thus identifying possible downsides of current practices and pointing a way towards safer and more efficient practices. This is a descriptive study of prescribing trends at the Clinical Department for Children and Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade, during the period from September 2009 to September 2010. Analyzed demographic data (age, gender) and the number of hospitalizations were obtained from medical histories, while diagnoses were obtained from discharge notes. Prescribed therapy was copied from medication charts. Drug dosages were analyzed as average daily doses prescribed during the hospitalization. Psychiatric diagnoses were classified according to The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10). During the examined time period, 264 patients were hospitalized (61.4% males), with an average age of 11.4\u00b15.1 years. We have found that 66.3% of admitted patients were treated with pharmacotherapy in addition to other treatment modalities. There was a highly significant correlation between the age of patients and the prescribed dosage (Spearman's rho=0.360, p<0.001) as well as the number of prescribed drugs (Spearman's rho=0.405, p<0.001). The most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders were: autism spectrum disorders (20.8%), conduct disorders(19.7%), mixed developmental disorder (14.8%), adjustment disorder (7.2%), mental retardation (7.2%),acute psychosis (4.5%), and ADHD (2.3%). The most commonly prescribed medications were antipsychotics(45.9%), followed by antidepressants (17.2%), mood stabilizers (16.1%), benzodiazepines (14.4%), and other psychotropic drugs (6.4%). The most commonly prescribed antipsychotic was risperidone, used for more than 50% of the patients treated with antipsychotics. Taken together risperidone and chlorpromazine were more than 75% of all prescribed antipsychotics. 98.4% of prescribed antidepressants belonged to the SSRIs,with sertraline and fluoxetine accounting for almost 90% of them. All prescribed dosages were in accordance with the official guidelines. This is the first survey in Serbia to document the practice of prescribing psychotropic medication in the field of child and adolescent psychiatry. Current drug-prescribing practices at the Clinical Department for Children and Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade are in accordance with current practices in the United States and Europe. Not every child with symptoms of mental health problems needs pharmacological treatment; when they do, the general rule of thumb should be \"start low, go slow, and taper slowly\".

Nearly all psychiatrists and general practitioners treating depressive patients agree about the relevance of antidepressants in the treatment of depressive patients. However, a number of meta-analytic studies recently challenged this belief and it has been put up for discussion to psychiatry/clinical psychopharmacology whether the efficacy of antidepressants is clinically relevant. Despite that all medication were judged to have sufficient data to receive approval from the FDA and the EMA and other agencies worldwide, some authors went further and questioned the effectiveness of antidepressants. They even proposed that \"alternative\" therapies of unproven efficacy or of proven negative efficacy should be preferred to medication. These authors do not take into consideration that for methodological reasons it is not acceptable to deduce too extensive conclusions. Some assumptions they rely on, like the suggestion of NICE, which regards a mean placebo-verum difference of 3 HAM-D points as clinically relevant, is downright arbitrary on statistical grounds, and not supported by empirical findings or by expert opinion. It seems that the difference in change in HAM-D score between the active drug and placebo is somewhere between 2 and 3, with maybe some agents performing a little better than others. It is uncertain whether initial severity determines response; different interpretations exist. However, much more important for the evaluation of the clinical relevance is the result of the responder/remitter analysis, which compares the relative frequency of these categories between the placebo and verum groups. This approach results in a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5-7. In evidence-based medicine such a NNT is traditionally regarded as a sign of moderate to strong efficacy and corresponds to the referring values of many therapies, which e.g. are standard therapies in internal medicine. However, from many meta-analyses it is clear that when concepts of evidence-based medicine and health economy are applied, which are far away from clinical thinking, problems occur and results are very difficult to interpret in clinical terms."}, {"Title": "Advances and perspectives in mental health: is psychiatry being stigmatized?", "Abstract": "The specialty of Psychiatry and the interdisciplinary work performed by psychiatrists in conjunction with other scientific and humanistic disciplines is being affected by some facts which lead to its stigmatization. There are both internal and external risks that are affecting the profession. Among the internal ones we may mention the different diagnostic criteria used by psychiatrists and the differences between treatments--as there is a wide variety of treatment options. Besides, the practice of psychiatry may differ enormously, according to the perspective--biological, psychological, social, cultural, and so on--of each psychiatrist. The internal inconsistencies give rise to some of the external risks psychiatry and psychiatrists have to face: patients' discontent or even mistrust, the intrusion of other professions in the field of psychiatry and the negative image psychiatry has among the public. Just as it occurred in many other places before, the passing of a new mental health law in Argentina has proved to be an occasion for deep debate. The passing of this law has caused big controversy, especially among professional associations, private mental health services, NGOs which represent users and their families, trade unions which represent health workers, political and economic decision makers, etc. In Argentina, the debate of ideas has always been rich. Even when political parties were forbidden, there were discussions taking place among groups which supported psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches. There are many who demonize the developments made in the field of psychiatry and they also campaign against such developments. They catch the public's attention and they convince legislators, thus spreading the idea that psychiatry may be dangerous. As a consequence, for example, the new law gives similar status to psychiatrists and psychologists when it states that the decision to confine a patient into hospital \"should be signed by two professionals, one of whom should be either a psychologist or a psychiatrist\". We all know that psychologists play a very important role in mental health care, but the medical training of psychiatrists will surely enable them to make very complex medical decisions such as the decision to confine a patient into hospital. Some other aspects to be mentioned about this law are that no reference is made to outpatient services, although they are of utmost importance in everyday practice, and that there is a bureaucratization of hospitalization. Such decision is no longer made by a professional, as a means to achieve the best treatment possible, but by a judge, who is expected to know what is best for the patient. However, there are basic contents in this law which are definitely positive: it defends patients' rights; it promotes interdisciplinary team work; it recommends deinstitutionalization, community services and, if necessary, inpatient services in general hospitals. However, there are many doubts as regards the way this will be put into practice. In most countries psychiatry is also threatened by a shortage of psychiatrists. In Argentina, the number of medical students who choose this branch of medicine as their specialty has declined the past twenty years, while the number of prospective psychologists has soared in the meantime. These are some of the reasons why many believe that psychiatry is being discredited. In this scenario, where there are both internal and external risks for psychiatry, our main professional interest is based on improving our patients' quality of life, which obviously includes their mental health. In order to achieve the best results we should avoid militant attitudes and the ideologization of reality, and be as creative as possible looking for the best way to do so."}, {"Title": "[Prevention of risky sexual behavior in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Sexual activity in psychiatric hospitals is a reality.

The patient didn't remember this fact after finding her and the infant by the police. The patient had no genetic predisposition in her history and had suffered head injury in her childhood. Her mother lost two of her siblings (miscarriage and early death of infant). The patient miscarried her first pregnancy, and then she had waited several years for the baby. The second pregnancy was at risk, the labor was premature and the infant was born with palatoschisis. In the maternity ward, the patient had difficulties with feeding the baby. She experienced fear about the baby's life, as well as the feeling of being neglected by the staff. In the psychiatry ward, the patient did not reveal any symptoms of mental illness. A memory gap covered the period of her flight. She had shown interest in her child and was motivated to nurse him by herself. The tendency to use immature defence mechanisms (denial and suppression), as well as mild cognitive dysfunctions were observed in psychological testing. Dissociative fugue was diagnosed.\nThe interaction of past and present traumatic experiences with cognitive dysfunctions and immature defence mechanisms could influence the patient's ability to cope with fear about the child negatively.

This polymorphism has been extensively studied in relation to alcohol, nicotine and drugs addiction, eating disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia and pharmacogenetics. The ANKK1 gene contains single serine/threonine kinase domain and 11 ankyrin repeats. ANKK1 belongs to RIP (Receptor-Interacting Protein) serine/threonine kinase family. These kinases are important in cell proliferation, differentiation and activate transcription factors. DRD2 gene is probably regulated by ANKK1 through NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor-kappaB). ANKK1 is activated by apomorphine-dopaminergic agonist, which indicates another link with the dopaminergic system.

This review explored the age at first presentation to orthodox clinical practice of African children with ASDs and their expressive language ability at presentation. METHODS: A literature search of case series and case reports of ASDs from Africa was done through PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, African Journals Online (AJOL), and archives of the Nigerian Journal of Psychiatry. Six articles included content relating to age of the child at first presentation to orthodox clinical practice and symptoms at presentation related to expressive language ability and therefore fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Suggestions are made to explain the observations emanating from the review. RESULTS: An excess of non-verbal over verbal cases of ASDs have been presenting to orthodox clinical practice and there is a common denominator of late presentation/diagnosis and in turn late intervention, with most cases presenting for the first time well above 8 years of age. Attempts to explain these observations included low levels of knowledge and awareness about ASDs in Africa; problems with help-seeking behaviour; and lack of mental healthcare facilities and trained personnel.

Yet aggression is a normal component of the innate behavior repertoire of most vertebrate animal species as well as of many invertebrates. Progress in understanding the etiology of disorders of aggressive behavior, whether genetic or environmental in nature, therefore requires an understanding of the brain circuitry that controls normal aggression. Efforts to understand this circuitry at the level of specific neuronal populations have been constrained by the limited resolution of classical methodologies, such as electrical stimulation and electrolytic lesion. The availability of new, genetically based tools for mapping and manipulating neural circuits at the level of specific, genetically defined neuronal subtypes provides an opportunity to investigate the functional organization of aggression circuitry with cellular resolution. However, these technologies are optimally applied in the mouse, where there has been surprisingly little traditional work on the functional neuroanatomy of aggression. Here we discuss recent, initial efforts to apply optogenetics and other state-of-the-art methods to the dissection of aggression circuitry in the mouse. We find, surprisingly, that neurons necessary and sufficient for inter-male aggression are located within the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, a structure traditionally associated with reproductive behavior. These neurons are intermingled with neurons activated during male-female mating, with approximately 20% overlap between the populations. We discuss the significance of these findings with respect to neuroethological and neuroanatomical perspectives on the functional organization of innate behaviors and their potential implications for psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Analysis of the anatomy of the Papez circuit and adjoining limbic system by fiber dissection techniques.", "Abstract": "Fiber dissection techniques were used to study the limbic system, in particular the Papez circuit. The course, length and anatomical relations of the structures that make up the Papez circuit were delineated. Ten previously frozen and formalin-fixed cadaveric human brains were used, and dissected according to the fiber dissection techniques of Klingler et al. (Schweiz Arch Neurol Psychiatry 1935;36:247-56). The primary dissection tools were thin and curved wooden and metallic spatulas with tips of varying sizes. We found that the Papez circuit (mean length: 350 mm) begins in the hippocampus and continues into the fornix to reach the mamillary body. From there, the mamillothalamic tract continues to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn connects to the cingulum by means of anterior thalamic radiations (mean length: 30 mm). The cingulum courses around the corpus callosum to end in the entorhinal cortex, which then projects to the hippocampus, thus completing the circuit. The average length and breadth of the mamillothalamic tract was 18 mm and 1.73 mm respectively. The average length of the cingulum was 19.6 cm and that of the fornix was 71 mm. The entire circuit was anatomically dissected first in situ in the hemisphere and was then reconstructed outside after removing its various components using fine fiber dissection under a surgical microscope. We found that fiber dissection elegantly delineates the anatomical subtleties of the Papez circuit and provides a three-dimensional perspective of the limbic system.

As clinical psychiatrists appeared as undisputed victors from the battle with social and mental hygienists, the entire narcological arsenal was subdued in order to serve the needs of mainstream psychiatry. However, what that 'mainstream' would be, was not entirely clear. When, in 1934, Aleksandr Rapoport insisted on the need for re-working narcological knowledge in line with the Marxist approach, he could only raise questions and recognise that there were almost no \"dialectically illuminated scientific data\" to address these questions. The maintenance treatment of opiate users, which emerged as the most effective one based on the results of a six-year study published in 1936, was definitely not attuned to the political and ideological environment of the late 1930s. Maintenance was rather considered as a temporary solution, in the absence of radical therapeutic measures to free Soviet society from \"narkomania.\" As the Great Terror swept across the Soviet Union, Stalin's regime achieved its objective of eliminating drug addiction from the surface of public life by driving opiate users deep underground and incarcerating many of them in prisons and the Gulag camps.

Factor analysis showed four themes among the qualities assessed (professional, personal values, relationship, academic-executive). A good mentor is defined by professional, relationship, and personal-values qualities. Mentors have significantly higher scores than psychiatrists for two themes (relationship and academic-executive).\nBeing a good mentor, in Asia, means being a good psychiatrist first and foremost but also requires additional relationship and academic-executive skills.

Results were compared with those of the 2007 students.\nThe introduction of the OSCE had little impact on the overall scores, but the 2007 students had significantly higher scores on the essay examination and long case, whereas the 2008 group had significantly higher scores on the OSCE (versus the OE for the 2007 group). In comparing the top 10 scoring students from the two classes, the 2007-year students had significantly higher overall scores, both on end-of-course tests and the annual examinations. In particular, the scores for the OSCE exams for the 2008 class were significantly lower than the scores for the OE in the 2007 class.\nThe higher scores on OSCE in Year 2008 suggest that students performed better on clinical skills and professional development than recall on the factual-knowledge domains.

The data were further tested for redundancy by Cronbach alpha.\nThe investigation yielded five dimensions, but, on filtering the information, there was good independent correlation in four of the five dimensions emerging from the analysis. These were (1) inspiration from medical school; (2) the stigma of psychiatry; (3) the merits of psychiatry as scientific medicine; and (4) the effectiveness of treatment, from which a suggested edited scale emerged.\nOn examining the APS scale using principal-components analysis, the authors found clusters of questions around four themes that do seem intuitively relevant for attitudes toward psychiatry.

Initially, psychiatrists hoped that statistics would reveal the benefits of institutional care. Nevertheless, their fascination with statistics was far removed from the growing importance of epidemiology generally. The impetus to create an epidemiology of mental disorders came from the emerging social sciences, whose members were concerned with developing a scientific understanding of individual and social behavior and applying it to a series of pressing social problems. Beginning in the 1920s, the interest of psychiatric epidemiologists shifted to the ways that social environments contributed to the development of mental disorders. This emphasis dramatically changed after 1980 when the policy focus of psychiatric epidemiology became the early identification and prevention of mental illness in individuals.\nThis article reviews the major developments in psychiatric epidemiology over the past century and a half.\nThe lack of an adequate classification system for mental illness has precluded the field of psychiatric epidemiology from providing causal understandings that could contribute to more adequate policies to remediate psychiatric disorders. Because of this gap, the policy influence of psychiatric epidemiology has stemmed more from institutional and ideological concerns than from knowledge about the causes of mental disorders.\nMost of the problems that have bedeviled psychiatric epidemiology since its inception remain unresolved. In particular, until epidemiologists develop adequate methods to measure mental illnesses in community populations, the policy contributions of this field will not be fully realized."}, {"Title": "Seclusion and restraint in psychiatry: patients' experiences and practical suggestions on how to improve practices and use alternatives.", "Abstract": "This study explored psychiatric inpatients' experiences of, and their suggestions for, improvement of seclusion/restraint, and alternatives to their use in Finland.\nThe data were collected by focused interviews (n= 30) and were analyzed with inductive content analysis.\nPatients' perspectives received insufficient attention during seclusion/restraint processes. Improvements (e.g., humane treatment) and alternatives (e.g., empathetic patient-staff interaction) to seclusion/restraint, as suggested by the patients, focused on essential parts of nursing practice but have not been largely adopted.\nPatients' basic needs have to be met, and patient-staff interaction has to also continue during seclusion/restraint.

However, there are no published guidelines or consensuses on how to communicate potential benefits and harm to patients and payers.\nThe goal of this review was to identify key elements for communication between clinicians, patients, and payers to achieve maximal benefits and minimal risk.\nLiterature published from January 1980 to July 2011 and cited on MEDLINE was searched using the terms communication, benefit, harm, effectiveness, cost, cost-effectiveness, psychiatry, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. Elements related to communicating benefits and/or harm to patients and payers were identified, with only key elements discussed in detail here.\nEvidence-based medicine, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or harm (NNTH), and the likelihood of being helped or harmed (LHH) have been advocated as the basis for communication in all specialties of medicine. Phase-dependent communication of benefits and harm is novel, especially in patients with different phases of illness, such as bipolar disorder. Duration-dependent (short-term versus long-term) communication is essential for all psychiatric disorders to reduce the burden of relapse and adverse events with long-term treatment. For drugs with multiple therapeutic indications, a disease-dependent approach is crucial to maximize benefits and minimize harm. The exclusion of comorbid psychiatric disorders in pivotal efficacy trials affects their generalizability. Communicating cost (direct versus indirect) is an essential component in reducing health care expenditures. The results of available cost-effectiveness analyses of psychiatric pharmacotherapy have been inconsistent and/or contradictory.\nEvidence-based communication of potential benefits and harm to patients and payers, using NNTB, NNTH, and LHH, should be the key principle that guides decision making.

Development of policies regarding these issues may be informed in a variety of ways by the views of key stakeholders: patients, family members, healthcare professionals, and the general public. Here, we review empirical studies of attitudes towards genetic testing among these groups. Patients and family members show strong interest in diagnostic and predictive genetic testing, and to a considerable extent psychiatrists share their enthusiasm. Prenatal test utilization seems likely to depend both on parental views on abortion and the seriousness of the disorder. Parents show a surprising degree of interest in predictive testing of children, even when there are no preventive interventions available. Many persons report themselves ready to alter their lifestyles and plans for marriage and family in response to test results. Respondents also fear negative consequences, from discrimination to being unable to cope with knowledge of their \"genetic fate.\" Empirical studies of beliefs about genetic testing suggest tests are likely to be embraced widely, but the studies have methodologic limitations, reducing the certainty of their conclusions, and indicating a need for further research with more representative samples."}, {"Title": "Young advisors to the Ombudsman as co-operators of child psychiatry.", "Abstract": "In Slovakia, Legislation regulates the rights of individuals with mental disorders.

This process is manifested by continuous changes in cognitive, motor, speech/language, psychological and sensory modulation skills and consequently, in the behavior of the developing child. It is a period of neuron-plasticity, in which the CNS structure and functioning are very sensitive to environmental influences. These influences could be positive or negative. On the one hand, early protective factors, like secure attachment, increase the resilience of the very young child against stressors and against the development of psychopathology; but on the other hand, there is a high vulnerability to early insults of any kind. It has been demonstrated that a high percentage of psychopathology in adult life has his roots in early childhood, and that early diagnosis, which leads to early therapeutic interventions, decreases morbidity and the later life consequences of the disorders.

In addition, literature was supplied by experts and articles were located by the snowball method.\nStigmatisation constitutes a major obstacle in the psychiatric and somatic care that gps provide for patients with a psychiatric disorder. Although such patients have a higher somatic vulnerability as a result of their psychiatric problems, they receive fewer technical and exploratory investigations than other categories of patients. Medical students too have a negative attitude towards patients with a psychiatric disorder. More education and training could lead to less stigmatisation but the effect would probably be only temporary. Personal experience is the main factor that leads to greater empathy.\nThe literature suggests that psychiatric patients are victims of self-inflicted stigmatisation and stigmatisation by society and doctors. This leads to social exclusion and poorer healthcare.

Twenty states and the federal government have developed a seemingly convenient way to reduce this risk. They have passed statutes that allow for the involuntary (often lifetime) psychiatric commitment of mentally disordered sexual offenders after prison time is up. In three separate cases, the Supreme Court has accepted the constitutionality of this procedure, but only if the offender's dangerousness is caused by a mental disorder and is not a manifestation of simple criminality. The idea that paraphilic rape should be an official category in the psychiatric diagnostic manual has been explicitly rejected by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, and, recently, DSM-5. Despite this, paraphilia NOS, nonconsent, is still frequently used by mental health evaluators in SVP cases to provide a mental disorder diagnosis that legitimizes psychiatric commitment and makes it appear constitutional. This commentary will show how the diagnosis paraphilia NOS, nonconsent, is based on a fundamental misreading of the original intent of the DSM-IV Paraphilia Workgroup and represents a misuse of psychiatry, all in the admittedly good cause of protecting public safety."}, {"Title": "Restraint and seclusion in psychiatric treatment settings: regulation, case law, and risk management.", "Abstract": "Changing federal regulations, civil rights and malpractice cases, and new treatment methods have influenced the use of restraint and seclusion (R&S) in inpatient psychiatric treatment settings, such that restraint and seclusion today are among the most highly regulated practices in psychiatry. Despite increased pressure from regulatory bodies and litigation, the use of R&S remains controversial and risky. These procedures can compromise safety if performed incorrectly or monitored inadequately, but intervention by restraint or seclusion may be necessary to maintain safety on the treatment unit, especially during emergencies. Case law and medical research have demonstrated the importance of a patient-focused, treatment-oriented approach toward risk management. Analysis of specific clinical scenarios can help to develop risk mitigation strategies that are therapeutically conceptualized rather than driven by regulation. Insights drawn from clinical cases that have resulted in litigation can offer an opportunity to develop an approach oriented to patient care from a clinical or risk management perspective.

Faced with an empty drug pipeline and numerous failures of potential new drugs in clinical trials, many large pharmaceutical companies have been shrinking or even closing down their research divisions that focus on central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In this paper, we argue that many of the difficulties facing CNS drug discovery stem from a lack of robustness in pre-clinical (i.e., non-human animal) testing. There are two main sources for this lack of robustness. First, there is the lack of replicability of many results from the pre-clinical stage, which we argue is driven by a combination of publication bias and inappropriate selection of statistical and experimental designs. Second, there is the frequent failure to translate results in non-human animals to parallel results in humans in the clinic. This limitation can only be overcome by developing new behavioral tests for non-human animals that have predictive, construct, and etiological validity. Here, we present these translational difficulties as a \"grand challenge\" to researchers from comparative cognition, who are well positioned to provide new methods for testing behavior and cognition in non-human animals. These new experimental protocols will need to be both statistically robust and target behavioral and cognitive processes that allow for better connection with human CNS disorders. Our hope is that this downturn in industrial research may represent an opportunity to develop new protocols that will re-kindle the search for more effective and safer drugs for CNS disorders."}, {"Title": "Neurocognitive endophenotypes of impulsivity and compulsivity: towards dimensional psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A key criticism of the main diagnostic tool in psychiatry, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-IV), is that it lacks a biological footing.

We focus on the constructs of impulsivity and compulsivity as key examples of the approach and discuss their possible cross-diagnostic significance, applying them to co-morbidities and commonalities across a range of disorders (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance dependence, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders).

Although much praised worldwide, Lombroso was also the target of scathing criticism and unmitigated condemnation. Examination of Lombroso's method of data collection and analysis reveals his weakness. Indeed, his approach was extremely naive, simplistic and uncritical, aimed at irrefutably demonstrating the hypotheses that he championed, without exercising the methodological caution that was already beginning to characterize scientific research in his day. However, we must acknowledge that his biological theories of crime are undergoing new developments as a result of the recent success of biological psychiatry. On the other hand we should recognize that his work was not limited to his biological central theory; rather, it covered a range of cues and concepts, for the most part ignored, that demonstrate his interest in the economic, cultural and social factors that impact on crime. For these reasons, Lombroso appears to have anticipated many modern conceptions regarding delinquent behavior and criminal justice, such as those of restorative justice, the so-called \"situational\" theories of criminal behavior and white collar crime."}, {"Title": "Imaging trait anxiety in high anxiety F344 rats: Focus on the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.", "Abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an important method in clinical psychiatry research whereas there are still only few comparable preclinical investigations. Herein, we report that fMRI in rats can provide key information regarding brain areas underlying anxiety behavior. Perfusion as surrogate for neuronal activity was measured by means of arterial spin labeling-based fMRI in various brain areas of high anxiety F344 rats and control Sprague-Dawley rats. In one of these areas, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), c-Fos labeling was compared between these two strains with immunolabeling. The effects of a neurotoxic ibotenic acid lesion of the dmPFC in F344 rats were examined in a social approach-avoidance anxiety procedure and fMRI. Regional brain activity of high anxiety F344 rats was different in selective cortical and subcortical areas as compared to that of low anxiety Sprague-Dawley rats; the largest difference (i.e. hyperactivity) was measured in the dmPFC. Independently, c-Fos labeling confirmed that F344 rats show increased dmPFC activity. The functional role was confirmed by neurotoxic lesion of the dmPFC that reversed the high anxiety-like behavior and partially normalized the brain activity pattern of F344 rats. The current findings may have translational value as increased activity is reported in an equivalent cortical area in patients with social anxiety, suggesting that pharmacological or functional inhibition of activity in this brain area should be explored to alleviate social anxiety in patients."}, {"Title": "[The specificities of the assessment of quality of life in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Psychiatry, like other medical disciplines, has integrated the assessment of quality of life into the various parameters necessary for the monitoring of a patient's healthcare project.

Fifty-four of those teams (360 individuals) also participated in an observation session simulating problem-solving team meetings. Data were reduced to a number of indexes: self-assessed/perceived equality, functional influence and efficiency; and observed verbal dominance/activity and problem-solving capacity. Perceived status differences within the teams appeared moderate, irrespective of professional belonging. With respect to verbal dominance during meetings, however, the findings revealed a hierarchy with psychologists, physicians and social workers at the top together with special education teachers. No relationship was found between self-assessed efficiency and actual problem-solving nor between observed verbal activity and problem-solving. The findings suggest that different problems may demand different prerequisites to be solved effectively: successful solving of simple convergent problems correlated negatively with equality, whereas functional influence was a predictor of success with respect to divergent, complex problem-solving.

With an increasing number of ultra-high field MR systems worldwide possibilities of higher spatial and temporal resolution in combination with increased sensitivity and specificity are expected to advance detailed imaging of distinct cortical brain areas and subcortical structures. One target region of particular importance to applications in psychiatry and psychology is the amygdala. However, ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging of these ventral brain regions is a challenging endeavor that requires particular methodological considerations. Ventral brain areas are particularly prone to signal losses arising from strong magnetic field inhomogeneities along susceptibility borders. In addition, physiological artifacts from respiration and cardiac action cause considerable fluctuations in the MR signal. Here we show that, despite these challenges, fMRI data from the amygdala may be obtained with high temporal and spatial resolution combined with increased signal-to-noise ratio. Maps of neural activation during a facial emotion discrimination paradigm at 7 T are presented and clearly show the gain in percental signal change compared to 3T results, demonstrating the potential benefits of ultra-high field functional MR imaging also in ventral brain areas."}, {"Title": "European guidance: a project of the European Psychiatric Association.", "Abstract": "Evidence based medicine is a cornerstone of modern medicine including psychiatry.

Actually, it is a syndrome that interests many specialties, especially ophthalmology, geriatrics, neurology and psychiatry. \"Atypical CBS\" or \"CBS plus\" was introduced to designate any kind of visual hallucinations that could be considered as a CBS but accompanied by a low level of insight, a possible cognitive decline, other hallucinatory modalities etc. Since all patients suffering from CBS have to be psychiatrically evaluated, psychological and psychiatric implications of their syndrome have to be well understood in order to better manage them. These psychiatric and psychological implications are: the relationship between the CBS and dementia, the psychological reaction of the patients towards their hallucinations and psychiatric comorbidities that could be developed during the course of the syndrome.\nA research via MEDLINE for all the articles published in French or in English between January 1999 and December 2009 was done using the following keywords Charles-Bonnet, psychiatric comorbidities and Charles-Bonnet syndrome, Charles-Bonnet syndrome and dementia, psychological reaction and Charles-Bonnet syndrome.\nAlthough some studies report an association between the CBS and dementia, the majority of these studies do not confirm this association and point towards an atypical initial presentation of the syndrome. The psychological reaction accompanying the visual hallucinations of the typical CBS is variable (mild distress, indifference, pleasure). Patients suffering from a typical CBS conserve a full insight during the course of the syndrome. A positive personal psychiatric history or a concomitant psychiatric disorder changes the clinical presentation of the syndrome.\nOur research allowed us to define the following diagnostic criteria for the atypical CBS: 1) diminished level or absence of insight towards the visual hallucinations; 2) presence of a mild cognitive decline; 3) presence of an atypical psychological reaction towards the visual hallucinations as in the case of a severe and prolonged stressful reaction; 4) presence of other hallucinatory modalities; 5) presence of a positive personal psychiatric history or a concomitant psychiatric disorder. Each patient suffering from CBS should be initially evaluated psychiatrically and neurologically in order to confirm or to eliminate the presence of the most common causes of visual hallucinations. In the presence of a lowered visual acuity and a conserved cognitive functioning, the typical CBS is diagnosed after eliminating more common disorders. Once this diagnosis is established, patients should be evaluated in order to rule out the presence of an atypical clinical presentation.\nAtypical CBS is a syndrome that could be eventually associated with dementia, accompanied with a major depressive disorder or another psychiatric disorder, or with vulnerability towards psychiatric disorders. Patients suffering from atypical CBS should be closely followed psychiatrically and neurologically. Patients suffering from the typical CBS should also benefit from a psychiatric follow-up, due to their multiple psychiatric vulnerability factors and their possible management with psychotropic drugs."}, {"Title": "[Communicate instead of stigmatizing - does social contact with a depressed person change attitudes of medical students towards psychiatric disorders?

The control group comprised 98 students who did only the psychiatry practical. Both at the beginning and end of the practical, students filled in a questionnaire, among others, on cognitive and affective dimensions and social distance. The questionnaire was preceded by 4 different case vignettes describing a fictional person (a man/woman suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and a man/woman suffering from unipolar depression).\nThe results of our study show that before students took their practical, female students felt more pro-social and socially closer, but at the same time more fearful, in relation to mentally ill persons than male students. Females also considered psychiatric illnesses as better treatable than males. Basically, students felt socially closer towards depressed persons than towards schizophrenic patients who were also perceived to be more severely ill, more dangerous and more unpredictable. Students with personal contact with a female depressed patient during their practical demonstrated significant reduction of social distance and fear in relation to depressed persons, and in the sense of a generalization effect, there was also a significant reduction in their assessment of the danger and unpredictability of schizophrenic patients. As against this, students who did only their compulsory practical developed an even stronger stereotype of schizophrenic patients as being dangerous and unpredictable. Additionally, contact with a depressed person during practical resulted in a better assessment of the treatability of this illness. Students who participated in the compulsory practical alone reduced their fear towards depressed persons and increased prosocial feelings towards schizophrenic patients.\nCompared to students who did only the psychiatry practical, additional contact with a depressed person resulted in major changes in attitude, in particular, in relation to the stereotype of schizophrenic patients being \"dangerous\".

The results confirm an increase risk for mental abnormalities in children of psychiatric patients. This risk varies with existing risk and protective factors, which can be partially influenced. Therefore children of mentally ill parents with problems in their mental development should be detected early. Even if genetic risk factors cannot be changed reducing known psychosocial risk factors and promotion protective factors can significantly influence a healthy development of these vulnerable children."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry movie club: A novel way to teach psychiatry.", "Abstract": "For decades, films across the world have entertained people and affected their attitudes regarding certain issues and conditions.

The aetiology of aggressive behaviour is multifactorial and can be driven by psychosis, impulsivity, psychopathy, intoxication, cognitive impairment, or a combination of all of these. Recognition of the different factors behind the aggression can inform medication selection and the relative need for specific environmental and behavioural interventions in a forensic psychiatric setting. Acute agitation needs to be managed quickly and effectively before further escalation of the behavioural dyscontrol occurs. Benzodiazepines and/or antipsychotic medications are often used and can be given intramuscularly to achieve a rapid onset of action. Available are intramuscular preparations of second-generation antipsychotics that have similar efficacy to lorazepam and haloperidol in reducing agitation, but are well tolerated and not associated with the extrapyramidal adverse effects, including akathisia, that can plague the older first-generation antipsychotics. The longer-term management of persistent aggressive behaviour can be quite complex. A major obstacle is that the causality of aggressive events can differ from patient to patient, and also from event to event in the same patient. For patients with schizophrenia and persistent aggressive behaviour, clozapine is recommended both for its superior antipsychotic effect and its specific anti-hostility effect.

Category A agents were identified and specific attention was paid to the management issues that plastic surgeons might face in the event that these agents are used in an attack.\nDisease entities reviewed were smallpox, anthrax, plague, viral hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, and botulism. For each agent, we presented the microbiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, potential for weaponization, medical management, and surgical issues related to the plastic surgeon.\nThis article is the first attempt at addressing preparedness for bioterrorism in the plastic surgery community. Many other fields have already started a similar process. This article represents a first step in developing evidence-based consensus guidelines and recommendations for the management of biological terrorism for plastic surgeons."}, {"Title": "Availability of psychiatric consultation-liaison services as an integral component of palliative care programs at Japanese cancer hospitals.", "Abstract": "Collaboration between psychiatry and palliative medicine has the potential to enhance the quality of medical practice. The integration between palliative care and psychiatry has been attempted only in discrete medical settings and is not yet firmly established as an institution. Our objective was to determine the availability and degree of integration between psychiatric consultation-liaison services and palliative care in Japan.\nA survey questionnaire was mailed to consultation-liaison psychiatrists at 375 government-designated cancer hospitals regarding their consultation-liaison services.\nA total of 375 survey questionnaires were sent to consultation-liaison psychiatrists, with a response rate of 64.8%. Designated cancer hospitals with approved palliative care teams were significantly more likely to have a consultation-liaison psychiatrist in the palliative care team than those in non-approved palliative care teams [80/80 (100%) versus 110/153 (73%); P= 0.008]. Approved palliative care teams had double the number of referrals, conducted rounds more frequently and held conferences more frequently. Psychiatrists of the approved palliative care teams spent more of their time on palliative care consultations, adhered more closely to consultation processes and contributed more actively to the integration of developmental perspectives in treatment plans.\nIn Japan, most designated cancer hospitals with approved palliative care teams were more likely to integrate psychiatric consultation-liaison services into their palliative care programs. Systematic strategies for integration between palliative care and consultation-liaison psychiatry would contribute to the provision of appropriate psychosocial care for cancer patients and families at all stages."}, {"Title": "The future of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "There is widespread concern among psychiatrists that the profession is in crisis and that it faces an array of external and internal challenges. Indeed, some observers have questioned whether the psychiatrist is an endangered species. This paper argues that medical specialties can become extinct as the case of the apothecaries exemplifies. The training template for psychiatry in the UK was put in place 40 years ago and there is a need to carefully examine whether it is still fit for purpose. Advances in theoretical knowledge and in basic understanding of psychiatric disorders have not significantly influenced the structure of clinical placements; rather it is service developments and administrative demands that have been the determinants of changes in training. Urgent action is required to address the need for reform of training that will ensure the future of psychiatry as a profession."}, {"Title": "European Psychiatric Association guidance on the conflicts of interest.", "Abstract": "Conflict of interest (COI) is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgments or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced and compromised by a secondary interest. It might arise in clinical practice, research, and education, and might include individuals and institutions. Primary interests include the pursuit of well-being of patients, ensuring the independence of medical education, and protecting the objectivity and integrity of medical research. Secondary interests might involve financial interests, pursuit of recognition and professional career advancement. COI might result from the multiple roles of physicians in patient care, research, administration, provision of expert opinion and policy advice, and consultancy to commercial organizations. The purpose of the COI policy is to protect the interests of the patients, strengthen the integrity of the profession, and preserve public trust in medicine and psychiatry. The aim of the guidance is to eventually prevent these conflicts from arising rather than remediate them ex post. It is desirable to identify factors that might lead to their occurrence, offer a framework for their recognition and assessment, introduce the principles and standards of their disclosure, and provide recommendations for their transparent resolution."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant augmentation and combination in unipolar depression: strong guidance, weak foundations.", "Abstract": "Depression will be the second leading contributor to the global burden of disease by 2020. In Ireland, in 2009, 6061 people were hospitalised with depressive disorders. This represents a significant economic and social burden. There is growing awareness of the difficulty in treating depression with medications alone. The likelihood that a patient will achieve remission with the first antidepressant tried is around 30%, and the rates are similar for the second antidepressant tried. This falls to around 15% after three trials. Many patients are exposed to pharmacotherapy for extended periods of time with little beneficial effect, but often with side-effects. Patients are therefore in great need of clear information with regard to their chance of success. Clinicians are in need of clear guidance on prescribing strategies which have proven efficacy. However, this guidance often discusses treatment strategies based on varying levels of evidence. Guiding bodies may approach the problem from varying perspectives. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has a clear government mandate with regard to provision of not only effective but cost-effective treatments. The British Association of Psychopharmacology (BAP) is an independent body of interested researchers and therefore may discuss prescribing options from the point of view of tertiary care institutions, and university centres. The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust publish the popular Maudsley guidelines. These are perhaps more pragmatic in nature, but include very low levels of evidence, including case series. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) is an independent member association which also publishes guidelines. These are published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and the latest guidelines were published in October 2010. All these bodies attempt to weigh their advice according to the level of evidence available and aim to provide clinical guidance in difficult situations. The burden on guiding organisations is to provide some direction and clarity in areas that are often unclear or controversial. Clinical guidelines are one method of providing support and guidance to busy clinicians. However, this clinician-centered approach has limitations. The onus is on the authors of the guidance to provide ever-more treatment options. This may mean that conclusions about the efficacy of medications is overstated or the limitations of the literature not fully explored in explanatory notes."}, {"Title": "Audit of documentation of allergies in a psychiatric inpatient unit.", "Abstract": "This audit aimed to: identify the level of allergy documentation in admission notes, case notes and medication charts in the Department of Psychiatry, Portlaoise; establish the degree of compliance to the gold standard guidelines; highlight areas requiring further improvement and make realistic recommendations to ensure better compliance with the stipulated guidelines on allergy documentation; and re-audit after six months.\nGold standard guidelines on allergy documentation were obtained from various sources. Audit was performed over three days during which data was collected from the allergy section of medication charts, current case notes and original admission notes in both acute and long-stay wards. Recommendations were made and some were adopted, changes to practice were implemented for six months; at which time re-audit was performed.\nThe initial audit revealed that: the allergy section was completed in 25% of medication charts; only 12% of current case notes had any documentation of allergy status; an for the original admission notes, the allergy section was documented in 65% of notes. Based on these results, a formal initial assessment proforma with a designated allergy section was introduced and a renewed awareness of the importance of the documentation of allergy status was actively promoted amongst non consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs). Six months later, re-audit showed that: in the medication charts there was a significant improvement in the level of compliance with documentation of allergy status (allergy or NKDA) in the allergy section up from 25% to 58.1%; in the current case notes, there was only marginal improvement in the level of compliance on the front of case notes from 12-19.1%; and in the original admission notes, there was also considerable improvement in the level of compliance with documentation of allergy status up from 65% to 80.9%.\nThis audit improved the level of documentation of allergy sections in the relevant areas and therefore helped in preventing avoidable and potentially fatal allergic reactions.

A recent Seanad Bill proposed removing the option of administering ECT to involuntary patients who do not provide informed consent. This controversial issue has stimulated extensive media and stakeholder debate. In this study we explored the attitudes of consultant psychiatrists towards prescribing ECT for involuntary patients.\nWe compiled a current list of consultant psychiatrists attached to approved centres nationwide. We sent a study specific questionnaire to consultants of all adult psychiatry specialties.\nFrom the 249 individualised anonymous questionnaires posted, 164 (66%) were returned and analysed.

For involuntary patients who lack capacity and are unable to consent, 157 (96%) consultant psychiatrists stated that they would and six (4%) that they would not prescribe ECT. For involuntary patients who have capacity to consent but are unwilling to do so, 52 (32%) consultant psychiatrists stated they would and 104 (63%) would not prescribe ECT.\nThe overwhelming majority of consultant psychiatrists would prescribe ECT for involuntary patients who are unable to consent to this treatment.

Impairment of PPI has been reported in several psychiatric diseases, particularly schizophrenia, where PPI is considered a candidate intermediate phenotype (endophenotype) of the disease. Recent findings from a variety of research areas have provided important evidence regarding PPI impairment. Human brain imaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and frontal and parietal cortical regions in PPI. In addition, several genetic polymorphisms, including variations in the genes coding for Catechol O-methyltransferase, Neuregulin 1, nuclear factor kappa-B subunit 3 and serotonin-2A receptor were related to PPI; and these findings support PPI as a polygenetic trait that involves several neurotransmitter pathways. Early psychosis studies suggest that PPI disruption is present before the onset of psychosis. Also, discrepancy of PPI impairment between children and adults can be found in other psychiatric diseases, such as autistic spectrum disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder, and comprehensive investigation of startle response might contribute to understand the impairment of the neural circuitry in psychiatric diseases. Finally, recent studies with both Asian and Caucasian subjects indicate that patients with schizophrenia exhibit impaired PPI, and impaired sensorimotor gating might be a global common psychophysiological feature of schizophrenia. In conclusion, studies of PPI have successfully contributed to a better understanding of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor gating and will certainly be most valuable in devising future approaches that aim to investigate the complex pathogenesis of psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "[Mental disorders in psychiatric outpatients in Spain].", "Abstract": "The aim of data presented is to increase knowledge about the morbidity and impact of mental disorders in Spanish psychiatry.

We explore the individual trajectories of relative change in depression severity to establish what proportion of individuals experience early and late onset of improvement.\nLongitudinal latent class analysis was applied in a secondary analysis of data obtained from the Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study. In the GENDEP trial, conducted in 9 European academic psychiatry centers from July 2004 to June 2008, 811 treatment-seeking adult subjects with DSM-IV major depression received escitalopram or nortriptyline for 12 weeks. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale measurements were taken weekly. The secondary analysis reported in this article was conducted in 2010.\nA model with 9 latent classes provided a good description of the individual trajectories of symptom change over time. These classes included 3 nonresponder classes, 3 classes with varying degrees of improvement concentrated in the first 3 weeks (early improvement), and 3 classes with varying degrees of improvement that was more prominent in the second 3 weeks than in the first 3 weeks (delayed improvement). More than half of the subjects who eventually reached remission showed a pattern of delayed improvement, and their eventual outcome could not be predicted from early time points.

Only the emotional role limitation predicts the presence of depression, whereas only self-defeating, obsessive, paranoid, and passive aggressive personality predict the emotional role limitation.\nPatients with MDD have personality and disability problems. PDs in depression contribute to disability. Our results demonstrated that the emotional role limitation is the unique sub-scale that predicts the MDD group."}, {"Title": "Responsibility of the therapist for the patients' actions (Tarasoff Rules): position of the psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "Patient confidentiality and the therapists responsibility to society may present a challenge in the therapeutic relationship between the psychiatrist and the patient.

Since its approval, subspecialty training programs in PM have been created in the United States. Training programs are designed to educate trainees in the psychiatric care of the complex medically ill, and are centered around development of certain core competencies by trainees. Completion of an ACGME-accredited training program in PM allows the graduate to sit for the PM subspecialty board examination. Development of centers with academic PM programs will lead to an increase in the depth of knowledge about the care of the complex medically ill with psychiatric comorbidities, and may thus lead to improved medical outcomes for this population.

This review combines perspectives from psychiatry, psychology and neurology to identify and discuss key problems with the current diagnostic DSM-IV criteria for conversion disorder and to make the following proposals for DSM-5: (a) abandoning the label \"conversion disorder\" and replacing it with an alternative term that is both theoretically neutral and potentially more acceptable to patients and practitioners; (b) relegating the requirements for \"association of psychological factors\" and the \"exclusion of feigning\" to the accompanying text; (c) adding a criterion requiring clinical findings of internal inconsistency or incongruity with recognised neurological or medical disease and altering the current 'disease exclusion' criteria to one in which the symptom must not be 'better explained' by a disease if present, (d) adding a 'cognitive symptoms' subtype. We also discuss whether conversion symptoms are better classified with other somatic symptom disorders or with dissociative disorders and how we might address the potential heterogeneity of conversion symptoms in classification."}, {"Title": "[Introducing treatment for dissociative identity disorder].", "Abstract": "This paper is a case presentation and study of the introduction of treatment for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Since one manifestation of the pathology of DID is that sufferers avoid relying on others, at the start of treatment we try to stabilise the relationship between clinicians and patients; that is to say, we aim to build a treatment relationship which will be able to gradually overcome the patients' dread of relying on clinicians. In parallel with this we undertake a thorough psychiatric assessment of their condition. This is a standard treatment plan, which follows the general principles of clinical psychiatry. On the other hand, the specialist aspect of DID treatment calls for handling the unique behaviours of a group of mutually opposed alternating personalities appropriately, while always paying consistent attention to the traumatic memories which are connected to the formation and maintenance of the condition. This paper presents the first DID case which the author has taken charge of. There were some difficulties in the early stages of treatment, but after modifying some parts to acknowledge the alternating personalities as independent personalities in face-to-face interviews and psychological education for families, the stabilisation of the treatment structure progressed gradually and the stability of the relationship between clinicians and patients itself has become the focus."}, {"Title": "[Dissociative disorder--the concept and its history].", "Abstract": "Dissociative disorder is both an old and a new mental disorder. Its forerunner, hysteria, was a poorly understood and often grossly misconceived notion that might date back as far as human societies existed, but it has been treated as a new disorder since it emerged in the DSM-III. A century ago, Sigmund Freud and Pierre Janet, two giants in the history of dynamic psychiatry, were deeply influenced by dissociative phenomena, and created their own theory of human mind with very different orientations. The reemergence of dissociative disorders in the current psychiatry has several implications. It helps clinicians understand mental conditions that they did not know how to define and classify based on the traditional psychiatry. It also allows clinicians to identify a population that was misdiagnosed with other diagnostic categories, such as borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy.", "Abstract": "To examine the evidence regarding takotsubo cardiomyopathy as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\nSearches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1966-August 2011) were conducted.\nPublished studies and case reports that mentioned takotsubo cardiomyopathy following ECT were reviewed.\nTwelve case reports were available for review. There were 7 documented cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 4 cases of myocardial stunning, and 1 case of cardiogenic shock following ECT. Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not mentioned in 5 of the cases, some clinical characteristics were consistent with this diagnosis. Left ventricular ejection fraction and the electrocardiogram returned to normal within a few days in the majority of the cases. All cases were in women, the majority of whom were postmenopausal (average age 64 years). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy developed after a single course of ECT in 6 of the cases, while the syndrome developed after more than 1 course in the other 6 cases. ECT was successfully readministered without syndrome recurrence in 4 of the cases, but only after 3 of the 4 patients received a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocking agent prior to each subsequent therapy session. The \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents used were esmolol in 1 case and labetolol in the other 2.\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious but transient potential complication of electroconvulsive therapy. Limited evidence indicates that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may help prevent its reoccurrence in patients needing further electroconvulsive treatment.

This column focuses on psychiatric/psychological aspects of mitigation in criminal matters."}, {"Title": "What do the terms \"drug-specific response/remission rate\" and \"placebo\" really mean?", "Abstract": "This column addresses two important clinical trial issues in psychiatry. Placebo is frequently misrepresented by the media as representing nothing. In fact, placebo represents everything except the investigational treatment. That is an important distinction. The second is the concept of the drug-specific response/remission rate. While manufacturers frequently cite the overall response/remission rate observed in the group treated with their drug in their clinical trials, that is not the true rate specifically attributable to the drug. Instead, it represents the combined rate due to both the drug and the non-drug (or \"placebo\") therapeutic aspects of the trial. To determine the drug-specific response/remission rate, the placebo response/remission rate must be subtracted from the overall response/remission rate observed in the drug treated group. That is because the drug treated group receives both the therapeutic benefit of the drug and all of the nondrug therapeutic benefit of the trial (i.e., the \"placebo\" condition). Viewed from this perspective, only about one out of four patients with major depression responds specifically to either selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. These principles are important if one is to put the recent controversy about the effectiveness of modern antidepressant treatment into perspective. The critical issue is not how good the drugs are but rather how serious our diseases are. When evaluating the current antidepressants, the principal issue is not how many patients with major depression they treat but instead how well they treat the patients they do treat. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study has clearly documented that approximately 40% of patients with major depression do not respond to existing antidepressants. That finding is consistent with the concept that there are likely many forms of depressive illness, only a fraction of which are responsive to drugs that work via effects on biogenic amines."}, {"Title": "How close is evidence to truth in evidence-based treatment of mental disorders?", "Abstract": "Given the importance of the term 'evidence' in evidence-based medicine (EBM), the meaning of this term is evaluated, going back to the philosophical tradition and current meaning of the terms 'evidence' and 'truth'.

Non-invasive ultra-high-field, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a window to the mind, making it possible to image changes in brain activity across distributed, integrated neural circuits with high temporal and spatial resolution. In theory, changes in brain function, anatomy, and chemistry can be recorded in the same animal from early life into old age under stable or changing environmental conditions. This prospective capability of animal imaging to follow changes in brain neurobiology after genetic or environmental insult has great value to the fields of psychiatry and neurology and probably stands as the key advantage of MRI over other methods in the neuroscience toolbox. In addition, awake animal imaging offers the ability to record signal changes across the entire brain in seconds. When combined with the use of 3D segmented, annotated, brain atlases, and computational analysis, it is possible to reconstruct distributed, integrated neural circuits or 'fingerprints' of brain activity. These fingerprints can be used to characterize the activity and function of new psychotherapeutics in preclinical development and to study the neurobiology of integrated neural circuits controlling cognition and emotion. In this review, we describe the methods used to image awake animals and the recent advances in the radiofrequency electronics, pulse sequences, and the development of 3D segmented atlases and software for image analysis. Results from pharmacological MRI studies and from studies using provocation paradigms to elicit emotional responses are provided as a small sample of the number of different applications possible with awake animal imaging."}, {"Title": "Homicide and bipolar I disorder: a 22-year study.", "Abstract": "Non-serious offenses in manic phase have been mainly studied in patients with bipolar disorder.

Even the new generation of medications may not hold significant advantages over older drugs. In fact, there may be additional safety risks with polypharmacy being so widespread. Washout, as a clinical tool, is rarely done in medication management today. Studies have shown that augmenting therapy with additional medications resulted in 9.1%-34.1% dropouts due to intolerance of the augmentation, whereas studies of medication washout demonstrated only 5.9%-7.8% intolerance to the washout procedure. These perils justify reconsideration of medication washout before deciding on augmentation. There are unwarranted fears and resistance in the medical community toward medication washout, especially at the moment a physician is trying to decide whether to washout or add more medications to the treatment regimen. However, medication washout provides unique benefits to the physician: it establishes a new baseline of the disorder, helps identify medication efficacy from their adverse effects, and provides clarity of diagnosis and potential reduction of drug treatments, drug interactions, and costs. It may also reduce overall adverse events, not to mention a potential to reduce liability. After washout, physicians may be able to select the appropriate polypharmacy more effectively and safely, if necessary. Washout, while not for every patient, may be an effective tool for physicians who need to decide on whether to add potentially risky polypharmacy for a given patient. The risks of washout may, in some cases, be lower and the benefits may be clearly helpful for diagnosis, understanding medication effects, the doctor/patient relationship, and safer use of polypharmacy if indicated."}, {"Title": "Improving the medical scale predictability by the pairwise comparisons method: evidence from a clinical data study.", "Abstract": "In the clinical practice of psychiatry, presence or absence of particular symptoms is based on the subjective interpretation, by the clinician, of mental and behavioural descriptions offered by the patient.

In this article geographic similarities and differences in primary care service usage are examined among people with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus residing in regional and urban Victoria, Australia.\nBetween April and July 2010, hard-copy questionnaires were sent to a random selection of 10 000 registrants from the National Diabetes Services Scheme, 2162 were distributed via Heart Support Australia and community organisations within the state of Victoria; an online version yielded 290 valid responses.

From this information, geographic location was determined on the basis of the Australian Standard Geographical Classification. Data were subject to inferential analyses using PASW Statistics 18.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA). A series of contingency table analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between primary care service use and respondents' geographical locality. Contingency analyses and \u03c7(2) tests were also conducted to examine the differences between rural and metropolitan frequency of GP use.\nIn comparison with urban respondents, rural respondents reported greater use of allied health practitioners, district or practice nurses, and community health centres.

Use of GP clinics was not related significantly to respondents' locality, nor was use of inpatient hospital services or use of counselling, psychiatry or psychology services. Frequency of GP use, however, varied significantly among geographical categorisations, with urban respondents visiting their GPs more frequently.\nWhile GPs play an important role in chronic disease management in Australia, the rate of GP attendance remains lower among patients living in regional areas.

This association makes conceptual sense, given that MDD has been associated with hyper-reactivity in neural systems associated with punishment processing. Yet in practice, depression-related variance in measures of mPFC functioning often fails to relate to performance. For example, neuroelectric reflections of mediofrontal error signals are often found to be larger in MDD, but a deficit in post-error performance suggests that these error signals are not being used to rapidly adapt behavior. Thus, it remains unknown if depression-related variance in error signals reflects a meaningful alteration in the use of error or punishment information. However, larger mediofrontal error signals have also been related to another behavioral tendency: increased accuracy in avoidance learning. The integrity of this error-avoidance system remains untested in MDD. In this study, EEG was recorded as 21 symptomatic, drug-free participants with current or past MDD and 24 control participants performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task. Depressed participants had larger mid-frontal EEG responses to error feedback than controls. The direct relationship between error signal amplitudes and avoidance learning accuracy was replicated. Crucially, this relationship was stronger in depressed participants for high conflict \"lose-lose\" situations, demonstrating a selective alteration of avoidance learning. This investigation provided evidence that larger error signal amplitudes in depression are associated with increased avoidance learning, identifying a candidate mechanistic model for hypersensitivity to negative outcomes in depression."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetics in psychiatry: translating research into clinical practice.", "Abstract": "Pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic (PGx) approaches to psychopharmacology aim to identify clinically meaningful predictors of drug efficacy and/or side-effect burden.

Nurses' knowledge of the impact that family nursing intervention can have on family members may increase positive attitudes towards families. However, little is known about the impact that education and training intervention can have on nurses' attitudes, towards families in clinical practice. Quasi-experimental design was used to assess the change in nurses' attitudes towards families in psychiatric care after the intervention, which included a one-day seminar on the Calgary family nursing conceptual frameworks and skills training with clinical vignettes of families from psychiatry. The Families Importance in Nursing Care - Nurses' Attitude questionnaire was used to evaluate nurses' attitudes. A total of 81 nurses (65%) working in psychiatric care responded to the questionnaire. Nurses with more than 15 years of work experience were significantly more supportive of families in their care compared with less experienced nurses. Out of the 81 nurses, 52 (64%) answered the questionnaire again 14 months later. Furthermore, psychiatric nurses saw families significantly less burdensome after having participated in the ETI-PROGRAM."}, {"Title": "A follow-up study of patients with medically unexplained symptoms referred to a liaison psychiatry service.", "Abstract": "The principal objective was to describe general hospital use and mortality in a group of patients with medically unexplained symptoms referred to a liaison psychiatry service.\nCases were identified from patients with medically unexplained symptoms referred to a liaison psychiatry service between 1998 and 2005. We also identified a control group of patients, matched for age, sex, and date of referral, referred for other reasons to the same service. Follow-up information was obtained from the New Zealand Health Information Service national minimum data set from 1998 to 2006. Finally we compared hospital use in people with medically unexplained symptoms with national data on average length of stay in New Zealand hospitals.\nOver 9 years 153 patients referred for medically unexplained symptoms spent nearly 14,000 days in hospital. They also had statistically significant greater numbers of general hospital admissions and fewer deaths compared to patients referred to liaison psychiatry for other reasons. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms spent 41% spent longer in hospital on each admission (5.5 days) compared to the New Zealand average length of stay in general hospitals (3.9 days). After referral to liaison psychiatry patients who were frequently admitted with medically unexplained symptoms experienced a statistically significant decrease in the number of admissions and length of stay per year.\nPatients referred to a liaison psychiatry service with medically unexplained symptoms use substantial amounts of health service resources.

Information from 3 insurance companies and 3 sets of aggregated insurance company data also were available. One follow-up study of hospitalized psychiatric patients also was reviewed.\nStudies of medical board discipline indicate that, compared with other specialties, psychiatrists are at an increased risk of disciplinary action. Psychiatrists who were female, board certified, and in practice for a short period of time had a lower chance of medical board discipline. Psychiatry claims accounted for a very small proportion of overall malpractice claims and settlements. The amount of patient disability secondary to alleged malpractice was the most important variable predicting insurance payout.\nPsychiatrists appear to be disciplined by medical boards at an above-average frequency compared with other medical specialties. However, few malpractice suits reach the courts, and psychiatry represents a very small proportion of overall physician malpractice claims and dollars of settlement."}, {"Title": "The development of fear learning and generalization in 8-13 year-olds.", "Abstract": "The current study examined developmental changes in fear learning and generalization in 40 healthy 8-13 year-olds using an aversive conditioning paradigm adapted from Lau et al.

We review the evidence available concerning pharmacological prevention of suicide in bipolar disorder patients. Several clinical trials provide evidence that effective acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression provides a strong protection against suicide, suicide attempts, and probably against other complications of this disorder. Current major mood disorder is the most important risk factor of suicide, and bipolar II patients carry the highest risk. In bipolar patients suicidal behavior is most likely to occur during pure or mixed depressive episodes. Since bipolar disorder is a highly recurrent illness, adequate long-term pharmacotherapy is needed to prevent suicidal behavior."}, {"Title": "Is there an association between subjective and objective measures of cognitive function in patients with affective disorders?", "Abstract": "Patients with affective disorders experience cognitive dysfunction in addition to their affective symptoms.

To update available data, a systematic review was conducted, focusing on the main issues addressed in literature in regard to this topic. In addition to data on epidemiology, clinical features and treatment, five main issues could be identified: LOBI as secondary disorder, LOBI as expression of a lower vulnerability to the disease, LOBI as subform of pseudodementia, LOBI as risk factor for developing dementia, and LOBI as bipolar type VI (bipolarity in the context of dementia like processes). Levels of available evidence were found to vary according to the addressed issue. Although the concept of bipolar type VI could be criticized for subsuming under one single heading all the four other issues, this concept may be of pragmatic value in helping clinicians to orientate both diagnosis process and treatment decisions. Among others, the question as to whether some forms of bipolar type VI could constitute a special risk factor for developing dementia deserves further investigation. More studies are also needed to better disentangle the effects of age at onset from those of age itself."}, {"Title": "First prescription of new elderly patients attending the psychiatry outpatient of a tertiary care institute in North India.", "Abstract": "There is lack of data on prescription patterns in elderly patients from developing countries.

World War I (WWI) was a potent trigger of functional disorders with neurological or psychiatric symptoms. We analysed 100 randomly selected case files of German servicemen admitted to the Department of Psychiatry of the Charit\u00e9 Medical School of Berlin University during WWI and classified them according to contemporaneous and retrospective modern diagnoses. We compared the clinical presentations with accounts in the German and British medical literature of the time. Most patients obtained the contemporaneous diagnosis of 'psychopathic constitution' or hysteria reflecting the general view of German psychiatrists that not the war but an individual predisposition was the basis for the development of symptoms. The clinical picture was dominated by pseudoneurological motor or sensory symptoms as well as pseudoseizures. Some soldiers relived combat experiences in dream-like dissociative states that partly resemble modern-day post-traumatic stress disorder. Most servicemen were classified as unfit for military service but very few of them were granted compensation. Severe functional disorders of a neurological character could develop even without traumatic exposure in combat, which is of interest for the current debate on triggers of stress disorders. The high incidence of pseudoseizures accords with the psychiatric literature of the time and contrasts with accounts of war-related disorders in Britain. The tendency of German psychiatrists not to send traumatised servicemen back to active duty also distinguished between German and British practice. Our data contribute to the debate on the changing patterns of human responses to traumatic experience and their historical and social context."}, {"Title": "Evidence of a suffocation alarm system within the periaqueductal gray matter of the rat.", "Abstract": "Dyspnea, hunger for air, and urge to flee are the cardinal symptoms of panic attacks. Patients also show baseline respiratory abnormalities and a higher rate of comorbid and antecedent respiratory diseases. Panic attacks are also precipitated by infusion of sodium lactate and inhalation of 5% CO\u2082 in predisposed patients but not in healthy volunteers or patients without panic disorder. Accordingly, Klein [Klein (1993) Arch Gen Psychiatry 50:306-317] suggested that clinical panic is the misfiring of an as-yet-unidentified suffocation alarm system. In rats, selective anoxia of chemoreceptor cells by potassium cyanide (KCN) and electrical and chemical stimulations of periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) produce defensive behaviors, which resemble panic attacks. Thus, here we examined the effects of single or combined administrations of CO\u2082 (8% and 13%) and KCN (10-80 \u03bcg, i.v.) on spontaneous and PAG-evoked behaviors of rats either intact or bearing electrolytic lesions of PAG. Exposure to CO\u2082 alone reduced grooming while increased exophthalmus, suggesting an arousal response to non-visual cues of environment. Unexpectedly, however, CO\u2082 attenuated PAG-evoked immobility, trotting, and galloping while facilitated defecation and micturition. Conversely, KCN produced all defensive behaviors of the rat and facilitated PAG-evoked trotting, galloping, and defecation. There were also facilitatory trends in PAG-evoked exophthalmus, immobility, and jumping. Moreover, whereas the KCN-evoked defensive behaviors were attenuated or even suppressed by discrete lesions of PAG, they were markedly facilitated by CO\u2082. Authors suggest that the PAG harbors an anoxia-sensitive suffocation alarm system which activation precipitates panic attacks and potentiates the subject responses to hypercapnia."}, {"Title": "Practice and career outcomes of double-boarded psychiatrists.", "Abstract": "The practice patterns and career paths of physicians who are double-boarded in medicine, family practice, or neurology and psychiatry are not well understood.

Thirty psychiatry residents were additionally evaluated before and after completion of a clinical rotation in hospice and palliative care.\nFew programs offered any formalized training in palliative care, although nearly all psychiatry residents reported interest in this area. A clinical rotation in palliative care significantly increased psychiatry residents' competence and knowledge while simultaneously decreasing their concerns about practice in this area; most were at levels comparable to family and internal medicine residents completing the same rotation. Psychiatry residents' knowledge of pain assessment, pain management, and generalized non-pain management were also enhanced during the rotation.\nResults indicate that training opportunities in palliative care are lacking for psychiatry residents in the United States although residents report strong interest in this area. This study finds psychiatry residents can benefit as much as other disciplines from receiving palliative care training. The need to offer such training within psychiatry residencies is highlighted and the welcoming of psychiatrists into palliative care is suggested."}, {"Title": "AGNP consensus guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring in psychiatry: update 2011.", "Abstract": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), i. e., the quantification of serum or plasma concentrations of medications for dose optimization, has proven a valuable tool for the patient-matched psychopharmacotherapy. Uncertain drug adherence, suboptimal tolerability, non-response at therapeutic doses, or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are typical situations when measurement of medication concentrations is helpful. Patient populations that may predominantly benefit from TDM in psychiatry are children, pregnant women, elderly patients, individuals with intelligence disabilities, forensic patients, patients with known or suspected genetically determined pharmacokinetic abnormalities or individuals with pharmacokinetically relevant comorbidities. However, the potential benefits of TDM for optimization of pharmacotherapy can only be obtained if the method is adequately integrated into the clinical treatment process. To promote an appropriate use of TDM, the TDM expert group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) issued guidelines for TDM in psychiatry in 2004. Since then, knowledge has advanced significantly, and new psychopharmacologic agents have been introduced that are also candidates for TDM. Therefore the TDM consensus guidelines were updated and extended to 128 neuropsychiatric drugs. 4 levels of recommendation for using TDM were defined ranging from \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d to \u201cpotentially useful\u201d. Evidence-based \u201ctherapeutic reference ranges\u201d and \u201cdose related reference ranges\u201d were elaborated after an extensive literature search and a structured internal review process. A \u201claboratory alert level\u201d was introduced, i. e., a plasma level at or above which the laboratory should immediately inform the treating physician. Supportive information such as cytochrome P450 substrate and inhibitor properties of medications, normal ranges of ratios of concentrations of drug metabolite to parent drug and recommendations for the interpretative services are given. Recommendations when to combine TDM with pharmacogenetic tests are also provided. Following the guidelines will help to improve the outcomes of psychopharmacotherapy of many patients especially in case of pharmacokinetic problems. Thereby, one should never forget that TDM is an interdisciplinary task that sometimes requires the respectful discussion of apparently discrepant data so that, ultimately, the patient can profit from such a joint eff ort."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of autism spectrum disorders in a sample of egyptian and saudi patients: transcultural cross sectional study.", "Abstract": "Autism is a biological disorder with clearly defined phenomenology. Studies from the Middle East on this topic have been particularly rare. Little is known about the influence of culture on clinical features, presentations and management of autism.

They were recruited from the Okasha Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt and Al-Amal Complex for Mental Health, Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They were grouped into an Egyptian group (n = 20) and a Saudi group (n = 28). They were assessed both clinically and psychometrically using the GARS, the Vineland adaptive behavioral scale, and the Stanford Binnet IQ test.\nTypical autism was more prevalent than atypical autism in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical variables like regression, hyperactivity, epilepsy or mental retardation. Delayed language development was significantly higher in the Egyptian group while delay in all developmental milestones was more significant in the Saudi group. The Vineland communication subscale showed more significant severe and profound communication defects in the Saudi group while the Gilliam developmental subscale showed significantly more average scores in the Egyptian group. Both groups differed significantly such that the age of noticing abnormality was younger in the Saudi group. The age at diagnosis and at the commencement of intervention was lower in the Egyptian group. The Saudi group showed a higher percentage of missing examinations, older birth order and significantly higher preference to drug treatment, while the Egyptian group showed a high preference to behavioral and phoniatric therapies, higher paternal and maternal education, higher employment among parents and higher family concern.\nCultural context may significantly influence the age of noticing abnormality, the age of starting intervention, developmental and perinatal problems, family concerns about managing the problem as well as familial tendency for neurodevelopmental disorders, all of which have important impact on clinical symptomatology and severity of autism.

This chapter describes the need for innovative approaches for identification of biomarkers which can been used to classify at-risk patients such as youngsters with prodromal symptoms for psychosis and existing patients who are likely to progress to more severe states.

Here, we outline the necessity of improving and applying proteomic methods for biomarker discovery and validation in the field of psychiatric disorders. While proteomic-based applications in neurosciences have increased in accuracy and sensitivity over the past 10 years, the development of orthogonal validation technologies has fallen behind. These issues are discussed along with the importance of integrating systems biology approaches and combining proteomics with other research approaches.

The SA-related variables we included in the model were self-rated successful aging, depression severity, physical and emotional functioning, optimism, resilience, attitude towards own aging, self-efficacy, and cognitive ability. After adjusting for age, education and income, we fitted an exploratory factor analysis model to the SA-related variables and then, in order to address relationships among these factors, we computed a Bayesian Belief Net (BBN) using rotated factor scores.\nThe SA-related variables loaded onto five factors. Based on the loading, we labeled the factors as follows: self-rated successful aging, cognition, psychosocial protective factors, physical functioning, and emotional functioning. In the BBN, self-rated successful aging emerged as the primary downstream factor and exhibited significant partial correlations with psychosocial protective factors, physical/general status and mental/emotional status but not with cognitive ability.\nOur study represents a step forward in developing a dimensional model of SA.

The aim is not to take issue with the detail in such histories but to critically examine the texts, so as to highlight constructions that structure the presentation of conventional histories and possible purposes that such constructions may serve. The argument is that such conventional histories leave key questions not just unanswered, but unconsidered - a tendency that can be seen throughout the CAMH literature more generally. Therefore, we then pursue critical discussion of how 'taken-for-granted' constructions of CAMH enabled psychiatry to successfully expand its power and influence to establish hegemony over 'problem children'.

The high degree of learning-dependent plasticity in these networks-combined with the availability of advanced computerized technology-suggests that we should be able to engineer very specific training programs that drive meaningful and enduring improvements in impaired neural systems relevant to neuropsychiatric illness. However, cognitive training approaches for mental and addictive disorders must take into account possible inherent limitations in the underlying brain 'learning machinery' due to pathophysiology, must grapple with the presence of complex overlearned maladaptive patterns of neural functioning, and must find a way to ally with developmental and psychosocial factors that influence response to illness and to treatment. In this review, we briefly examine the current state of knowledge from studies of cognitive remediation in psychiatry and we highlight open questions. We then present a systems neuroscience rationale for successful cognitive training for neuropsychiatric illnesses, one that emphasizes the distributed nature of neural assemblies that support cognitive and affective processing, as well as their plasticity. It is based on the notion that, during successful learning, the brain represents the relevant perceptual and cognitive/affective inputs and action outputs with disproportionately larger and more coordinated populations of neurons that are distributed (and that are interacting) across multiple levels of processing and throughout multiple brain regions. This approach allows us to address limitations found in earlier research and to introduce important principles for the design and evaluation of the next generation of cognitive training for impaired neural systems. We summarize work to date using such neuroscience-informed methods and indicate some of the exciting future directions of this field."}, {"Title": "[Agust\u00edn Moreno: scientific psychology and women's legal responsibility in Spain].", "Abstract": "Agust\u00edn Moreno Rodr\u00edguez (1886-1967) studied Medicine and Natural Sciences at the Central University of Spain, in Madrid.

As the role of these barriers is poorly understood, we aimed to identify patient characteristics that are associated with non-participation in a patient satisfaction survey.\nAt the University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland, a patient satisfaction survey is regularly conducted among all adult patients hospitalized for >24 hours on a one-month period in the departments of internal medicine, geriatrics, surgery, neurosciences, psychiatry, and gynaecology-obstetrics. In order to assess the factors associated with non-participation to the patient satisfaction survey, a case-control study was conducted among patients selected for the 2005 survey. Cases (non respondents, n = 195) and controls (respondents, n = 205) were randomly selected from the satisfaction survey, and information about potential barriers to participation was abstracted in a blinded fashion from the patients' medical and nursing charts.\nNon-participation in the satisfaction survey was independently associated with the presence of a language barrier (odds ratio [OR] 4.53, 95% confidence interval [CI95%]: 2.14-9.59), substance abuse (OR 3.75, CI95%: 1.97-7.14), cognitive limitations (OR 3.72, CI95%: 1.64-8.42), a psychiatric diagnosis (OR 1.99, CI95%: 1.23-3.23) and a sight deficiency (OR 2.07, CI95%: 0.98-4.36).

It is a personality trait commonly used in the diagnosis of many psychiatric diseases. In clinical practice, impulsivity is estimated using written questionnaires. However, answers to questions might be subject to personal biases and misinterpretations. In order to alleviate this problem, eye movements could be used to study differences in decision processes related to impulsivity. Therefore, we investigated correlations between impulsivity scores obtained with a questionnaire in healthy subjects and characteristics of their anticipatory eye movements in a simple smooth pursuit task. Healthy subjects were asked to answer the UPPS questionnaire (Urgency Premeditation Perseverance and Sensation seeking Impulsive Behavior scale), which distinguishes four independent dimensions of impulsivity: Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack of Perseverance, and Sensation seeking. The same subjects took part in an oculomotor task that consisted of pursuing a target that moved in a predictable direction. This task reliably evoked anticipatory saccades and smooth eye movements. We found that eye movement characteristics such as latency and velocity were significantly correlated with UPPS scores. The specific correlations between distinct UPPS factors and oculomotor anticipation parameters support the validity of the UPPS construct and corroborate neurobiological explanations for impulsivity. We suggest that the oculomotor approach of impulsivity put forth in the present study could help bridge the gap between psychiatry and physiology."}, {"Title": "The American Psychiatric Association and the history of psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The history committee within the American Psychiatric Association was actively involved in the history of psychiatry in the early decades of the twentieth century, as well as from 1942 to 2009.This paper explores the role of this committee in the context of changes in the psychiatric profession over the twentieth century."}, {"Title": "The mental health sector and the social sciences in post- World War II USA.

The objective of this study was to examine the role of rural residence in relation to service utilization. Using Canadian data collected in 2002, service use was examined as a function of the presence of anxiety or mood disorders and rural/urban residence. Use of four different types of professional mental health services was examined in relation to rural residence and additional demographic, social, and health status factors known to predict use of services.\nData were obtained from Statistics Canada's Canadian Mental Health Survey Cycle 1.2. Rural residence was defined as living in a rural community with a population of 1000 or less. For all participants, associations between the presence of anxiety or mood disorders, rural/urban residence, and any service use or use of specialized mental health services (psychiatry and psychology) were examined. For participants who had used professional services, associations were examined between 17 predictor variables, including location of residence, and the use of four types of service providers (family doctor or GP; nurse, social worker, counsellor, or psychotherapist; psychiatrist; or psychologist). Predictors included demographic, social, and health status variables. Cross-tabulated counts and adjusted odds ratios with 99% confidence intervals based on bootstrapped variance estimates were used to evaluate predictors.\nAmong the total sample (<em>n </em>= 35 140), 7.9% had used professional mental health services in the previous year. Among people who were likely to have had anxiety or mood disorders, rural or urban residence was not differentially related to past-year use of any professional services or specialized mental health services. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model factors predicting past year use of four different types of professional services. Location of residence was not a significant predictor of service utilization. Age, sex, race, level of education, degree of psychological distress, chronicity of distress, and the presence of anxiety or mood disorders predicted type of service used.\nThe notion that rural residence limits access to mental health services was not supported. Other demographic and health status indicators such as age, sex, race, education, distress, and type of illness were more important predictors of service utilization. However, null findings related to geographic residence must be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample of rural residents who sought mental health services. The mental health system in Canada must provide a variety of professional services in order to meet the preferences of diverse groups, and mental health specialists must find ways to adequately support general practice physicians and counsellors who provide mental health services."}, {"Title": "Audit of ICD-10 diagnosis use at admission assessments and in discharge summaries by psychiatric trainees.", "Abstract": "Article 14 of the General and Specialist Medical Practice Order 2003 for specialties in psychiatry describes the specific conditions that a doctor must meet in order to be eligible as a specialist for the purposes of inclusion on the Specialist Register.

Different theoretical approaches disagree as to whether or not hypnosis may involve an altered mental state. So far, a hypnotic state has never been convincingly demonstrated, if the criteria for the state are that it involves some objectively measurable and replicable behavioural or physiological phenomena that cannot be faked or simulated by non-hypnotized control subjects. We present a detailed case study of a highly hypnotizable subject who reliably shows a range of changes in both automatic and volitional eye movements when given a hypnotic induction. These changes correspond well with the phenomenon referred to as the \"trance stare\" in the hypnosis literature. Our results show that this 'trance stare' is associated with large and objective changes in the optokinetic reflex, the pupillary reflex and programming a saccade to a single target. Control subjects could not imitate these changes voluntarily. For the majority of people, hypnotic induction brings about states resembling normal focused attention or mental imagery. Our data nevertheless highlight that in some cases hypnosis may involve a special state, which qualitatively differs from the normal state of consciousness."}, {"Title": "Guidelines reduce time to consultation for a liaison psychiatry service in an Irish teaching hospital.", "Abstract": "Timeliness of response from referral to consultation is necessary to provide best standards of care to inpatients in the general hospital setting.\nTo measure the length of time from referral to consultation in a liaison psychiatry service, and improve service delivery by introducing guidelines for time to consultation.\nTime to consultation was measured on all patients presenting to a liaison psychiatry consultation service over an initial 6-month period, with subsequent repeat measurement following the introduction of guidelines.\nThere were significant reductions for time to consultation in the service for the second cycle of the audit (\u03c7(2) = 43.84, P < 0.001), and targets based on international standards were achieved.\nIntroduction of guidelines for time to consultation, may improve response times, leading to improved quality of service for inpatient consultation services."}, {"Title": "Dynamic psychiatry and the psychodynamic formulation.", "Abstract": "This article aims to describe the difference between descriptive and dynamic psychiatry.

The formulation furthermore helps with the initial orientation towards the patient: it anticipates and predicts how the patient might interact with the psychiatrist and how defenses and underlying conflicts will manifest themselves in treatment. The formulation can therefore be very useful in the treatment of any patient, since it can help to understand and manage the patient's attitude towards being prescribed medication, as well as compliance and prognosis and serve as an initial guide in the psychotherapy.

As a result chronicity acquired a new uncertain and elusive shape.

Ischemic stroke was confirmed by CT scan or autopsy in patients admitted to the 2nd Department of Neurology, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland from 1995 to 2007. Male and female patients were compared for risk factors, state of activity prior to stroke, stroke type according to Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, diagnostic test findings, and early 30-day outcome. Data on 1379 women and 1155 men admitted with ischemic stroke were analyzed. The mean age of female and male patients was 74.3 and 68.8 years, respectively. Women were more often disabled prior to stroke, hypertensive, diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or heart failure, and had impaired consciousness at admission, whereas men were more likely to smoke, abuse alcohol and have a history of myocardial infarction or transient ischemic attack. A higher percentage of female stroke patients suffered from total anterior circulation syndrome than males (21.2% and 14.0%, respectively). Internal carotid artery stenosis over 70% was reported in 10.8% ofwomen and 19.1% of men. The 30-day mortality and poor outcome rates were significantly higher in women than men (17.2% vs. 13.1% and 59.9% vs. 46.2%).

Cenesthesia refers to the internal, global, implicit and affective perception of one's own body. The concept of cenesthopathy was coined by Dupre and Camus in 1907 to describe a clinical entity characterized by abnormal and strange bodily sensations.\nIn this review, we examine the history of these concepts and the influence they have had on clinical, nosographical and phenomenological psychiatry and on cognitive neuropsychiatry.\nWe performed a narrative review of the published research literature.\nClassical French and German psychiatrists have written extensively on cenesthesia and cenesthopathy although these notions are no longer in the mainstream of contemporary psychiatry. However, they are still present in contemporary psychiatric nosography in the form of some controversial clinical entities clearly related to cenesthesia such as cenesthetic schizophrenia, hypochondriacal monothematic delusions, or the Capgras and the Cotard syndromes. These clinical entities are all associated with a state of depersonalization. We point out the similarities between Ey's description of the depersonalization syndrome, especially in psychosis, and the characteristics of cenesthesia. Philosophers like Sartre or Merleau-Ponty have developed the concept of cenesthesia, and in particular have added new concepts like \"body schema\". Similarly, phenomenological psychiatrists like Minkowski or Tellenbach have attempted to describe psychiatric disorders associated with cenesthesia and have also proposed new concepts (i.e. atmospheric sense) in order to understand them better. More recently, cognitive neuropsychiatry has tried to discover the mechanisms, which cause or contribute to the genesis of delusions. The majority of delusion theories developed in cognitive neuropsychiatry consider that the explanation of monothematic delusions involves one or two explanatory stages. The first stage corresponds to an abnormal experience (the experiential stage) while the second is related to abnormal reasoning (the inferential stage). This theoretical first stage has been considered to be the result of a highly unusual or bizarre perceptual experience. According to the authors, this experience refers to a phenomenon of depersonalization, a loss of cenesthesia, or a loss of a feeling of familiarity. For example, the neurocognitive models of the Capgras and Cotard syndromes have in common the belief that they are both based on various kinds of unusual experiences. These unusual experiences are thought to include affective or emotional experiences. Capgras' syndrome is possibly triggered by an abnormal affective experience in response to the sight of closed-person's face. Similarly, the Cotard syndrome may result from a general flattening of affective responses to external stimuli. The inferential stage can also differentiate between the two syndromes. Some empirical validation has already been obtained in Capgras' syndrome but not yet in Cotard's syndrome.\nThis review illustrates that the historical descriptions of cenesthesia and cenesthopathy remain relevant in contemporary neurocognitive models and more generally suggests that the comprehension of quite complex phenomena like delusion requires a multidisciplinary approach."}, {"Title": "[Effectiveness of physical exercise in psychiatry: a therapeutic approach?].", "Abstract": "There is a general belief that physical activity and exercise have positive effects on mood and anxiety. Intervention studies describe an anxiolytic and antidepressive effect of exercise in healthy subjects and patients. However, the majority of published studies have substantial methodological inconsistencies. Our review of the literature showed the importance of distinguishing three items in studies regarding efficacy of physical exercise in psychiatry: operationalisation of concepts (duration, frequency, intensity, type of exercise), the type of disorder, the diagnosis, and exploratory hypotheses. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that physical exercise in the psychiatry department contributes to the improvement of the mental health of in-hospital patients.\nSociodemographical data, the diagnosis and the physical exercise (duration, distance, type and frequency) of 283 in-hospital patients in the psychiatry department were listed. Physical exercise (cycling, long walks, short walks, soft and hard gymnastics) included in a database has been proposed to patients for many years in this hospital. After their hospitalisation, the members of the medical staff (20 persons) evaluated the patients on a visual analogic scale from 1 to 10 related to the improvement of their mental health. No experimental manipulation was made.\nOne hundred and twenty-eight men, mean age: 45.67 years (\u00b1 13.59) exhibited the following disorders: major depressive disorder (117), anxious disorders (25), alcoholic addiction (85), toxicomania (10), psychotic decompensation (33), bipolar disorder (3) and others (10). Patients practised at least one exercise during their hospitalisation, mean duration of 15.93 (\u00b1 9.18) working days. The frequency of physical exercises per patient was 5.65 (\u00b1 6.20). The improvement of each patient was evaluated around six times (6.16 \u00b1 3.83). The average amelioration score for all the patients was close to 50% (4.99 \u00b1 1.65).\nCorrelations between the improvement of mental health and participation in physical exercises were all significant (frequency: r=0.228; P<0.001; duration: r=0.236; P<0.001; distance: r=0.201, P=0.001). In comparison with psychotic patients, drug addiction and alcoholic, depressive patients showed greater interest in physical exercise. This is similar for anxious disorders. According to the results, two groups were created regarding their improvement (cut out point: 5.08). We observed that patients suffering from major depression considerably improved thanks to physical exercise (P=0.048), spent more time practising (P=0.037) and walked or cycled greater distances (P=0.038). Finally, cycling (frequency: P=0.008; distance: P=0.016; duration: P=0.011) and \"hard\" gymnastics were the physical exercises which optimized the results.\nPhysical exercise is correlated with the improvement of mental health. The practice of physical exercise depends on the mental disorder. People suffering from major depressive disorder benefit more from physical exercise than other groups. Cycling and \"hard\" gymnastics are both exercises to be proposed in every programme.\nTo practice physical exercise during hospitalisation in a psychiatric department has a positive influence on the symptomatology, and contributes to the improvement of mental health."}, {"Title": "Vitamin B(12) deficiency as a cause of delirium in a patient with spinal cord injury.", "Abstract": "A man with spinal cord injury (SCI) and multiple medical comorbidities had new-onset delirium during his 14th month of hospitalization.

The placebo effect seems to be more marked in children than adults, and particularly in children and adolescents with depression, although it is pervasive across ages and is present in non-psychiatric conditions as well. The use of a placebo in clinical trials as a comparator with drugs that have moderate efficacy at most makes it difficult to obtain positive results, and much effort is needed to design very high quality clinical trials that may overcome the limitations of using a placebo.

Vestibular rehabilitation originated as a physical therapy, but a careful look at its research development and clinical applications show it to be as much, or perhaps more, a behavioral intervention. More patients referred for vestibular rehabilitation require habituation to chronic vestibular symptoms and motion sensitivity than compensation for active peripheral or central vestibular deficits. Vestibular rehabilitation may exert a positive effect on behavioral morbidity, but the benefits are somewhat uneven and do not always correlate with physical improvements. Health anxiety (i.e., excessive worry about the cause and consequences of physical symptoms) is an emerging concept in clinical psychiatry and psychology.

Some are common to all QIPs, such as the incomplete dissemination of audit results throughout participating organizations and variable uptake of change interventions. Others are specific to particular QIPs, depending on the prescribing issue addressed. For example, in a QIP targeting biochemical monitoring of lithium treatment, the major barrier was the complexity of clinical care arrangements, including multiple interfaces between clinical and laboratory services, which were often not directly or wholly under the control of clinical teams. In this QIP there was little improvement in overall performance against the clinical standards in the total national sample between baseline and re-audit."}, {"Title": "[Impairment status and related predictors for adults hospitalized as children in a psychiatric ward in Israel].", "Abstract": "The few studies that exist on long term outcome of psychiatric hospitalization of children show poor prognosis.\nTo study the level of functioning of adults who were hospitalized as children in a psychiatric ward in Israel and to identify prognosis predictors.\nThe study population consisted of all 1654 people who had been hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital in Israel and whose age at the time of the study was 21 years and above. For each subject, demographic and clinical data were extracted from a national case registry and data on disability benefits were retrieved from another file in the Ministry of Health.\nOnly 8% of the study subjects were married, 8.3% died (3.5 times more in men compared to the general population), and 21% received disability benefits. More than half of the people who were hospitalized as children were rehospitalized during the follow-up (43% as adults). Younger age at first hospitalization was associated with a longer cumulative duration of hospitalization, while an older age was associated with a greater number of hospitalizations and a higher rate of eligibility for disability benefits. Diagnosis at first hospitalization was associated with all measures of functioning in adulthood. Diagnosis of an \"organic\" or severe psychiatric disorder was associated with poor prognosis.

There was significant correlation between these two sets of criteria used to define the metabolic syndrome (Kappa value -0.821, P < 0.001). Among the individual parameters studied, increased waist circumference was the most common abnormality, followed by abnormal blood glucose levels and elevated triglyceride levels. All these abnormalities were seen in more than half (52-61%) of the patients. When the sample was divided into two groups, i.e., those with and without metabolic syndrome, patients with metabolic syndrome had significantly higher body mass index and had spent more time in school.

The analysis charts the shifting understandings of personality disorders associated with antisocial behaviour in the DSM and in US psychiatry more broadly from 1950 to the present day. Memos, letters and minutes produced by the DSM-III committee and held in the American Psychiatric Association (APA) archives ground the discussion. Finally, the article explores more recent constructions of antisocial personality disorder and examines the anticipatory discourse pertaining to the rewriting of this category expected in the forthcoming DSM-5. In presenting an in-depth socio-historical narrative of the development - and potential future - of standards for pathological antisociality, this analysis casts new light on the ASPD construct.

According to this doctrine, understanding is concerned with a person's inner life and consequently, its method consists in putting oneself in the other's position and reliving their experience. Jaspers' concept of understanding - which is regarded as definitive for psychiatry by advocates and opponents alike - is commonly interpreted according to this tradition as well.\nI shall argue here that this position does not stand up to scrutiny. It is a mistake to simplify Dilthey's concept of understanding to a form of mere psychologism. In fact, Jaspers practically tore this position down. In his own account, by contrast, he utilises Max Weber and Rickert to established a third realm in addition to a person's inner life on the one hand and their bodily nature on the other: the realm of the objective products of the human mind. It is this dimension that is essential for understanding. Such a transition from the dichotomy of explaining and understanding to a three-valued logic requires a radical rethinking of the traditional notion of understanding. Jaspers meets this demand but he does so only implicitly and not always consistently so that it might easily be missed. It is nonetheless crucial to see that Jaspers in fact rejects the hermeneutics of empathy which are commonly attributed to him and for which he is often criticised.\nIn conclusion of this essay, I will suggest some implications of this - often overlooked - distinction for psychiatry and psychology."}, {"Title": "Long term antidepressants prescribing in the Psychiatry Department at Riyadh Military Hospital.

Cognition and emotionality are the most affected functions in neuropsychiatric disorders, i.e., anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. In this review, most relevant literature on the role of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in neuropsychiatric disorders will be presented. Evidence from clinical and animal studies is provided for the participation of CB1 and CB2 receptors (CB1R and CB2R) in the above mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders. CBRs are crucial in some of the emotional and cognitive impairments reported, although more research is required to understand the specific role of the eCB system in neuropsychiatric disorders. Cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-psychotropic component of the Cannabis sativa plant, has shown therapeutic potential in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Although further studies are needed, recent studies indicate that CBD therapeutic effects may partially depend on facilitation of eCB-mediated neurotransmission. Last but not least, this review includes recent findings on the role of the eCB system in eating disorders. A deregulation of the eCB system has been proposed to be in the bases of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including eating disorders. Cannabis consumption has been related to the appearance of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia. In contrast, the pharmacological manipulation of this eCB system has been proposed as a potential strategy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, depression, and anorexia nervosa. In conclusion, the eCB system plays a critical role in psychiatry; however, detrimental consequences of manipulating this endogenous system cannot be underestimated over the potential and promising perspectives of its therapeutic manipulation."}, {"Title": "Development and clinical outcomes of a dialectical behavior therapy clinic.", "Abstract": "The authors describe the first 6 months of a dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) clinic operated by trainees in a general adult psychiatry residency program.

The crucial supervisor/supervisee relationship has been described extensively in the literature, most often framed as a clinical apprenticeship of the novice to the master craftsman. This approach fails to directly incorporate adult-learning theory (ALT), despite a clear literature supporting its superiority.\nIn this article, the author describes the basic principles of ALT, reviewing the limitations of current supervisory practice from the ALT perspective. He then describes system insights gleaned from elements of the manufacturing process and integrates them into a model that enhances ALT-informed approaches to clinical supervision that can be utilized in all settings.\nAlthough there are clear benefits of ALT and the proposed \"pull\" manufacturing management-informed approaches to supervision, there are several anticipated areas of likely resistance: the issues of time for the collaborative goal-setting, monitoring progress, and revising the educational plan. Much of this is already a factor in the current, labor-intensive patterns of individual supervision, and, in practice, even the formal monthly review has, in almost all cases, taken appreciably less than half of a supervisory hour. Any possible increases in time or effort would be more than compensated for by the inherent efficiency of resident-specific teaching and learning.\nCurrent supervisory practices can be revised to include principles of ALT and \"pull\" manufacturing systems that can enhance resident education."}, {"Title": "[Reorganisation of the diagnostic and therapeutic courses in the psychiatric care centre--from the analysis to implementation].", "Abstract": "Under current conditions psychiatric-psychotherapeutic inpatient care can not be sustained in its present form for much longer.

PCP-specific challenges include unfamiliarity with depressive symptom profiles in diverse patient populations, limited time to address mental health, and limited referral options for mental health care. Patient-specific challenges include stigma around mental health issues and reluctance to seek mental health treatment. To address these issues, we implemented a multi-component intervention for Asian American and Latino American primary care patients with depression at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).\nWe propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a culturally appropriate intervention to improve the diagnosis and treatment of depression in our target population. Our goals are to facilitate a) primary care providers' ability to provide appropriate, culturally informed care of depression, and b) patients' knowledge of and resources for receiving treatment for depression. Our two-year long intervention targets Asian American and Latino American adult (18 years of age or older) primary care patients at MGH screening positive for symptoms of depression. All eligible patients in the intervention arm of the study who screen positive will be offered a culturally focused psychiatric (CFP) consultation. Patients will meet with a study clinician and receive toolkits that include psychoeducational booklets, worksheets and community resources.

This results in frequent over-sedation and occasional profound sedation and death. This paper describes the development of a simplified sedation protocol for the pharmacological management of acute behavioural disturbance.\nFollowing the wider availability of intramuscular lorazepam in 2008, Metro North Mental Health developed a protocol utilizing only two products - oral or intramuscular lorazepam or olanzapine - which was subsequently developed into a statewide protocol.\nThe advantage of utilizing only two sedating medications is that it greatly reduces the risk of profound sedation and theoretically reduces the risk of other complications including deaths. Clinical staff who have utilized the protocol report a reduction in over-sedation of inpatients.\nA simplified protocol makes the pharmacological management of acute behaviour disturbance safer for both patients and staff."}, {"Title": "Low-level light therapy of the eye and brain.", "Abstract": "Low-level light therapy (LLLT) using red to near-infrared light energy has gained attention in recent years as a new scientific approach with therapeutic applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and psychiatry. The ongoing therapeutic revolution spearheaded by LLLT is largely propelled by progress in the basic science fields of photobiology and bioenergetics. This paper describes the mechanisms of action of LLLT at the molecular, cellular, and nervous tissue levels. Photoneuromodulation of cytochrome oxidase activity is the most important primary mechanism of action of LLLT. Cytochrome oxidase is the primary photoacceptor of light in the red to near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is also a key mitochondrial enzyme for cellular bioenergetics, especially for nerve cells in the retina and the brain. Evidence shows that LLLT can secondarily enhance neural metabolism by regulating mitochondrial function, intraneuronal signaling systems, and redox states. Current knowledge about LLLT dosimetry relevant for its hormetic effects on nervous tissue, including noninvasive in vivo retinal and transcranial effects, is also presented. Recent research is reviewed that supports LLLT potential benefits in retinal disease, stroke, neurotrauma, neurodegeneration, and memory and mood disorders. Since mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in neurodegeneration, LLLT has potential significant applications against retinal and brain damage by counteracting the consequences of mitochondrial failure. Upon transcranial delivery in vivo, LLLT induces brain metabolic and antioxidant beneficial effects, as measured by increases in cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. Increases in cerebral blood flow and cognitive functions induced by LLLT have also been observed in humans. Importantly, LLLT given at energy densities that exert beneficial effects does not induce adverse effects. This highlights the value of LLLT as a novel paradigm to treat visual, neurological, and psychological conditions, and supports that neuronal energy metabolism could constitute a major target for neurotherapeutics of the eye and brain."}, {"Title": "Liaison old age psychiatry service in a medical setting: description of the newcastle clinical service.", "Abstract": "Liaison Old Age Psychiatry services (LOAP) have begun to emerge in the UK and further development of the service is supported by the latest health policies.

The variability of symptoms and the frequency of comorbidities among patients with fibromyalgia make this a difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. New diagnostic criteria are available to improve the diagnosis and care of patients. We propose the first French translation of the new diagnostic criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010. Although the etiology of fibromyalgia remains unclear, evidences suggest that biologic, genetic and environmental factors are involved. This chronic psychophysical suffering state of fibromyalgia adversely affects the patient's quality of life, performance and mood. Studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia that requires careful history and evaluation for the presence of primary or secondary mood disturbances and psychological stress. Despite the absence of strong evidence of the fibromyalgia pathogenesis, evidence base medecine lead us to consider a biopsychosocial model and a multidisciplinary treatment. Treatment of fibromyalgia requires a comprehensive and multidimensional approach with patient education, cognitive behavior therapy, exercise, physical therapy and pharmacological therapy. Today, the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (milnacipran and duloxetine) and the antiepileptic (pregabalin) are the most effective drugs available for the treatment for fibromyalgia.

The reason for this may be the need to transport or cam the patient down (emergency), the need to understand the disorder, its dynamics, therapeutic difficulties or difficulties in cooperation with the patient. The introduction to consultation consists of gathering information from the supporting staff, patient's family, main physician or from the disease records. Psychiatric examination should be taking place in peaceful surroundings enduring privacy. Basic examination of mental condition should be carried out. The results of the consultation are required to be shared in writing and they influence further treatment and often, further life of the patient. In difficult situations it is advised to carry out psychiatric consultation several times. In emergencies there is a need to consult the aggressive patients with suicidal tendencies and consciousness disorders.

With a spectrum view in mind, the possibility of broadening the diagnosis of bipolar disorder has been proposed. This paper discusses some of the rationale for an expanded diagnostic scheme from both clinical and research perspectives in light of potential drawbacks. The ultimate goal of broadening the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is to help identify a common etiopathogenesis for these conditions to better guide treatment. To help achieve this goal, bipolar researchers have increasingly expanded their patient populations to identify objective biological or endophenotypic markers that transcend phenomenological observation. Although this approach has and will likely continue to produce beneficial results, the upcoming DSM-IV and ICD-10 revisions will place increasing scrutiny on psychiatry's diagnostic classification systems and pressure to re-evaluate our conceptions of bipolar disorder. However, until research findings can provide consistent and converging evidence as to the validity of a broader diagnostic conception, clinical expansion to a dimensional bipolar spectrum should be considered with caution."}, {"Title": "[Health 2.0 for psychiatrists].", "Abstract": "The internet used to be mainly 'one-way traffic' (1.0).

The review was based on searches of electronic databases and a hand search of relevant journals and reference lists between 1966 and June 2010. There were 20 studies comparing videoconferencing diagnosis with a non-telemedicine alternative by reporting a measure of agreement. Half of the studies were in the field of dermatology; these studies provided solid support for the reliability of videoconferencing. The other 10 studies were in psychiatry, geriatrics, minor injuries, neurology and rheumatology. Reliability of diagnosis via videoconferencing was confirmed in all studies. In the studies where physical examination was an element of the diagnostic process, results were reliable but authors recommended greater care during the diagnostic process (e.g. good equipment, onsite support, additional camera angles). Four studies incorporated a second group to measure agreement in paired face-to-face assessments. Although useful evidence for the reliability of diagnosis via videoconferencing was provided by the studies in the review, the range of medical specialties was small. The variation in research methodology and statistical analysis suggests a lack of clarity about which research design is appropriate for measuring observer agreement in relation to diagnostic reliability."}, {"Title": "[Validation study of the French schizotypal personality questionnaire in a sample of adolescents: a confirmatory factor analysis].", "Abstract": "This article aims to validate the schizotypal personality questionnaire in a sample of French speaking adolescents. Because early schizotypal manifestations are predictive of psychosis-proneness, reliable self-report measures are crucial for early detection of vulnerability to schizophrenia during adolescence. Unlike most existing self-reports, the questionnaire de personnalit\u00e9 schizotypique (SPQ) assesses individual differences in all nine feature of DSM-IV schizotypal personality (i.e. ideas of reference, excessive social anxiety, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experience, odd behaviour, no close friends, odd speech, constricted affect and suspiciousness). Furthermore, it yields dimensional scores concerning the main schizotypal factors, which represent valuable information for the clinician's case formulation and can be used as a screening instrument in the general population.\nOur sample consisted of 174 adolescents (98 girls) between 12 and 17 years old. All completed the SPQ 74-item self-report. Participants were recruited in secondary schools in Switzerland, and through the child and adolescent community outpatient psychiatric service (office m\u00e9dico-p\u00e9dagogique) affiliated to the University of Geneva's Psychiatry Department and to the Canton of Geneva Education Department. A confirmatory factorial analysis was conducted on our sample to test nine competing models of SPQ. The 3-factor model of Raine et al. was compared to concurrent 2, 3, and 4-factor models. Simple structure models of Raine et al. and Stefanis et al. were also tested.\nThe following observations were highlighted in our results: (1) goodness-of-fit indices are better for structures allowing cross loadings than for simple structures; (2) amongst the simple structures, the best goodness-of-fit index was obtained for the Raine model and (3) the fit between our data and the Raine model is improved by a cross loading for suspiciousness subscale. The latter seems problematic for the global data fitting. This led us to test simple structures models of Siever and Gunderson, Raine et al., and Stefanis et al., based on eight subscales rather than nine. Without suspiciousness subscale, goodness-of-fit indices are enhanced in these three models. The 3-factor model yields the clearest and most reliable results in comparison with other competing models. In summary, the best goodness-of-fit indices were obtained for the 3-factor Raine model. Goodness-of-fit indices could be improved by the exclusion of the suspiciousness scale.\nConsistent with earlier analyses by Raine et al. and Dumas et al., our data confirm the 3-factor model of the SPQ (cognitive-perceptive; interpersonal; disorganized) in a sample of French speaking adolescents. Our analyses confirm that two dimensions are insufficient to explain the structure of schizotypy during adolescence. These results further suggest the stability of a 3-factor structure during lifespan. We note that the inclusion of the suspiciousness subscales engenders statistical issues. Most studies to date have dealt with these issues by performing a cross-loading with this subscale, or by the inclusion of a paranoid factor which is linked with the negative and the cognitive-perceptive factors. We found that the most statistically sound strategy was reached without the inclusion of the suspiciousness subscale. Future studies with larger samples could investigate the SPQ structure at an item-level, which carries the benefit of reduced restrictions on the factorial analysis. In conclusion, the current study shows that the French version SPQ constitutes a reliable self-report questionnaire for the assessment of schizotypal trait expression during adolescence that may assist in the evaluation of psychosis proneness in youths."}, {"Title": "Time will tell: a retrospective study investigating the relationship between insomnia and objectively defined punctuality.", "Abstract": "Primary insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder affecting approximately 3% of the general population. Studies suggest that personality traits such as perfectionism and neuroticism might be implicated in the aetiology of the disorder. However, to date, no study has investigated behavioural indicators of these factors in a hypothesis-driven manner. In the present study, we assessed punctuality as a behavioural indicator of perfectionism and neuroticism in 635 consecutive clinical patients of the sleep laboratory of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Freiburg Medical Center. The primary aim was to compare primary insomnia patients (n = 148) with another group of patients with other sleep-related diagnoses (n = 487). Primary insomnia patients arrived on average 4 min earlier when compared to other patients (P = 0.041). However, this effect failed to reach statistical significance when correcting for the influence of potential confounding variables. Of note, we found a strong relationship between polysomnographic sleep parameters and punctuality. That is, short sleep duration was associated significantly with early arrival times at the sleep laboratory (P = 0.023). These findings support the proposal that personality traits, which we predict underlie obsessive punctuality, may be involved in the aetiology of objectively defined sleep disturbances.

Uncertain drug adherence, suboptimal tolerability, non-response at therapeutic doses, or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are typical situations when measurement of medication concentrations is helpful. Patient populations that may predominantly benefit from TDM in psychiatry are children, pregnant women, elderly patients, individuals with intelligence disabilities, forensic patients, patients with known or suspected genetically determined pharmacokinetic abnormalities or individuals with pharmacokinetically relevant comorbidities. However, the potential benefits of TDM for optimization of pharmacotherapy can only be obtained if the method is adequately integrated into the clinical treatment process. To promote an appropriate use of TDM, the TDM expert group of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Neuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (AGNP) issued guidelines for TDM in psychiatry in 2004. Since then, knowledge has advanced significantly, and new psychopharmacologic agents have been introduced that are also candidates for TDM. Therefore the TDM consensus guidelines were updated and extended to 128 neuropsychiatric drugs. 4 levels of recommendation for using TDM were defined ranging from \"strongly recommended\" to \"potentially useful\". Evidence-based \"therapeutic reference ranges\" and \"dose related reference ranges\" were elaborated after an extensive literature search and a structured internal review process. A \"laboratory alert level\" was introduced, i.\u2009e., a plasma level at or above which the laboratory should immediately inform the treating physician. Supportive information such as cytochrome P450 substrate- and inhibitor properties of medications, normal ranges of ratios of concentrations of drug metabolite to parent drug and recommendations for the interpretative services are given.

Psychoanalysts rarely serve as Balint group leaders. Sessions are normally held every 2 weeks (26.7 %) or once a month (26.4 %). Despite the original intention of Michael Balint, the idea of holding weekly Balint groups is now seldom(3.9 %). 85 %of the Balint group leaders prefer sessions lasting 90 minutes. An average of 8.6 participants attend, with 2.1 persons missing. There is a great heterogeneity in the professions of Balint group leaders. 17.4 % of them are older 65 years.\nThis study shows that Balint group work in Germany is well integrated in both general practice and psychotherapy, and it is still of great interest to many specialists of other disciplines as well as a good way to realize further education.

Thomas S. Szasz was the most vituperative and best-known critic, but he was by no means alone. Individuals and groups from both extremes of the political spectrum were united in their belief that psychiatry was not a legitimate medical specialty, but one that was devoted to protecting its authority as well as enforcing societal norms associated with an unjust society. The attack on psychiatry, of course, did not occur in a vacuum; numerous social and intellectual currents played major roles.

We conducted a study in order to estimate the concurrent validity and sensitivity to change using clinical parameters as ICD-10 diagnoses, as well as the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), and the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP) psychopathology scale, a frequently used psychopathological rating system, in a representative clinical sample.\nData on the three instruments (CGI, AMDP, HoNOS-D) were collected at admission and discharge of 100 psychiatric inpatients using a representative clinical sample. Experienced clinicians completed the CGI, AMDP and HoNOS-D. Descriptive and comparative data analyses were performed. We estimated the concurrent validity by calculating correlations between the HoNOS and other scales. Secondly, we examined the differences between HoNOS scores related to diagnoses and demographic parameters. Thirdly we calculated change criteria and outcome effect size for the HoNOS.\nEven in a small clinical sample (n = 100), the HoNOS-D items are highly correlated with the corresponding AMDP syndromes (p < 0.003). The HoNOS-D score is associated with the CGI score (p < 0.01). Correlations of HoNOS symptoms, behavior and impairment items with AMDP syndromes as well as differences in diagnoses were appropriate and comprehensible as regards clinical content, and change on the HoNOS total score is statistically significant (t = 6.57, d.f. = 89, p < 0.0001).\nThis study is the first to investigate the concurrent validity of HoNOS-D concerning psychopathology using the AMDP rating system in a clinical sample of patients with mental disorders in an inpatient setting. HoNOS-D can be recommended for routinely screening outcomes in inpatient psychiatric settings. Our analysis showed that HoNOS-D covers psychopathology corresponding to the AMDP rating system.

Electronic Health Record (EHR) system contain large volumes of patient data that could be used for CER, but the data contained in EHR system are typically accessible only in formats that are not conducive to rapid synthesis and interpretation of therapeutic outcomes. In the time-pressured clinical setting, clinicians faced with large amounts of patient data in formats that are not readily interpretable often feel 'information overload'. Decision support tools that enable rapid access at the point of care to aggregate data on the most effective therapeutic outcomes derived from CER would greatly aid the clinical decision-making process and individualize patient care. In this manuscript, we highlight the role that visual analytics can play in CER-based clinical decision support. We developed a 'VisualDecisionLinc' (VDL) tool prototype that uses visual analytics to provide summarized CER-derived data views to facilitate rapid interpretation of large amounts of data. We highlight the flexibility that visual analytics offers to gain an overview of therapeutic options and outcomes and if needed, to instantly customize the evidence to the needs of the patient or clinician.

All of them are legitimate as there is no conclusive evidence that either is more proper than others in terms of its capacity to explicate the very nature of mental disorders and make possible more efficacious treatment of those with mental illness. There are two major sources of the existence of numerous models in psychiatry: difficulties in discerning the role played by the biological and the psychological in the genesis and treatment of individual mental disorders, and want of a widely accepted theory of the mind-body relationship. The conceptual divide in psychiatry has numerous negative effects: scarce communication or no communication between the advocates of different approaches; over-rating of the benefits of the concept one clings to; lack of interest in other approaches; confusion of clients when confronted with different explanation of the origin of their troubles and most appropriate treatment; tarnished image of psychiatry.

However, clinical studies with selective NK(3) receptor antagonists in these psychiatric conditions have been disappointing and they were unable to confirm the promising therapeutic potential from animal studies, thereby questioning the therapeutic utility of these compounds for CNS disorders.

Schizophrenia is a disorder that has the most regressive effects in societies' and patients' behavioural, occupational and psychiatric aspects. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life and global function of schizophrenia patients.\nA hundred schizophrenia patients (with DSM-IV-TR) who had a history of at least 10 years from the beginning of the disorder were collected. Demographic characteristics, type of schizophrenia, living condition and the quality of life scale (QLS) including: interpersonal relationship, instrumental role, intra psychic foundations and common objects and activities, were gathered. Patients' general functions were evaluated with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS statistical software using Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Dunken and Pearson's correlation test.\nIn this study 67% of patients were male and 51% were female. They were comprised of residual (55%), paranoid (11%) and undifferentiated (33%) schizophrenia. They lived in institute (67%) and with their families (28%). There was a moderate correlation between QLS and GAF (p<0.01, r=0.2). A significant association was found between married and single patients in instrumental role (F: 2.97), P<0.05) but there was not a significant association in other domains. Correlation were found between undifferentiated and paranoid patients in interpersonal relationship (F: 2.97), P<0.05). However there weren't any correlation in intra psychic foundation and common objects and activities domains. Also there were significant associations in GAF (F: 3.98), P<0.05) between uneducated and educated participants. There was not an association between the Mean of five domains and genders.\nSchizophrenia patients' quality of life is low which shows the value and reliability of Global Assessment Functioning that is usually used for every psychiatrics' patients for V axis clinical diagnosis and indicated the clinical value of this scale.

Dosing in paediatric psychiatric patients requires careful handling, since the dose recommendations for adults can not simply be extrapolated to minors because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences. In addition, psychopharmacotherapy in children and adolescents is hampered by lack of high quality evidence on efficacy and safety in many indications and subsequently a high degree of off-label use. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is an established and useful tool in psychiatry to individualize and optimize the outcomes (efficacy/safety balance) of psychopharmacological drug treatment in the individual patient by dose adjustments based upon measured serum concentrations. In children and adolescents the administration of psychotropic drugs is a general indication for performing TDM. However, TDM studies specific in these age groups are necessary to identify age and indication specific therapeutic ranges of serum concentrations. Systematic collection of data on drug exposure, serum concentrations and clinical characteristics as well as outcomes can generate such practice-based evidence. A German-Swiss-Austrian competence network for TDM in child and adolescent psychiatry using a multi-centre internet-based data infrastructure was founded to document and collect demographic, safety and efficacy data as well as blood concentrations of psychotropic drugs in children and adolescents (further information: www.tdm-kjp.com)."}, {"Title": "Evidence-based medicine: opportunities and challenges in a diverse society.", "Abstract": "In this article we explore the discourse and practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in the context of social and cultural diversity.

We then note its importance in contemporary psychiatry, comparing dynamics between the United States and Canada. Secondly, we offer a constructive critique of the application of EBM and evidence-based practices in the context of ethnocultural diversity, as one consistent reflection on the EBM literature is that it is does not adequately address issues of diversity. In doing so, we use the situation here in Canada as an extended case study, though our observations will likely be applicable in other diverse nations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. We critically examine the following 6 issues related to the practice of EBM in a diverse society: generalizability and transferability of evidence-based interventions; diversifying standards of evidence in EBM; strategies to address diversity in EBM research; cultural adaptations of evidence-based interventions; integrating idiographic knowledge; and, training and health service delivery. Concurrent with our critique, we offer research and practice suggestions that may address outstanding challenges vis-\u00e0-vis the practice of EBM in a diverse society. These include a need for more effectiveness research, more openness to diverse sources of knowledge, better integration of idiographic and nomothetic knowledge, and a critical approach to extrapolation and transfer of knowledge."}, {"Title": "PECC--factor structure and findings in three longitudinal cohorts of patients with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Symptom control by drug treatment is the most important task in routine clinical care of patients with schizophrenia.

The Psychosis Evaluation tool for Common use by Caregivers (PECC) was constructed in Europe some years ago, with the intent to overcome some of the PANSS drawbacks.\nTo validate PECC on three longitudinal cohorts of schizophrenic patients representative of Swedish outpatients (n = 225, six assessments over 5 years), international forensic patients (n = 186) and matched non-forensic controls (n = 116), five assessments over 2 years for both.\nThe factor structure of PECC appears to be highly robust. Norm values (in percentiles) were calculated on the materials. Such data provides for analyses of symptom profiles and improvement over time measured in absolute numbers. Forensic patients appear to have a much lower symptom load (except for cognitive symptoms) than the other groups. Forensic controls had much shorter inpatient times than any other group and never caught up with respect to symptom control, even after 2 years. These differences suggest that the scale is clinically valid.\nPECC has a more robust factor structure than PANSS and is simpler to use.

Over the last 30 years, child and adolescent psychiatry has seen an immense shift from the 'cannot change' category to the 'change category' and an even bigger shift to the territory between changeable and unchangeable. The question of the capacity for change in humans and the more traditional notion of 'the human condition' are in need of re-evaluation. The possibility that there might be elements of the human condition that are beyond good and evil is especially relevant to the psychiatric treatment of children and young people. The notion of the human condition in children and adolescents becomes problematic if an essential element of the human condition is the irreducibly unchangeable, as the essence of youth is change and the capacity to change. The notion of personality disorder, and the persistence of disturbed behaviour that the diagnosis implies, are completely out of place in childhood and adolescence. There is a telling discrepancy between the small number of mental health treatment facilities and the large number of juvenile detention facilities in Australia.

The prevalence and severity of psychosis risk items from the mPRIME and the effects of sex and age on symptoms were evaluated. k-Means cluster analysis was used to identify symptom groups. Depending on the mPRIME item, 1.8% to 19.5% of participants reported certainty of having had a psychosis risk symptom. Overall, 45.5% reported having had any psychosis risk symptom. Females had a significantly higher mean severity score on items evaluating persecutory ideation and auditory hallucinations. Symptom severity on 5 items showed a modest (R = 0.09-0.13) but significant correlation with age. Cluster analysis identified 4 groups of participants: normative (55%), high symptom (11%), intermediate symptom (19%), and grandiose symptom (15%). Psychosis risk symptoms appear to be highly prevalent in Kenyan youth. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the correlation of identified symptoms with transition to psychotic illness, as well as the associated functionality and distress, to develop appropriate intervention strategies."}, {"Title": "Gray matters!--mapping the transition to psychosis.", "Abstract": "Despite many neuroimaging studies on schizophrenia showing brain abnormalities the exact time course of their occurrence is unknown. Studies of gray matter are a powerful tool in biological psychiatry and provide an unprecedented opportunity for brain structure investigations. Here we compared cross-sectional and longitudinal structural neuroimaging studies distinguishing high-risk subjects developing psychosis from those who did not. These investigations on gray matter volumes in the prodromal phase potentially identify core structural markers of impending psychoses and clarify dynamic changes underlying the transition. Subjects at high risk of psychosis show qualitatively similar albeit less severe gray matter abnormalities as patients with psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Development of a Guideline on Clinical investigation of Medicinal Product in the Treatment of Depression in Japan].", "Abstract": "Drug development is one of the methods for qualitative improvement of medical treatment.

The definition of child abuse includes abusing children verbally or psychologically, and is not limited to abusing children physically such as beating, sexual abuse, or neglect. Recent studies have revealed that emotional trauma during childhood development could be much more difficult to treat than physical abuse. Severe abuse during childhood can cause abnormal brain development and have a negative impact later in life. In this review, I will introduce the mechanisms of brain damage due to child abuse with consideration of how and when child abuse can have an impact on the victims' brains. The information presented is based on a collaborative study with the Psychiatry Department at Harvard University on the relationship between brain functions and the human mind."}, {"Title": "Differential diagnosis between non-pathological psychotic and spiritual experiences and mental disorders: a contribution from Latin American studies to the ICD-11.", "Abstract": "To review research articles in psychiatry and psychology involving Latin American populations and/or produced by Latin American scholars to investigate the differential diagnosis between spiritual/anomalous experiences and mental disorders in order to contribute to the validity of the International Classification of Diseases towards its 11th edition in this area.\nWe searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and SciELO) using relevant keywords (possession, trance, religious experience, spiritual experience, latin, Brazil) for articles with original psychiatric and psychological data on spiritual experiences. We also analyzed the references of the articles found and contacted authors for additional references and data.\nThere is strong evidence that psychotic and anomalous experiences are frequent in the general population and that most of them are not related to psychotic disorders. Often, spiritual experiences involve non-pathological dissociative and psychotic experiences. Although spiritual experiences are not usually related to mental disorders, they may cause transient distress and are commonly reported by psychotic patients.\nWe propose some features that suggest the non-pathological nature of a spiritual experience: lack of suffering, lack of social or functional impairment, compatibility with the patient's cultural background and recognition by others, absence of psychiatric comorbidities, control over the experience, and personal growth over time."}, {"Title": "Mapping prodromal psychosis: a critical review of neuroimaging studies.", "Abstract": "The onset of schizophrenia is usually preceded by a prodromal phase characterized by functional decline and subtle prodromal symptoms, which include attenuated psychotic phenomena, cognitive deterioration and a decline in socio-occupational function. Preventive interventions during this phase are of great interest because of the impressive clinical benefits. However, available psychopathological criteria employed to define a high risk state for psychosis have low validity and specificity. Consequently there is an urgent need of reliable neurocognitive markers linked to the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie schizophrenia. Neuroimaging techniques have rapidly developed into a powerful tool in psychiatry as they provide an unprecedented opportunity for the investigation of brain structure and function. This review shows that neuroimaging studies of the prodromal phases of psychosis have the potentials to identify core structural and functional markers of an impending risk to psychosis and to clarify the dynamic changes underlying transition to psychosis and to address significant correlations between brain structure or function and prodromal psychopathology. Additionally, neurochemical methods can address the key role played by neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamate during the psychosis onset. To conclude, multimodal neuroimaging may ultimately clarify the neurobiology of the prodromal phases by the integration of functional, structural and neurochemical findings."}, {"Title": "Telepsychiatry \"coverage\" to a rural inpatient psychiatric unit.", "Abstract": "Rural psychiatrists responsible for inpatient psychiatry units in general hospitals often have trouble getting coverage for training, vacations, and periods of illness. This article describes telepsychiatry \"coverage\" to a rural general hospital psychiatric unit for 1 week.\nAll adult patients meeting criteria for inpatient mental health treatment in the emergency room were offered admission to the general hospital after obtaining informed consent regarding the use of inpatient telepsychiatry. The number of patients on the inpatient psychiatric unit ranged from three to nine, with an average daily census of seven. All psychiatric care was provided via video teleconferencing (VTC) at a bandwidth of 512 kilobits per second using Internet Protocol.\nPatients with psychosis reported more difficulty hearing the doctor than patients without psychosis and incorporated VTC into delusions in a congruent manner. Patients rated development of rapport and effectiveness of treatment higher than staff ratings. Two staff thought telepsychiatry was either not effective for acutely psychotic patients or more effective with higher functioning patients.\nShort-term coverage of rural inpatient psychiatric units for purposes of vacation, training, and illness is possible using telepsychiatry. Psychiatrist's efficiency and consistency are enhanced with instantaneous connections possible from hospital, office, or home.

An extensive search of bio-medicolegal articles published in the last five and a half years was performed on the MEDLINE database according to MeSH terms combined with free-text protocols. We performed a systematic analysis of targeted journals after merging, selecting and categorising all retrieved records, taking into account data from the 2009 JCR Science Edition (released on June 2010); 1,037 different journals were identified, of which only 48 (4.6%) focus specifically on bio-medicolegal matters, and of which only seven (14.6%) have an impact factor (IF). Despite this apparent dispersion, 47% of articles were published in bio-medicolegal journals (BML), of which 70.2% were in journals with IF (BML-IF). Articles published in BML-IF journals (33% of total papers) reach almost 50%, mainly in \"Forensic Science International\", \"International Journal of Legal Medicine\" and \"Journal of Forensic Sciences\".

IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 level of AD patients showed no difference from the controls.\nContrary to MD, AD has reversed vegetative symptoms, i.e. hypersomnia and hyperphagia. It is assumed that the phenotype difference between AD and MD might be related to Th1 cytokines (IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4) and not related to monocytic cytokines (IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1)."}, {"Title": "The professionalization of psychology within the apartheid state 1948-1978.", "Abstract": "When the National Party came to power in South Africa in 1948 it inherited an ageing colonial psychiatric system underpinned by British-based mental health legislation promulgated in 1916. This situation remained substantially unchanged until the late 1960s, despite the apartheid government's far-reaching attempts to restructure other aspects of the social landscape. The 1966 assassination of South Africa's prime minister by a schizophrenic parliamentary messenger led directly to a series of commissions of enquiry into the management of mental health services, followed by new mental health legislation in 1973 and the compulsory registration of clinical psychologists. The increasing professionalization of psychology, and the apartheid state's policy in relation to the profession, are considered in the light of local and international influences. Unlike the Nazi and Soviet governments, the apartheid state did not seek to create a new psychology and psychiatry in its own image but was instead motivated by a desire to emulate Western models and to identify and control the dangerous individual."}, {"Title": "Psychotherapy in psychiatry: the current situation and future directions in Germany.", "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to review how psychotherapy is dispensed to patients in psychiatric treatment and to render the future perspectives of psychotherapy in psychiatric outpatient and inpatient care in Germany. We demonstrate that--according to the currently available data about healthcare providers, allocation of financial resources and curricular regulations--the presently used definition of the term \"psychotherapy\" is ambiguous. One major problem for the application of psychotherapy in psychiatry is obviously constituted by the dominance of the major guideline therapies (\"Richtlinienverfahren\") within psychiatric services. Here, guideline therapies do not meet the needs of a significant proportion of acutely, severely and/or chronically ill psychiatric patients and restrain the application of scientifically approved, disorder-oriented and context compliant interventions in psychiatric practice. As a future perspective, we suggest that the training of psychiatrists should impart profound interpersonal skills and provide the competence to offer psychotherapy within a multimodal, modular, and flexible treatment plan on the background of the self-conception of psychiatry as a medical discipline.

There is emerging evidence that some personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder and, to a lesser extent, schizotypal personality disorder, may benefit from treatment with atypical antipsychotics as well as mood stabilizers. This review examines the evidence for atypical antipsychotics for personality disorders and discusses strengths and limitations of this approach.\nSearches of Medline and PsycInfo yielded 57 articles related to use of atypical antipsychotics for treatment of personality disorders. Most were relatively small randomized, controlled trials examining atypical antipsychotics for borderline personality disorder; however, the search also yielded two Cochrane reviews examining pharmacotherapy for borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder as well as three other meta-analyses.\nThere is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics are effective for treating symptom domains in personality disorders, in particular psychotic-like symptoms, impulsivity, aggression and anger. There is no evidence that they improve overall illness severity. Given the high rate of comorbidity between personality disorders and axis I disorders, atypical antipsychotics are best used when these symptom domains are prominent and there is a comorbid axis I condition for which an atypical antipsychotic is indicated."}, {"Title": "Deep brain stimulation in addiction: a review of potential brain targets.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an adjustable, reversible, non-destructive neurosurgical intervention using implanted electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to areas in the brain. DBS is currently investigated in psychiatry for the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome and depressive disorder. Although recent research in both animals and humans has indicated that DBS may be an effective intervention for patients with treatment-refractory addiction, it is not yet entirely clear which brain areas should be targeted. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on DBS and addiction and outline the most promising target areas using efficacy and adverse event data from both preclinical and clinical studies. We found 7 animal studies targeting six different brain areas: nucleus accumbens (NAc), subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal striatum, lateral habenula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hypothalamus, and 11 human studies targeting two different target areas: NAc and STN. Our analysis of the literature suggests that the NAc is currently the most promising DBS target area for patients with treatment-refractory addiction. The mPFC is another promising target, but needs further exploration to establish its suitability for clinical purposes.

Also, patients were evaluated with The Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory (CSI), The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-I-II), and The Problem Solving Inventory (PSI). Patients were followed for six months with monthly intervals after hospital discharge. Drinking status was assessed in terms of abstinence and relapse. Data were assessed with Student t-test, and univariate and multivariate analyses. In the logistic regression analysis, age, marital status, employment status and PSI subscores were taken as the independent variables and drinking state at the end of six months as the dependent variable.\nThere were significant differences in reflective and avoidant styles, and monitoring style of problem solving between abstainers and relapses. It was found that subjects who perceived their problem solving style as less avoidant and less reflective were at greater risk to relapse.\nThe findings demonstrated that active engagement in problem solving like utilizing avoidant and reflective styles of problem solving enhances abstinence. In treatment, expanding the behavior repertoire and increasing the variety of ways of problem solving ways that can be utilized in daily life should be one of the major goals of the treatment program."}, {"Title": "Publication trends in addiction research.", "Abstract": "As opportunities to use and abuse drugs have tremendously increased during the past 50 years, so has addiction research.

In this first report, we provide a brief comprehensive overview on what has been published in terms of addiction in the general and multi-disciplinary science category versus Addiction Biology within the past decade. We reviewed the literature within three time windows 1999/2000, 2004/2005 and 2009/2010 and selected the number of publications (1) according to the country/region where the original study was conducted; (2) according to the drug classes; (3) according to animal versus human studies; (4) and in terms of methodological trends such as genetic association studies and neuro-imaging. We found a 350% increase in addiction-related publications in the general and multi-disciplinary science category within the past decade. This increase, however, was mainly due to increased publication output from the United States. Concerning drug classes, alcohol-, nicotine- and psychostimulant-related publications clearly increased between 1999 and 2010, whereas published papers related to opioids decreased over time. There were also strongly increasing trends for genetic and imaging studies in the addiction field over time.

Each informant contributes unique information about an individual's problems. Thus, it has been advocated to obtain ratings from multiple sources in child psychiatry, whereas adult psychiatry relies mostly on self-reports. Longitudinal studies repeatedly assessing children's psychiatric problems from childhood into adulthood and including reports from multiple informants could serve as benchmarks for studies including only selected time points or informants. We examined the development of agreement among informants' ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems using self-, parent, teacher, and partner reports in a longitudinal study with 7 assessment waves spanning an interval of 24 years and covering an age range of 4 to 40 years. The number of informant pairs is 12,059, who rated 1,875 individuals. The results revealed that correlations among informant ratings of internalizing and externalizing problems depend more on the informant pair than on problem type or age group. Second, differences among informants rating internalizing problems typically become larger when individuals get older. Third, when rating themselves, individuals typically report higher scores than do parents, teachers, or partners. These results were consistent for internalizing and externalizing problems and across age groups. The findings indicate that like in child psychiatry, assessment in adult psychiatry may benefit from a shift to multiple informant reports, as different informants' ratings may contain more information than if informants completely agree."}, {"Title": "Religion and spirituality in psychiatric practice.", "Abstract": "The role of religion and spirituality in psychiatric practice has long been a topic of discussion among mental health providers, patients, and faith communities.

These 86 students had significantly higher openness scores than those who indicated a lesser likelihood of pursuing psychiatry. Students who were highly interested in psychiatry ranked it as very attractive in respect to providing interesting and challenging subject matter, and relatively attractive in respect to financial reward, work enjoyment, good lifestyle, having a bright and interesting future, and association with colleagues. However, psychiatry remained less attractive with respect to prestige, perceived low effectiveness of treatments, degree to which it draws upon aspects of medical training, and lack of reliable scientific foundation. Within the entire sample, psychiatry was ranked most unattractive compared to the other specialties across eight of the 13 parameters assessed.\nStudents interested in psychiatry are more likely to be 'open' and view the specialty as interesting and challenging. Such characteristics should be promoted more widely along with countering myths that as a specialty, psychiatry lacks a scientific foundation or is somehow different from mainstream medicine in terms of training and outcomes. Championing psychiatry in this manner may attract more recruits and enhance its prestige."}, {"Title": "Differentially expressed genes in major depression reside on the periphery of resilient gene coexpression networks.", "Abstract": "The structure of gene coexpression networks reflects the activation and interaction of multiple cellular systems. Since the pathology of neuropsychiatric disorders is influenced by diverse cellular systems and pathways, we investigated gene coexpression networks in major depression, and searched for putative unifying themes in network connectivity across neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, based on the prevalence of the lethality\u2013centrality relationship in disease-related networks, we hypothesized that network changes between control and major depression-related networks would be centered around coexpression hubs, and secondly, that differentially expressed (DE) genes would have a characteristic position and connectivity level in those networks. Mathematically, the first hypothesis tests the relationship of differential coexpression to network connectivity, while the second \u201chybrid\u201d expression-and-network hypothesis tests the relationship of differential expression to network connectivity. To answer these questions about the potential interaction of coexpression network structure with differential expression, we utilized all available human post-mortem depression-related datasets appropriate for coexpression analysis, which spanned different microarray platforms, cohorts, and brain regions. Similar studies were also performed in an animal model of depression and in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder microarray datasets. We now provide results which consistently support (1) that genes assemble into small-world and scale-free networks in control subjects, (2) that this efficient network topology is largely resilient to changes in depressed subjects, and (3) that DE genes are positioned on the periphery of coexpression networks. Similar results were observed in a mouse model of depression, and in selected bipolar- and schizophrenia-related networks. Finally, we show that baseline expression variability contributes to the propensity of genes to be network hubs and/or to be DE in disease. In summary, our results suggest that the small-world and scale-free properties of gene networks are resilient to pathological changes in major depression, and that the network structure may constrain the extent to which a gene may be DE in the illness, hence informing further gene-network-based mechanistic studies of neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Classification of late-life leisure activities among elderly Chinese in Hong Kong.", "Abstract": "To develop a classification to describe leisure activities of elderly Hong Kong Chinese based on the functions fulfilled, namely: intellectual, physical, social, and recreational.\nA focus group comprising care-for-the-elderly professionals was invited to identify leisure activities commonly practised by elderly Chinese in Hong Kong.

However, worldwide the access to such medication can vary considerably. In this study, access to a wide range of psychiatric medication including antidepressants, antipsychotics, tranquilisers, mood stabilisers and ADHD medication was analysed for the Western African country of The Gambia by surveying private pharmacies within the urban and sub-urban areas of Banjul, the country's capital. The results show that most of these pharmacies tend to keep a very limited range of psychiatric drugs in stock. In many instances only a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g., amitriptyline), the neuroleptic haloperidol and the benzodiazepine diazepam were readily available. None of the pharmacies kept ADHD medication in stock, and only very few had mood stabilisers. However, several pharmacies reported to be able to obtain at request most of the drugs from international sources, including atypical antipsychotics, SSRIs, and dual-acting antidepressants. Therefore, it can be concluded that in rapidly growing urban centres of developing countries exemplified by Banjul, the infrastructure for modern psychopharmacotherapy is well established, and that the lack of immediate access to modern psychopharmacological compounds represents not so much a genuine lack of availability, but rather a lack of demand which may be associated with the considerable cost-implications of such treatment and the absence of prescribers (i.e. psychiatrists and other doctors with an expertise in modern psychopharmacotherapy). To our knowledge this is the first such study for The Gambia and results might be representative for the wider Western African region. It also exemplifies the challenges psychiatry is facing in developing countries worldwide. It is essential that government-sponsored so-called \"essential medication lists\" are continuously updated in order to reflect the progress in medical research including psychopharmacology. Further research into how to facilitate psychopharmacotherapy is urgently needed in order to further improve psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Transforming poison into medicine: the role of dualism in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This article draws attention to a generalizable phenomenon called \"transforming poison into medicine,\" illustrating both literal and figurative applications. The purpose of such illustrations is to support a strong philosophical claim, namely the currently incomplete reduction (if not the ultimate irreducibility) of intentional mind-states - e.g., beliefs, desires, volitions - to electro-chemical brain-states. Such incomplete reduction (or irreducibility) holds profound implications for the ineluctable role of dualism in neuroscience and psychiatry alike."}, {"Title": "Chronotherapeutics and psychiatry: setting the clock to relieve the symptoms.", "Abstract": "Circadian rhythms are near 24-h cycles in a number of physiological and behavioural parameters and the underpinning circadian timing systems is one of the key homeostatic regulatory systems in mammalian physiology. Many common psychiatric conditions are associated with disrupted sleep, including a common occurrence of delayed or advanced phase sleep syndromes, which in themselves may be indicative of dysregulated circadian timing in these disorders. In this article we discuss the evidence for abnormal circadian rhythms in seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Much of this evidence suggest that these conditions are associated with either phase delays or phase advances of core phase markers of the circadian clock such as melatonin or core body temperature, suggesting the presence of circadian desynchrony in these conditions. We also highlight findings that pharmacological and/or behavioural interventions that ameliorate circadian misalignments are efficacious in producing symptomatic relief, suggesting an intrinsic link between the circadian and affective systems that can be manipulated for clinical benefit."}, {"Title": "Forensic patients with organic brain disorders.", "Abstract": "Present literature states that people with acquired organic brain dysfunctions face problems with attention, executive functions and social interaction. During the past years an increasing number of patients with organic brain disorders have been committed into our forensic psychiatry.

Included were all patients of the forensic psychiatry in Rostock (Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania) with a primary or secondary organic brain dysfunction who have been committed into the clinic since 2009. These patients went through an extensive neuropsychological test battery. It was found that patients affected by organic brain dysfunction achieve lower results in the neuropsychological testing than non impaired patients, but their results are not as below average than it would have been expected.

It may also provide new neuroanatomical targets for treatments. A detailed understanding of neuroanatomy is a prerequisite of understanding the pathomechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders on a molecular and cellular level. The tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA), also known as rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), is a recently described region which may be a major inhibitory control centre for the dopaminergic systems. These systems participates to behavioural functions and are implicated in the aetiology, symptoms or treatment of neurological or psychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's, schizophrenia, mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity-disorder (ADHD) and drug abuse. Belonging to the reticular formation, the tVTA may constitute a major inhibitory GABAergic input to these dopaminergic systems. Moreover, it is sensitive to drugs of abuse, to stimulant or arousing drugs, to aversive stimuli and it could also be the main relay between lateral habenula and VTA. First described in rats, and proposed as a component of the emotional motor system implicated in basic survival behaviours, tVTA appears as a relevant structure for molecular psychiatry, which should foster research to define and study this brain region in the human brain."}, {"Title": "Modern neuroimaging in psychiatry: towards the integration of functional and molecular information.", "Abstract": "Thirty-five years of psychiatric imaging along traditional diagnostic boundaries have revealed a great deal about the structural and functional brain changes that accompany mental disorders but not produced reliable biomarkers. One reason may be that clinical syndromes represent the phenotypic expression of many different genotypes and biological pathways. Neuroimaging is now increasingly being used to map out the pathways from genes (obtained from candidate or genome-wide association studies) to the cognitive, emotional and behavioural phenotypes that result in syndromes like schizophrenia or depression. The armamentarium of neuroimaging is becoming increasingly versatile, and now includes methods with considerable spatial, temporal and/or molecular resolution. We can expect that a sophisticated combination of these techniques with genetic and pharmacological information will usher into a new era of psychiatric imaging that will aid a biological classification of mental diseases."}, {"Title": "Conceptualising molecular psychiatry and translational psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The terms \"molecular psychiatry\" and \"translational psychiatry\" are frequently used key words of today's scientific community.

Omic studies include pharmacogenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Herbal medicines, as monotherapies, or complex formulations such as traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, may benefit from omic studies, and this new field may be termed 'herbomics'. Applying herbomics in the field of psychiatry may provide answers about which herbal interventions may be effective for individuals, which genetic processes are triggered, and the subsequent neurochemical pathways of activity. The use of proteomic technology can explore the differing epigenetic effects on neurochemical gene expression between individual herbs, isolated constituents and complex formulae. The possibilities of side effects or insufficient response to the herb can also be assessed via pharmacogenomic analysis of polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or P-glycoprotein. While another novel application of omic technology is for the validation of the concept of synergy in individual herbal extracts and prescriptive formulations. Chronic administration of psychotropic herbal medicines may discover important effects on chromatin remodelling via modification of histone and DNA methylation.

Previous work has shown that urinary incontinence is not always considered to be important in inpatient psychiatry.\nRetrospective analysis of provincial database for inpatient psychiatry.\nThe study included all psychiatric inpatients in Ontario assessed with the Resident Assessment Instrument Mental Health at both admission and discharge since 1 October 2005. We used sex-based analyses to examine the prevalence of urinary incontinence at admission and change over the inpatient stay. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between urinary incontinence and experiencing an above average length of stay in hospital.\nThe prevalence of urinary incontinence at admission was 5\u00b76%; rates were higher among women and the profiles of afflicted men and women differed. Approximately 35% of psychiatric patients were no longer incontinent at the time of discharge, and new cases of incontinence were reported for 1\u00b72% of patients. Both the presence of urinary incontinence at admission and development of urinary incontinence over the inpatient stay were related to increased likelihood of having a longer than average length of stay. These odds were significant for both sexes, but higher for women for the role of urinary incontinence at admission and higher for men for the role of developing urinary incontinence.\nUrinary incontinence was present among a non-trivial proportion of psychiatric inpatients and persisted for most throughout the inpatient stay. Presence of urinary incontinence was related to increased hospital stay.\nMental health service providers should identify urinary incontinence quickly and pay attention to it; incorporating treatment into the care plan early on in the inpatient stay may help to ensure a more rapid return to the community."}, {"Title": "Comparative efficacy study of haloperidol, olanzapine and risperidone in delirium.", "Abstract": "The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of second-generation antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone vs. haloperidol in patients of delirium admitted to medical and surgical wards.\nProspective follow-up single-blind randomized controlled trials were performed.

The work of the charismatic reformer Franco Basaglia had four main objectives, which have taken more than 30 years to achieve. Although the creation of outpatient mental health centres and a reduction in involuntary commitments occurred rapidly, the expensive development of small acute psychiatric departments in general hospitals as an alternative to psychiatric hospitals was implemented very slowly. According to a national survey by the Italian Ministry of Health, in 2001, there were a total of 9,300 acute beds for all of Italy, of which as many as 4,000 were in private facilities. With 1.72 acute beds per 10,000 inhabitants, Italy has one of the lowest figures in Europe of psychiatric beds. However, Italy's apparent and often praised low bed requirement places a large burden on families. The implementation of the reform process was most delayed and occurred at its worst in South Tyrol, in North Italy.

I suggest that there are strong parallels with Aristotle's account of tragic narratives and the concepts of representation and performance of forensic expert testimony, as described by Griffith and Baranoski-especially in relation to the creation of voice. On this account, the forensic expert's psychiatric court report acts as a tragic narrative that makes defendants come alive as people. Such performance is crucial for the criminal justice process, where there are competing accounts of the truth, and the expert narrative can articulate the voice of different parties. However, there are other legal fora where the role of the forensic psychiatric voice may be less clear.

It is performance. Anthropology, religious studies, political science, and psychology (among other disciplines) have investigated elements of face-to-face human interaction set within ritual and credentialed it as worthy of attention and belief. Such is the nature of expert testimony within forensic psychiatry. This is our position, but we also consider well-founded concerns about the ethics of highlighting oral performance.

This study aimed to explore nurses' assessment and management of delirium when caring for people with cancer, the elderly or older people requiring psychiatric care in the inpatient setting.\nParticipants in this qualitative study were nurses working in Australian public hospital inpatient dedicated units in palliative care, aged care (geriatrics), aged care (geriatric) psychiatry and oncology. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore nurses' views about specific areas of delirium assessment and management. Purposive sampling was used and interviews conducted until thematic saturation reached. A thematic content analysis was performed from a grounded theory perspective.\nA total of 40 participants were included in the study. The analysis revealed four broad analytical themes: (1) superficial recognition and understanding of the operational definition of delirium or recognition of delirium as a syndrome; (2) nursing assessment: investigative versus a problem solving approach; (3) management: maintaining dignity and minimizing chaos; and (4) distress and the effect on others.\nNurses have limited knowledge of the features of delirium regardless of their specialty discipline. Delirium was uniformly identified as a highly distressing experience for patients, families and staff alike. The majority of nurses had a superficial understanding of delirium management, and adopted a task-orientated approach aimed at addressing the more noticeable problems.

We argue that direct extrapolation of placebo and nocebo effects of psychiatric medication in the voluntary setting to the situation of coercive treatment is probably not justified. Both placebo and nocebo effects are based upon patient expectations about the medication, but, in general, patient expectations in settings of involuntary medication tend to be less positive than in voluntary settings. As a consequence, placebo effects are likely to be diminished in coercive treatment, while nocebo effects are probably increased. This may result in an overall decreased effectiveness of medication in coercive settings."}, {"Title": "An RSU by any other name: thoughts on the naming of secure units.", "Abstract": "Names are powerful symbols which contribute to internal and external perceptions of an individual or institution.

The task of a psychiatrist providing expert opinion to criminal courts is far from clear. Psychiatric experts are trained in a particular set of ethical and philosophical frameworks. They have expertise in the diagnosis and management of behaviours arising from mental disorders. The concept of mental disorder itself is a dimensional one. Such a dimensional view of human behaviour and mental disorders is hard to fit into the categorical view of human behaviour that the law follows. The task of the psychiatric expert is to marry these two philosophically different branches. Such a task would be facilitated by clear rules of admissibility of expert psychiatric evidence, clear definition of the roles and limitations of psychiatric evidence in criminal cases, a better understanding and training of mental health professionals in legal principles and a better understanding by the legal professionals of the mental health concepts.

Narrative psychiatry is also on the rise and promises to help psychiatry be responsive to increasing critical concerns from inside and outside the field.\nThe field of narrative is vast and cuts across a variety of disciplines. Contemporary scholars in narrative medicine build on 30 years of work in medical humanities and bioethics to rigorously understand human variables in medicine and to improve physician empathy. Narrative psychotherapists have developed a new model of psychotherapy and a meta-narrative theory of diverse mental health interventions. Psychiatrists have picked up these insights and are finding them invaluable for navigating contemporary issues in psychiatry.\nNarrative theory has become important in the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and psychotherapy for understanding human meaning making. Increasingly, the tools of narrative are proving valuable for psychiatry as well. Narrative psychiatry does not negate or supersede other knowledge and research in psychiatry, but it can help psychiatry understand how people use psychiatric knowledge, among other cultural resources, for making sense of psychic difficulties and psychic differences."}, {"Title": "Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-short form for quality of life assessments in clinical practice: a psychometric study.", "Abstract": "The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) and its short form (Q-LES-Q-SF) are among the most frequently used outcome measures in psychiatry research.

Fifty-seven adults with a psychiatric diagnosis participated. Psychometric evaluation included descriptive analysis, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, validity, sensitivity and responsiveness analysis. The amount of missing data was 5.3%, while no floor or ceiling effects were observed. The internal consistency and test-retest coefficients were 0.9 and 0.93, respectfully. Almost all items significantly correlated to the total score and other measures used in the study, with the correlations ranging 0.41-0.81. Finally, the responsiveness parameters indicated the Q-LES-Q-SF is 80% sensitive and 100% specific measure.

Mean cortical thickness did not differ between the groups. Over time, excessive cortical thinning was found in widespread areas on the cortical mantle, most pronounced bilaterally in the temporal cortex and in the left frontal area. Poor outcome in patients was associated with more pronounced cortical thinning. Higher cumulative intake of typical antipsychotics during the scan interval was associated with more pronounced cortical thinning, whereas higher cumulative intake of atypical antipsychotic medication was associated with less pronounced cortical thinning.\nIn schizophrenia, the cortex shows excessive thinning over time in widespread areas of the brain, most pronounced in the frontal and temporal areas, and progresses across the entire course of the illness. The excessive thinning of the cortex appears related to outcome and medication intake."}, {"Title": "From genes to therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders - what to expect?", "Abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders as schizophrenia, autism and mood disorders represent one of the leading causes of disability.

At the same time we are facing an unprecedented rate of discovery in human genetics. Genes predisposing for common diseases including psychiatric disorders are being identified. The knowledge derived from the identification of genes relevant for psychiatric disorders holds the promise of providing truly innovative therapeutic interventions. The process of approving new psychiatric drugs, is however complex, lengthy and requires a well orchestrated and funded effort of multiple disciplines.

The authors examined whether the many positive cG\u00d7E findings reported in the psychiatric literature were robust or if, in aggregate, cG\u00d7E findings were consistent with the existence of publication bias, low statistical power, and a high false discovery rate.\nThe authors conducted analyses on data extracted from all published studies (103 studies) from the first decade (2000-2009) of cG\u00d7E research in psychiatry.\nNinety-six percent of novel cG\u00d7E studies were significant compared with 27% of replication attempts. These findings are consistent with the existence of publication bias among novel cG\u00d7E studies, making cG\u00d7E hypotheses appear more robust than they actually are. There also appears to be publication bias among replication attempts because positive replication attempts had smaller average sample sizes than negative ones. Power calculations using observed sample sizes suggest that cG\u00d7E studies are underpowered. Low power along with the likely low prior probability of a given cG\u00d7E hypothesis being true suggests that most or even all positive cG\u00d7E findings represent type I errors.\nIn this new era of big data and small effects, a recalibration of views about groundbreaking findings is necessary.

It will be very difficult to address this problem without attracting more medical students to psychiatry and motivating the current crop of psychiatrists to see more patients and delay retirement. In this study the authors sought to identify factors that have a significant impact on the career satisfaction of psychiatrists.\nData were gathered from 314 psychiatrists who participated in the 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey conducted by the Center for Studying Health System Change. Independent variables were grouped as practice-related factors, compensation-related factors, patient-related factors, and demographic characteristics of psychiatrists. Career satisfaction of psychiatrists was the outcome measure of this study.\nThreat of malpractice and the need to consider in treatment decisions out-of-pocket cost to patients had a significant negative impact on career satisfaction. Adequate time with a patient had a significant positive impact on career satisfaction. None of the compensation-related factors was significant. Psychiatrists who worked in practices that accepted new Medicare patients reported significantly higher levels of career dissatisfaction, whereas those who worked in practices that accepted new Medicaid patients reported significantly higher levels of career satisfaction. Older psychiatrists were more satisfied than younger psychiatrists, and white, non-Hispanic psychiatrists were more satisfied than African-American or Hispanic psychiatrists.\nThe results of this study highlight the need for policy makers and health care administrators to develop specific strategies to increase career satisfaction, which in return may help alleviate the shortage of psychiatrists."}, {"Title": "Walking a fine line: Forensic mental health practitioners' experience of working with correctional officers.", "Abstract": "This paper explores mental health professionals' experiences working with correctional staff--one aspect of an interdisciplinary phenomenological study of ethical practice in forensic psychiatry.

For example, among the neurotic disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder can be seen from around 3 years of age, with rapid rise in prevalence from around age 10. Increase is also seen in cases of anorexia nervosa from around age 11. This report examines the association between disorders in childhood and adolescence, in comparison to that in adulthood, with focus on obsessive-compulsive disorder. To start with, the characteristics of childhood onset cases with onset under age 7 were reviewed, revealing a relatively large proportion of subjects with experience of separation anxiety. Analyses revealed the possibility of anticipating obsessional tendencies in the parents of such subjects. Further clarification of the features of such early onset cases is hoped for in future. Next, we conducted a literature review comparing the characteristics of child and adolescent obsessive-compulsive disorder with that in adulthood. It has been determined that obsessive-compulsive symptoms in childhood and adolescence have a relatively unyielding 4-factor construct that persists through life, namely: 1) symmetry factor, 2) forbidden thoughts factor, 3) cleaning factor, and 4) hoarding factor. Of these, children with primary symptoms of hoarding are said to have poorer long-term diagnoses than children with other symptoms. Another point of note is the presence of large disparity regarding the prognosis of cases with concomitant tics. While the prognosis of childhood-obsessive compulsive disorder is generally favorable in many reports, the need for caution has also been noted regarding the possibility of transition on to schizophrenia in more than just a few cases."}, {"Title": "[Integrative studies for early psychosis: toward realizing youth mental health].", "Abstract": "The editorial of the new-year issue of Nature 2010 features \"A decade for psychiatric disorders\". The DALY estimation clearly shows that psychiatric disorders are the top source for burden of diseases to the individual life and society. Schizophrenia is a most devastating psychiatric disorder in which the onset is usually at youth and the cognitive dysfunction persists for life-long in some patients. Schizophrenia is associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been unknown whether post-onset progressive pathology is also present in schizophrenia until the recent sophistication of in vivo neuroimaging techniques. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies on first-episode schizophrenia have shown a progressive deterioration of structure and function of neocortical regions in the early stage of the disorder. Insult to dendritic spines through glutamatergic dysfunction may underlie this process, which may in turn be a promising molecular target for intervention to improve the functional outcome of schizophrenia. More recently, the question of whether early intervention can be targeted at prodromal stage of schizophrenia has called special attention in psychiatry. In University of Tokyo, the integrative neuroimaging studies for schizophrenia targeting early intervention and prevention (IN-STEP) is ongoing.

However, state and national budgets face deepening cuts, with rising health care costs taking the blame. As the gap between needs and finances widens, identification of cost-effective treatments that will benefit children with SED and their families is of increasing importance. Community-based interventions for this population, such as the wraparound approach and systems-of-care, are being disseminated but literature is scant regarding effects on expense. The Mental Health Services Program for Youth (MHSPY) model is aligned philosophically with wraparound and systems-of-care but unique in blending public agency dollars to deliver integrated medical, mental health and social services. MHSPY's linked clinical and expense data is useful to study community-based treatment cost-effectiveness.\nTo examine the cost-effectiveness of an intensively integrated, family and community-based clinical intervention for youth with mental health needs in comparison to \"usual care.''\nStudy and reference populations were matched on age, gender, community, psychiatric diagnosis, morbidity and insurance type. Claims analyses included patterns of service utilization and medical expense for both groups. Using propensity score matching, results for study youth are compared with results for the population receiving \"usual care.'' Clinical functioning was measured for the intervention group at baseline and 12 months.\nThe intervention group used lower intensity services and had substantially lower claims expense (e.g. 32% lower for emergency room, 74% lower for inpatient psychiatry) than their matched counterparts in the \"usual care'' group. Intervention youth were consistently maintained in least restrictive settings, with over 88% of days spent at home and showed improved clinical functioning on standard measures.\nThe intensive MHSPY model of service delivery offers potential as a cost-effective intervention for complex youth. Its integrated approach, recognizing needs across multiple life domains, appears to enhance engagement and the effectiveness of mental health treatment, resulting in statistically significant clinical improvements. Functional measures are not collected in \"usual care,'' limiting comparisons. However, claims expense for intervention youth was substantially lower than claims expense for Medicaid comparison youth, suggesting clinical needs for intervention youth post-enrollment were lower than for those receiving \"usual care.''\nThe MHSPY model, which intentionally engages families in \"clustered'' traditional and non-traditional services, represents a replicable strategy for enhancing the impact of clinical interventions, thereby reducing medical expense.\nBlending categorical state agency dollars and insurance funds creates flexibility to support community-based care, including individualized services for high-risk youth. Resulting expenses total no more, and are often less, than \"treatment as usual'' but yield greater clinical benefits.\nFurther research is needed regarding which intervention elements contribute the most towards improved clinical functioning, as well as which patients are most likely to benefit. A randomized trial of MHSPY vs. \"usual care,'' including examination of the sustainability of effects post-disenrollment, would provide a chance to further test this innovative model."}, {"Title": "Structural and functional neuroimaging methods in the diagnosis of dementias: a retrospective chart and brain imaging review.", "Abstract": "Assess the contribution of structural and functional neuroimaging methods to the diagnosis of dementia.\nThis was a retrospective chart and imaging review.

In this report, Bowlby coined the term 'maternal deprivation', which quickly permeated into Western psychiatry and psychology.

This article examines the origins of the 'maternal deprivation' hypothesis, focusing on how the deficiency theory of disease influenced psychiatric discourse, and framed Bowlby's theory of maternal care. We argue that developments in paediatric medicine, and particularly in the field of nutritional deficiencies, provided Bowlby a prototype for conceptualizing his early views on the psychological needs of children and the development of psychopathology."}, {"Title": "From social pathologies to individual psyches: psychiatry navigating socio-political currents in 20th-century Latvia.", "Abstract": "The paper explores psychiatry's responses to the twentieth-century socio-political currents in Latvia by focusing on social objectives, clinical ideologies, and institutional contexts of Soviet mental health care.

The potential impact of the growing knowledge on the practice of psychiatry is explored to update clinicians and administrators as they develop laboratory and service plans.\nPsychiatric electrophysiology currently plays a limited role in the diagnosis and management in psychiatry. This status is not supported by the existing literature. The underutilization of electrophysiological tests in psychiatry is propagated by the fact that the laboratories providing the service are not managed by psychiatrists.

Reflections on the development of psychiatry in British India, C. 1870-1940.", "Abstract": "This article explores the development of psychiatric institutions within the context of British colonial rule in India, in particular during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Existing scholarship on 'colonial medicine' has tended to focus on colonial power and hegemony and the British endeavour to 'colonize the Indian body' during the nineteenth century. It is suggested here that reference to 'colonial' medicine and psychiatry tends to reify the ideology of colonialism and neglect other important dimensions such as the role of international scientific networks and the mental hospital as the locus of care and medicalization. From the later period of British colonial engagement in south Asia, people's right and entitlement to medical care and the colonial state's obligation to provide institutional treatment facilities received increased attention. As the early twentieth-century case of an Indian hospital superintendent shows, practitioners' professional ambitions went beyond the confines of 'colonial psychiatry'.

Research was not what it should have been, and the alienists (psychiatrists of that era) knew it. American alienists, however, were otherwise engaged in all manner of deliberations about important issues of the day relevant to the practice of psychiatry.

The philosophy of the Department of Infant Psychosomatics at the University Children's Hospital Z\u00fcrich emphasizes interdisciplinary teamwork, the application of psychodyamic tools in pediatric liaison psychiatry and utilization of group settings. Clinical approach and course of treatment are illustrated by three case reports, highlighting specific psychotherapeutic interventions with the parent-infant relationship in the context of a paediatric clinic."}, {"Title": "Deinstitutionalizing the history of contemporary psychiatry.", "Abstract": "While contemporary mental health services have been marked by the burgeoning of outpatient and preventive care, the historiography of psychiatry remains largely tied to the study of custodial and palliative treatment.The work in which contemporary psychiatry has been involved cannot be adequately understood as a singular, autonomous enterprise based in a residential facility. It has become a technoscience that operates in numerous settings and alongside multiple sciences, technologies and decision-makers.

It discusses explanations of social change based on deinstitutionalization and proposes instead to put reform practices themselves at the centre of the analysis. Thus, central to this framework is the historicity of the idea of reform itself. Taking the case of France as an example, the article shows how the diffusion of a reformist ethos within psychiatry in the post-World War II period can be accounted for by a change in medical expertise during the first half of the century. It concludes with a discussion of the changing relationship between psychiatrists and the State in the twentieth century."}, {"Title": "'Therapeutic community', psychiatry's reformers and antipsychiatrists: reconsidering changes in the field of psychiatry after World War II.", "Abstract": "In addition to outlining some core characteristics of the therapeutic community--an approach developed during World War II--this article describes the achievements of reformist psychiatrists in the field of the therapeutic community during the 1950s and also discusses the appropriation of this model by the antipsychiatrists during the 1960s.

Many candidate genes have been investigated in relation to psychiatric disorders and many connections have been found. The utilization of these investigations is currently at a theoretical level. Nevertheless, these findings of candidate genes will be important for further research and subsequent clinical use, for example in pharmacogenetics). Due to the rapidly growing number of empirical studies that provide profound analysis of different genes and their variants in different psychiatrical symptomatology, the field is highly divided, and providing a succinct overview is challenging. This article attempts to provide an up-to-date review of the most important and most discussed genes (mainly transporter and receptor genes) contributing to the etiology of psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "[Neurological symptoms in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Certain psychiatric diseases have biological pathomechanisms, and as a result they are accompanied by various neurological symptoms. Neurological examination is a simple method to assess these symptoms. Neurological signs come in two varieties; they are either of the hard or the soft type. Hard symptoms appear primarily in organic psychiatric disorders or as side effects of psychiatric therapy. They can also be encountered during neurological diseases of psychiatric patients. Their use in diagnostics and therapy is widely accepted. In contrast, soft neurological symptoms often stay unnoticed, even though they may contain important pieces of information. For this reason they will form the focus of our discussion. Soft neurological symptoms have been studied in different psychiatric disorder-groups. Up to now most attention has been devoted to schizophrenia. The study suggests that the soft symptoms are trait markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore they also signal disease activity and predict the outcome of the disease. Neurological symptoms are also important pointers for psychiatry. However, more systematic studies may increase the theoretical and practical implications of soft symptoms."}, {"Title": "The (un)managed self: paradoxical forms of agency in self-management of bipolar disorder.", "Abstract": "Self-management of mental illness is a therapeutic paradigm that draws on a distinctly biomedical conceptualization of the isolability of personhood from pathology. This discourse posits a stable and rational patient/consumer who can observe, anticipate, and preside over his disease through a set of learned practices. But in the case of bipolar disorder, where the rationality of the patient is called into question, the managing self is elusive, and the disease that is managed coincides with the self. While humanist critiques of the biomedical model as applied to mental illness have argued that its logic fatalistically denies patients intentionality and effectiveness (Luhrmann, Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American Psychiatry, 2000), biomedical proponents claim that psychiatry's way of envisioning the body as under the control of the intentional mind actually returns agency to the patient/consumer. Rose (The Psychiatric Gaze, 1999) remarks that biomedical models have the potential to \"[open] that which was considered natural to a form of choice\" (p. 37), and that techniques of medical self-control help constitute the free embodied liberal subject who is obliged to calculate and choose. Through an examination of clinical literature as well as the practices and narratives of members of a bipolar support group, this paper explores ethnographically the possibilities for subjectivity and agency that are conditioned or foreclosed by the self-management paradigm, which seems to simultaneously confer and deny rational selfhood to bipolar patients. To express their expertise as rational self-managers, patients/consumers must, paradoxically, articulate constant suspicion toward their present thoughts and emotions, and distrust of an imagined future self. I argue that through their self-management practices, bipolar support group members model provisional and distributed forms of agency based on an elusive, discontinuous, and only partially knowable or controllable self-revealing, perhaps, the limits of the contemporary reification and medicalization of both selfhood and disease."}, {"Title": "Referrals to a liaison psychiatry outpatient clinic.", "Abstract": "This study aimed to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of consecutive referrals to a liaison psychiatry outpatient clinic, based within a National Health Service (NHS) general hospital. All outpatient referrals to the service between January 2005 and January 2008 were subjected to retrospective completion of a proforma for post hoc data collection. Data relating to characteristics of the referral, patients, diagnosis, and nature and extent of contact were extracted for scrutiny. The majority (60.2%) of referrals to the service came from physicians based within the general hospital. Where conveyed, depression (26.7%) was the most commonly cited reason for referral. Diagnoses of both mood (affective) disorders (32.9%) and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders (54.7%) were common. Cognitive behaviour therapy (56.1%) was the most commonly used intervention followed by pharmacological therapy (25.4%).

One hundred years after the publication of Eugen Bleuler's monograph, we are still debating the nosology and mechanisms of schizophrenia. We have stalled in the development of more effective treatments, after success with the introduction of antipsychotic medication. Cure and prevention remain in the distance. This article reviews the importance of Bleuler's monograph for the neuroscientific exploration of schizophrenia. While Bleuler assumed that schizophrenia has a neural basis, he remained agnostic on possible mechanisms and skeptical about the value of pathological diagnosis. He preferred psychological understanding over neural explanation. He gave hope by making schizophrenia dimensional and less predictive of course and outcome. To make progress now, we need to redefine schizophrenia at the level of the brain."}, {"Title": "The reputation of psychiatry in the first half of the twentieth century.", "Abstract": "The article evaluates the arguments used by German psychiatrists in the first half of the twentieth century to raise their professional reputation. The arguments, which were used in Wilhelmine Germany and in the 1920s, changed with the establishment of the NS-regime. While psychiatrists claimed for open care systems and for more transparency of psychiatric practice to the public in the first decades of the twentieth century, psychiatry became a crucial part of NS-health policies after 1933. The psychiatrist's participation in the largest systematic action to kill mentally ill patients known in history forced them to search for ways to legitimatize the murder program and to integrate it into a therapeutical view of future psychiatry by trying to avoid arbitrariness and assigning research a central importance."}, {"Title": "Motivation of primary care physicians for participating in early intervention for psychosis in Japan.", "Abstract": "People with psychosis as represented by schizophrenia experience lengthy delays between the onset and the start of treatment. This duration is called Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP). Since it has been indicated that shorter DUP leads to their better prognosis, early intervention has been a hot topic for decades in clinical psychiatry. In Japan, as any patient can visit either specialists or primary care physicians using medical insurance, a considerable portion of psychosis patients are supposed to visit the latter first. Thus, a role of primary care physicians seems keys of success in implementation of early intervention system in the Japanese society. In this study, to clarify the motivation of physicians to participate in early intervention, we sent postal questionnaires to 4030 private clinics throughout Japan, inquiring physicians' situations around psychiatric disorders. Seven hundred and fourteen questionnaires were used for analysis (17.7%). Among these 714 respondents, 364 (51.0%) reported that they have willingness to participate in early intervention. Similarly, 494 (69.2%) were interested in psychiatric disorders, whereas only 168 (23.5%) were confident in identifying schizophrenia. The interest in psychiatric disorders was most strongly associated with their willingness to participate (Odds ratio = 3.54 by logistic regression analysis). These results, therefore, suggest that the interest in psychiatric disorders motivates them to participate in early intervention for psychosis; this has considerable implications for future approach to build up early intervention system in Japan."}, {"Title": "Substance use disorders in forensic psychiatry: differences among different types of offenders.", "Abstract": "This is the first study that compared different types of offenders in forensic outpatient treatment (i.e., offenders of general violence [GV], intimate partner violence [IPV], sex crimes, and \"other offenses\" such as drug smuggling and property crimes) regarding the prevalence of substance use disorders at the time of the offense. In total, 35.8% of participants (n = 187) were diagnosed with any substance use disorder. Specifically, 61.5% of GV perpetrators, 30.9% of IPV perpetrators, 9.1% of sex offenders, and 26.7% of \"other offenders\" were diagnosed with substance abuse or dependence. More GV offenders and less sex offenders fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder. Furthermore, 29.9% of the offenders were intoxicated by substances at the moment they committed the offense (48.5% of GV perpetrators, 25.0% of IPV perpetrators, 17.4% of sex offenders, and 21.0% of other offenders). More GV perpetrators were intoxicated during the offense.

Contrary to clinicians who seek to treat addicted people to become and remain abstinent, researchers seek to make drug-na\u00efve animals addicted to a drug with known addictive properties in humans. The goals of this research are to better understand the neuroscience of drug addiction and, ultimately, to translate this knowledge into effective treatments for people with addiction. The present review will not cover the vast literature that has accumulated over the past 50 years on animal models of drug addiction. It is instead more modestly devoted to recent research spanning the past decade on drug self-administration-based models of addiction in the rat (the animal species most frequently used in the field), with a special focus on current efforts to model compulsive cocaine use as opposed to nonaddictive use. Surprisingly, it turns out that modeling compulsive cocaine use in rats is possible but more difficult than previously thought. In fact, it appears that resilience to cocaine addiction is the norm in rats. As in human cocaine users, only few individual rats would be vulnerable. This conclusion has several important implications for future research on the neuroscience of cocaine addiction and on preclinical medication development."}, {"Title": "\"Resources for each other.\" The society of German neurologists and psychiatrists and the Nazi \"health leadership\".", "Abstract": "The history of the German Association for Psychiatry and--after its merger with the Society of German Neurologists in 1935--the Society of German Neurologists and Psychiatrists (Gesellschaft deutscher Neurologen und Psychiater, GDNP) during the period of National Socialism has been subjected to only rudimentary research. The conventionally accepted idea that two independent professional associations were \"coordinated\" from above and turned into the extended arm of Nazi genetic health policy (Erbgesundheitspolitik) against their will must be reconsidered.

Each index considers all three genes as complementary components of a liver enzyme drug metabolism system and uniquely benchmarks innate hepatic drug metabolism reserve or alteration through CYP450 combinatory genotype scores.\nA total of 1199 psychiatric referrals were genotyped for polymorphisms in the CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 gene loci and were scored on each of the four indices. The data were used to create distributions and rankings of innate drug metabolism capacity to which individuals can be compared. Drug-specific indices are a combination of the drug metabolism indices with substrate-specific coefficients.\nThe combinatory drug metabolism indices proved useful in positioning individuals relative to a population with regard to innate drug metabolism capacity prior to pharmacotherapy. Drug-specific indices generate pharmacogenetic guidance of immediate clinical relevance, and can be further modified to incorporate covariates in particular clinical cases.\nWe believe that this combinatory approach represents an improvement over the current gene-by-gene reporting by providing greater scope while still allowing for the resolution of a single-gene index when needed. This method will result in novel clinical and research applications, facilitating the translation from pharmacogenomics to personalized medicine, particularly in psychiatry where many drugs are metabolized or activated by multiple CYP450 isoenzymes."}, {"Title": "[Mental health and interdisciplinary work: the experience in \"Candido Ferreira\", in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil].", "Abstract": "This article analyses the process on the psychiatric reform, with a focus on the interdisciplinary work developed by the health professionals from the health service \"Dr. Candido Ferreira\"in Campinas, Brazil.

This is a case series of 8 young subjects (age range of 6-16 years, 11.12 \u00b1 3.52 years) who were referred or consulted to child psychiatry department. They were referred or consulted by pediatric gastroenterology or surgery departments for the presence of non-remitting and medically unexplained vomiting. They were investigated for co-morbid psychiatric disorders using a structured psychiatric interview. An open trial of mirtazapine was conducted for the treatment and/or prevention of vomiting. Primary outcome measure was Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Subjects were diagnosed with chronic (n = 5) or cyclic (n = 3) vomiting syndromes. Duration of vomiting ranged from 6 months to 10 years (3.5 \u00b1 3.2 years). All subjects received multiple psychiatric diagnoses with anxiety disorders being the most frequent. Maximum mirtazapine dosage was 7.5-30 mg/day (16.00 \u00b1 6.16 mg/day). Three subjects showed complete remission and 5 subjects showed much to very much improvement in vomiting. Most frequent side effects were increased appetite, weight gain and sedation. Young subjects with chronic or cyclic vomiting may frequently suffer anxiety and/or depressive symptoms or disorders. Mirtazapine could be an effective treatment option for the treatment of vomiting and co-morbid anxiety or depressive disorders in these subjects.

As the orbitofrontal cortex appears to be simultaneously implicated in odour processing and executive impairments, it has been proposed that olfaction could constitute a cognitive marker of psychiatric states. While this assumption appears promising, very few studies have been conducted on this topic among psychopathological populations. The present study thus aimed at exploring the links between olfaction and executive functions. These links were evaluated using two tasks of comparable difficulty, one known to rely on orbitofrontal cortex processing (i.e., a confabulation task), and one not associated with this area (i.e., Stop-Signal task).\nTwenty recently detoxified alcoholic individuals and twenty paired controls took part in an experiment evaluating olfactory abilities and executive functioning (i.e., Stop-Signal task and confabulation task). Comorbidities and potential biasing variables were also controlled for. Alcoholic individuals exhibited impaired performance for high-level olfactory processing and significant confabulation problems as compared to controls (but no deficit in Stop-Signal task), even when the influence of comorbidities was taken into account. Most importantly, olfactory abilities and confabulation rates were significantly correlated in both groups.\nAlcoholism jointly leads to olfactory and memory source impairments, and these two categories of deficits are associated. These results strongly support the proposition that olfactory and confabulation measures both index orbitofrontal functioning, and suggest that olfaction could become a reliable cognitive marker in psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it underlines the need to take into account these olfactory and source memory impairments in a clinical context."}, {"Title": "Partnerships between pediatric palliative care and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Children with life-threatening illnesses and their families may face physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges throughout the children's course of illness.

Factor analytic studies of acute mania are fewer compared to schizophrenia and depression. Evidence from factor analysis suggests more categories or subtypes than what is included in the classification systems. Studies have found that these factors can predict differences in treatment response and prognosis.\nThe sample included 131 patients consecutively admitted to an acute psychiatry unit over a period of one year. It included 76 (58%) males. The mean age was 44.05 years (SD = 15.6). Patients met International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) clinical diagnostic criteria for a manic episode. Patients with a diagnosis of mixed bipolar affective disorder were excluded. Participants were evaluated using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Exploratory factor analysis (principal component analysis) was carried out and factors with an eigenvalue > 1 were retained. The significance level for interpretation of factor loadings was 0.40. The unrotated component matrix identified five factors. Oblique rotation was then carried out to identify three factors which were clinically meaningful.\nUnrotated principal component analysis extracted five factors. These five factors explained 65.36% of the total variance. Oblique rotation extracted 3 factors. Factor 1 corresponding to 'irritable mania' had significant loadings of irritability, increased motor activity/energy and disruptive aggressive behaviour. Factor 2 corresponding to 'elated mania' had significant loadings of elevated mood, language abnormalities/thought disorder, increased sexual interest and poor insight. Factor 3 corresponding to 'psychotic mania' had significant loadings of abnormalities in thought content, appearance, poor sleep and speech abnormalities.\nOur findings identified three clinically meaningful factors corresponding to 'elated mania', 'irritable mania' and 'psychotic mania'.

Because of varied definitions of medication refusal, diverse methodologies and few rigorous studies, it has not been possible to draw firm conclusions on the average rate of refusal of psychotropic medications in acute psychiatry. However, it is clear that medication refusal is common and leads to poor outcomes characterized by higher rates of seclusion, restraint, threats of, and actual, assaults and longer hospitalizations. There are no statistically significant differences between refusers and acceptors in gender, marital status and preadmission living arrangements. Although no firm conclusions on the influence of ethnicity, status at admission and diagnosis on refusal, the refusers are more likely to have higher number of previous hospitalizations and history of prior refusal. The review indicates that staff factors such as the use of temporary staff, lack of confidence in ward staff and ineffective ward structure are associated with higher rates of medication refusal. Comprehensive knowledge of why, and how, patients refuse medication is lacking.

Biomarkers are objectively measured characteristics which serve as indicators of the causes of illnesses, their clinical course, and modification by treatment. There exist a variety of markers: laboratory markers which comprise the determination of genetic and epigenetic markers, neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, neuropeptides, enzymes, and others as single measures; electrophysiological markers which usually comprise electroencephalography (EEG) measures, and in particular sleep EEG and evoked potentials, magnetic encephalography, electrocardiogram, facial electromyography, skin conductance, and others; brain imaging techniques such as cranial computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, functional MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, and single photon emission computed tomography; and behavioral approaches such as cue exposure and challenge tests which can be used to induce especially emotional processes in anxiety and depression. Examples for each of these domains are provided in this review.

She had been hospitalized four times in the previous three months. She was admitted on more than 10 medications and received more than 20 different medications in this time period. It was determined that she had delirium concurrent with dementia and/or depression. During her hospital stay a urinary tract infection (UTI) was treated, her anticholinergic medications were minimized, and her digoxin dose was adjusted. As her mental status cleared, a workup was completed to differentiate between dementia and depression. She was initially treated with memantine, but as time progressed it became more evident she was experiencing depression and a \"pseudodementia,\" which was treated with sertraline. Her Mini-Mental State Examination returned to 29/30 (her score previously was 26/29). This case demonstrates the complexity of treating an elder individual and the importance of differentiating among delirium, depression, and dementia.

While grooming is traditionally assessed by the latency, frequency and duration, its sequencing represents another important domain sensitive to various experimental manipulations. Such behavioral complexity requires novel objective approaches to quantify rodent grooming, in addition to time-consuming and highly variable manual observation. The present study combined modern behavior-recognition video-tracking technologies (CleverSys, Inc.) with manual observation to characterize in-depth spontaneous (novelty-induced) and artificial (water-induced) self-grooming in adult male C57BL/6J mice. We specifically focused on individual episodes of grooming (paw licking, head washing, body/leg washing, and tail/genital grooming), their duration and transitions between episodes. Overall, the frequency, duration and transitions detected using the automated approach significantly correlated with manual observations (R=0.51-0.7, p<0.001-0.05). This data validates the software-based detection of grooming, also indicating that behavior-recognition tools can be applied to characterize both the amount and sequential organization (patterning) of rodent grooming. Together with further refinement and methodological advancement, this approach will foster high-throughput neurophenotyping of grooming, with multiple applications in drug screening and testing of genetically modified animals."}, {"Title": "Current therapeutic options in pediatric multiple sclerosis.", "Abstract": "Therapies for relapsing-remitting pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) are aimed at preventing relapses (disease modifying therapies), treating acute attacks, and managing disabling cognitive and physical symptoms. Initial disease modifying therapy to prevent relapses should use one of four first-line injectable therapies that are approved for adult relapsing-remitting MS: interferon beta 1a IM, interferon beta 1a SC, interferon beta 1b SC, or glatiramer acetate. If breakthrough disease occurs or the medication is poorly tolerated, the next step should be to try one of the other first-line therapies. If the first-line therapies have been exhausted, second-line therapies such as natalizumab, cyclophosphamide, or mitoxantrone may be considered. One must use caution when choosing these potent therapies, as secondary effects may include serious infection or malignancy. Phase III studies in adult MS have been published on two oral agents, fingolimod and cladribine, and fingolimod has received FDA approval for use in relapsing-remitting MS in adults. These drugs have not been evaluated in the pediatric MS population, nor have any of three other oral agents now in phase III development: laquinimod, BG-12, and teriflunomide. Acute relapses can be treated with pulse methylprednisolone at a dosage of 20 to 30\u00a0mg/kg per day (maximum 1\u00a0g per day) for 3 to 5\u00a0days. If this is ineffective, intravenous immunoglobulin (2\u00a0g/kg divided over 2-5\u00a0days) or plasmapheresis may be considered. Neuropsychological, physical therapy, and occupational therapy screening should be performed on patients with pediatric MS. Interventions focusing on visual motor integration may be particularly useful in this group Spasticity may be treated with symptomatic therapies, but one must be aware of potential adverse effects of agents such as baclofen and diazepam.

All health care providers share the disposition to intervene in the course of disease. Specific notions about the course of severe mental illness are woven into the mission of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) as well as the treatment plan, a key paperwork tool used to stage daily activities. The treatment plan demands a narrative of progress that ACT workers often find impossible to supply. The gap between the ideal of progress and the realities of practice produce distinctive kinds of demoralization.

Yet the interactions involved in trying to achieve shared decision-making are relatively unexplored in psychiatry. This study analyses audiotapes of 92 outpatient consultations involving nine consultant psychiatrists focusing on how pressure is applied in shared decisions about antipsychotic medication. Detailed conversation analysis reveals that some shared decisions are considerably more pressured than others. At one end of a spectrum of pressure are pressured shared decisions, characterised by an escalating cycle of pressure and resistance from which it is difficult to exit without someone losing face. In the middle are directed decisions, where the patient cooperates with being diplomatically steered by the psychiatrist. At the other extreme are open decisions where the patient is allowed to decide, with the psychiatrist exerting little or no pressure. Directed and open decisions occurred most frequently; pressured decisions were rarer.

A new set of approaches is therefore required.\nAmending the British practice of \"physical restraint\" for German conditions, a technique of holding the patient was developed accompanied by manualised interventions of verbal de-escalation. In contrast to mechanical restraint, the technique represents a therapeutic intervention and is usually of short duration.

CDH of long duration includes CM, chronic tension-type headache, new daily persistent headache, and hemicrania continua. CM affects approximately 2% of the adult population in Western countries, imposing substantial burdens on individual sufferers and their families and, more broadly, upon society. Although this disorder is highly disabling and prevalent, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Diagnosing CM requires a systematic approach that includes these steps: (1) exclude a secondary headache disorder, and (2) diagnose a specific primary headache syndrome based on frequency and duration, for example, short-duration episodic, long-duration episodic, or long-duration chronic. CM usually develops as a complication of episodic migraine after a period of increasing headache frequency. This migraine transformation is associated with a number of risk factors, some of which cannot be modified, including age and race. Other risk factors for CM are modifiable, such as obesity, snoring, head injury, stressful life events, and overuse of opioids and barbiturates. However, risk factor modification has not yet been shown to decrease the likelihood of CM onset. According to a cross-sectional analysis of data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study published this year in Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, when compared to patients with episodic migraine, patients with CM were significantly less likely to be employed full-time and almost twice as likely to be occupationally disabled. In addition, patients with CM were nearly twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, or depression. Furthermore, patients with CM had higher cardiovascular and respiratory risk, were 40% more likely to have heart disease and angina, and were 70% more likely to have a history of stroke. These findings highlight the paramount importance of clinical vigilance, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate, effective management - including treatment or referrals - to improve patient outcomes."}, {"Title": "Assessing depression and factors possibly associated with depression during the course of Parkinson's disease.", "Abstract": "Although research suggests depression is common among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), it is unclear how to best assess depression in PD (dPD).

We also examined potential predictors of the presence of dPD.\nThe prevalence of depression among study participants ranged from 11% to 57%, depending on which of the 4 definitions of depression was applied. Younger age and longer duration of PD predicted a relatively higher prevalence of depression.

Twenty-eight women, referred to C-L Psychiatry during their obstetrical inpatient stay were interviewed six months post-discharge to determine how they experienced the consultation process, whether they recollected and adhered to treatment recommendations, and whether they developed or had a recurrence of mental health problems post-discharge. Method. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted by a psychologist who had not been involved with patient care. Results. There was strong congruence between reason for referral as stated in psychiatric consult notes and participants' recollections and strong congruence and compliance regarding treatment recommendations. Sixty-four percent of women had concerns regarding mood post-discharge, of whom 66% sought professional help within six months. Participants' recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the C-L service to obstetrical inpatients pertained mainly to sensitivity to patients' feelings, consistency of message and personnel, and post-discharge follow-up. Conclusions. Obstetrical patients had good recollection of their experience of C-L psychiatry, and post-discharge compliance with treatment recommendations was high. A post-discharge telephone call might further enhance treatment compliance and encourage women who are struggling with mood difficulties to seek help. Contact between C-L psychiatry and patients' primary care physician may also enhance care post-discharge."}, {"Title": "[Prevention in psychiatry in therapeutic clubs].", "Abstract": "Prevention remains the poor relation of public health.

Previous studies showed that the mean concentration of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in blood increases during antidepressant treatment and positively correlates with amelioration of MDD symptoms. We previously showed an association between very early changes of the serum BDNF concentration and treatment outcome (Tadi\u0107 et al., 2011. Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 35, 415-420). However, no study has yet investigated whether BDNF concentration in plasma increases in the early course of treatment and enables the prediction of final treatment outcome. The goal of this study was to investigate in MDD patients, whether the change of pBDNF in the early course of treatment is a specific and sensitive marker for final treatment outcome. For this purpose, we performed a naturalistic pilot study with 39 inpatients with MDD according to DSM-IV. Depression severity and pBDNF were measured in weekly intervals from baseline (EP) to endpoint (EP, max. week six) with the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. According to ROC-analysis, the best cut-off value for the prediction of response at EP is an increase of 338 pg/ml or 126%, respectively, of pBDNF between BL and day 7. The single markers pBDNF change and HAMD-21 improvement from BL-d7 predicted later treatment outcome with moderate to high sensitivity and specificity (pBDNF: 42% and 96%, resp.; HAMD improvement: 83% and 65%, resp.). The combined marker early pBDNF change plus HAMD-21 improvement at day 7 increased the specificity for response to 100%. Our data provide first preliminary evidence that an early change of pBDNF in conjunction with early improvement might be a peripheral marker predictive for treatment outcome in patients with MDD. This has to be confirmed in further investigations.

Implications for financing psychiatric services.", "Abstract": "The debate on appropriate financing systems in inpatient psychiatry is ongoing. In this context, it is important to control resource use in terms of length of stay (LOS), which is the most costly factor in inpatient care and the one that can be influenced most easily. Previous studies have shown that psychiatric diagnoses provide only limited justification for explaining variation in LOS, and it has been suggested that measures such as psychopathology might be more appropriate to predict resource use. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between LOS and psychopathological syndromes or symptoms at admission as well as other characteristics such as sociodemographic and clinical variables.\nWe considered routine medical data of patients admitted to the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich in the years 2008 and 2009. Complete data on psychopathology at hospital admission were available in 3,220 inpatient episodes. A subsample of 2,939 inpatient episodes was considered in final statistical models, including psychopathology as well as complete datasets of further measures (e.g. sociodemographic, clinical, treatment-related and psychosocial variables). We used multivariate linear as well as logistic regression analysis with forward selection procedure to determine the predictors of LOS.\nAll but two syndrome scores (mania, hostility) were positively related to the length of stay. Final statistical models showed that syndromes or symptoms explained about 5% of the variation in length of stay. The inclusion of syndromes or symptoms as well as basic treatment variables and other factors led to an explained variation of up to 25%.\nPsychopathological syndromes and symptoms at admission and further characteristics only explained a small proportion of the length of inpatient stay.

METHODS The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. The eligible patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups: sarsasapogenin group (sarsasapogenin plus risperidone for 8 weeks, n = 41) and placebo group (risperidone only for 8 weeks, n = 39).

Incomplete clerking may put patient safety at risk.\nWe sought to assess the completeness of clerking to general adult psychiatry wards and to evaluate whether the introduction of an admission booklet would improve clerking.\nWe analysed the completeness of clerking to general adult psychiatric wards by trainee doctors. Using an audit approach, the first phase assessed completeness of clerking when trainee doctors used continuation sheets to document the clerking in a free-hand manner. Thereafter, we developed a standardised admission booklet to document the clerking and assessed completeness of clerking in the second phase.\nThe admission booklet significantly improved the completeness of clerking. Notable improvements were seen in multiple components of history taking and initial management, particularly in documenting risk to self and others.\nImproving clerking by use of an admission booklet can lead to more informed management decisions particularly in regard to the patients' physical health and clinical risk management. This may consequently improve patient safety and help trainees communicate important aspects of the case to seniors and the wider multi-disciplinary team."}, {"Title": "[Neurosciences and the ravings of the Soviet era. Spanish Republican physicians, a set of privileged witnesses].", "Abstract": "This study analyses the links between the Russian and Soviet neurosciences and their Spanish counterpart, especially with regard to the experiences of the Spanish Republican physicians exiled in the USSR. The Russian neurosciences, which date back to the second half of the 19th century, followed a path that ran parallel to the discipline throughout the rest of Europe and finally displayed signs of being influenced by the German and French schools. Important figures include Alexei Kojevnikov and Vladimir Bekhterev in neurology, Sergei Korsakov in psychiatry, Ivan Pavlov and his disciple Piotr Anojin in neurophysiology, Lev Vygotsky and Alexander Luria in neuropsychology, and Nikolai Burdenko in neurosurgery. When the Bolsheviks came to power, they brought with them a progressive conception of health care, which was modified during the Stalinist era to serve political interests, above all in the case of psychiatry. During the first third of the 20th century, Spanish scientists became interested in Pavlov's reflexology and the Soviets took a similar interest in Spanish histology. Among the 4500 Spanish Republicans who emigrated to the USSR because of the Spanish Civil War, there were several dozen physicians who were privileged witnesses of the madness that shook the science and the health care of that period. Relevant names worth citing here from the field of the neurosciences include Juan Planelles and Ramon Alvarez-Buylla in neurophysiology, Federico Pascual and Florencio Villa Landa in psychiatry, Angel Escobio and Maria Perez in neurology, Julian Fuster in neurosurgery and Manuel Arce in neuroimaging."}, {"Title": "[The use of noninvasive brain stimulation in childhood psychiatric disorders: new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities and challenges].", "Abstract": "Novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches based on noninvasive brain stimulation offer some promise in the field of childhood psychiatric disorders. There are two primary methods of noninvasive brain stimulation currently available: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Both noninvasive neuromodulation techniques appear to rely on modulating brain plasticity and thus open new hopes in the treatment of brain circuit and plasticity disorders. Since many childhood psychiatric disorders involve disturbances in the timing or mechanisms of plasticity within frontostriatal circuits, and the developing brain shows a greater capacity of brain plasticity, noninvasive brain stimulation might induce greater benefits in this population than in adults. Although the utilization of TMS and tDCS remains limited in children, there is enough evidence for their rational, safe use in this population. In this paper, we review the principles of noninvasive brain stimulation and the diagnostic and therapeutic applications in child-hood psychiatric disorders in order to inform its development into safe and reliable diagnostic and effective therapeutic approaches in pediatric psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Anton's syndrome and eugenics.", "Abstract": "Anton's syndrome is arguably the most striking form of anosognosia.

Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of PM training experiences and career interest in PM on the perception of PM, controlling for number of months already completed in PM, training level, and residency program.\nThe response rate was 35%, n = 199. 68% of respondents identified PM as a definite subspecialty, with the majority of respondents believing that PM was as important a subspecialty as child (53%), forensic (67%) and geriatric psychiatry (75%). Eighty percent of the respondents believed a PM specialist should complete more than 3 months of additional training to be competent/qualified. There was significant heterogeneity in training experiences across programs, with a differential effect of certain training components-seminar, journal club-associated with a more favorable perception of PM as a subspecialty.\nThe above results challenge the notion that PM represents only a focused area of general psychiatric practice in Canada. PM appears to require additional training beyond residency for trainees to feel competent and qualified.

Due to the potential of methamphetamine to induce, exacerbate and precipitate psychotic symptoms, this drug has also taken centre stage in several criminal trials considering the sanity of defendants. Highly publicised and often involving contested expert evidence, these criminal trials have illustrated the limits of using psychiatric expertise to answer legal questions. This article considers the implications of such cases in light of material from a qualitative study that aimed to generate insights into the difficulties forensic psychiatrists and their instructing lawyers face when providing expert evidence on the relationship between methamphetamine, psychosis and insanity. It reports material from 31 in-depth interviews with lawyers and forensic psychiatrists and observation of one criminal trial that considered the relationship between methamphetamine and legal insanity. The findings are correlated with the clinical and medico-legal literature on the topic and subjected to scrutiny through the lens of \"sanism\". The article concludes that the continued use of forensic psychiatry to meet the legal objectives of insanity, where methamphetamine is involved, has the potential to reinforce sanist attitudes and practices."}, {"Title": "Imprisonment and diagnostic delay among male offenders with schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Psychotic symptoms are common among prisoners, a diagnosis of schizophrenia probably more likely than in the general population; however, less is known about the extent to which prisoners may show a different course of illness.\nThe aims of the study were to characterise schizophrenic male offenders and to compare their age at diagnosis with that of people with schizophrenia in general mental health services in Finland.\nThe study population comprised all the male offenders in Finland who left the national psychiatric prison hospital between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2006 with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, diagnosis of schizophrenia. The comparison group was drawn from 9992 Finnish people screened at random for psychotic illnesses.\nThere was no overall difference in age of diagnosis between prisoners and their community peers, but three-quarters of the offenders had received their diagnosis of schizophrenia in the prison hospital rather than in the community, and for them, the median age at diagnosis (30) was significantly older than that (27) in the community comparison group.\nOur findings show that men with schizophrenia who have to serve prison sentences are not a homogenous group, but that for a majority, complex presentations are likely to delay diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

It is influenced by interviewer and client's communication skills, personality, socio-cultural beliefs and interpretations. The inference of \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" varies across cultures and understanding of the cultural nuances is an integral part of understanding psychopathology. Knowledge gained in one culture cannot be extrapolated completely to another culture. Indian psyche is distinct as it is has been influenced by various invaders into the country, collectivism and interdependence. Because of all these factors, presentation of mental illness is different in the Indian culture and many a times it is difficult to fit patients into the categories developed by the Western world. Similar factors also influence attitude towards treatment seeking and visit to magico-religious healers and those practicing alternative system of medicine. Moreover, the principles of Western psychotherapy cannot be applied to the Indian subjects. Compared to West, family plays a vital role in all major decision in an individual's life including his treatment and care. They bear the major burden and take up the responsibility of care of the persons with mental illness and dampen the effect of limited resources. These families cope by trusting and passing on the responsibility to almighty.

Moreover, it is frequently claimed that undergraduate nursing students do not always regard MHN favourably for future employment. Although undergraduate nurses are employed as assistants in nursing (AIN) in mental health settings, there is no published research exploring their role, the career trajectory into MHN, or its effectiveness as a recruitment strategy. In this paper, we draw on the literature to delineate factors that might contribute to the desire of AIN to work in MHN. Nine factors were identified: acceptance by nurses, fitting in with the culture, managing the workload, developing a realistic appraisal of the effectiveness and limits of psychiatry, constructive learning from direct interpersonal interactions with clients, practising communication skills, being supported in a structured way, working with positive role models, and the overall quality of the employment setting. A comprehensive understanding of these factors can enhance the experience of undergraduate nursing students working as AIN, and potentially increase recruitment into MHN."}, {"Title": "Assessing quality of life in patients with schizophrenia in an acute psychiatric setting: reliability, validity and feasibility of the EQ-5D and the Q-LES-Q.", "Abstract": "Quality of life (QoL) is considered an important outcome of treatment in psychiatry. Two QoL instruments, the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), have been increasingly used among patients with schizophrenia.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the reliability, validity and feasibility of the EQ-5D and the Q-LES-Q among patients with schizophrenia and related disorders (n = 311) in the most acute stage of their illness.\nThe study was carried out in nine acute psychiatric wards of two psychiatric hospitals in Finland. The instruments' internal consistency, construct validity and missing values were evaluated.\nOur findings show high internal consistency for the Q-LES-Q (Cronbach's alpha 0,89). For the EQ-5D, the Cronbach's alpha value was minimally acceptable (0.63) taking in to consideration the low number of items. Lower overall functioning indicated poorer QoL measured by the EQ-5D (U = 3098, P < 0.001) or the Q-LES-Q (U = 3357, P < 0.001). Missing values in the EQ-5D ranged from 6% to 7% and in the Q-LES-Q from 6% to 31%.\nOur results suggest that both QoL scales are reasonably reliable, valid and feasible in this patient group. The decision regarding which instrument to use would depend on clinical or research questions.

In the 13th century, the first Swedish legal text about the mentally ill and the first hospital to treat them are documented. Control, care and cure of the ill have been shaped by social and cultural changes from time to time, e.g. King Gustav Vasa introduced a paradigm shift of care after the Reformation, when he altered Catholic buildings into state hospitals. He also ordered that medical texts should no longer be written in Latin but in Swedish. The first book dealing with mental illnesses was published in 1578. Laypersons ran the mental hospitals for centuries until the medical perspective and doctors were engaged in the 1800 s. To advance the hospital doctors' competence and skill, a Swedish Psychiatric Association was established in 1905. Severely psychotic patients could not be effectively treated until the introduction of chlorpromazine in the 1950s and there is still no cure available. Following the deinstitutionalization, from more than 35,000 beds 50 years ago down to about 4500 today, the request for outpatient treatment increased. Mandatory training in psychotherapies for all psychiatrists started in the 1970s. A major \"psychiatry reform\", with the hope of improving the situation for the mentally ill, and to reduce the stigma, was introduced in Sweden in 1995. The historic long-term effect of the reform cannot yet be fully evaluated."}, {"Title": "Finnish psychiatry--past and present.", "Abstract": "The history of Finnish psychiatry has been characterized by polarizations: priority in hospitals vs. outpatient care, centralized vs. decentralized organization, independent vs. integrated administration, biological vs. psychological treatments, private vs. public production, special psychiatric policies vs. general health policies. The independent psychiatric organizations on District level lasted from the 1920s until 1990. Since then, the formerly independent psychiatry was subordinated to General Hospital administration and the centralized system of state planning and financing of healthcare was gradually decentralized and run down. During the heavy Finnish economic recession of the early 1990 s, the cuts of the public sector were unfortunately focused most heavily on psychiatric services. The main focus of research and teaching has shifted from earlier emphasis on psychoanalytical approach to biological psychiatry since the late 1980s. The administrative position of psychiatry has been repeatedly changing and unstable during the last 20 years. At the level of the contents of the services, however, there have been many very positive and promising developments. Psychiatry has come closer to other specialties from its formerly isolated position, when the separate administrations have been integrated.

Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid with pleiotropic actions in rodents that include the enhancement of learning and memory, neuritic outgrowth, and myelination. Further, pregnenolone administration results in elevations in downstream neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, a molecule with neuroprotective effects that also increases neurogenesis, decreases apoptosis and inflammation, modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and markedly increases GABA(A) receptor responses. In addition, pregnenolone administration elevates pregnenolone sulfate, a neurosteroid that positively modulates NMDA receptors. There are thus multiple mechanistic possibilities for pregnenolone as a potential therapeutic agent in schizophrenia, including the amelioration of NMDA receptor hypofunction (via metabolism to pregnenolone sulfate) and the mitigation of GABA dysregulation (via metabolism to allopregnanolone). Additional evidence consistent with a therapeutic role for pregnenolone in schizophrenia includes neurosteroid changes following administration of certain antipsychotics in rodent models. For example, clozapine elevates pregnenolone levels in rat hippocampus, and these increases may potentially contribute to its superior antipsychotic efficacy [Marx et al. (2006a) Pharmacol Biochem Behav 84:598-608]. Further, pregnenolone levels appear to be altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia compared to control subjects [Marx et al. (2006c) Neuropsychopharmacology 31:1249-1263], suggesting that neurosteroid changes may play a role in the neurobiology of this disorder and/or its treatment. Although clinical trial data utilizing pregnenolone as a therapeutic agent in schizophrenia are currently limited, initial findings are encouraging. Treatment with adjunctive pregnenolone significantly decreased negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a pilot proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial, and elevations in pregnenolone and allopregnanolone post-treatment with this intervention were correlated with cognitive improvements [Marx et al. (2009) Neuropsychopharmacology 34:1885-1903]. Another pilot randomized controlled trial recently presented at a scientific meeting demonstrated significant improvements in negative symptoms, verbal memory, and attention following treatment with adjunctive pregnenolone, in addition to enduring effects in a small subset of patients receiving pregnenolone longer-term [Savitz (2010) Society of Biological Psychiatry Annual Meeting New Orleans, LA]. A third pilot clinical trial reported significantly decreased positive symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects following adjunctive pregnenolone, in addition to increased attention and working memory performance [Ritsner et al. (2010) J Clin Psychiatry 71:1351-1362].

Time out is rated by nurses and patients as more acceptable. Several countries have initiated exercises to reduce the use of seclusion, but England has not.\nIn this study, data were collected on the sequence of conflict (aggression, rule breaking, absconding etc.) and containment (coerced medication, restraint, special observation etc., including time out and seclusion) for the first 2 weeks of 522 acute admissions on 84 wards in 31 English hospitals between June 2009 and March 2010. Data were analysed to describe what preceded and followed time out and seclusion episodes in a nursing shift.\nSeclusion was used with 7\u00b75% of patients, and time out with 15\u00b75%. Both containment methods were used with similar patients in similar circumstances, and both brought disturbed behaviour to a close in half of the cases. Some seclusion appeared to follow less serious disturbed behaviour. There was an important variation in rates of seclusion between hospitals. Seclusion and time out had equally good outcomes in the management of physical violence to others.\nThere is good evidence that seclusion rates can be reduced safely, and time out can sometimes be used as a substitute. A national registration and reporting system should be introduced in England, and serious efforts made to reduce seclusion use in hospitals where rates are high."}, {"Title": "[Psychiatric diagnosis by telephone?].", "Abstract": "The fact that more and more interviews are being conducted on the phone suggests that phone interviews are just as valid as face-to-face interviews.\nTo discuss the literature on the assessment of psychiatric patients with depressive disorder when there is no personal contact between psychiatrists and patient.\nWe searched the literature using PubMed and the snowball method so that we could make comparisons between face-to-face interviews and phone interviews.

Some medical specialties are highly gender segregated. Therefore, it is interesting to know whether medical students have early specialization preferences based on their gender. Consequently, we like to know importance stipulated to motivational factors.\nOur study investigates new medical students' early specialization preferences and motivational factors.\nNew students at a Dutch medical school (n = 657) filled in a questionnaire about specialty preferences (response rate = 94%; 69.5% female, 30.5% male). The students chose out of internal medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, surgery, gynecology and family medicine, \"other\" or \"I don't know.\" Finally, they valued ten motivational factors.\nForty percent of the medical students reported no specialty preference yet. Taken together, female medical students preferred pediatrics and wished to combine work and care, whereas male students opted for surgery and valued career opportunities.\nGender-driven professional preferences in new medical students should be noticed in order to use competencies.

The clinic draws explicitly from the work of Fanon and French ethnopsychologist Tobie Nathan. This genealogy provides a basis for reflection on the ways in which current ethnopsychiatry re-articulates older questions about difference and healing, culture and suffering, and the political dimensions of psychiatry.

Collaborative care is one promising model for improving geriatric mental health care delivery in primary care. Diffusion of collaborative care into the health care system and integrating geriatric psychiatry into other models such as geriatric medical homes will require redesign of the organization and financing of primary care and psychiatry to overcome current barriers.

A blind evaluation has been performed on records of 100 suicides with a primary severe depression and 100 matched controls, admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Lund, Sweden. Ego-dystonic suicidal ideation was more commonly reported during adequate treatment as compared to ego-syntonic ideation (P = .004). Men who committed suicide during adequate antidepressant therapy more often reported ego-dystonic suicidal ideation earlier in their lives compared with those who were not treated (P = .0377). This may indicate that treatment failure for ego-dystonic ideation was a precursor of their suicides. Consequently, ego-dystonic ideation seems to show a poorer response to antidepressant therapy as compared to ego-syntonic ideation, which may be more directly related to depression. Ego-dystonic ideation is proposed to be related to depressive psychosis."}, {"Title": "[Decommissioning of the medical cyclotron in National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In Japan, positron emission tomography has prevailed as a useful procedure for detecting malignancy, myocardial viability, and epileptic foci.

This report describes the series of steps involved in the decommissioning of a compact medical cyclotron that had been used to produce radioactively tagged substances over a period of fifteen years at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry in Japan. Additionally, this report describes the manner in which the radioactive waste was disposed.\nThe plan to decommission the cyclotron was comprised of three phases: a preliminary survey, the dismantling work, and a reports after the dismantling. We complied with the guidelines for the disposal of radioactive waste published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.\nThe most radioactive material was the vacuuming foil used in the window of the target chamber, with a dose rate of 17 microSv/h (gamma rays) and 20 x 10(3) cpm (beta rays). The detected radionuclides were mainly 22Na, 57Co, 60Co and 65Zn. The total numbers of radioactive waste containers were thirteen 200 l containers and one 50 l container. We suspect that the long shutdown period of the cyclotron (more than one year) contributed to the decay of the radioactive waste because the amount of containers was smaller than the initial estimation.\nThe shutdown period of a cyclotron may play a significant role in reducing the amount of radioactive waste."}, {"Title": "Ego disturbances in the sense of Kurt Schneider: historical and phenomenological aspects.", "Abstract": "The phenomena which were grouped together by Kurt Schneider to constitute the ego disturbances have always been of particular diagnostic relevance for schizophrenia. The manner in which these symptoms are described and distinguished from other psychopathological symptoms has generally been rather imprecise. The introduction of phenomenological methods into the field of psychiatry led to considerable improvements in symptom descriptions and to a clearer distinction between psychotic and nonpsychotic experience. Continued developments in phenomenology have further incorporated aspects of schizophrenic symptom development and in doing so have brought so-called transitional phenomena and the core schizophrenic syndrome into focus. The ego disturbances accordingly appear to stem from a particular form of depersonalization which is described as a modified sense of mineness and which can be distinguished from the neurotic experience of depersonalization."}, {"Title": "Homeopathic treatments in psychiatry: a systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled studies.", "Abstract": "To systematically review placebo-controlled randomized trials of homeopathy for psychiatric conditions.\nEligible studies were identified using the following databases from database inception to April 2010: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Hom-Inform, Cochrane CENTRAL, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine grantee publications database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

With the identification of genetic susceptibility factors for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, great efforts have been made to generate genetic animal models for major mental illnesses. As these disorders are multifactorial, comparisons among drug-induced (non-genetic) and genetic models are becoming an important issue in biological psychiatry. A major barrier is that the standard mouse strain used in the generation of genetic models is C57BL/6, whereas almost all studies with PCP-induced models have utilized other strains. To fill this technical gap, we systematically compared the behavioural changes upon PCP administration in different mouse strains, including C57BL/6N, C57BL/6J, ddY, and ICR. We observed strain differences in PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and enhanced immobility in the forced swim test (ddY>>C57BL/6N and 6J>ICR). In contrast, there was no strain difference in the impairment of recognition memory in the novel object recognition memory test after withdrawal of chronic PCP administration. This study provides practical guidance for comparing genetic with PCP-induced models of psychosis in C57BL/6. Furthermore, such strain differences may provide a clue to the biological mechanisms underlying PCP-induced endophenotypes possibly relevant to major mental illnesses."}, {"Title": "Confirmation bias: why psychiatrists stick to wrong preliminary diagnoses.", "Abstract": "Diagnostic errors can have tremendous consequences because they can result in a fatal chain of wrong decisions. Experts assume that physicians' desire to confirm a preliminary diagnosis while failing to seek contradictory evidence is an important reason for wrong diagnoses. This tendency is called 'confirmation bias'.\nTo study whether psychiatrists and medical students are prone to confirmation bias and whether confirmation bias leads to poor diagnostic accuracy in psychiatry, we presented an experimental decision task to 75 psychiatrists and 75 medical students.\nA total of 13% of psychiatrists and 25% of students showed confirmation bias when searching for new information after having made a preliminary diagnosis. Participants conducting a confirmatory information search were significantly less likely to make the correct diagnosis compared to participants searching in a disconfirmatory or balanced way [multiple logistic regression: odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.53-21.22, p<0.001; OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.23-8.56, p=0.02].

Circumstantial evidence indicates that determining the Omega-3 Index has a therapeutic consequence. Thus, the Omega-3 Index fulfils important criteria for novel biomarkers, set forth by the American Heart Association and others, and compares well to other novel biomarkers.

This can be done by using assessment instruments to routinely measure the nature and severity of psychiatric symptoms. Up until now, in the Netherlands, assessment measures are seldom used in the psychiatric care for this population. The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the use of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a widely used standardised questionnaire in general psychiatry, in a well-defined sample of people with borderline intellectual functioning or mild ID diagnosed with one or more psychiatric disorders.\nA total of 224 psychiatric outpatients with either borderline intellectual functioning or mild ID participated in this study. All participants were new patients of Kristal, Centre for Psychiatry and Intellectual Disability in the Netherlands, in the period between 1 April 2008 and 1 October 2009. All participants were assessed by a multidisciplinary team, including a certified psychiatrist. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria were applied. The mean total intelligence quotient was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). The BSI was administered in an assisted fashion. Utility and psychometric properties of the BSI were investigated. Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's alphas) were computed. Bivariate correlations between the sub-scales were computed to assess differentiation between the scales. Mean sub-scale scores were compared between different DSM-IV-TR subgroups to investigate the discriminant abilities of the scales. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted.\nThe results suggest that the BSI is practically useful. Internal consistencies ranged from 0.70 to 0.96 and thus are considered good to adequate. Sub-scale inter-correlations showed there is a degree of differentiation between the sub-scales. Discriminant validity was shown for the sub-scales depression, anxiety and phobic anxiety. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the underlying structure of the BSI could be described by the same nine-factor model as reported in previous studies.\nAs a result of the psychometric properties illustrated, this study supports the use of the BSI as a screener for psychopathology and a general outcome measure in people with ID."}, {"Title": "Progress in workforce development since 2000: advanced training opportunities in public and community psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A crisis in the behavioral health care workforce has drawn considerable attention from consumers, families, advocates, clinical professionals, and system administrators at local, state, and federal levels in the past decade. Its effects have been felt in the recruitment, retention, and performance of psychiatrists in the public sector, where a focus on biological aspects of illness and efforts to cut costs have made it difficult for public psychiatrists to engage meaningfully in leadership, consultation, prevention, and psychosocial interventions. An array of training opportunities has recently been created to meet the needs of community psychiatrists at various stages of their careers, from psychiatrists just beginning their careers to those who have been working as medical directors for several years. This article describes the development of these initiatives and their impact on public psychiatry in four key areas--training of experienced psychiatrists, ensuring retention of psychiatrists in community programs, providing fellowship training, and creating professional identity and pride. Although these programs constitute only initial steps, opportunities for psychiatrists to obtain advanced training in community psychiatry are much greater now than they were ten years ago.

However, the standard experimental designs used in psychiatric research are not ideal for this purpose. The authors review the limitations of the most commonly employed designs in studies that make developmental or lifespan inferences in psychiatry: cross-sectional, single-cohort longitudinal, and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. Cross-sectional studies completely confound within- and between-subject sources of variation and hence rely on the presence of parallel trajectories and negligible sampling and age cohort differences for making valid developmental inferences. Delineating trajectories of within-individual change over substantial periods of time requires data covering long age spans that often cannot be covered using single-cohort longitudinal designs. Unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs are a commonly used alternative that can cover a longer age span in a shorter interval than necessary for a single-cohort design. However, the impact of cohort and sampling effects is often minimized or ignored in unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. The authors propose that structured multicohort longitudinal designs are a particularly viable and underutilized class of designs in psychiatry that represents a significant improvement over cross-sectional designs and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs for making developmental inferences while being more practical to implement than single-cohort longitudinal designs. As an example of this approach, the authors analyze changes in entorhinal cortex thickness in Alzheimer's disease in relation to APOE-\u03b54 genotype."}, {"Title": "Early patterns of symptom change signal remission with interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed adolescents.", "Abstract": "This study examined whether reductions in depression symptoms at different time points over the course of therapy predict remission for depressed adolescents treated with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-A) or treatment as usual (TAU) delivered in school-based health clinics.\nParticipants were 63 adolescents (ages 12-18) drawn from a randomized controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of IPT-A Mufson et al.

Week 4 was the best time point for classifying adolescents as likely to remit or not likely to remit for both IPT-A and TAU. A 16.2% reduction in HRSD from baseline represented the best combined sensitivity and specificity in predicting week 16 remission status for adolescents treated with IPT-A. A 24.4% reduction in depressive symptoms represented the best combined sensitivity and specificity in predicting remission status for TAU.\nThese findings provide preliminary evidence of one early marker of remission with IPT-A. Replication with larger samples would suggest that depressed adolescents who have not demonstrated at least a 16.2% reduction in their depressive symptoms after 4 weeks of IPT-A may benefit from a change in the treatment plan."}, {"Title": "Cardiac intensive care of the adult with congenital heart disease: basic principles in the management of common problems.", "Abstract": "Although there has been an intense interest in the care of the adult with congenital heart disease (ACHD), these guidelines are usually not focused on the concepts of immediate postoperative care. The 2 most common perioperative complications are heart failure and atrial dysrhythmias. The broad etiological categories for ACHD and heart failure include primary pump failure (systolic dysfunction) and hypertrophy (diastolic dysfunction) of the right, left, or single ventricle. Some conditions with a pressure-loaded systemic right ventricle as well as patients with a functionally single ventricle may be particularly prone to develop heart failure; in others, right heart failure may occur in patients with Ebstein anomaly or with tetralogy of Fallot after corrective repair but with varying degrees of pulmonary insufficiency, and left heart failure can be a result of mitral or aortic insufficiency. The management of postoperative atrial tachycardia in the ACHD patient actually begins prior to surgery. Assessment of arrhythmia history, complete determination of risk, inducibility and arrhythmia substrate, preoperative planning of pacing sites, and optimal pacing strategies all assist to bring about optimal postoperative outcomes. Ideal perioperative care of the ACHD involves a multidisciplinary team of pediatric and adult cardiologists, pediatric and adult intensivists, cardiac surgeons, and nursing staff along with a myriad of adult subspecialists such as pulmonology, nephrology, endocrinology, and others including psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in the diagnosis of ADHD: where we are and where we are going.", "Abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent childhood psychiatric disorder.

There are serious concerns about the widespread misdiagnosis of ADHD that, together with the fast growing use of neuroimaging techniques in ADHD research, have prompted an inquiry into the feasibility of an imaging test for the diagnosis of ADHD that could aid in clinical practice.\nThis article consists of a brief review of the main neuroimaging research findings in ADHD and its contributions to the current understanding of the ADHD neurobiology, highlighting aspects that could eventually be utilized as a basis for diagnostic tests. The paper then outlines and applies a multiphase approach for developing diagnostic imaging tests in psychiatry to evaluate their prospects for the diagnosis of ADHD as well as evaluating a recently proposed diagnostic imaging test.\nIt appears obvious that a diagnostic imaging test for ADHD should be based on the state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques now available from ADHD neurobiology research. However, the deriviation of an imaging diagnostic tool from neuroimaging research is not as straightforward as it may seem, with several prerequisites that must be met in advance.

In this article, we will review all the information that has led to those recommendations and which includes: indications and contraindications for switching antipsychotics, pharmacological issues, switching strategies, switching antipsychotics due to efficacy problems, switching antispychotics due to tolerability issues (including extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic disorders, hyperprolactinemia, sexual dysfunction, persistent sedation, and QT prolongation), switching antypsychotics due to lack of treatment compliance, and switching antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorders."}, {"Title": "Inhalant abuse: An exploratory study.", "Abstract": "Inhalants are being abused by large numbers of people throughout the world, particularly children and adolescents. It is also an often overlooked form of ubstance abuse in adolescents.\nThe current study explored the inhalant abuse among adolescents seeking treatment from a tertiary care drug de-addiction clinic.\nThe study was conducted at a tertiary level multispecialty hospital.\nThe current study was a chart review of the cases with inhalant abuse/dependence presenting to the clinic over a 1-year period. All the treatment records of the de-addiction clinic were reviewed, and information was gathered regarding patients with inhalant abuse/dependence.\nDescriptive statistics with frequency distribution was carried out by using SPSS version 10.0.\nThe mean age of the subjects was 16.24 years (SD\u00b11.9 years; range 12-18 years). Twenty-two percent of the subjects were illiterate. Forty percent of the adolescents had a family history of alcohol use problems and 48% that of tobacco use. The mean age of the initiation of inhalant use was 11.6 years (SD\u00b12.17 years). It varied from 9 to 18 years.

The article provides demographic data, as well as further information on the types and amounts of services children/adolescents received during the process of seeking help related to different diagnoses.\nThe study was conducted in CAPC-UHC in Tirana, during September 2006-September 2007. Data were collected from 162 children and their parents using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and Pathways Encounter Form. The sample consisted of 53.1% (86) males and 46.9% (76) females. The mean age was 9.5+4.4 years.\nOut of the total number of cases that sought care to CAPC; 55, 6% were referred by parents themselves, while the rest were referred by others. There was a significant effect of gender to intervals from the onset of problem to the first career (F=10.803, p=0.001), as well as a significant effect of gender to total time intervals from the onset till the specialist of child mental health problem (F=6.742, p=0.01).\nThis is the first study investigating the help seeking process to psychiatric care in CAPC Tirana-Albania and may serve as a good start in generating evidence based on child/adolescent mental health service. Further multicentre studies will enhance the values of the findings, since the present study was performed in a single service, and in a setting lacking previous works with similar scope that could have served as references."}, {"Title": "Bioinformatic analyses to select phenotype affecting polymorphisms in HTR2C gene.", "Abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in serotonin related genes influence mental disorders, responses to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. In planning association studies, researchers that want to investigate new SNPs have to select some among a large number of candidates. Our aim is to guide researchers in the selection of the most likely phenotype affecting polymorphisms. Here, we studied serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) SNPs because, till now, only relatively few of about 2000 are investigated.\nWe used the most updated and assessed bioinformatic tools to predict which variations can give rise to biological effects among 2450 HTR2C SNPs.\nWe suggest 48 SNPs that are worth considering in future association studies in the field of psychiatry, psychology and pharmacogenomics. Moreover, our analyses point out the biological level probably affected, such as transcription, splicing, miRNA regulation and protein structure, thus allowing to suggest future molecular investigations.\nAlthough few association studies are available in literature, their results are in agreement with our predictions, showing that our selection methods can help to guide future association studies."}, {"Title": "Benzodiazepines revisited--will we ever learn?", "Abstract": "To re-examine various aspects of the benzodiazepines (BZDs), widely prescribed for 50 years, mainly to treat anxiety and insomnia.

As 60,000 references were found, this review is not exhaustive. It concentrates on the adverse effects, dependence and abuse.\nAlmost from their introduction the BZDs have been controversial, with polarized opinions, advocates pointing out their efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptability, opponents deprecating their adverse effects, dependence and abuse liability. More recently, the advent of alternative and usually safer medications has opened up the debate. The review noted a series of adverse effects that continued to cause concern, such as cognitive and psychomotor impairment. In addition, dependence and abuse remain as serious problems. Despite warnings and guidelines, usage of these drugs remains at a high level. The limitations in their use both as choice of therapy and with respect to conservative dosage and duration of use are highlighted. The distinction between low-dose 'iatrogenic' dependence and high-dose abuse/misuse is emphasized.\nThe practical problems with the benzodiazepines have persisted for 50 years, but have been ignored by many practitioners and almost all official bodies. The risk-benefit ratio of the benzodiazepines remains positive in most patients in the short term (2-4 weeks) but is unestablished beyond that time, due mainly to the difficulty in preventing short-term use from extending indefinitely with the risk of dependence.

A well-established sex difference in psychiatry is the higher incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in females. These disorders share stress as a potential etiological contributor and hyperarousal as a core symptom, suggesting that the distinction between sexes lies at the intersection of stress and arousal systems. This review focuses on the link between the stress axis and the brain norepinephrine arousal system as a key point at which sex differences occur and are translated to differences in the expression of mood disorders. Evidence for a circuit designed to relay emotion-related information via the limbic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system to the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine arousal system is reviewed. This is followed by recent novel findings of sex differences in CRF receptor signaling and trafficking that would result in an enhanced arousal response and a compromised ability to adapt to chronic stress in females. Finally, we discuss the evidence for sex differences in LC dendritic structure that allow for an increased receipt and processing of limbic information in females compared to males. Together these complementary sets of data suggest that in females, the LC arousal system is poised to process more limbic information and to respond to some of this information in an enhanced manner compared to males. The clinical and therapeutic considerations arising from this perspective are discussed.

A body of work in diagnostic development suggests a framework for evaluating and validating novel biomarkers, but this work may be unfamiliar to clinical and translational researchers in psychiatry. Therefore, this review focuses on the steps that might follow the identification of putative biomarkers. It first addresses standard approaches to characterizing biomarker performance, followed by demonstrations of how a putative biomarker might be shown to have clinical relevance. Finally, it addresses ways in which a biomarker-based test might be validated for clinical application in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness."}, {"Title": "[A call for immediate abolishment of the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act].", "Abstract": "The author demonstrates that Japan's Medical Treatment and Supervision Act of 2005 is meaningless and harmful from the perspective of psychiatric treatment, and worthless in terms of enhancing public safety. He goes on to propose a step-by-step process for reforming both the practice of psychiatry in general and that branch of the justice system that deals with defendants who have psychiatric disorders. The author suggests that the cost of reforms can be offset by abolishing the law in question and reducing the number of psychiatric hospital beds, and argues that it is possible to immediately halve the number of those beds.

This article discusses the present circumstances of forensic mental health services in Japan, focusing on trends in prison psychiatry. In the traditional Japanese system, offenders with mental disorders were treated within general psychiatry as involuntarily admitted patients, or within the prison system as mentally ill inmates. As a consequence of recent legal reform, however, this situation has radically changed. The Medical Treatment and Supervision Act of 2005 aimed to provide intensive psychiatric treatment to offenders with mental disorders, attaching great importance to their reintegration into society. Under the new system, a person who commits a serious criminal offense in a state of insanity or diminished capacity shall be referred by the public prosecutor to the district court; following a treatment order of the court, the person shall be treated in psychiatric facilities established by the law. While the new system is expected to play a role in the context of specialist forensic psychiatry, its distinction from general psychiatry remains unclear. For example, persons who commit serious crimes, such as assault, in an acute psychotic state are occasionally admitted to general psychiatric hospitals, even if they meet the criteria for a treatment order under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act. The relationship between prison psychiatry and specialist forensic psychiatry is still more problematic. Compared to the intensive, rehabilitation-oriented care provided under the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act, mental health services in penal institutions have a number of disadvantages, and it is unlikely that mentally ill prisoners have benefited from the recent progress in forensic psychiatry. Statistics show that the number of sentenced prisoners with mental disorders has steadily increased during the last decade. Although a majority of these individuals are substance abusers, the number of patients with schizophrenia who are unable to serve a sentence due to severe illness is not insignificant. Although patients are sometimes transferred to medical prisons, a substantial number of inmates with mental disorders remain in general prisons, most of which lack adequate medical staff. Accordingly, the growing number of mentally ill inmates is imposing a heavy burden on the penal administration system. Provisions of the Mental Health and Welfare Act pertaining to general psychiatry are not applicable to patients in penal institutions. The Psychiatric Review Board established in each prefecture does not intervene in the management of these facilities. As a result, legal safeguards against the violation of patients' rights are not sufficiently guaranteed in penal institutions. There are no legal provisions for transferring patients with severe mental disorders from prisons to psychiatric hospitals. Once sentenced to imprisonment, offenders with mental disorders are treated almost exclusively within the prison system. This situation is particularly serious in the case of patients with long-term sentences. In addition, the continued availability of psychiatric care after discharge from prison, which is crucial for preventing relapse of illness and recidivism, is not assured. When a mentally ill inmate is discharged, the head of the institution is required to report the discharge to the prefectural governor, in accordance with the Mental Health and Welfare Act. Recently, although the number of such reports has sharply increased, in actuality many of the persons reported are not admitted to hospitals because they do not meet the criteria for involuntary admission, and the provisions of the Medical Treatment and Supervision Act do not apply to them. In conclusion, more attention should be paid to the reform of prison psychiatry. Coordination of the separate functions of general psychiatry, specialist forensic psychiatry, and prison psychiatry is also important."}, {"Title": "Psychoanalysis in the university: the natural home for education and research.", "Abstract": "Psychoanalysis as a theory of human mental functioning and a derived therapeutic for disturbed functioning would have its natural home in the university, and Freud gave evidence of harboring such an ambition. But the sociopolitical structure of the early 20th century Austro-Hungarian Empire precluded this, and analysis developed, by default, its part-time, private practice-based educational structure.

This advantage enables contemporary scientists to suggest and test brain models for psychological concepts, theories, and methods. Considering the current dominance of biological ideas in psychiatry and psychology, such models are essential in confirmation of the psychological theories of mind. In this article a brain model for schemas as essential to cognitive theory is proposed. Schemas are seen as patterns which are recognized and memorized through the training phase of an autoassociative neural network. Then, these patterns are used to complete ambiguous aspects of future experiences through thalamo and hippocampal-cortical pathways. In relation to the self or the outside world when a pattern with unknown, noisy, or vague aspects is encountered, those aspects are completed by the principal components of previously learned patterns (schema). This process is to help the observer acquire a better understanding of the environment or the self. However, the patterns which are used to complete the uncertainties about the self or the environment are sometimes not good estimates of the reality and lead the person/patient to an illusionary perception of the self/environment. In this article, the role of the mirror neuron system in pattern recognition is also explained. Psychological and biological therapeutic implications of this model are discussed and the importance of a link between dynamic and cognitive therapies is rationalized."}, {"Title": "Expected benefits of streamlining undergraduate medical education by early commitment to specific medical specialties.", "Abstract": "Undergraduate medical education is too long; it does not meet the needs for physicians' workforce; and its content is inconsistent with the job characteristics of some of its graduates. In this paper we attempt to respond to these problems by streamlining medical education along the following three reforms. First, high school graduates would be eligible for undergraduate medical education programs of 4\u00a0years duration. Second, medical school applicants would be required to commit themselves to a medical specialty and choose one of four undergraduate paths: (1) \"Interventions/consultations\" path that would prepare its graduates for residencies in secondary and tertiary specialties, such as cardiology and surgery, (2) \"continuous patient care\" path for primary care specialties, such as family medicine and psychiatry, (3) \"diagnostic laboratory medicine and biomedical research\" path that would prepare for either laboratory-based careers, such as pathology, biochemistry and bacteriology, or research in e.g., immunology and molecular genetics, and (4) \"epidemiology and public health\" path that would include population-based research, preventive medicine and health care administration. Third, the content of each of these paths would focus on relevant learning outcomes, and medical school graduates would be eligible for residency training only in specialties included in their path. Hopefully, an early commitment to a medical specialty will reduce the duration of medical education, improve the regulation of physicians' workforce and adapt the curricular content to the future job requirements from medical school graduates."}, {"Title": "Road traffic accidents and posttraumatic stress disorder in an orthopedic setting in South-Eastern Nigeria: a controlled study.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric liaison services are rare in trauma units of various hospitals in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries.

However, it is through a small portal of entry and a very long lineage that disease as sickness entered behavioural spaces and human consciousness. This has a long evolutionary history. Anyone interested in the origins of medicine and psychiatry as social institution has to start with analysis of how mind and body were conceptualised and played out behaviourally following the pongid/hominin split and thereafter. The early evolution of medicine provides a template for clarifying elemental characteristics of mind and minding. Sickness and healing in chimpanzees represents an early manifestation of (ethno) medicine, termed a behavioural tradition, which is found played out in routines of helping, caring, and healing as well as other social behaviours. Chimpanzees seem to know they are sick since they resort to self-medication when exhibiting signs and symptoms of disease. Also, they help those exhibiting physical and cognitive disability. Among hominins, awareness of consequences and implications of sickness and coping with them represented an important feature of human consciousness and a major factor in the origins of vaunted human abilities involving language, cognition, and culture as we know them. A philosophical examination of the early evolution of sickness and healing provides a window into an understanding of evolving human capacities such as self-awareness, awareness and implications of suffering, theory of mind, altruism, conceptual grasp of sickness and healing and morality."}, {"Title": "The neuroendocrine system and stress, emotions, thoughts and feelings.", "Abstract": "The philosophy of mind is intimately connected with the philosophy of action. Therefore, concepts like free will, motivation, emotions (especially positive emotions), and also the ethical issues related to these concepts are of abiding interest. However, the concepts of consciousness and free will are usually discussed solely in linguistic, ideational and cognitive (i.e. \"left brain\") terms. Admittedly, consciousness requires language and the left-brain, but the aphasic right brain is equally conscious; however, what it \"hears\" are more likely to be music and emotions. Joy can be as conscious as the conscious motivation produced by the left-brain reading a sign that says, \"Danger mines!!\" However, look in the index of a Western textbook of psychology, psychiatry or philosophy for positive emotions located in the limbic system. Notice how discussion of positive spiritual/emotional issues in consciousness and motivation are scrupulously ignored. For example, the popular notions of \"love\" being either Eros (raw, amoral instinct) or agape (noble, non-specific valuing of all other people) miss the motivational forest for the trees. Neither Eros (hypothalamic) nor agape (cortical) has a fraction of the power to relieve stress as attachment (limbic love), yet until the 1950s attachment was neither appreciated nor discussed by academic minds. This paper will point out that the prosocial, \"spiritual\" positive emotions like hope, faith, forgiveness, joy, compassion and gratitude are extremely important in the relief of stress and in regulation of the neuroendocrine system, protecting us against stress.

Starting from a detailed case history, this paper describes how, to the contrary, values come into the diagnosis of mental disorders, directly through the criteria at the heart of psychiatry's most scientifically grounded classification, the American Psychiatric Association's DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual). Various possible interpretations of the prominence of values in psychiatric diagnosis are outlined. Drawing on work in the Oxford analytic tradition of philosophy, it is shown that, properly understood, the prominence of psychiatric diagnostic values reflects the necessary engagement of psychiatry with the diversity of individual human values. This interpretation opens up psychiatric diagnostic assessment to the resources of a new skills-based approach to working with complex and conflicting values (also derived from analytic philosophy) called 'values-based practice.' Developments in values-based practice in training, policy and research in mental health are briefly outlined.

This article investigates patient and social work factors related to successful community placement, in the context of limited community care facilities.\nThirty-six long-term patients who were successfully placed outside of the hospital during a seven month period were compared to 235 unplaced long-term patients in terms of demographic and clinical variables. Social work services were analysed in terms of which patients received the most interventions, and the most common type of interventions.\nThe most significant patient factors associated with successful placement were: female patients; medium-to-high level of functioning; having involved relatives living far away; a low frequency of behavioural problems (especially of cannabis abuse, verbal or physical aggression, uncontrolled sexual activity), and agitation or restlessness. These patient factors were mirrored in the social work services rendered to the long-term patients during the study period: The recipients were mostly female, in open wards (higher-functioning); and the social services utilised were mostly related to planning for placement and patient support.\nThe lack of community care facilities in the Pretoria area that are able to care for the more difficult long-term psychiatry patients, limits successful placement and increases the burden of hospital based social workers. The problem cannot be resolved at a hospital level and needs to be addressed in the context of provincial and national health departments."}, {"Title": "Adherence to Turkish psychiatric association guideline for bipolar depression treatment in a specialized mood disorders outpatient unit.", "Abstract": "Bipolar patients spend up to one third of their lives in depression however, acute treatment guidelines mainly focused on the manic phase of illness. With recent attention to the importance of evidence-based medicine in psychiatry, a number of treatment guidelines have emerged to aid clinicians in clinical decision making. Here, we aim to measure concordance with the Turkish Psychiatric Association Treatment Guideline for Bipolar Disorders (TPATGBD) for the depressive phase of illness.\nBipolar patients attending the Rasit Tahsin Mood Disorders Outpatient Unit of Istanbul Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatry, Neurolgy & Neurosurgery, were assessed using standardized forms based on a nation-wide mood disorders follow-up program. Concordance of implementations with the TPATGBD were evaluated step by step for each level of depression severity.\nConcordance rates with the first step recommendations of the guideline were 29.4%, 27.4% and 87.5% for mild-moderate, moderate-severe (without psychosis) and severe depression (with psychosis), respectively. Concordance rates with the second step recommendations of the guideline were lower for bipolar depressions without psychosis. Overall, adherence to the guideline did not impact on time to remission (p=0.19).\nDespite considerable efforts to develop and disseminate evidence-based guidelines, they are not widely followed by clinicians and important opportunities clearly exist to educate clinicians about the feasibility and utility of clinical guidelines for bipolar disorder.

Clinical trials exploring deep brain stimulation (DBS), a focally targeted, adjustable and reversible form of neurosurgery, are being developed to address the use of this technology in highly selected patient populations. Psychiatric patients deemed eligible for surgical intervention, such as DBS, typically meet stringent inclusion criteria, including demonstrated severity, chronicity and a failure of conventional therapy. Although a humanitarian device exemption by the US Food and Drug Administration exists for its use in obsessive-compulsive disorder, DBS remains a largely experimental treatment in the psychiatric context, with its use currently limited to clinical trials and investigative studies. The combination of a patient population at the limits of conventional therapy and a novel technology in a new indication poses interesting challenges to the informed consent process as it relates to clinical trial enrollment. These challenges can be divided into those that relate to the patient, their disease and the technology, with each illustrating how traditional conceptualisations of research consent may be inadequate in the surgical psychiatry context. With specific reference to risk analysis, patient autonomy, voluntariness and the duty of the clinician-researcher, this paper will discuss the unique challenges that clinical trials of surgery for refractory psychiatric disease present to the consent process. Recommendations are also made for an ethical approach to clinical trial consent acquisition in this unique patient population."}, {"Title": "Unmet needs of outpatients with late-life depression; a comparison of patient, staff and carer perceptions.", "Abstract": "There is evidence that late life depression is associated with high levels of unmet needs.

The severity of depression was measured with the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).\nOn average patients scored more unmet needs than staff and carers. On item level, patients and staff showed the highest agreement in the psychological needs category. Patient and carers showed the highest agreement on physical health needs. Logistic regression showed that severe depression is a significant predictor of low concordance between stakeholders on a substantial number of CANE items.\nKappa coefficients were computed to determine agreement between parties involved. However, Kappa coefficients should be interpreted with caution, especially when obvious disparity in unmet needs scores between groups of interest can be observed.\nHome dwelling older patients with major depressive disorder, their practitioners and their informal carers have different perceptions of the older patients unmet needs.Practitioners should be aware of the negative impact of depression severity on reaching agreement regarding unmet needs and its possible consequences for mutual goal setting and compliance."}, {"Title": "The child and adolescent track in the forensic fellowship.", "Abstract": "Exposure to child and adolescent forensic issues is limited in general psychiatry residency and child and adolescent psychiatry residency programs.

Classifications were compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were compared with a clinician-rated gold standard.\nModels incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55). When these cross-sectional visits were integrated to define longitudinal outcomes and incorporate treatment data, 15% of the cohort remitted with a single antidepressant treatment, while 13% were identified as failing to remit despite at least two antidepressant trials. Non-remitting patients were more likely to be non-Caucasian (p<0.001).\nThe application of bioinformatics tools such as NLP should enable accurate and efficient determination of longitudinal outcomes, enabling existing EMR data to be applied to clinical research, including biomarker investigations.

Considering Kraepelin's influence in the creation of these diagnostic tools, the question arises as to how Kraepelin's contemporaries and successors reacted to his nosology. Historical libraries and archives in Munich, Berlin and Paris were searched for European and American psychiatric literature using the keywords 'Kraepelin', 'dichotomy' and 'manic-depressive disorder'. Literature from 1900 to 1960 was examined and compared to the current literature regarding Kraepelin's impact on modern classification systems. The sixth edition of Kraepelin's 'Lehrbuch' (1899) presented the dichotomy in its entirety and led to three different periods of critical comment on dichotomy and methodology between 1900 and 1960. But on the whole, Kraepelin's system was quickly and completely adopted in clinical diagnosis. The publications appearing on and following Kraepelin's centenary in 1956 represent his work as generally being the foundation of modern psychiatry. The neo-Kraepelinian movement, beginning in the late 1960s, developed more differentiated views of Kraepelin's scientific background and methodology. Notwithstanding all the criticism of Kraepelin's dichotomy, it remains more than ever the basis of psychiatric diagnosis. The criticism today shows parallels to the statements made during Kraepelin's era, mainly concerning the issue of diagnostic overlapping of the two disease entities, manic-depressive disorder and schizophrenia, and includes the question of syndromatology."}, {"Title": "Something to hang my life on: the health benefits of writing poetry for people with serious illnesses.", "Abstract": "We aimed to explore the effect of a poetry writing program for people who had experienced a serious illness.\nFor this study we randomly assigned 28 volunteer participants with a history of serious illness, usually cancer, to one of two poetry writing workshops.

This paper endeavours to examine the way in which the history of the psychoanalysis of children is marked by the history of its protagonists. In particular, Hug-Hellmuth's treatment of children is divided between an educational approach and a more properly psychoanalytical aspect. Her theory and practice heavily influenced the directions taken after her, in particular by Anna Freud and Melanie Klein, even if this influence is essentially unacknowledged by these authors.\nHug-Hellmuth's contribution to the psychoanalysis of children and consequently to child psychiatry are considerable and include technical innovation with the introduction of play into the treatment of children, the elaboration of the place of the analyst in regard to the child and notably the establishment of the place of the parents in regard to the treatment of the child. It is proposed that the very duality of her approach is what allowed her to be able to distinguish the place of the parent from that of the analyst. Nonetheless, her insistence on the place of education within the treatment and its effects on later theorists continue to raise dilemmas today."}, {"Title": "Ten years of integrated care for mental disorders in the Netherlands.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM STATEMENT: Integrated care for mental disorders aims to encompass forms of collaboration between different health care settings for the treatment of mental disorders. To this end, it requires integration at several levels, i.e. integration of psychiatry in medicine, of the psychiatric discourse in the medical discourse; of localization of mental health care and general health care facilities; and of reimbursement systems.\nSteps have been taken in the last decade to meet these requirements, enabling psychiatry to move on towards integrated treatment of mental disorder as such, by development of a collaborative care model that includes structural psychiatric consultation that was found to be applicable and effective in several Dutch health care settings. This collaborative care model is a feasible and effective model for integrated care in several health care settings. The Bio Psycho Social System has been developed as a feasible instrument for assessment in integrated care as well.\nThe discipline of psychiatry has moved from anti-psychiatry in the last century, towards an emancipated medical discipline. This enabled big advances towards integrated care for mental disorder, in collaboration with other medical disciplines, in the last decade.\nNow is the time to further expand this concept of care towards other mental disorders, and towards integrated care for medical and mental co-morbidity. Integrated care for mental disorder should be readily available to the patient, according to his/her preference, taking somatic co-morbidity into account, and with a focus on rehabilitation of the patient in his or her social roles."}, {"Title": "[Clinical psychiatry and the problem of investigation of new psychopharmacological agents].", "Abstract": "Problems of future development of psychopathology and clinical psychopharmacology are discussed.

These sections are: building a trusting relationship, making a diagnosis and carrying out treatment suited to the patient\u2019s needs.\nThe psychiatrist\u2019s attitude to his patient varies according to the phase of treatment, sometimes it is more relativistic, at other times it is more universalistic.\nThe compliance of non-Western patients will probably increase when the clinician adopts a more relativistic approach during the phase of building a relationship with the patient and probably also during some parts of the treatment phase so that he can come closer to meeting the patient\u2019s expectations."}, {"Title": "[Psychopharmocotherapy of schizophrenia in forensic and general psychiatry].", "Abstract": "In general psychiatry, the treatment of schizophrenic psychoses is focused on the reduction of symptoms, the improvement of quality of life and the recovery of the capacity to work. In forensic psychiatry, a further major targets is the reduction of aggressive behavior - not least by the establishment of a stable adherence to medication. It is unclear until now, whether this leads to different psychopharmacological treatment strategies.\nThe study includes 91 patients from the Psychiatric University Clinic Vienna (PUC) and 116 patients from the Justizanstalt G\u00f6llersdorf (JAG\u00d6), Austrian's central institution for the treatment of mentally disordered offenders not guilty by reason of insanity. We compared dosage, way of administration (oral, depot) and additional other medication. For both groups the chlorpromazine-equivalents were calculated. Additionally, combinations of different antipsychotic drugs and those of antipsychotics with medication of other substance classes (antidepressants, mood-stabilizers, benzodiazepines, anticholinergics) were compared.\nForensic patients were statistically significantly more often treated with intramuscular long-acting antipsychotics (LAI). Surprisingly, the total chlorpromazine-equivalents did not differ between the groups. Combinations of two or more antipsychotics were common in both groups, in the JAG\u00d6 frequently as a combination of a first generation depot antipsychotic drug (FGA) with oral second genera tion antipsychotics (SGA), in the PUC more as often a combination of two or more oral SGA. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines were more frequently prescribed in the PUC, anticholinergics in the JAG\u00d6.\nPatients suffering from schizophrenia are often non-compliant to medication. As nonadherence is a strong predictor for criminal offences, LAI-formulations are an important treatment tool in forensic psychiatry. This does not result in higher dosages. The high rates of polypharmacy in both groups emphasizes the well known problem that therapeutic guidelines based on studies in highly selected samples are often not transferable into everyday clinical practice."}, {"Title": "Eating disorders and trauma history in women with perinatal depression.", "Abstract": "Although the prevalence of perinatal depression (depression occurring during pregnancy and postpartum) is 10%, little is known about psychiatric comorbidity in these women.

The risk association was estimated by time-dependent survival analyses, as indexed by hazard ratio.\nApproximately 30% of young people received MPH treatment within the year of their ADHD diagnosis, and virtually none remained in treatment beyond 12 months. Regardless of co-morbidity status, the following were significantly associated with earlier initiation of MPH treatment: older age (e.g., adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for age 12-17 = 4.5-7.6), lower socioeconomic status (aHR = 1.2-1.4), southern residence (aHR = 1.4-1.6), receiving the diagnosis while school was in session (aHR = 1.3-1.4), receiving the diagnosis from a physician specializing in pediatrics or psychiatry (aHR = 7.3-16.8), and receiving the diagnosis in a district hospital/clinic (aHR = 1.3-1.7). However, once treatment started, older ages appeared to increase the risk of early discontinuation by 15%, and the corresponding estimates for receiving initial MPH in a regional hospital or district hospital/clinic were 27% and 32%, respectively.

Image-based meta-analyses use full image information (i.e. the statistical parametric maps) and well-established statistics, but images are rarely available making them highly unfeasible. Peak-probability meta-analyses such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) or multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) are more feasible as they only need reported peak coordinates. Signed-differences methods, such as signed differential mapping (SDM) build upon the positive features of existing peak-probability methods and enable meta-analyses of studies comparing patients with controls. In this paper we present a new version of SDM, named Effect Size SDM (ES-SDM), which enables the combination of statistical parametric maps and peak coordinates and uses well-established statistics. We validated the new method by comparing the results of an ES-SDM meta-analysis of studies on the brain response to fearful faces with the results of a pooled analysis of the original individual data. The results showed that ES-SDM is a valid and reliable coordinate-based method, whose performance might be additionally increased by including statistical parametric maps.

Scores from the B-CATS and the SCIP were highly correlated in the three diagnostic groups, and both scales showed good to excellent concurrent validity relative to a Global Cognitive Composite Score (GCCS) derived from the more comprehensive examination. The SCIP-S showed better predictive value of global cognitive impairment than the B-CATS.

Developing a robust placebo model to describe the placebo response is important to facilitate quantification of drug effects, and eventually to guide the design of clinical trials for psychiatric treatment via a model-based simulation approach. In addition, high dropout rates are very common in the placebo arm of psychiatric clinical trials. While developing models to evaluate the effect of placebo response, the data from patients who drop out of the trial should be considered for accurate interpretation of the results. The objective of this paper is to review the various empirical and semi-mechanistic models that have been used to quantify the placebo response in schizophrenia trials. Pros and cons of each placebo model are discussed. Additionally, placebo models used in other neuropsychiatric disorders like depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are also reviewed with the objective of finding those placebo models that could be useful for clinical studies of both acute and chronic schizophrenic disease conditions. Better understanding of the patterns of dropout and the factors leading to dropouts are crucial in identifying the true placebo response. We therefore also review dropout models that are used in the development of models for treatment effects and in the optimization of clinical trials by simulation approaches. The use of an appropriate modelling strategy that is capable of identifying the potential sources of variable placebo responses and dropout rates is recommended for improving the sensitivity in discriminating between the effects of active treatment and placebo."}, {"Title": "Epigenetics of early child development.", "Abstract": "Comprehensive clinical studies show that adverse conditions in early life can severely impact the developing brain and increase vulnerability to mood disorders later in life. During early postnatal life the brain exhibits high plasticity which allows environmental signals to alter the trajectories of rapidly developing circuits. Adversity in early life is able to shape the experience-dependent maturation of stress-regulating pathways underlying emotional functions and endocrine responses to stress, such as the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, leading to long-lasting altered stress responsivity during adulthood. To date, the study of gene-environment interactions in the human population has been dominated by epidemiology. However, recent research in the neuroscience field is now advancing clinical studies by addressing specifically the mechanisms by which gene-environment interactions can predispose individuals toward psychopathology. To this end, appropriate animal models are being developed in which early environmental factors can be manipulated in a controlled manner. Here we will review recent studies performed with the common aim of understanding the effects of the early environment in shaping brain development and discuss the newly developing role of epigenetic mechanisms in translating early life conditions into long-lasting changes in gene expression underpinning brain functions. Particularly, we argue that epigenetic mechanisms can mediate the gene-environment dialog in early life and give rise to persistent epigenetic programming of adult physiology and dysfunction eventually resulting in disease. Understanding how early life experiences can give rise to lasting epigenetic marks conferring increased risk for mental disorders, how they are maintained and how they could be reversed, is increasingly becoming a focus of modern psychiatry and should pave new guidelines for timely therapeutic interventions."}, {"Title": "Translational epidemiology in psychiatry: linking population to clinical and basic sciences.", "Abstract": "Translational research generally refers to the application of knowledge generated by advances in basic sciences research translated into new approaches for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease. This direction is called bench-to-bedside. Psychiatry has similarly emphasized the basic sciences as the starting point of translational research. This article introduces the term translational epidemiology for psychiatry research as a bidirectional concept in which the knowledge generated from the bedside or the population can also be translated to the benches of laboratory science. Epidemiologic studies are primarily observational but can generate representative samples, novel designs, and hypotheses that can be translated into more tractable experimental approaches in the clinical and basic sciences. This bedside-to-bench concept has not been explicated in psychiatry, although there are an increasing number of examples in the research literature. This article describes selected epidemiologic designs, providing examples and opportunities for translational research from community surveys and prospective, birth cohort, and family-based designs. Rapid developments in informatics, emphases on large sample collection for genetic and biomarker studies, and interest in personalized medicine--which requires information on relative and absolute risk factors--make this topic timely. The approach described has implications for providing fresh metaphors to communicate complex issues in interdisciplinary collaborations and for training in epidemiology and other sciences in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Psychoeducational methods for patients suffering from depression: the knowledge seeking instrument (KSI).", "Abstract": "To develop and psychometrically assess a short instrument that can be easily used in clinical practice to measure knowledge-seeking behavior in patients suffering from depression.\nWe developed the knowledge seeking instrument (KSI), a self-report scale of three items to assess the number of hours spent in knowledge seeking behavior such as reading written materials, surfing the internet, or watching audio-visual tools. Experts in mood disorders (n=12) participated in the formal validity assessment of the instrument, and the developed instrument was administered to outpatients who were attending psychiatry clinic (n=63). All patients also completed a multiple choice question instrument to measure knowledge of depression, a Likert self report questionnaire to assess attitudes towards depression and its treatment, and an adherence to antidepressants scale.\nIn addition to the empirical evidence for validity, there was 68% agreement among experts that the items were highly relevant in measuring behavior of knowledge seeking, providing evidence for content validity. There were significant correlations (p<0.05) between knowledge of psychological and biological treatments of depression and knowledge seeking reading scores. The internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) was 0.67 for the instrument.\nThe KSI takes 2 min to complete.

In pharmaceutically oriented practice, relations are used to evaluate biologies, and drugs produce the truth about relations at the same time that they produce the truth about bodies. In the process, clinical practice often involves unmaking relations, generating loss, in certain instances, as a dire result. In this, a particular kind of clinical knowing emerges, engaging broad cultural and historical connections between love and madness more than definitions of right and wrong unions. In asking how disciplinary and relational modes of biomedicine converge, I argue that in north Indian psychiatry's attentions to women, rather than enforcing normative configurations of \"the family,\" biomedicine grapples with the gendered fallout of kinship."}, {"Title": "Reflexes in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric patients often do not cooperate fully with the neurologic examination.

A total of 338 youths were identified who returned to the emergency department of an urban general hospital within six months of an index visit. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between having a connection to outpatient mental health care and repeated use of the emergency department.\nBehavior problems were the presenting complaint for more than 50% of youths at both the index and second visits. Sixty-five percent of youths reported a connection to an outpatient mental health provider at both visits; 9% did not identify a provider at either visit.

Data are from a three-arm, 12 week, randomized clinical trial of investigating the efficacy of St. John's Wort (810\u00a0mg/day), citalopram (20\u00a0mg/day), or placebo for acute treatment of MinD. Due to a high placebo response on all outcome measures, neither St. John's Wort nor citalopram separated from placebo on change in depressive symptom severity, quality of life, or well-being. However, systematic assessment of potential adverse effects (AEs) led to three important observations: (1) prior to the administration of study compound, 60% of subjects endorsed items that would be characterized as AEs once study compound was administered, (2) St. John's Wort and citalopram were each associated with a significant number of new or worsening AEs during treatment, and (3) using a structured interview for identifying AEs at baseline and during treatment is informative. MinD was not responsive to either a conventional antidepressant or a nutraceutical, and both compounds were associated with a notable side effects burden. Other treatment approaches for MinD should be investigated."}, {"Title": "Genes, environment, and individual differences in responding to treatment for depression.", "Abstract": "A principal weakness of evidence-based psychiatry is that it does not account for the individual variability in therapeutic response among individuals with the same diagnosis. The aim of personalized psychiatry is to remediate this shortcoming and to use predictors to select treatment that is most likely to be beneficial for an individual. This article reviews the evidence that genetic variation, environmental exposures, and gene-environment interactions shape mental illness and influence treatment outcomes, with a primary focus on depression. Several genetic polymorphisms have been identified that influence the outcome of specific treatments, but the strength and generalizability of such influences are not sufficient to justify personalized prescribing. Environmental exposures in early life, such as childhood maltreatment, exert long-lasting influences that are moderated by inherited genetic variation and mediated through stable epigenetic mechanisms such as tissue- and gene-specific DNA methylation. Pharmacological and psychological treatments act on and against the background of genetic disposition, with epigenetic annotation resulting from previous experiences. Research in animal models suggests the possibility that epigenetic interventions may modify the impact of environmental stressors on mental health. Gaps in evidence are identified that need to be bridged before knowledge about cause can inform cure in personalized psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Pharmacogenetic approaches to cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Research in the area of pharmacogenetics in psychiatry is aimed at identifying clinically relevant genetic variations that can predict treatment response. Ultimately, the goal is to individualize treatment in order to optimize outcome in disorders in which incomplete treatment response is common. Positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia appear to be the most amenable to the currently available agents; however, negative symptoms and cognitive deficits frequently persist even when frank psychosis is well controlled. Given the relationship between these persistent traits and functional disability in schizophrenia, efforts are under way to directly target cognitive impairment and negative symptoms pharmacologically in order to improve quality of life. To date, most pharmacogenetic studies of schizophrenia have been focused on predicting clinical efficacy and side effects.

The largest share of acute referrals to emergency psychiatric wards occurs out-of-hours, and out-of-hours services are responsible for a disproportionately high share of compulsory referrals. Concerns exist regarding the quality of mental healthcare provided in the out-of-hours setting. The aim of this study was to explore which challenges GPs experience when providing emergency care out-of-hours to patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse.\nWe conducted a qualitative study based on two individual interviews and six focus groups with purposively sampled GPs (totally 45 participants). The interviews were analysed successively in an editing style, using a thematic approach based on methodological descriptions by Charmaz and Malterud.\nSafety and uncertainty were the dominating themes in the discussions. The threat to personal safety due to unpredictable patient behaviour was a central concern, and present security precautions in the out-of-hours services were questioned. The GPs expressed high levels of uncertainty in their work with patients presenting problems related to mental illness or substance abuse. The complexity of the problems presented, shortage of time, limited access to reliable information and limited range of interventions available during out-of-hours contributed to this uncertainty. Perceived access to second opinion seemed to have a major impact on subjectively experienced work stress.\nThe GPs experienced out-of-hours psychiatry as a field with high levels of uncertainty and limited support to help them meet the experienced challenges. This might influence the quality of care provided.

Seclusion continues to be widely used in the management of disturbed behaviour in hospitalized patients. Although recent studies serve to strengthen the link between the use of seclusion and negative patient responses, they are limited in extending our understanding of the seclusion experience. The objective of this work was two-fold: to examine the perceptions and experiences of patients about their seclusion experience and then suggest ways of improving the use of seclusion in relation to an ethical perspective.\nWe conducted face-to-face semi-structured interviews with inpatients in a French Public Psychiatric Hospital, 3 weeks after their seclusion. They were conducted until no new ideas emerged in the content analysis, comprising 30 patients. Interviews were conducted using an interview guide by a physician. Specific attention was paid to their perceptions of seclusion. This guide was based on the concepts of medical ethics (autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance). Interviews were retranscribed and content analysis was performed by two of the authors who were skilled in textual analysis. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 software.\nAutonomy was challenged by 50% of interviewed patients. For 70% of patients, there was a lack of information and explanation during the seclusion on therapeutics, practices, procedures, expected length of time in seclusion and behaviours. This can contribute to perception of this process as punishment expressed by the patients. The dominant view of patients was that more effective communication about seclusion was needed. A majority of patients perceived the beneficence of the health professionals even if most of them did not express a benefit from this experience: only 26% believed that seclusion made them calm down and 36% that seclusion helped them to feel and behave better. The level and the quality of the relationship with staff during and following the seclusion experience was a major source of satisfaction for patients and can counter-balance their negative perception of seclusion. The non-malfeasance was questioned by patients. The therapeutic value of seclusion was not recognized by a majority of them. Seclusion from the patient's perspective appears to invoke a complex range of feelings that include helplessness (76%), anger (60%), humiliation (60%), depression (50%), and fear (63%). For 60% of patients, the act of placing them in seclusion had a profound negative impact. Seventy-six percent of them considered that seclusion could be prevented.\nDespite advances in our knowledge and understanding of mental illness, seclusion continues, and is likely to continue, as a treatment option for a number of patients. In our study, a certain number of trends were observed. Globally, there is some tension concerning ethical principles. Attention to the specific needs of patients while in seclusion may serve to reduce the punitive connotations linked to the practice. What is needed is a permanent ethical reevaluation of seclusion. For this purpose, healthcare professional staffs may be useful for a truly ethical reflection. The aim is to recognize the patient as the agent of his/her own empowerment through appropriate information. This approach should not only provide the patient with the opportunity to understand why the seclusion occurred, but also some means for overcoming the negative effects of the procedure."}, {"Title": "[Assessment of targeted clinical audit in suicide attempt].", "Abstract": "Suicide attempt is a serious condition that is frequent in France.

All the wards analyzed 30 patients' files for the first cycle, set up and implemented improvement actions and then performed the second cycle of data collection.\nAll wards fully satisfied the protocol with 30 patients' files per cycle and two cycles. In all wards the teams consisted of physicians (both certified for emergency or psychiatry) and others care providers (nurses, psychologists, social workers, secretary). For the first cycle, three criteria (patient assessment, somatic examination and coordination) met the 100% target for more than half of the wards while three criteria (sociofamily and environmental evaluation, management for after hospital care, monitoring of follow-up) did not conform by more than 50% in more than half of the wards. All wards implemented changes after the first cycle with a total of 29 interventions, each one specifically devoted to improving a particular criterion. Intervention included better coordination and communication, protocol design and reminders, and information tools. The second cycle showed modest and mixed changes. After the interventions only one criteria reached the 100% target in one ward; the degree of conformity decreased in nine cases (with a mean of -23%) and increased in 16 cases (+19%). Globally, three criteria improved by less than 10% while three slightly decreased.\nG. Shaw introduced clinical audits in 1989 to boost a poorly performing system within the \"clinical governance\" framework, a condition quite different from the French healthcare system in 2005. Therefore, the validation of clinical audit in a different context appeared necessary. Anaes has not yet published the evaluation of this method in a peer reviewed journal. Observed changes are modest and mixed. Moreover, the true impact on care delivery appears limited and one cannot rule out that the observed improvements are in fact related to an improvement in traceability or due to Hawthorne's effect. Quality improvement methods must be evaluated and validated by scientific methods such as for new treatments with clinical research.\nThe feasibility of the method was excellent, due to the methodological and technical support, however the method did not significantly improve the quality of care."}, {"Title": "The Geneva brain collection.", "Abstract": "The University of Geneva brain collection was founded at the beginning of the 20th century.

Hospitals with good IP-OP communication had structures in place to support communication or had changed/implemented new procedures to enhance communication, and anticipated clinicians would 'buy in' to the goal of improved communication. Hospitals reporting no improvement efforts were less likely to have structures supporting IP-OP communication, anticipated resistance among clinicians and reported a need for technological resources such as electronic health records, integrated IT and secure online communication. Most leaders reported a need for additional staff time and information, knowledge or data.\nFor many hospitals, successfully improving communication will require overcoming organisational barriers such as cultures not conducive to change and lack of resources and infrastructure.

Anxiety-depressive syndrome and attention disorders were the diseases for which psychotropic drugs were most commonly prescribed. In all, 75% youths also received psychological support and 20% were prescribed drugs for 2 or more years.\nDespite the low drug prescription prevalence, the finding that most children were not cared for by child and adolescent psychiatric services is of concern and calls for a systematic, continuous monitoring of psychopharmacological treatments."}, {"Title": "Patients with delusional infestation (delusional parasitosis) often require prolonged treatment as recurrence of symptoms after cessation of treatment is common: an observational study.", "Abstract": "Delusional infestation (DI) is an uncommon psychiatric disorder in which patients present with the false and fixed belief of infestation.

Antidepressant-resistance, antidepressant-induced worsening of depression, antidepressant-associated (hypo)manic switches, mixed depressive episode, and antidepressant-associated suicidality among depressed patients are relatively most frequent in bipolar/bipolar spectrum depression and in children and adolescents. As early age at onset of major depressive episode and mixed depression are powerful clinical markers of bipolarity and the manic component of bipolar disorder (and possible its biological background) shows a declining tendency with age antidepressant-resistance/worsening, antidepressant-induced (hypo)manic switches and \"suicide-inducing\" potential of antidepressants seem to be related to the underlying bipolarity."}, {"Title": "Discovering imaging endophenotypes for major depression.", "Abstract": "Psychiatry research lacks an in-depth understanding of mood disorders phenotypes, leading to limited success of genetics studies of major depressive disorder (MDD). The dramatic progress in safe and affordable magnetic resonance-based imaging methods has the potential to identify subtle abnormalities of neural structures, connectivity and function in mood disordered subjects. This review paper presents strategies to improve the phenotypic definition of MDD by proposing imaging endophenotypes derived from magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures, such as cortical gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate/glutamine concentrations, and from measures of resting-state activity and functional connectivity. The proposed endophenotypes are discussed regarding specificity, mood state-independence, heritability, familiarity, clinical relevance and possible associations with candidate genes. By improving phenotypic definitions, the discovery of new imaging endophenotypes will increase the power of candidate gene and genome-wide associations studies. It will also help to develop and evaluate novel therapeutic treatments and enable clinicians to apply individually tailored therapeutic approaches. Finally, improvements of the phenotypic definition of MDD based on neuroimaging measures will contribute to a new classification system of mood disorders based on etiology and pathophysiology."}, {"Title": "What medical students say about psychiatry: results of a reflection exercise.", "Abstract": "The author describes the results of a reflection exercise for psychiatry clerkship students.\nThe author performed a qualitative analysis on 100 \"reflection\" papers written by medical students in their psychiatry clerkship and identified the most prominent thematic content.\nThe most common thematic content involved social issues in psychiatry, the reality of mental illness, the role of trauma, difficulties forming alliances with patients, the efficacy of interventions, the power of empathic connection, and students' personal identifications.\nReflection exercises can foster students' awareness of their preexisting attitudes toward mental illness and the evolution of their views during training.

The neurobiology of bipolar depression and the possible targets of bipolar antidepressant therapy remain relatively elusive. We performed a complete and systematic review to identify agents with definite positive or negative results concerning efficacy followed by a second systematic review to identify the pharmacodynamic properties of these agents. The comparison of properties suggests that the stronger predictors for antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression were norepinephrine alpha-1, dopamine D1 and histamine antagonism, followed by 5-HT2A, muscarinic and dopamine D2 and D3 antagonism and eventually by norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 5HT-1A agonism.

Several studies indicate that collaboration often is poor, with the result that patient' needs for coordinated services are not sufficiently met, and that resources are inefficiently used. An increasing number of mental health care workers should improve mental health services, but may complicate collaboration and coordination between mental health workers and other professionals in the treatment chain. The aim of this qualitative study is to investigate strengths and weaknesses in today's collaboration, and to suggest improvements in the interaction between General Practitioners (GPs) and specialised mental health service.\nThis paper presents a qualitative focus group study with data drawn from six groups and eight group sessions with 28 health professionals (10 GPs, 12 nurses, and 6 physicians doing post-doctoral training in psychiatry), all working in the same region and assumed to make professional contact with each other.\nGPs and mental health professionals shared each others expressions of strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvement in today's collaboration. Strengths in today's collaboration were related to common consultations between GPs and mental health professionals, and when GPs were able to receive advice about diagnostic treatment dilemmas. Weaknesses were related to the GPs' possibility to meet mental health professionals, and lack of mutual knowledge in mental health services. The results describe experiences and importance of interpersonal knowledge, mutual accessibility and familiarity with existing systems and resources. There is an agreement between GPs and mental health professionals that services will improve with shared knowledge about patients through systematic collaborative services, direct cell-phone lines to mental health professionals and allocated times for telephone consultation.\nGPs and mental health professionals experience collaboration as important. GPs are the gate-keepers to specialised health care, and lack of collaboration seems to create problems for GPs, mental health professionals, and for the patients.

A resident desiring certification as a psychiatric specialist must purchase a psychiatric specialist certification handbook and present it when taking the examination. There are many differences between the new examination and the transitional period examination, in terms of both the handbook and the number of case reports to be submitted. Results of a survey conducted on 360 psychiatrists belonging to either university or national hospitals, all of whom had undergone psychiatric training within the past eight years, revealed that there was currently a lack of knowledge, and low rate of utilization, of the handbook. The primary author was in the first cohort of those who began postgraduate psychiatric training in a university hospital and subsequently took the first examination administered after the transition period. The author has maintained that, based on personal experience, a number of issues need improvement, such as the large number of grading items to be signed off on by supervising psychiatrists, and complications involving the outline of cases to be experienced.

Using a series of case files pertaining to European patients admitted to the Mathari Mental Hospital in Nairobi during the 1940s and 1950s, this article shows how sexual transgression among colonial Europeans precipitated, and was combined with, mental distress. Considering psychiatric treatment as a form of social control, the article investigates a number of cases in which a European patient had been perceived to have transgressed the normative sexual behaviour codes of settler society in Kenya. What these files suggest is that transgressive sexuality in Kenya was itself framed by indices, as insistent as they were uncertain, of gender, race and class. While psychiatry as social control has some degree of purchase here, more valuable is an attempt to discern the particular ways in which certain forms of sexual behaviour were understood in diagnostic terms. Men who had sex with Africans, we see, tended to be diagnosed as 'depressed' on arrival at the hospital but were judged to be mentally normal consequently. Women, by contrast, were liable to be diagnosed as psychopathic, a diagnosis, I argue, that helped to explain the uniquely transgressive status of impoverished European women living alone in the margins of white society. Unlike white men, moreover, women did not have to have sex with non-Europeans to transgress sexual codes: this is because female poverty was a sexual problem in a way that male poverty decidedly was not. Poor white women were marked by uncertainty over their sexual behaviour\u2014and dubious racial identity in its turn\u2014and the problem of social contamination was described by reference both to the polluted racial ancestry of an individual and to the prospective contamination of healthy racial stocks.

Psychiatry studies are complex and present unique challenges in the Indian setting. Ethical issues pertaining to the risk of worsening of illness, use of placebo and validity of informed consents are commonly faced. Site selection can be difficult due to the relative paucity of ICH-GCP (International Conference on Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice) trained psychiatry investigators in India. Recruitment can be challenging due to issues such as strict eligibility criteria, (lack of) availability of caregiver, illness-related considerations, etc. Assessment of the consent capacity of patients is not simple, while structured assessments are not commonly employed. As the illness fluctuates, the consent capacity may change, thus requiring continued assessment of consent capacity. Study patients run the risk of worsening of illness and suicide due to exposure to inactive treatments; this risk is counterbalanced by use of appropriate study designs, as well as the indirect psychotherapeutic support received. Psychiatry studies are associated with a high placebo response. This necessitates conduct of placebo-controlled studies despite the attendant difficulties. Also, the high placebo response is often the cause of failed trials. Rating scales are essential for assessment of drug response. Some rating instruments as well as some rater training procedures may not be suitable for the Indian setting. Technological advancements may increase the procedural complexity but improve the quality of ratings. Psychiatry studies present monitors and auditors with unique scenarios too.

To address this important gap, we sought providers' perspectives on the potential clinical translation of functional neuroimaging for prediction and diagnosis of mental illness. We conducted 32 semi-structured telephone interviews with mental health care providers representing psychiatry, psychology, family medicine, and allied mental health. Our results suggest that mental health providers have begun to re-conceptualize mental illness with a neuroscience gaze. They report an epistemic commitment to the value of a brain scan to provide a meaningful explanation of mental illness for their clients. If functional neuroimaging continues along its projected trajectory to translation, providers will ultimately have to negotiate its role in mental health. Their perspectives, therefore, enrich bioethical discourse surrounding neurotechnology and inform the translational pathway."}, {"Title": "[Suicide and malpractice].", "Abstract": "Some recent statements on the subject of psychiatrists' responsibility for suicide committed by patients have provoked lively discussions about the welfare duties of public psychiatric services, causing a widespread climate of alarm among medical institutions. The discussion is primarily about the extent of the psychiatrist's \"posizione della garanzia\", in particular the duty of protection and surveillance in relation to the risk of self-destructive behavior, referring to convictions not only in TSO cases but also in cases of voluntary hospitalization and valid consensus on treatment. The subject of suicide inevitably reminds us of the predictability of self-destructive behavior and, above all, of its prevention. The authors compare data from scientific literature on this subject - the organizational model of territorial psychiatry - with the principles ordered by the convictions, in particular the request for \"ulterior and more rigorous protective rules\", thus highlighting their complicated synthesis. In the authors' opinion, a possible literal interpretation of the legal indications would risk a profound change in the quality of the relationship between psychiatrist and patient.

Although some conflicting data has been presented, studies investigating the CGI's validity have only rarely been conducted so far. It is unclear whether the improvement index CGI-I or a difference score of the severity index CGI-S (dif) is more valid in depicting clinical change. The current study examined the validity of these two measures and investigated whether therapists' CGI ratings correspond to the view the patients themselves have on their condition.\nThirty-one inpatients of a German psychotherapeutic hospital suffering from a major depressive disorder (age M = 45.3, SD = 17.2; 58.1% women) participated. Patients filled in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). CGI-S and CGI-I were rated from three perspectives: the treating therapist (THER), the team of therapists involved in the patient's treatment (TEAM), and the patient (PAT). BDI and CGI-S were filled in at admission and discharge, CGI-I at discharge only. Data was analysed using effect sizes, Spearman's \u03c1 and intra-class correlations (ICC).\nEffect sizes between CGI-I and CGI-S (dif) ratings were large for all three perspectives with substantially higher change scores on CGI-I than on CGI-S (dif). BDI (dif) correlated moderately with PAT ratings, but did not correlate significantly with TEAM or THER ratings. Congruence between CGI-ratings from the three perspectives was low for CGI-S (dif) (ICC = .37; Confidence Interval [CI] .15 to .59; F(30,60) = 2.77, p < .001; mean \u03c1 = 0.36) and moderate for CGI-I (ICC = .65 (CI .47 to .80; F(30,60) = 6.61, p < .001; mean \u03c1 = 0.59).\nResults do not suggest a definite recommendation for whether CGI-I or CGI-S (dif) should be used since no strong evidence for the validity of neither of them could be found. As congruence between CGI ratings from patients' and staff's perspective was not convincing it cannot be assumed that CGI THER or TEAM ratings fully represent the view of the patient on the severity of his impairment. Thus, we advocate for the incorporation of multiple self- and clinician-reported scales into the design of clinical trials in addition to CGI in order to gain further insight into CGI's relation to the patients' perspective."}, {"Title": "Serotonin transporter genotype modulates subgenual response to fearful faces using an incidental task.", "Abstract": "This study assessed the impact of serotonin transporter genotype (5-HTTLPR) on regional responses to emotional faces in the amygdala and subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC), while subjects performed a gender discrimination task. Although we found no evidence for greater amygdala reactivity or reduced amygdala-sgACC coupling in short variant 5-HTTLPR homozygotes (s/s), we observed an interaction between genotype and emotion in sgACC. Only long variant homozygotes (la/la) exhibited subgenual deactivation to fearful versus neutral faces, whereas the effect in s/s subjects was in the other direction. This absence of subgenual deactivation in s/s subjects parallels a recent finding in depressed subjects [Grimm, S., Boesiger, P., Beck, J., Schuepbach, D., Bermpohl, F., Walter, M., et al. Altered negative BOLD responses in the default-mode network during emotion processing in depressed subjects. Neuropsychopharmacology, 34, 932-943, 2009]. Taken together, the findings suggest that subgenual cingulate activity may play an important role in regulating the impact of aversive stimuli, potentially conferring greater resilience to the effects of aversive stimuli in la/la subjects. Using dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we explored the effects of genotype on effective connectivity and emotion-specific changes in coupling across a network of regions implicated in social processing. Viewing fearful faces enhanced bidirectional excitatory coupling between the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus, and increased the inhibitory influence of the amygdala over the sgACC, although this modulation of coupling did not differ between the genotype groups.

We hypothesized that because of psychiatry's lack of direct laboratory tests to distinguish dysfunction from normal-range distress, the context in which symptoms occur (eg, lack of imminent danger in a panic attack) is often essential to determining whether symptoms are caused by a dysfunction. If this is right, then the DSM diagnostic criteria should include many contextual criteria added to symptom syndromes to prevent dysfunction false positives. Despite their potential importance, such contextual criteria have not been previously reviewed. We, thus, systematically reviewed DSM categories to establish the extent of such uses of contextual criteria and created a typology of such uses.\nOf 111 sampled categories, 68 (61%) used context to prevent dysfunction false positives. Contextual criteria fell into 7 types: (1) exclusion of specific false-positive scenarios; (2) requiring that patients experience preconditions for normal responses (eg, requiring that individuals experience adequate sexual stimulation before being diagnosed with sexual dysfunctions); (3) requiring that symptoms be disproportionate relative to circumstances; (4) for childhood disorders, requiring that symptoms be developmentally inappropriate; (5) requiring that symptoms occur in multiple contexts; (6) requiring a substantial discrepancy between beliefs and reality; and (7) a residual category.\nMost DSM categories include contextual criteria to eliminate false-positive diagnoses and increase validity of descriptive criteria.

The concept of clinical effectiveness can lead to important insights into the treatment of depression and, by acting as an organizing concept for research, can help studies better focus on obtaining information necessary to improve clinical practice.\nThe limitations and strengths of efficacy and effectiveness studies in psychiatry are explored, and recent effectiveness studies in psychiatry are discussed, and their implications for re-examining treatment goals and remission.\nEfficacy studies are invaluable for the development of new drugs, but often lack generalizability. In contrast, effectiveness studies are broader in scope and offer the potential to assess quality of life and functional change. Studies that explore the clinical effectiveness of treatments for depression can identify important treatment gaps and suggest ways to address them. Although the efficacy of an antidepressant is important, other factors such as patient adherence, safety and tolerability, and the alignment of treatment outcomes with dimensions likely to be critical to patients (quality of life and functioning) also need to be examined.\nAntidepressant treatment, both in clinical practice and in research, should involve clinical considerations that go beyond efficacy data.

Moral psychology provides an explanation of how moral judgments are developed through processes of interaction. We will make use of the Social Intuitionist Model of Jonathan Haidt that emphasizes the role of emotions, intuitions and the social context in moral judgments and reasoning. We argue that this model can help to explain social dynamics in the context of enforced seclusion. In the discussion we explore how moral psychology can be complemented with the normative perspective of dialogical ethics to develop strategies for improving psychiatric practices.

In analogy, 5-HTT knockout rodents are highly responsive to early life, but also adult external stressors, albeit conflicting data have been obtained. In our study on emotion and cognition using homozygous 5-HTT knockout (5-HTT(-/-)) and wild-type (5-HTT(+/+)) rats we have been confronted with animal facility construction, which were associated with severe lifetime stress (noise and vibrations). To assess the impact of construction stress on well-established 5-HTT(-/-) rat phenotypes we conducted ad hoc analyses of 5-HTT(-/-) and 5-HTT(+/+) rats that grew up before and during the construction. The reproductive capacity of the parents of the experimental 5-HTT(+/-) rats was significantly decreased. Further, 5-HTT(-/-) anxiety-related phenotypes in the elevated plus maze and social interaction tests were abolished after construction noise exposure, due to increased anxiety in 5-HTT(+/+) rats and decreased anxiety in 5-HTT(-/-) rats (social interaction test only). In addition, reversal learning was improved in 5-HTT(+/+) and, to a milder extent, decreased in 5-HTT(-/-) rats. Finally, construction stress genotype-independently increased behavioural despair in the forced swim test. In conclusion, severe construction stress induces 5-HTT genotype-dependent 'for-better-and-for-worse' effects. These data importantly contribute to the understanding of 5-HTT gene x environment interactions and show the risk of losing genotype effects by construction stress."}, {"Title": "Diagnosis, psychiatry and neurology: the case of Huntington Disease.", "Abstract": "Although Huntington Disease (HD) is recognized as a neurological condition, it has a number of psychiatric effects, with recent studies suggesting that these effects can appear years prior to the telltale neurological symptoms.

Symptoms appear generally during early childhood and adolescence. The increasing need to clarify diagnostic queries in advanced age led to the constitution of specialised outpatient clinics for adults involving a growing amount of HFA/AS subjects diagnosed late in life. However, thus far neuropsychological data about this group are scarce.\nWe present a subgroup of 39 patients with HFA/AS (mean age at diagnosis 31.1 \u00b1 8.9 years) who were consecutively diagnosed at the autism outpatient clinic at the Department of Psychiatry at the University Hospital Cologne. Autistic symptoms (autism spectrum quotient; AQ), depressive symptoms (Beck depression inventory; BDI), general intelligence (HAWIE-R), social cognition (\"theory of mind\", ToM) and executive functioning (COWAT) were systematically studied in comparison to a control group matched for age, education, gender and intelligence (n = 39).\nHFA/AS subjects presented higher AQ scores (40.4 \u00b1 5.2) as opposed to the healthy controls (13.5 \u00b1 4.8). Neuropsychologically, patients showed deficits in social cognition, executive functions and in subtests of HAWIE-R related to verbal comprehension and perceptual organisation as opposed to the healthy control group.\nThe diagnosis of autistic disorders in adulthood basically relies on the clinical assessment of autistic core symptoms which were corroborated by high AQ values. The self-rating instrument AQ was found to be highly discriminative between the HFA/AS group and the healthy control group. The neuropsychological profile of adult HFA/AS patients diagnosed late in life is compatible with that of previously investigated HFA/AS populations.

Nowadays, a multiaxial assessment is used in diagnostic systems such as DSM-IV. However, these current concepts differ considerably from Essen-M\u00f6ller's suggestions. A return to the original approach of multiaxial diagnostic assessment comprising the axes \"syndromes\", \"course types\" and \"aetiology\" would be in line with current neurobiological findings and may provide a bridge between the traditional categorical diagnostic approach and dimensional models."}, {"Title": "[Neuropsychiatry of sexual desire].", "Abstract": "Inspired by the basic concepts of neuroscience, neuropsychiatry is a discipline at the interface between psychiatry, psychology, neurology and neuropathology.

Screening for both depression and anxiety is highly advisable in order to identify subjects who need psychiatric consultation and therapy. Screening tools for depression and anxiety range from informal questions to self-report instruments to structured interviews and the choice is up to the clinician and the setting of the clinical evaluation. Data on psychiatric disorders and medication overuse are till now not consistent. The treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in headache patients needs to take into account the possible drug interactions with headache therapies.

The study assessed the impact of research batteries on satisfaction with psychiatric care in suicidal adolescents and their parents.\nSuicidal adolescents presenting to the emergency department of a major urban pediatric hospital were divided into two groups, one receiving treatment as usual and the other exposed to psychometric testing of the type typically used in research protocols both before and after their treatment. Following treatment, the patients of both groups and their parents were given questionnaires to assess satisfaction with the services they had received. Differences between the two groups were analyzed.\nNo significant intergroup differences were found (p>0.05) in either patients or their parents regarding treatment received from the emergency-room team, regardless of whether they had been subjected to the psychometric testing.\nThere is no evidence in the study to support concerns that extensive psychometric testing of the type frequently encountered in research studies undermines patient satisfaction with the care they receive."}, {"Title": "Fuzzy logic: A \"simple\" solution for complexities in neurosciences?", "Abstract": "Fuzzy logic is a multi-valued logic which is similar to human thinking and interpretation. It has the potential of combining human heuristics into computer-assisted decision making, which is applicable to individual patients as it takes into account all the factors and complexities of individuals. Fuzzy logic has been applied in all disciplines of medicine in some form and recently its applicability in neurosciences has also gained momentum.\nThis review focuses on the use of this concept in various branches of neurosciences including basic neuroscience, neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and psychology.\nThe applicability of fuzzy logic is not limited to research related to neuroanatomy, imaging nerve fibers and understanding neurophysiology, but it is also a sensitive and specific tool for interpretation of EEGs, EMGs and MRIs and an effective controller device in intensive care units. It has been used for risk stratification of stroke, diagnosis of different psychiatric illnesses and even planning neurosurgical procedures.\nIn the future, fuzzy logic has the potential of becoming the basis of all clinical decision making and our understanding of neurosciences."}, {"Title": "The secrets of a successful clinical trial: compliance, compliance, and compliance.", "Abstract": "The high failure rate of drugs in clinical trials, especially in the later stages of development, is a significant contributor to the costs and time associated with bringing new molecular entities to market. These costs, estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion when capitalized over the ten to fifteen years required to develop a new chemical entity, are one of the principal drivers responsible for the ongoing retrenchment of the pharmaceutical industry. Therapeutic areas such as psychiatry, now deemed very high risk, have been widely downsized, if not abandoned entirely, by the pharmaceutical industry. The extent to which patient noncompliance has marred clinical research has in some cases been underestimated, and one step to improving the design of clinical trials may lie in better attempts to analyze patient compliance during drug testing and clinical development."}, {"Title": "Alternative methods for testing treatment effects on the basis of multiple outcomes: simulation and case study.", "Abstract": "In clinical trials multiple outcomes are often used to assess treatment interventions. This paper presents an evaluation of likelihood-based methods for jointly testing treatment effects in clinical trials with multiple continuous outcomes. Specifically, we compare the power of joint tests of treatment effects obtained from joint models for the multiple outcomes with univariate tests based on modeling the outcomes separately. We also consider the power and bias of tests when data are missing, a common feature of many trials, especially in psychiatry. Our results suggest that joint tests capitalize on the correlation of multiple outcomes and are more powerful than standard univariate methods, especially when outcomes are missing completely at random. When outcomes are missing at random, test procedures based on correctly specified joint models are unbiased, while standard univariate procedures are not. Results of a simulation study are reported, and the methods are illustrated in an example from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness for schizophrenia."}, {"Title": "[Developmental coordination disorder in a child with ADHD; is DCD a DSM-IV diagnosis that is not recognised by child psychiatry?].", "Abstract": "A five-year-old boy received treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

When treating a patient with ADHD, doctors should ask regularly about the patient's motor functioning and, if necessary, arrange a referral. In the first instance a young patient should be referred to a paediatric physiotherapist or, if the problems are complex, referral should be to a paediatric rehabilitation doctor.

Male doctors were disciplined for misconduct at four times the rate of their female colleagues (91 versus 22 cases per 100 000 doctor-years). Obstetrics and gynaecology and psychiatry were the specialties with the highest rates (224 and 178 cases per 100 000 doctor-years). The mean age of disciplined doctors did not differ from that of the general doctor population. The most common types of offences considered as the primary issue were sexual misconduct (24% of cases), illegal or unethical prescribing (21%) and inappropriate medical care (20%). In 78% of cases, the tribunal made no mention of any patient having experienced physical or mental harm as a result of the misconduct. Penalties were severe, with 43% of cases resulting in removal from practice and 37% in restrictions on practice.\nDisciplinary cases in Australia and New Zealand have features distinct from those studied internationally.

Some authors have proved how the Deficit and Attention/Hyperactivity Disorder may predispose to the development of other psychopathological attitude in adulthood. A recent study has underlined a common comorbidity between ADHD in childhood and Bipolar Disorder. The aim of the present was to verify the existence of an ADHD diagnosis in patients with depression (Unipolar and Bipolar) and to verify if such syndrome overstays in the present psychopathological picture. Moreover there has been even the intention to investigate on a difference in ADHD symptomatology in patients with Bipolar and Unipolar Depression.\nThe study has been conducted on a sample of 67 patients with depression diagnosis (35 patients with bipolar depression diagnosis, 32 patients with depression unipolar diagnosis) enrolled at the Bipolar Disorders Unit of the Clinical Psychiatry and Drug Dependence Institute of the Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli in Rome. The evaluation has been performed through the supply of the following psychometric tests: Neo Personality Inventory (Mole-pi-R), Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (Brown ADD-Scale), Adult ADHD Self-Report Staircases (ASRS-v1.1), Criteria of the Deficit and Attention / Hyperactivity Disorder for childhood according to the DSM-IV-Tr.\nThe achieved results point out that 42% of the sample has satisfied the ADHD Criterions during their childhood according to the DSM-IV-Tr and that symptomatology seems to remain in the present psychopathological picture. As to polarity of depression it has emerged that patients with Bipolar Depression diagnosis have satisfied with a greater frequency the ADHD criteria during their childhood than patients with Unipolar Depression.\nOur results seem to confirm the hypothesis that patients with bipolar depression diagnosis have more Deficit and Attention / Hyperactivity Disorders comorbidity diagnosis than others."}, {"Title": "Current research in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging in Italy: highlights of the 10th National Congress of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.", "Abstract": "The 10th National Congress of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (AIMN) took place in Rimini on March 18-21, 2011 under the chairmanship of Professor Stefano Fanti.

Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed with 8754 individuals (2062 alcohol-dependent cases) selected for informativeness for alcohol use disorder and associated quantitative traits. Family-based association tests were performed for alcohol dependence, dependence factor score, and heaviness of drinking factor score, with confirmatory case-population control comparisons using an unassessed population control series of 3393 Australians with genome-wide SNP data.\nNo findings reached genome-wide significance (p = 8.4 \u00d7 10(-8) for this study), with lowest p value for primary phenotypes of 1.2 \u00d7 10(-7). Convergent findings for quantitative consumption and diagnostic and quantitative dependence measures suggest possible roles for a transmembrane protein gene (TMEM108) and for ANKS1A. The major finding, however, was small effect sizes estimated for individual SNPs, suggesting that hundreds of genetic variants make modest contributions (1/4% of variance or less) to alcohol dependence risk.\nWe conclude that 1) meta-analyses of consumption data may contribute usefully to gene discovery; 2) translation of human alcoholism GWAS results to drug discovery or clinically useful prediction of risk will be challenging; and 3) through accumulation across studies, GWAS data may become valuable for improved genetic risk differentiation in research in biological psychiatry (e.g., prospective high-risk or resilience studies)."}, {"Title": "Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia II: developing imaging biomarkers to enhance treatment development for schizophrenia and related disorders.", "Abstract": "The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) initiative, funded by an R13 from the National Institute of Mental Health, seeks to enhance translational research in treatment development for impaired cognition in schizophrenia by developing tools from cognitive neuroscience into useful measures of treatment effects on behavior and brain function.

All necessary laboratory investigations should be done to rule out an underlying organic disorder. While clinical acumen of a trained movement disorder specialist may be sufficient to diagnose most PMD, there are clinical situations where electrophysiological tests are required either to rule out an organic movement disorder or even diagnose a PMD. Current electrophysiological test are most useful for tremor, followed by jerks and least for spasms or dystonia. Commonly used electrophysiologic tests include multichannel surface electromyography (EMG), accelerometry, electroencephalography time locked with EMG, premovement potential (Bereitschaftspotential), and somatosensory evoked potentials. Psychogenic tremor is a low frequency tremor with variable frequency and duration of EMG bursts, entrainable, has a high coherence with voluntary movements, and presence of coactivation sign. Patients with psychogenic jerks have well organized triphasic pattern of activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. The jerks are associated with EMG bursts of long duration (usually > 70 ms), long and variable latencies in stimulus induced jerks, absence of craniocaudal pattern of muscle recruitment in apparent startle response, and often a Breitschaftspotential (premovement potential) precedes the jerk. Electrophysiological characterization of psychogenic dystonia is difficult and the tests are usually performed to rule out organic dystonia with characteristic findings. Finally, caution should be exerted in interpreting the electrophysiological tests as both false positive and false negative diagnosis of PMD may still occur."}, {"Title": "[Men in a critical age: Kurt Mendel and the controversy over the male climacterium].", "Abstract": "Since the 1990s, with concepts like the male climacterium, andropause or PADAM, the idea of a\"change of life\" in men has gone through a spectacular reinvention. Recent research has focused upon the ways when, how and why these concepts emerged, thus taking cultural and historical approaches into account. This paper contributes to the growing corpus of such works. It sheds new light on the early decades of the twentieth century - a period that was decisive in establishing the modern, endocrinological understanding of the climacteric period as a result of hormonal deficiencies. Concurrently, this period saw several initiatives to conceptualize the male climacterium as a new and important diagnostic entity for health problems of men in their middle and later life. In Germany, the most important advocate was the Berlin neurologist Kurt Mendel, who published an influential article in 1910 entitled \"The Change of Life in Men (Climacterium virile)\". Mendel's concept evoked considerable interest and was much debated across medical disciplines, including neurology, psychiatry, sexology, endocrinology and urology. This article revisits and reassesses Mendel's concept of the male climacterium, discusses its specific status and significance, and places it within the historical context. Furthermore this, the paper argues that a historical approach is indispensable for a more nuanced understanding of the current arguments given to legitimize (or delegitimize) the status of a climacteric period in men."}, {"Title": "Has psychopharmacology got a future?", "Abstract": "Fifty years ago pharmacological discoveries transformed psychiatry but progress since then has been relatively slow and there is unease about the role of industry.

Our aim is to provide the reader with an updated lexicon on currently available biomarker candidates, how far they have come in development and how well they reflect pathogenic processes in different neurodegenerative diseases.

The present array of bladder-oriented treatments are marginally successful and for a long time patients were told that they would outgrow their symptoms. In this review, we look at the most recent findings in the urologic and psychiatric literature and try to piece together these two disparate fields and figure out how children who wet are best managed.\nIt became clear that children with attention deficit disorder were always more difficult to manage than those without neuropsychiatric problems. As the years have progressed and imaging technology has improved, we have begun to look into the active brain. This research has been conducted primarily in the fields of psychiatry and neuroscience, but there have been some seminal studies that point to a link between defects in the brain and functional urinary problems in children. In this review, we will attempt to outline the reasons why the traditional bowel program works and why there are such a large number of patients with neuropsychiatric problems who have functional urinary problems as children.\nUtilizing an approach that focuses on a treatment paradigm that is neurocentric instead of vesicocentric allows us to treat children who do not respond to the usual treatments and target the brain with centrally active medications such as tricyclics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Goa came under Portuguese rule in 1510 AD and remained under the Portuguese until 1961 when it became part of India. The Indian and Portuguese cultures interacted in Goa and led the Goans to create an interesting blend in which elements of both cultures were made to reconcile. The author reviews his experiences in this setting and describes how his family background, his search for roots, and his exposure to two religions, two languages, and two cultures fostered his decision to study medicine, his passion for transcultural psychiatry, and eventual pursuit of an academic career in this field in the United States. Research and reflections are presented on the impact of colonization, migration, and acculturation, and the importance of the construct of demoralization."}, {"Title": "The peripatetic cultural psychiatrist: reflections on a forty-five year longitudinal study of a South India village.", "Abstract": "This article presents one woman's odyssey, which began with a career in linguistics and later incorporated cultural psychiatry. While engaged in fieldwork as a linguist, studying the syntactic structure of Havyaka Kannada and dialectal accommodation among the castes in a South India village, I developed language skills and rapport with the village residents. Then I transferred my community-wide rapport to research on depression as a cultural psychiatrist. The articles I wrote on depression and its relationship to socialized passivity and endorsed assertiveness in progressive generations of South Indian women, illustrate the impact of change on mental health.

One of the satisfactions for the cultural psychiatrist is the opportunity to integrate lifelong interests that are not central to medical training, such as anthropology, philosophy, history or geography into one's daily work and career path, and this is not necessarily just applicable to clinical work or research. A background in social sciences can be very helpful in navigating the political and interpersonal challenges of working in an academic medical center or designing effective education programs across the career spectrum in medicine. This article traces the development of my career in academic cultural psychiatry and illustrates the way my clinical and academic interests were influenced both by early developmental and educational experiences and by positive career experiences as a clinician, teacher and researcher in the context of effective mentorship and professional peer relationships. The future of cultural psychiatry is exciting and its continued growth will be dependent on effective nurturance of young physicians who have a broad vision of the important place of cultural psychiatry and how it influences medicine, mental health, and society at large."}, {"Title": "Cultural psychiatry and epidemiology: researching the means, methods and meanings.", "Abstract": "This article describes my developing interest in cultural psychiatry.

These issues are intertwined in many ways and have broad implications for transcultural psychiatry. With increasing globalization, psychiatrists in many countries are likely to be treating patients who have migrated from different cultures and who may have been exposed to a variety of traumatic experiences that have a profound impact on their mental health. Of particular concern is the group of torture survivors and the elucidation of their symptom manifestations, as well as effective therapeutic interventions, which clearly show how human rights issues are linked to research and clinical psychiatry. The analyses of how different ethnic groups use psychiatric services, epitomize how important it is to pay attention to gender aspects in the interpretation of the findings and their therapeutic, as well as policy, implications."}, {"Title": "Psychiatric epidemiology and international mental health as a career in cultural psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology is one of the many paths to a career in cultural psychiatry.

In modern psychiatry, it is considered a culture-bound syndrome (CBS). This paper considers the formation and development of psychiatric conceptions of koro and related genital retraction syndromes from the 1890s to the present. It does so by examining the different explanations of koro based on shifting conceptions of mental illness, and considers the increased recognition of the role culture has to play in psychiatric concepts. Conceptions of culture (deriving from colonial psychiatry as well as from anthropology) actively shaped the ways in which psychiatrists conceptualized koro. Cases under consideration, additional to the first Dutch descriptions of koro, include the ways in which koro was identified in white western cases, and the 1967 Singaporean koro epidemic. Following a number of psychiatrists and psychologists who have addressed the same material, attention is also paid to the recent genital-theft panics in sub-Saharan Africa, considering the implications of the differences between koro and other genital-theft panics. Finally, the paper addresses the role played by koro in the development of the concept of CBSs, which was first presented in the DSM IV in 1994. This is explored against the backdrop of emerging ideas about culture and psychiatry from the late colonial period, especially in Africa, which are central to modern ideas about transcultural psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Reprint of: Psychosomatic medicine and consultation-liaison psychiatry: scope of practice, processes, and competencies for psychiatrists working in the field of CL psychiatry or psychosomatics.

In psychiatry, they are classified mostly as Somatoform Disorders and are often associated with anxiety and depression. The literature suggests that, in some cases, MUS may be ascribed to Somatoform Disorders when, fact, they are \"organic\" syndromes that are misdiagnosed. In developing countries, with fewer resources, MUS may be more difficult to assess.\nWe undertook a retrospective chart review to examine the demographics, referral pathway, management and diagnostic outcome of subjects (n = 50) referred to psychiatry with MUS over an 18 month period.\nSubjects with MUS accounted for only 4.5% of the total number of files reviewed. In only 38% of cases did the final diagnosis in psychiatry concur with the referral diagnosis. In 28% of cases a new \"organic\" diagnosis was made and in 72% of cases a new psychiatric diagnosis was made. Subjects who were diagnosed with \"organic\" illness were seen fewer times prior to referral to psychiatry and were significantly older than other subjects.\nIn developing countries like SA, a significant number of patients with MUS may have underlying \"organic\" illness, and most may have psychiatric disorders. Patients with MUS, especially older patients, should be more extensively investigated. Psychiatric referral of these patients is very appropriate."}, {"Title": "Incidence of tardive dyskinesia with risperidone or olanzapine in the elderly: results from a 2-year, prospective study in antipsychotic-na\u00efve patients.", "Abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) rates with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are considered to be low relative to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), even in the particularly vulnerable elderly population. However, risk estimates are unavailable for patients na\u00efve to FGAs. Therefore, we aimed to determine the TD incidence in particularly vulnerable, antipsychotic-na\u00efve elderly patients treated with the SGA risperidone or olanzapine. The present work describes a prospective inception cohort study of antipsychotic-na\u00efve elderly patients aged \ue2f655 years identified at New York Metropolitan area in-patient and out-patient geriatric psychiatry facilities and nursing homes at the time of risperidone or olanzapine initiation. At baseline, 4 weeks, and at quarterly periods, patients underwent assessments of medical and medication history, abnormal involuntary movements, and extra-pyramidal signs. TD was classified using Schooler-Kane criteria. Included in the analyses were 207 subjects (age: 79.8 years, 70.0% female, 86.5% White), predominantly diagnosed with dementia (58.9%) or a major mood disorder (30.9%), although the principal treatment target was psychosis (78.7%), with (59.4%) or without (19.3%) agitation. With risperidone (n=159) the cumulative TD rate was 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 9.9%) after 1 year (mean dose: 1.0\u00b10.76\u2009mg/day) and 7.2% (CI: 1.4, 12.9%) after 2 years. With olanzapine (n=48) the cumulative TD rate was 6.7% (CI: 0, 15.6%) after 1 year (mean dose: 4.3\u00b11.9\u2009mg/day) and 11.1% (CI: 0, 23.1%) after 2 years. TD risk was higher in females, African Americans, and patients without past antidepressant treatment or with FGA co-treatment.

The aims of our study are (a) to characterize the role of NtBNP as a biological marker in the setting of alcoholism; (b) to describe potential gender differences with respect to NtBNP; (c) to correlate NtBNP with other clinical and haemodynamic variables.\nWe examined 83 alcohol-dependent patients according to International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; 59 males and 24 females, age: 50 \u00b1 10.5 years) referred to the department of psychiatry for alcohol withdrawal therapy. In these patients, we determined NtBNP, markers of alcohol abuse and transthoracic echocardiography to determine systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). These measurements were repeated after alcohol withdrawal.\nAt Day 1 of alcohol withdrawal, 43 patients (52%; 27 males and 16 females) had elevated NtBNP levels (394.4 \u00b1 438.7 pg/ml) despite normal EF (64.7 \u00b1 6.2%). After withdrawal therapy (16.6 \u00b1 7.8 days), NtBNP decreased significantly (228.6 \u00b1 251.2 pg/ml; P < 0.01), despite unchanged EF (65.0 \u00b1 5.8%; P = ns). This was the case in both males and females (328.9 \u00b1 235.5 to 216.7 \u00b1 194.3 pg/ml; P < 0.05 vs. 492.7 \u00b1 635.7 to 246.6 \u00b1 327.7 pg/ml; P < 0.05). Elevated NtBNP levels were related significantly to the history of arterial hypertension (P < 0.05).\nThis study highlights the fact that NtBNP can be elevated in the setting of alcoholism. The elevation in NtBNP is unrelated to EF and is reversible after alcohol withdrawal.

Scholars, researchers, and practitioners largely disagree about the conceptualization of placebos. While different professionals often confound the meanings of placebo effects with placebo responses, physicians continue to prescribe placebos as part of clinical practice. Our study aims to review attitudes and beliefs concerning placebos outside of clinical research. Herein we compare patterns of placebo use reported by academic psychiatrists with those reported by physicians from different specialties across Canadian medical schools. Using a web-based tool, we circulated an online survey to all 17 Canadian medical schools, with a special emphasis on psychiatry departments therein and in university-affiliated teaching hospitals. A variation on earlier efforts, our 5-minute, 21-question survey was anonymous. Among the 606 respondents who completed our online survey, 257 were psychiatrists. Our analysis revealed that psychiatrists prescribed significantly more subtherapeutic doses of medication than physicians in other specialties, although about 20% of both psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrists prescribed placebos regularly as part of routine clinical practice. However, compared with 6% of nonpsychiatrists, only 2% of psychiatrists deemed placebos of no clinical benefit. In addition, more than 60% of psychiatrists either agreed or strongly agreed that placebos had therapeutic effects relative to fewer than 45% of other practitioners. Findings from this pan-Canadian survey suggest that, compared with other physicians, psychiatrists seem to better value the influence placebos wield on the mind and body and maintain more favourable beliefs and attitudes toward placebo phenomena."}, {"Title": "A brief history of placebos and clinical trials in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The history of placebos in psychiatry can be understood only in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Placebo treatments are as old as medicine itself, and are particularly effective in dealing with psychosomatic symptoms. In psychiatry, placebos have mainly been featured in clinical drug trials. The earliest controlled trial in psychiatry (not involving drugs) occurred in 1922, followed by the first crossover studies during the 1930s. Meanwhile the concept of randomization was developed during the interwar years by British statistician Ronald A Fisher, and introduced in 3 trials of tuberculosis drugs between 1947 and 1951. These classic studies established the RCT as the gold standard in pharmaceutical trials, and its status was cemented during the mid-1950s. Nevertheless, while the placebo became established as a standard measure of drug action, placebo treatments became stigmatized as unethical. This is unfortunate, as they constitute one of the most powerful therapies in psychiatry. In recent years, moreover, the dogma of the placebo-controlled trial as the only acceptable data for drug licensing is also being increasingly discredited. This backlash has had 2 sources: one is the recognition that the US Food and Drug Administration has been too lax in permitting trials controlled with placebos alone, rather than also using an active agent as a test of comparative efficacy. In addition, there is evidence that in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry, the scientific integrity of RCTs themselves has been degraded into a marketing device. The once-powerful placebo is thus threatened with extinction."}, {"Title": "Reply to 'Civilizing the \"Barbarian\": a critical analysis of behaviour modification programmes in forensic psychiatry settings'.", "Abstract": "To consider ethical propositions relating to nursing in UK forensic settings.\nA previous paper considered behavioural programmes with a Canadian forensic population.\nSome literature and personal reflections are presented.\nWhilst some similarities with the nature of Canadian forensic settings are identified, the UK is developing its' own cognitive-behavioural tradition of working.\nThe skills necessary for working with forensic patients are a development of a wider mental health nursing and therapy skill-set.\nNurse managers within forensic services need to be clear about the values of their services and ensure that therapeutic approaches are consistent with these values.

We sought to identify the range of indications for which antipsychotic drugs are prescribed in people with ID and to audit clinical practice against the standards.\nData were collected from the clinical records of individuals with ID who were under the care of mental health services in the UK, and prescribed an antipsychotic drug.\nThe sample comprised 2319 patients from 39 clinical services. Twenty-seven per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of a psychotic illness (ICD-10 F20-29) and 27% an affective illness (ICD-10 F30-39). The proportion who did not have a psychiatric diagnosis ranged from 6% of those with borderline/mild ID to 21% of those with severe/profound ID. Overall, the most common indications for prescribing an antipsychotic drug were comorbid psychotic illness, anxiety and agitation, and a range of behavioural disturbances. The prevalence of use of antipsychotic drugs to manage challenging behaviour in the absence of concomitant mental illness increased with the severity of ID and accounted for almost half of prescriptions in those with severe/profound ID. Adherence to the audit standards related to documentation of clinical indications and review of efficacy was high. Side effect monitoring was less assiduous.\nIn clinical practice, most prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs in people with ID are consistent with the evidence base and the overall quality of prescribing practice, as measured against recognised standards, is good, although in some patients potentially remedial side effects may not be detected and treated."}, {"Title": "The Dutch complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) protocol: to ensure the safe and effective use of complementary and alternative medicine within Dutch mental health care.", "Abstract": "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is subject to heated debates and prejudices.

A number of factors make it particularly well suited for patients with psychosis. For example, patients living in remote or underserved areas can be seen by a specialist without need for travel. However, the hallmark symptoms of psychotic disorders might lead one to question the feasibility of videoconferencing with these patients. For example, does videoconferencing exacerbate delusions, such as paranoia or delusions of reference? Are acutely psychotic patients willing to be interviewed remotely by videoconferencing? To address these and other issues, we conducted an extensive review of Medline, PsychINFO, and the Telemedicine Information Exchange databases for literature on videoconferencing and psychosis. Findings generally indicated that assessment and treatment via videoconferencing is equivalent to in person and is tolerated and well accepted. There is little evidence that patients with psychosis have difficulty with videoconferencing or experience any exacerbation of symptoms; in fact, there is some evidence to suggest that the distance afforded can be a positive factor.

The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and the risk of suicidal behavior/ideation/suicide are markedly increased in patients with epilepsy (PWE). Though AEDs receive initial indications for the treatment of epilepsy, currently the majority of AEDs are used to treat pain and psychiatric disorders. Thus in selecting the appropriate AEDs for treatment of PWE, consideration should be given to which AEDs best treat the epileptic disorder and the psychiatric comorbidity. This review is an overview of 21 AEDs in which negative psychotropic properties, approved indications in psychiatry, off-label studied uses in psychiatry, and principal uses in psychiatry are presented with literature review. A total of 40 psychiatric uses have been identified. Of the 21 AEDs reviewed, only 5 have U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or European Medicines Agency psychiatric approval for limited uses; the majority of AEDs are used off-label. Many of these off-label uses are based on case reports, open-label studies, and poorly controlled or small-sample-size studies. In some instances, off-label use persists in the face of negative pivotal trials. Further placebo-controlled (augmentation and monotherapy) parallel-arm research with active comparators is required in the complex field of AED treatment of psychiatric disorders to minimize the treatment gap not only for PWE with psychiatric disorders, but also for psychiatric patients who would benefit from properly studied AEDs while minimizing adverse effects."}, {"Title": "Kraepelin's concept of manic-depressive insanity: one hundred years later.", "Abstract": "Kraepelin's work is frequently cited and repeatedly interpreted as groundwork for the categorical classification of mental disorders.

During study hours, each time a psychiatric consultation was requested, the emergency medicine (EM) and consulting psychiatry residents were asked to fill out similar short questionnaires concerning their diagnoses and disposition decisions after they consulted with their attending physicians. EM and psychiatry residents were blinded to the other's assessment of the patient. Residents were asked about their evaluation of patients regarding: 1) psychiatric assessments, 2) if the patients presented a danger to themselves or others or were gravely disabled, and 3) the need for emergency psychiatric hospitalization.\nA total of 408 resident physician pairs were enrolled in the study. Patients ranged in age from 5 to 92 years, with a median age of 31 years; 50% were female. The most common psychiatric assessments, as evaluated by either EPs, consulting psychiatrists, or both, were mood disorder (66%), suicidality (57%), drug/alcohol abuse (26%), and psychosis (25%). Seventy-three percent were admitted for acute psychiatric hospitalization. Agreement between EPs and psychiatrists was 67% for presence of mood disorder, 82% for suicidality, 82% for drug/alcohol abuse, 85% for psychosis, and 85% for grave disability. There was 67% agreement regarding patient eligibility for involuntary psychiatric hold.

Children with psychiatric problems are at risk for polyvictimization, and polyvictimized child psychiatric inpatients have been found to have particularly severe psychiatric symptoms. Cluster analysis was used to identify a polyvictimized subgroup (N = 22, 8%) among 295 outpatient admissions in 2007-2009 to a child psychiatry outpatient clinic, based on chart review of documented maltreatment, parental impairment (history of arrest, psychiatric illness, and substance use), and multiple out-of-home placements. Polyvictimization was associated with severe parent-reported externalizing problems and clinician-rated psychosocial impairment, independent of demographics and psychiatric diagnoses. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the only psychiatric diagnosis associated with polyvictimization. Polyvictimization merits further clinical and research assessment with child psychiatry outpatients.

The model was then used to obtain realistic target effect sizes in defined study characteristics.\nIn the face of a real difference or correlation in population, many depression researchers are less likely to give a valid result than simply tossing a coin.

The first views Descartes as the father of \"rational psychology\" a tradition that defines the soul as a thinking, unextended substance. The second account views Descartes as the father of materialism and the machine metaphor. The consensus is that Descartes' studies of optics and motor reflexes and his conception of the body-machine metaphor made early and important contributions to physiology and neuroscience but otherwise his impact was minimal. These predominately negative assessments of Descartes' contributions give a false impression of the role his philosophy played in the development of medicine and psychiatry in seventeenth-century France and beyond. I explore Descartes' influence in the little-known writings of a doctor from Toulouse, Fran\u00e7ois Bayle (1622-1709).

The dilemma of psychiatry lies in its double role - having both a therapeutic and a regulatory function. Violence against sick and disabled people conflicts with the ethical principles of helping professions. This, however, is where the danger lies: that the violent parts of psychiatric work - which in the opinion of experts cannot be entirely avoided - are repressed or seen as taboo and are therefore more difficult to control. Comparisons between EU countries of the nature, frequency and duration of coercive measures are difficult because of the heterogeneity of regulation and differences in established practice. Scientific examination of this issue seems to be insufficient. There are only a few studies on important issues such as how patients rate these measures.

On the basis of the evidence, the Task Force reached a consensus on practice recommendations, which are intended to be clinically and scientifically meaningful for physicians who treat adults with opioid dependence. The data used to develop these guidelines were extracted primarily from national treatment guidelines for opioid use disorders, as well as from meta-analyses, reviews, and publications of randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of pharmacological and other biological treatments for these disorders. Publications were identified by searching the MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Library. The literature was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for efficacy, which was categorized into one of six levels (A-F).\nThere is an excellent evidence base supporting the efficacy of methadone and buprenorphine or the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone for the treatment of opioid withdrawal, with clonidine and lofexidine as secondary or adjunctive medications. Opioid maintenance with methadone and buprenorphine is the best-studied and most effective treatment for opioid dependence, with heroin and naltrexone as second-line medications.\nThere is enough high quality data to formulate evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of opioid abuse and dependence.

The human microbiome serves as the interface between our genes and our history of environmental exposures; explorations of our microbiomes thus offer the possibility of providing new insights into our neurodevelopment and our behavioral phenotypes by affecting complex processes such as inter- and intra personal variations in cognition, personality, mood, sleep, and eating behavior, and perhaps even a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases ranging from affective disorders to autism.

Three primary treatment paradigms exist. The first is the medical management of patients with psychiatric emergencies who also have physical illnesses. Physical complications may occur due to external injury, internal secretions, metabolic disease, and treatment for psychiatric emergencies. In such cases, patients require not only psychiatric treatment but also medical treatment for their physical symptoms or problems. The second pattern is the management of patients brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. In this case, the cause of the physical complications is action derived from suicidal ideation, and somatic therapy is given priority. The third pattern is the often difficult management of physical illness in patients who suffer from chronic psychiatric illness. In a general hospital with no department of psychiatry, psychiatric patients with physical emergencies are often unable to obtain appropriate diagnosis and treatment. There is a greater need for general hospitals able to manage psychiatric emergencies and their physical complications during medical treatment."}, {"Title": "[Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) accompanied by symptoms of late catatonia: what to consider and how to treat].", "Abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has recently often been reported to exhibit various psychiatric symptoms.

We report two DLB patients with characteristic psychiatric symptoms: a depressive state and anxiety in the early stage, and auditory hallucination, delusion of guilt, and catatonia in the later stage. Pharmacotherapy was ineffective, but electroconvulsive therapy proved to have a marked effect. The clinical course represents the symptomatic concept of \"late catatonia,\" which Sommer first reported in 1910 and Kocha later reappraised. In Japan, this has been prevailing as a useful concept in the field of clinical geriatric psychiatry. We discuss what to consider and how to treat DLB patients including those with atypical courses and psychiatric symptoms. We consider and treated them as \"late catatonia\", with a favorable response to treatment. There is an important viewpoint which helps us understand the process. The viewpoint is to distinguish between \"genera\" and \"types\" of mental illnesses as inherited from classical psychopathology to modern psychiatry. DLB corresponds to \"genera\" and late catatonia to \"types.\" In treating DLB patients with atypical symptoms and courses, it appears clinically very important to think more about late catatonia, exhibiting characteristic symptoms.

However, all available research on this topic (to our knowledge) relies exclusively on parent and/or adolescent informant-reports, both of which are subject to various forms of rater bias. As the presence of significant shared environmental effects has often been attributed to rater bias in the past (Baker et al. Journal of Abnormal Psychology 16:219-235, 2007; Bartels et al.

The current study thus examined the origins of the relationship between parent-child conflict and adolescent acting-out behavior, as measured using both observer-ratings and various informant-reports. Participants included 1,199 adopted and non-adopted adolescents in 610 families from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS). Results indicated that parent-child conflict consistently predicts acting-out behavior in adopted adolescents, and moreover, that this association is equivalent to that in biologically-related adolescents. Most importantly, these findings did not vary across parent- and adolescent-reported or observer-ratings of parent-child conflict and acting-out behavior. Such findings argue strongly against rater bias as a primary explanation of shared environmental mediation of the association between parent-child conflict and adolescent antisocial behavior."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry: life events and social support in late life depression.", "Abstract": "To examine the association of life events and social support in the broadly defined category of depression in late life.\nNegative life events and lack of social support are associated with depression in the elderly.

Patients suffering from these disorders do not seek to obtain immediate secondary benefits, contrary to simulation. They send the physician a challenge, sometimes by means of self-mutilation, or exposure to a vital risk. Their objective is to raise the interest and the mobilization of the medical community. The patient will develop intense relationships with the medical staff, technically mobilized as well as emotionally, as far as the factitious character of the disorder is uncovered. In some cases, factious disorders are conditions in which a person acts as if he or she has a psychiatric disorder, by deliberately exhibiting psychiatric symptoms. Most often described are factitious acute psychotic disorders, mourning, affective disorders and post-traumatic stress disorders. Psychiatric factitious disorders are difficult to diagnose, but they share common diagnosis criteria with other pathomimias. These subjects may suffer from pathomimia because of the occurrence of other psychiatric symptoms, such as pathological personalities, adaptation disorders, abuse and/or dependence on alcohol or other substances, or depressive disorders. This paper describes three clinical cases of pathomimia, diagnosed after hospitalization in a psychiatric unit for depressive symptoms, as a correlate to their factitious or authentic character.\nThree case reports, describing patients with pathomimia hospitalized in a department of psychiatry for depressive disorders.\nThe first case was a 57 year-old man considered as suffering from a bipolar disorder hospitalized for a depressive syndrome. The symptoms described and reported are those of a factitious disorder. The patient interrupted the medical care by asking to be discharged from the hospital. The second case was a young woman hospitalized following a suicide attempt. She has a history of multiple somatic and psychiatric factitious disorders. On admission she had depressive symptoms, more likely linked with a pathological personality, rather than with a major depressive episode. The third case presented a Munchausen syndrome. He was hospitalized for depressive symptoms. He had a comorbid major depressive episode. The prescription of antidepressants led to a significant clinical improvement.\nThese three cases indicate that a real depressive syndrome may be observed with a patient suffering from pathomimia.

Concerning the presentation as an emergency, 70 % of patients reported a subjective clinical deterioration but only 44 % were regarded as an urgent need in the responsible physician's point of view (Cohen's kappa 0.39). Our findings show that patients presenting as \"psychiatric emergency cases\" without appointment mainly suffer from depression, adjustment disorders and panic disorders. Furthermore, the layperson's point of view of clinical deterioration justifying an emergency presentation differs from physician's evaluation.

Surveys of prescribing in psychiatric services internationally have identified the relatively frequent and consistent use of combined antipsychotics, usually for people with established schizophrenia, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some clinical settings. A common reason for prescribing more than one antipsychotic is to gain a greater or more rapid therapeutic response than has been achieved with antipsychotic monotherapy. However, the evidence on the risks and benefits for such a strategy is equivocal, and not generally considered adequate to warrant a recommendation for its use in routine clinical practice in psychiatry. Combined antipsychotics are a major contributor to high-dose prescribing, associated with an increased adverse effect burden, and of limited value in helping to establish the optimum maintenance regimen for a patient. The relatively widespread use of antipsychotic polypharmacy identified in cross-sectional surveys reflects not only the addition of a second antipsychotic to boost therapeutic response, but also the use of as-required antipsychotic medication (mainly to treat disturbed behaviour), gradual cross-titration while switching from one antipsychotic to another, and augmentation of clozapine with a second antipsychotic where the illness has failed to respond adequately to an optimized trial of clozapine. This review addresses the clinical trial data and other evidence for each of these pharmacological approaches. Also reviewed are examples of systematic, practice-based interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy, most of which have met with only modest success. Guidelines generally agree that if combined antipsychotics are prescribed to treat refractory psychotic illness, this should be after other, evidence-based, pharmacological treatments such as clozapine have been exhausted. Further, their prescription for each patient should be in the context of an individual trial, with monitoring of the clinical response and adverse effects, and appropriate physical health monitoring."}, {"Title": "Stimulant use under a prison treatment protocol for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.", "Abstract": "Although stimulant medications are the mainstay of effective intervention for attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), their use presents a daunting scenario for psychiatry, nursing, and custody staff in correctional settings, where reported prevalence rates range from 9% to 45%.

Under a monitored protocol that required documentation of history, diagnosis, lack of response to nonstimulant treatment, and significant functional impairment, less than 1% of male inmates in the Massachusetts state prison system met criteria for treatment with stimulants. Although this protocol did not attempt to determine overall ADHD prevalence rates, the relatively low number of inmates with compelling reasons for stimulant treatment may provide a more realistic idea of the likely consequences of allowing access to this intervention."}, {"Title": "One year outcomes of a mentoring scheme for female academics: a pilot study at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London.", "Abstract": "The professional development of under-represented faculty may be enhanced by mentorship, but we understand very little about the mechanisms by which mentoring brings about change.

Online surveys were conducted to compare health-related and attitudinal measures and expectations of mentoring at baseline with outcomes at 6 months and 1 year using paired t-tests and McNemar's test for matched cohort data.\nN = 46 mentoring pairs, 44 (96%) mentees completed the pre-mentoring survey, 37 (80%) at 6 months and 30 (65%) at 1 year. Job-related well-being (anxiety-contentment), self-esteem and self-efficacy all improved significantly and work-family conflict diminished at 1 year. Highest expectations were career progression (39; 89%), increased confidence (38; 87%), development of networking skills (33; 75%), better time-management (29; 66%) and better work-life balance (28; 64%). For mentees, expectations at baseline were higher than perceived achievements at 6 months or 1 year follow-up. For mentors (N = 39), 36 (92%) completed the pre-mentoring survey, 32 (82%) at 6 months and 28 (72%) at 1 year. Mentors' highest expectations were of satisfaction in seeing people progress (26; 69%), seeing junior staff develop and grow (19; 53%), helping solve problems (18; 50%), helping women advance their careers (18; 50%) and helping remove career obstacles (13; 36%). Overall, gains at 6 months and 1 year exceeded pre-mentoring expectations.\nThis uncontrolled pilot study suggests that mentoring can improve aspects of job-related well-being, self-esteem and self-efficacy over 6 months, with further improvements seen after 1 year for female academics. Work-family conflict can also diminish. Despite these gains, mentees' prior expectations were shown to be unrealistically high, but mentors' expectations were exceeded."}, {"Title": "Mysteries of nature.", "Abstract": "This article examines a group photograph of the Psychiatry and Neurology section of the 66th Meeting of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Doctors in Vienna, 24-30 September 1894 which Sigmund Freud attended. The society's origins in Naturphilosophie are indicated and a number of the participants are identified on the photo. They and the events at the conference are related to Sigmund Freud's work at the time and to his gradual abandonment of anatomy and of heredity and degeneration as significant aetiological factors in the neuroses. Philosophical problems, such as how phenomena should be described and how 'nature' is conceptualized, are also considered in the light of their implications for Freud's life and thought at that period."}, {"Title": "Treatment of conversion disorder in the 21st century: have we moved beyond the couch?", "Abstract": "Conversion disorder (CD) is classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for psychiatry as a subtype of Somatoform Disorders. CD patients present with a wide range of neurologic signs and symptoms and are typically referred to psychiatry after investigations fail to yield a medical or neurologic diagnosis that can adequately explain their disability. The cause of CD is unknown and the underlying brain mechanisms remain uncertain. Controlled studies of the treatment of CD are rare, and almost all information about the effectiveness of particular interventions is descriptive and anecdotal. Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common and require attention. An initial treatment hurdle involves overcoming patients' anger about being given a psychiatric diagnosis when they consider the problem to be entirely physical. Physicians, too, are often uneasy about the diagnosis, doubting the unconscious etiology of the disorder and confusing it with malingering. They are also concerned that a \"real\" (i.e., medical or neurologic) diagnosis has been missed, and this concern can negatively affect the success of psychiatric treatment interventions. Psychotherapy, either psychodynamic or cognitive-behavioral, continues to be the mainstay of treatment. Key elements of successful treatment include (1) open-mindedness on the part of the physician, with willingness to reconsider the diagnosis if recovery does not occur as expected with psychiatric intervention; (2) patient education about mind-body interplay, using common examples such as the worsening of tremor with anxiety or impaired athletic performance when confidence has been undermined; (3) involvement of allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech pathologists, when appropriate; (4) hospitalization, if the patient is severely disabled or lives in a situation that supports disability or sabotages recovery; (5) attention to the presence of comorbid medical, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions that may have been overlooked or neglected when the diagnosis of CD was made, or which develop during the course of treatment."}, {"Title": "Setting up a Death Row Psychiatry Program.", "Abstract": "Death row psychiatry contains a complex set of clinical, ethical, and legal questions.

The purpose of this pilot investigation was to determine whether differences in nonpsychiatric inpatient hospitalization frequency, duration, and costs existed between patients receiving outpatient psychiatric treatment and patients without identified psychiatric problems. Length of stay and cost information for patients that had at least 1 inpatient medical/surgical hospitalization during a 6-month period was extracted from the hospital's inpatient billing database (n = 10,865). The medical record numbers of these patients were then cross-referenced against the outpatient psychiatry-billing database for the same 6-month period, thereby identifying all patients that had both a nonpsychiatric inpatient hospitalization and an outpatient psychiatry visit (n = 149). Patients identified as having outpatient psychiatry involvement had significantly more nonpsychiatric hospitalizations on average (mean = 1.60) than nonpsychiatric patients (mean = 1.34) during the study period (t4381 = 2.94, P = .003). There was no difference in the total costs associated with these hospitalizations between the 2 groups. Those that had a psychiatry consult during the nonpsychiatric hospitalization had a significantly higher length of stay and costs than those without. Thus, the criteria used to determine whether or not a psychiatry consultation is triggered, and the timing of the consultation request need further study."}, {"Title": "The DSM-5 dimensional model of personality disorder: rationale and empirical support.", "Abstract": "Ideally, a dimensional model of normal and abnormal personality functioning within the forthcoming DSM-5 would represent a common ground among the existing alternative models and would be consistent with the substantial body of empirical research that has accumulated on such models. The DSM-5 Work Group had the opportunity to make an historic step toward the integration of the normal personality traits researched within psychology with the personality disorders of psychiatry.

Advocates of these treatments, often grouped together under the term 'physical therapies', expressed relief that the social problems encountered by patients could now be interpreted as symptomatic of underlying biological malfunction rather than as a cause of disorder that required treatment. Drawing on the British Journal of Psychiatric Social Work, this article analyses the critique articulated by psychiatric social workers based within hospitals who sought to facilitate the social reintegration of patients following treatment. It explores the development of 'psychiatric social treatment', an approach devised by psychiatric social workers to meet the needs of people with enduring mental health problems in hospital and community settings that sought to alleviate distress and improve social functioning by changing an individual's social environment and interpersonal relationships. 'Physical' and 'social' models of psychiatric treatment, this article argues, contested not only the aetiology of mental illness but also the nature of care, treatment and cure."}, {"Title": "The narrative in neurology and psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The narrative has a long tradition in psychiatry and neurology. Its functions have evolved more recently from classical description and clinical education to healing and remediation, and there has been an explosion of literature on narratives by sufferers of individuals with brain disorders.\nThe narrative has many functions in neurology, psychiatry and neuropsychiatry. These disciplines began due to powerful clinical narratives, and the clinical description continues to draw upon the power of the patients' stories. The narrative has also emerged as an important tool to educate the public about brain disorders and normal brain function. It is increasingly being used by individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders to narrate their biographies, and healing remains an attempt to reconstruct broken narratives, both by physicians and by patients themselves. If the 20th century saw a psychologization of society, the neurological narrative now appears to be taking centre-stage.\nThe narrative has had a powerful presence in the history of neurology and psychiatry and continues to shape the disciplines as we witness an increasing neurologization of society."}, {"Title": "Law & psychiatry: SSRIs, suicide, and liability for failure to warn of medication risks.", "Abstract": "When can pharmaceutical companies be held liable for failure to disclose medication risks--such as the link between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and suicidality of young people?

In this article two fictional characters, Dr. Strong and Mr. Micawber, debate the use of such computational models (CMs) in psychiatry. We present four fundamental challenges to the use of CMs in psychiatry: (a) the applicability of mathematical approaches to core concepts in psychiatry such as subjective experiences, conflict and suffering; (b) whether psychiatry is mature enough to allow informative modelling; (c) whether theoretical techniques are powerful enough to approach psychiatric problems; and (d) the issue of communicating clinical concepts to theoreticians and vice versa. We argue that CMs have yet to influence psychiatric practice, but that they help psychiatric research in two fundamental ways: (a) to build better theories integrating psychiatry with neuroscience; and (b) to enforce explicit, global and efficient testing of hypotheses through more powerful analytical methods. CMs allow the complexity of a hypothesis to be rigorously weighed against the complexity of the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the path ahead. It points to stumbling blocks, like the poor communication between theoretical and medical communities. But it also identifies areas in which the contributions of CMs will likely be pivotal, like an understanding of social influences in psychiatry, and of the co-morbidity structure of psychiatric diseases."}, {"Title": "Relationship between genetic variation in the glutaminase gene GLS1 and brain glutamine/glutamate ratio measured in vivo.", "Abstract": "Abnormalities in glutamatergic neurotransmission are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, but in vivo neurochemical studies of the glutamate (Glu) system have been hampered by a lack of adequate probes. By contrast, glutamine (Gln) and Glu can be quantified separately in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies in vivo. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Gln/Glu ratio is a putative index of glutamatergic neurotransmission but interpretation of changes in the Gln/Glu ratio depends on the conditions of the system, including ammonia levels.\nHere, we explored whether variation in GLS1 (the gene encoding the brain isoform of glutaminase, which catalyzes Gln-to-Glu conversion) is associated with Gln/Glu measured in vivo in two brain regions (anterior cingulate cortex, parieto-occipital cortex).\nA specific haplotype of four single nucleotide polymorphisms within GLS1 was significantly associated with Gln/Glu in the parieto-occipital cortex in an magnetic resonance spectroscopy-genetics dataset optimized for Gln/Glu detection (n = 42). This finding was replicated in a second magnetic resonance spectroscopy dataset that was optimized for \u03b3-aminobutyric acid detection where Gln and Glu measurements could still be extracted (n = 40).\nThese findings suggest that genetic variation in a key component of glutamatergic machinery is associated with a putative in vivo index of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Thus, GLS1 genotype might provide insight into normal brain function and into the pathophysiology of many psychiatric conditions where glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated. It might also serve as a biomarker for predicting response to existing and novel therapeutic interventions in psychiatry that target glutamatergic neurotransmission."}, {"Title": "Food as medicine in psychiatric care: which profession should be responsible for imparting knowledge and use of omega-3 fatty acids in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "The effect of omega-3 fatty acids on depression is well documented.

This is a pilot study with a qualitative design using questionnaires and interviews among nursing students, tutor nurses and psychiatrists. Three main categories emerged: 1. Nutrition is considered important but few evaluations are made. 2. There was a lack of knowledge of the effects of Omega 3. 3. There was an unclear division of responsibility among health personnel. A change in knowledge paradigms and clarification of responsibility is called for if food-as-medicine is to take its true place in psychiatric care.

Guze in 1970. For more than 2 decades, psychiatrists using neuroimaging have aspired to provide one form of \"laboratory study\" that Robins and Guze said would have to be in place for a psychiatric diagnosis to be valid: researchers have sought \"neural signatures\" of psychiatric disorders. Our objective was to examine the feasibility of this endeavor. To this end, we examine whether current psychiatric nosology as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) lends itself to the identification of neural signatures for psychiatric diagnoses. Because neuroimaging largely is used only to detect average activation or structural differences between groups of individuals with the same diagnosis and groups of individuals with no diagnosis, it is unlikely that it will be possible to use neuroimaging technologies to determine which psychiatric diagnosis a given individual warrants. In addition, the heterogeneity of psychiatric disorder categories as defined in the DSM reveals that these diagnoses do not reflect neurologically discrete phenomena. Finally, neural correlates of psychopathology generally are not unique to specific diagnoses. Although it is unrealistic to hope that neuroimaging will be used to make psychiatric diagnoses as they are currently conceived, neuroimaging is already being used to make headway in 2 other arenas of psychiatric investigation that we briefly review."}, {"Title": "Quality of education at multidisciplinary case conferences in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "A large Dublin-based teaching hospital facilitates a weekly Psychiatric Case Presentation meeting, which is relatively unique in medicine and even in psychiatry, in that there is a large variety of attendees from various multidisciplinary groups: consultant psychiatrists, psychiatric trainees, nurses, psychologists and psychoanalytic psychotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and pastoral care staff. The aim of this audit is to assess the quality of education for members of different disciplines at these meetings, and to highlight the differing learning needs of the attendees.\nGroup-structured assessments and Likert scale questionnaires were used to identify what attendees thought were educational and what needed to be improved.\nOverall, the case conference is educationally worthwhile but there were several areas of dissatisfaction. Some felt that the case conference was overly medical in its orientation and that there was excessive medical jargon. The seating arrangements were not conducive to group discussion. Consultants and psychiatric trainees felt that the quality of the clinical presentations could be improved. Presentation skills teaching classes and topic-based classes would be useful inclusions. Feedback to the multidisciplinary group on the patients' progress and feedback to the patient is important.

There is paucity of such data in the Indian context. We deemed it worthwhile to assess the suspected ADR profile of psychotropic drugs in an ambulatory setting in a public teaching hospital in Kolkata.\nA longitudinal observational study was conducted in the outpatient department (OPD) of the concerned psychiatry unit. Twenty consecutive patients per day, irrespective of their psychiatric diagnosis, were screened for suspected ADRs, 2 days in a week, over 15 months. Adverse event history, medication history and other relevant details were captured in a format as adopted in the Indian National Pharmacovigilance Programme. Causality was assessed by criteria of World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Center (WHO-UPC).\nWe screened 2000 patients (68.69% males, median age 34.4 years), of whom 429 were suspected of having at least one ADR; 84 cases had insufficient evidence about causality (WHO-UMC causality status \"unlikely\") and were excluded from further analysis. Thus, 17.25% (95% confidence interval: 15.59-18.91%) of our study population reported ADRs with at least \"possible\" causality. Of 352 events recorded, 327 (92.90%) were \"probable\" and the rest \"possible\". None was labeled \"certain\" as rechallenge was not performed. Patients received a median of 3.2 psychotropic drugs each. Thirty-three different kinds of ADRs were noted, including tremor (19.60%), weight gain (15.34%) and constipation (14.49%). Among the incriminated drugs, antipsychotics represented the majority (57.10%), with olanzapine topping the list.\nThis study offers a representative profile of ADRs to be expected in psychiatry out-patients in an Indian public hospital.

One of the qualitative arms consisted of in-depth interviews with general practitioners (GPs) with high caseloads of gay men. The approach to discourse analysis was informed by Halliday's systemic functional linguistics. GPs constructed three discourses of depression: engaging with psychiatric discourse, engaging with the patient's world, and engaging with social structures. When GPs drew on the discourse of psychiatry, this discourse was positioned as only one possible construction of depression. This discourse was also contextualized in the social lives of gay men, and it was explicitly challenged and rejected. Engaging with their patients' social world was considered vital for recognizing depression in gay men. Finally, the GPs' construction of depression was inextricably linked to social disadvantage and marginalization. Depression is highly heterogeneous and constructed in terms of social relationships rather than as an independent entity that resides in the individual. There is a synergy between GPs' constructions of depression and men's experiences of depression, which differs from conventional medical views, and which enables GPs to be highly effective in dealing with the mental health issues of their gay patients."}, {"Title": "Neuroendocrinological aspects of epilepsy: important issues and trends in future research.", "Abstract": "Neuroendocrine research in epilepsy focuses on the interface among neurology, endocrinology, gynecology/andrology and psychiatry as it pertains to epilepsy. There are clinically important reciprocal interactions between hormones and the brain such that neuroactive hormones can modulate neuronal excitability and seizure occurrence while epileptiform discharges can disrupt hormonal secretion and promote the development of reproductive disorders. An understanding of these interactions and their mechanisms is important to the comprehensive management of individuals with epilepsy. The interactions are relevant not only to the management of seizure disorder but also epilepsy comorbidities such as reproductive dysfunction, hyposexuality and emotional disorders. This review focuses on some of the established biological underpinnings of the relationship and their clinical relevance. It identifies gaps in our knowledge and areas of promising research. The research has led to ongoing clinical trials to develop hormonal therapies for the treatment of epilepsy. The review also focuses on complications of epilepsy treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Although antiepileptic drugs have been the mainstay of epilepsy treatment, they can also have some adverse effects on sexual and reproductive function as well as bone density. As longevity increases, the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis becomes an increasingly more important topic, especially for individuals with epilepsy.

The aim is to deliver an accessible, responsive, cost-effective, rolled-out service. Consultant gastroenterologists, a specialist liaison psychiatrist, psychiatric alcohol liaison nurse, gastroenterology-based liver nurse practitioner and ward nurses provide joint inpatient and outpatient care for people with alcohol misuse, especially alcohol-related liver disease. A ward based, consultant-led, multidisciplinary team, with a dedicated social worker, meets daily to discuss all inpatients, unify treatment and facilitate discharges. On Monday-Friday, the two alcohol specialist nurses assess, triage and give brief advice to all alcohol-related medical admissions, liaise with consultants about admission or arrange outpatient appointments with the community alcohol team. This has reduced the average length of stay from 8.0 days to 5.7 days, saving the Trust more than 1000 bed days annually.

Four obstacles for a rational evidence-based psychiatry were recognised. First, current classification systems are scientifically nonfalsifiable. Second, cerebral processes are-at least to some extent-nondeterministic, i.e. they are random, stochastic and/or chaotic. Third, the vague or lack of relationship between therapeutic regimens and suspected pathogenesis. Fourth, the inadequacy of tools to diagnose and delineate a functional disorder. We suggest a strategy to identify diagnostic prototypes that are characterised by a limited number of parameters (symptoms, markers and other characteristics).

Drawing on Bradley's published articles on his experiments, this paper explores the historical context of his experiments and the effect this background had on the emerging field of child psychiatry. Bradley's studies went largely ignored in the field of child psychiatry for nearly 25 years.

The results of this survey suggest that NH administrators should worry less about the legal exposure of using antipsychotics and focus on actions that result in improved patient care."}, {"Title": "History of the Nordic psychiatric cooperation.", "Abstract": "The Nordic countries include Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden as well the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Svalbard and \u00c5land. The countries share much common history as well as common traits in their respective societies. As early as 1906, a Scandinavian Psychiatric Association was suggested. The first Nordic Psychiatric Congress was held in Copenhagen 1913. After the First World War, at the 6th Nordic Psychiatric Congress in Stockholm 1935, a Nordic Psychiatric Association was founded and it was decided that a Nordic Journal of Psychiatry should be founded. After the Second World War, at the 8th Nordic Psychiatric Congress in Copenhagen 1946, the Nordic Psychiatric Association was terminated. At this time, the most important task of the Association, to found a Nordic Journal of Psychiatry, had been achieved. After 1946, there has been a close cooperation between the Nordic countries but no common Nordic Psychiatric Association. Today, the Nordic Psychiatric Cooperation is active and ongoing. The 30th Nordic Psychiatric Congress is scheduled to be held in Troms\u00f6, in 2012. The Nordic Journal of Psychiatry is publishing its 64 th volume. The Journal is indexed in the important international databases and the impact factor is increasing. The Joint Committee of the Nordic psychiatric associations has established itself as the owner of the Journal and the organizer of the congresses. There are also a series of Nordic cooperations in a series of different fields, such as the Scandinavian Societies of Biological Psychiatry, the Scandinavian College of Neuropsychopharmacology (SCNP), the bi-annual Nordic Psychoanalytical Congresses, the Scandinavian Psychoanalytic Review, the Nordic Association of Psychiatric Epidemiology, NAPE, and so on."}, {"Title": "Contributions to the study of morphofunctional interrelations in the liver of the rats treated with certain antipsychotic drugs.", "Abstract": "The issue of antipsychotics in psychiatry constituted a revolution at the time.

Using more drugs at same time usually occurs where single drugs are considered insufficiently effective.\nThe sample consisted of 216 patients: 85 from Sarajevo, and 44 and 87 respectively from Mostar and Tuzla. All schizophrenic patients who were hospitalised in three University Centers of F/BiH (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Mostar) on a particular day are included in the study. This included patients of both sexes (131 (60.65%) males and 85 females (39.35%)), 20-60 ages, who were on antipsychotic treatment with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia by the treating psychiatrist. The research was performed in the year 2004. The census of patients was conducted simultaneously in all three Centers, using a questionnaire in which all routine prescribed antipsychotics were registered, as the common method of the administration, and the doses as well saving as data for other medications that were simultaneously prescribed to the patients that day.\nWithin the total sample the most frequently applied classical antipsychotics were haloperidol, promazine and from the group of new antipsychotics clozapine. The most frequently used other medications were biperidine and diazepam. The administration of all medication was followed through recording of individual doses, daily doses and frequency of administration. There are statistically significant differences regarding the frequency of biperidine use between the centers (p=0.008).\nIn three University Clinical Centers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo, Tuzla and Mostar), the applied rule is that more drugs in the treatment of schizophrenic psychosis and doing polypharmacy is the inevitable approach to treatment. The concept behind the polypharmacy is based on the fact that antipsychotic drugs do not cover all the symptoms of schizophrenic psychosis, and that additional medications may correct iatrogenic side effects caused by antipsychotic drugs. It is expected that the new atypical antipsychotics will treat much broader symptoms of psychosis and will not cause extrapyramidal side effects, as do the typical antipsychotics."}, {"Title": "[Munchausen syndrome, a factitious injury, presenting brain abscess and intraventricular hemorrhage: a case report].", "Abstract": "Munchausen syndrome is a factitious disorder. Patients sometimes inflict injury on themselves in order to assume a sick role. The authors report a patient with Munchausen syndrome suffered from brain abscess, reopened wound and intraventricular hemorrhage. A 64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital after head injury. CT and MR imaging revealed a mass with surrounding edema in the right frontal lobe. The mass was surgically removed, and diagnosed as brain abscess. During the surgery, the authors noticed a small bone defect in the frontal bone above the brain abscess; therefore, we considered that head injury just concerned this lesion. There were no particular clues leading to other possible pathologies. After the first surgery, the patient presented atypical seizures several times. Once we discharged him from our hospital, we hospitalized him again because the wound had reopened. A subsequent operation was needed, and we removed the bone flap which we considered the origin of the infection. After the second surgery, he stabbed a nail into his head where the bone had been removed due to the previous surgery, and presented intraventricular hemorrhage. The hemorrhage decreased in size through non-surgical treatment and he was referred to the psychiatry department under a diagnosis of Munchausen syndrome. Diagnosis of this entity is difficult and often made at the later stage of hospitalization, because patients present a variety of complaints and clinical symptoms, which are hardly proved factitious. Early consideration of this syndrome will offer an early and accurate diagnosis, and is mandatory for a good prognosis."}, {"Title": "[Personality disorders in the elderly].", "Abstract": "The diagnostic assessment of old age personality disorders is challenging.

Although impaired social relationships are core features of the psychiatric disorders found in pediatric epilepsy, few studies have examined social competence (i.e., social behavior, social adjustment, and social cognition) in these children. There also is a dearth of treatment studies on the frequent psychiatric comorbidities of pediatric epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression. Drs.

This is particularly true of compounds developed to treat CNS disorders. The use of pre-clinical models in CNS drug development is well established but these models often lack predictive validity and many compounds fail when they reach the target patient group. Bridging the gap between pre-clinical CNS models and patient studies, P1vital's objective is to develop human volunteer models that will enable rapid, accurate and reliable decision making about which compounds to progress into patient trials. The research strategy of P1vital and its academic research network is to focus on science that progresses the development of clinical efficacy models. As part of this strategy P1vital established a CNS Experimental Medicine Consortium with members from both academic research and the pharmaceutical industry. This consortium is unique in that experimental medicine models initially developed through academic research are selected for further validation in a process that is managed by the Pharma members of the P1vital CNS Experimental Medicine Consortium steering (PEM) committee.

It is concluded that a separate grouping of disorders with an onset specific to childhood should be deleted, the various specific disorders being placed in appropriate places, and the addition for all diagnoses of the ways in which manifestations vary by age. A new group should be formed of disorders that are known to occur but for which further testing for validity is needed. The overall number of diagnoses should be drastically reduced. Categorical and dimensional approaches to diagnosis should be combined. The requirement of impairment should be removed from all diagnoses.

Narratives of two residents who developed strong interest in psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalytic training are presented to illustrate the important influences on their identities as psychodynamically oriented psychiatrists. Results from a recent survey of U.S. residents regarding psychodynamic psychiatry indicate that they value psychodynamic psychotherapy, want to incorporate psychotherapy into their careers as psychiatrists, and strongly endorse personal psychotherapy but view their psychodynamic skills as weak. Recommendations about how to enhance education and interest include (1) building or strengthening relationships with mentors, supervisors, and teachers, (2) emphasizing the importance of psychodynamic understanding of patients whether or not the resident is functioning as a therapist, (3) using psychopharmacology to engage residents in thinking psychodynamically, (4) encouraging personal psychotherapy for residents and helping find ways to make it affordable, (5) utilizing awards, visiting scholars, specialized programs, and distance learning, especially for programs without adequate resources, and (6) encouraging clinicians to become familiar with the research base in psychodynamic psychotherapy to correct biases and misperceptions."}, {"Title": "Is that an unconscious fantasy or an automatic thought?

Much of it dates back to the community mental health movement 50 years ago. The emphasis at that time was on deinstitutionalization, prevention, least restrictive options for care, and transformation of large public hospitals into multiservice regional centers. The current focus, in contrast, is on economy, local control and accountability, emphasizing, for example, manualized behavioral health techniques, pharmacotherapy, and case management by allied professionals. Psychodynamic psychiatry, particularly a psychodynamic orientation is uniquely helpful in complex, community-based clinical situations. Applicable psychodynamics include unconscious mental processes, psychological defenses, emotional relationships, a developmental perspective, disciplined use of the self for healing, transference, and communications in all forms as material for therapy. Literature and case reports illustrate the approach taken. These include examples of active listening, interprofessional collaboration, clinical continuity, appropriate boundaries, and thoughtful timing. Psychodynamic applications in community settings have passed the test of time and because of their validity could again become prevalent.

Adults with ADHD frequently present with comorbid conditions (e.g., mood and substance use/abuse disorders) that may have a detrimental impact on neurocognitive function. Hence, we excluded patients with ADHD meeting criteria for comorbid psychiatric syndromes. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was administered to adults with ADHD attending a general psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, and healthy control participants. Adults with ADHD demonstrated performance deficits on tests of attention, information processing speed, and general and working memory. Patients with ADHD also reported a significantly greater number of symptoms associated with frontal lobe syndromes (i.e., dysexecutive symptoms and disinhibition). Patients with ADHD demonstrated rather striking deficits on tests of verbal and nonverbal memory. Once information was encoded, however, patients with ADHD do not demonstrate significant information loss. Patients with ADHD and healthy controls did not differ on tests of alternation learning, inhibitory control (error rates), and ToM skills. Findings support the contention that dorsal-prefrontal (rather than ventral-prefrontal) dysfunction is associated with adult ADHD. Unexpectedly, groups did not differ on executive control and fluency tasks. Yet patients with ADHD obtained substantially higher scores on a self-report measure of executive dysfunction. This suggests that dysexecutive symptoms among patients with ADHD in the current study do not reflect set-shifting or organizational deficits. Rather, symptoms may reflect attentional and working memory deficits as well as diminished information processing speed."}, {"Title": "A 6-week, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of placeboxetine hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive disorder in an Indian setting.", "Abstract": "This paper describes a fictitious study of a fictitious drug.

However, the former are much more commonly used despite their significantly higher cost and potential for contributing to the metabolic syndrome. To date, educational interventions have been unsuccessful in influencing this pattern. The Duke University Medical Center Department of Psy chiatry began a program based on principles of academic detailing designed to educate psychiatry residents about generic psychotropics. To encourage residents to gain experience with these medications, samples of selected generic drugs were provided. To assess the initiative's impact, the authors measured the prescribing patterns of residents.\nWe measured the amount of generic drug use 6 months after the program began and compared it with data from a 6-month control period. The data were analyzed based on overall psychotropic use, class of medication, site, and diagnosis.\nWe found a consistent increase in generic use across analyses. There was an increase in overall generic prescribing from 55.8% to 58.6% [X=10.37, odds ratio (OR)=1.12, P=0.0013] and a particularly large increase in prescribing of generic antipsychotic medications from 39.5% to 47.7% [X=36.12, OR=1.39, P<0.0001]. Conclusion. The implementation of this educational program was correlated with increasing use of generic medications and brought antipsychotic prescribing into concordance with the new evidence. This is the first such study in a psychiatry residency program and has implications for promoting cost-effective care while preserving patient choice in the mental health system.

Moreover, these methods have proven useful and provided hope in the therapy of other diseases, most of all in psychiatry. From a historic perspective, this new emphasis on somatic therapies in the case of transcranial magnetic stimulation and cranial electrotherapy stimulation represents the return of therapeutic methods widely used in the 19th century and based on very similar techniques. Against the background of a general rise in the importance of neurobiological concepts in the neurosciences, we are now in a new situation of change. Yet, as in the 1880s and 1990s, many epistemic questions remain unresolved, the methods not yet having been standardized. In particular, the inability to explain which way and precisely how electricity induces healing processes in the body continues to put the neurosciences, which have always regarded themselves as exact and scientific in nature, in a rather uncomfortable position. There was a similar situation in the 1880s and 1990s, when positivist scientific dogmas prevailed. For ideological and professional reasons, neurologists strongly rejected the notion pioneered by Leipzig neuropsychiatrist Paul Julius M\u00f6bius that curative effects of electrotherapy were based on suggestion. One should see, however, that M\u00f6bius's actual concern was not to raise opposition towards or question electrotherapy as such, but rather to sensitize his colleagues in view of the prevailing solely materialistic-somatic approach in order that they should not neglect the psychological component of all illness, both in clinical practice and in research. A singular and very special event illustrates the heated debate among German-speaking neurologists on the psychological/suggestive effects of electrotherapy in the last decade of the 19th century-namely the 'Frankfurt Council' of 1891. The statements made at the Frankfurt convention of 35 leading electrotherapists in opposition to M\u00f6bius's criticism very much resemble present-day arguments and attitudes. Yet neuroscientists of earlier generations also found very individual answers to fundamental questions in their field that might help both to understand problems from a long-term perspective and enrich present-day discussion as a beneficial corrective."}, {"Title": "Disability and hospital care expenses among national health insurance beneficiaries: analyses of population-based data in Taiwan.", "Abstract": "Nationwide data were collected concerning inpatient care use and medical expenditure of people with disabilities (N=937,944) among national health insurance beneficiaries in Taiwan.

There were 27.88% of persons with disabilities have been hospitalized for treatments during the year 2005 and it was 3.5 times of the general population (7.95%). The mean of annual inpatient care expenditure was 163,544.21 NTD, and male patients use more inpatient care cost than female patients in people with disabilities. However, the hospitalization rate in female patients is statistical higher than male patients in the study (p<0.001). Infectious and parasitic diseases, mental disorders, diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the circulatory system, injury and poisoning were the top five reasons for hospitalization among the subjects. Our study also found that psychiatry, internal medicine, orthopedic, surgery and neurosurgery are the top five clinical divisions which the cases used more frequently than other clinical departments in hospitalizations. The present study presents the first information of hospitalization care and medical costs in people with disabilities based on a nationwide data analyzes in Taiwan. We suggest the importance of supporting people with disabilities during hospitalizations, following up rehabilitation and there is an urgent need for cost-effective intervention programs for disability prevention, which could be offset against the cost for treating the disabled in the future."}, {"Title": "Sensorimotor integration and psychopathology: motor control abnormalities related to psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Recent evidence is reviewed to examine relationships among sensorimotor and cognitive aspects in some important psychiatry disorders. This study reviews the theoretical models in the context of sensorimotor integration and the abnormalities reported in the most common psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder and squizophrenia.\nThe bibliographical search used Pubmed/Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane data base and Scielo databases. The terms chosen for the search were: Alzheimer's disease, AD, autism spectrum disorder, and Squizophrenia in combination with sensorimotor integration. Fifty articles published in English and were selected conducted from 1989 up to 2010.\nWe found that the sensorimotor integration process plays a relevant role in elementary mechanisms involved in occurrence of abnormalities in most common psychiatric disorders, participating in the acquisition of abilities that have as critical factor the coupling of different sensory data which will constitute the basis of elaboration of consciously goal-directed motor outputs. Whether these disorders are associated with an abnormal peripheral sensory input or defective central processing is still unclear, but some studies support a central mechanism.\nSensorimotor integration seems to play a significant role in the disturbances of motor control, like deficits in the feedforward mechanism, typically seen in AD, autistic and squizophrenic patients."}, {"Title": "Autistic-like traits and their association with mental health problems in two nationwide twin cohorts of children and adults.", "Abstract": "Autistic-like traits (ALTs), that is restrictions in intuitive social interaction, communication and flexibility of interests and behaviors, were studied in two population-based Swedish twin studies, one in children and one in adults: (1) to examine whether the variability in ALTs is a meaningful risk factor for concomitant attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, conduct problems, depression and substance abuse, and (2) to assess whether common genetic and environmental susceptibilities can help to explain co-existence of ALTs and traits associated with such concomitant problems.\nTwo nationwide twin cohorts from Sweden (consisting of 11 222 children and 18 349 adults) were assessed by DSM-based symptom algorithms for autism. The twins were divided into six groups based on their degree of ALTs and the risk for concomitant mental health problems was calculated for each group. Genetic and environmental susceptibilities common to ALTs and the other problem types were examined using bivariate twin modeling.\nIn both cohorts, even the lowest degree of ALTs increased the risk for all other types of mental health problems, and these risk estimates increased monotonically with the number of ALTs. For all conditions, common genetic and environmental factors could be discerned. Overall, the phenotypic correlation between ALTs and the traits examined were less pronounced in adulthood than in childhood and less affected by genetic compared with environmental factors.\nEven low-grade ALTs are relevant to clinical psychiatry as they increase the risk for several heterotypical mental health problems. The association is influenced partly by common genetic and environmental susceptibilities. Attention to co-existing ALTs is warranted in research on a wide range of mental disorders."}, {"Title": "A competency-based model for research training during psychiatry residency.", "Abstract": "The Institute of Medicine recently identified a critical shortage of psychiatrist-researchers and highlighted the need for competency-based curricula that promote research training during psychiatry residency as a way to address that shortage.

Bibliotherapy and expressive writing are two examples of them. The effectiveness of both, for different types of disorders, has been proved in many studies. Up until today it was unknown just how prevalent these therapies are within child and adolescent psychiatry in the german speaking countries. The following article summarizes the results of a survey conducted in 122 child and adolescence psychiatric clinics in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to gain more information about their use. The survey takes into account the frequency of application of bibliotherapy and expressive writing therapies depending on age and type of disorder, preferences amongst patient groups, as well as specific approaches. More than half of the surveyed child and adolescent psychiatries are using at least one of the two therapies. They are used on an irregular and non-systematic basis and rather symptom- than diagnosis-orientated. Bibliotherapy and expressive writing are dynamic therapies which can be used in manifold ways. Reading and writing are two of the main pillars of our educational system and can be utilized within a therapeutic setting. Provided that the patient is not suffering from severe cognitive or mental limitations, the spoken and written word can leave deep imprints within the patient's, but also the therapist's, soul."}, {"Title": "[Liaison psychiatry.

The early recognition of these signs offers possibilities for early intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic patients. The Forensic Early warning Signs of Aggression Inventory (FESAI) was developed to assist nurses and patients in identifying and monitoring these early warning signs of aggression.\nThe FESAI was developed by means of qualitative and quantitative strategies. One hundred seventy six early detection plans were studied to construct a list of early warning signs of aggression. Inventory drafting was done by merging and categorizing early warning signs. Forensic nursing professionals assessed face validity, and interrater agreement was tested.\nThe investigation of early detection plans resulted in the FESAI, which contains 44 early warning signs of aggression subdivided into 15 main categories. The face validity of the form was very good, and the interrater agreement was satisfactory.\nPreliminary findings indicate that the FESAI provides a useful listing of early warning signs of aggression in forensic patients. It may facilitate the construction of early detection plans for the prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Parent-reported attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and subtypes of conduct disorder as risk factor of recidivism in detained male adolescents.", "Abstract": "Parents are considered to be crucial informants in child psychiatry, particularly for disorders in which age of onset is included in the diagnostic criteria. In detained adolescents, however, parents all too often are difficult to reach or reluctant to cooperate. The clinical relevance of gathering parental information in this context should therefore be demonstrated. This study examines if parent reports of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and age of onset subtypes of conduct disorder (CD) predict official criminal recidivism.\nParticipants were 110 detained male adolescents from all three Youth Detention Centers in Flanders. Between January 2005 and February 2007, both youth and a parent were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV. Two to 4 years later, information on criminal recidivism was retrieved.\nYouth self-reported ADHD and CD (subtypes) were not related with recidivism. Parent-reported ADHD, CD and childhood-onset CD predicted serious property recidivism, while parent-reported adolescent-onset CD predicted future violent arrests. In reverse, childhood-onset CD as reported by parents was negatively associated with violent recidivism.\nObtaining parental diagnostic information in delinquent adolescents is crucial for predicting recidivism. This finding emphasizes the need of including parents when studying mental disorder in detained adolescents."}, {"Title": "Child sex tourism: extending the borders of sexual offender legislation.", "Abstract": "Child sex tourism, the act of traveling to engage in sexual acts with minors, plagues developing nations worldwide. Several laws have been passed internationally in recent years designed to curtail this practice. Government entities and human rights organizations have driven these efforts. United States citizens represent a significant proportion of participants in child sex tourism. The PROTECT Act of 2003 prohibits United States citizens from participating in sexual acts with minors while traveling, and establishes extraterritorial jurisdiction. The case of Michael Lewis Clark, the first United States citizen convicted under this legislation, is highlighted. Child sex tourism poses unique issues to courts that will require ongoing clarification as challenges arise. This article discusses potential future challenges, describes strategies to address this problem, and relates this issue to psychiatry.

The evolution of the two patient groups was compared using an independent diagnostic consensual procedure involving a geriatric psychiatry physician/clinician and a neuropsychologist blinded to the initial psychiatric diagnosis.\nEOS presented significant memory and executive impairments when compared to controls but there was no significant difference between LOPS and their controls when age and education were taken into account. However, a detailed inspection of normative data suggests more executive impairments in LOPS than in EOS. The clinical judgment of experts was in favour of significant cognitive deficits with or without dementia in most LOPS (82.3%-94.1%) and EOS (80.0%-93.3%) patients. Regarding evolution, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) were the most common clinical diagnoses made by geriatric psychiatry physicians/clinicians for the LOPS (40%). In addition, 20% of LOPS versus 5.9% of EOS patients met the diagnostic criteria for dementia by consensus of the experts. Cerebral abnormalities were confirmed (CT scan; SPECT) in 73.3% of LOPS patients.\nThe present results suggest cognitive deficits (mostly of executive functions) and vascular and neurodegenerative vulnerability in LOPS. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm the present findings."}, {"Title": "Applicability of two brief evidence-based interventions to improve sleep quality in inpatient mental health care.", "Abstract": "The present study explored the applicability of two brief evidence-based interventions to improve sleep quality in inpatient psychiatry. The study involved three comparable admission wards of a psychiatric hospital. Stimulus control was introduced at the first ward, and music-assisted relaxation at the second. At the third ward, no intervention was introduced. A mixed-method study was employed. We found that nurses share the opinion that both interventions can be applied, but patients are hard to motivate. They perceived the lack of available time, busyness at the ward, and the lack of cooperation of patients as the main obstacles. The perception of a successful implementation is correlated with the perception of gained attention for sleep problems, the perception of increased care options, and the impression of effectiveness. Qualitative data showed that the effectiveness of the interventions was compromised by operational issues, commitment issues, adaptation to contextual limitations, and conflicting individual beliefs. We concluded that music-assisted relaxation is applicable in inpatient psychiatry. The application of stimulus control met with insurmountable operational issues. The nursing team is a very important factor for the implementation of evidence-based interventions at ward level. The lack of a shared urge for change and responsibility for continuity are important factors contributing to failure."}, {"Title": "A computerized system for reporting medication events in psychiatry: the first two years of operation.", "Abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe the first 2 years of operation of an electronic system for reporting medication events in psychiatry (Medi-Event system).

A total of 406 medication errors, 40 near misses and no adverse drug reactions were reported in the study period, representing a very large increase in reporting frequency with respect to the previous paper system. The majority (88.8%) of incidents were medication administration errors. The most common error types were failure to sign for a drug and omission of a drug without valid clinical reason. Although most errors were of minor severity, 6.3% were rated as moderate or serious. Distraction was cited as the most common contributory factor, also poor communication and being unfamiliar with the ward. In conclusion, use of the Medi-Event system increased the reporting of medication errors. Analysis of the pattern of errors, as well as of contributory factors and suggestions for error prevention, may help reduce the frequency of medication events and hence improve patient care."}, {"Title": "Multiple-criteria decision analysis reveals high stakeholder preference to remove pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater.", "Abstract": "Point-source measures have been suggested to decrease pharmaceuticals in water bodies. We analyzed 68 and 50 alternatives, respectively, for a typical Swiss general and psychiatric hospital to decrease pharmaceutical discharge. Technical alternatives included reverse osmosis, ozonation, and activated carbon; organizational alternatives included urine separation. To handle this complex decision, we used Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and combined expert predictions (e.g., costs, pharmaceutical mass flows, ecotoxicological risk, pathogen removal) with subjective preference-valuations from 26 stakeholders (authorities, hospital-internal actors, experts). The general hospital contributed ca. 38% to the total pharmaceutical load at the wastewater treatment plant, the psychiatry contributed 5%. For the general hospital, alternatives removing all pharmaceuticals (especially reverse osmosis, or vacuum-toilets and incineration), performed systematically better than the status quo or urine separation, despite higher costs. They now require closer scrutiny. To remove X-ray contrast agents, introducing roadbags is promising. For the psychiatry with a lower pharmaceutical load, costs were more critical. Stakeholder feedback concerning MCDA was very positive, especially because the results were robust across different stakeholder-types. Our MCDA results provide insight into an important water protection issue: implementing measures to decrease pharmaceuticals will likely meet acceptance. Hospital point-sources merit consideration if the trade-off between costs and pharmaceutical removal is reasonable."}, {"Title": "[Electronic records in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "Electronic patient records are very slowly being introduced into French hospitals.

This paper sought to move the outcomes measurement debate forward by reviewing some of the current limitations in outcomes methodology and by providing initial strategies to address them. Using these strategies, we evaluated outcomes for a large diagnostically diverse group of adult outpatients receiving treatment as usual (TAU) within an academic medical centre. Initial self-report and clinician-rated assessments were obtained from 5546 patients, and follow-up data were obtained from 1572 (28%) patients. Using the subset of patients with the follow-up data, we determined treatment effect sizes, rates of reliable improvement (and deterioration) and rates of clinically significant improvement for all patients and for specific diagnostic groups (depression, anxiety, substance abuse, mood disorders not otherwise specified, bipolar and psychotic conditions). TAU outcomes for depression and anxiety were also compared with benchmarks derived from the randomized controlled trial literature. Lastly, the impact of patient or sample characteristics on outcome was explored. Overall, these findings generally support the benefit of TAU over no treatment while also highlighting both the utility and limitations inherent in the current approaches to evaluating treatment outcomes.

Experience has emphasised (i) the role of appropriate timing of WCC sample collection to ensure that clozapine is not withdrawn unnecessarily and (ii) the success of agents such as filgrastim in promoting rapid production of granulocytes if the situation so demands. On the other hand, the use of lithium to promote a leucocytosis has taken hold without a clear risk: benefit analysis. Be this as it may, should patients decide that they no longer wish to undergo WCC monitoring after 12 months on clozapine, cessation of monitoring is probably preferable to stopping the drug since overall mortality is decreased in patients treated with clozapine."}, {"Title": "Attitudes of Japanese psychiatrists toward forensic mental health as revealed by a national survey.", "Abstract": "In Japan, a new comprehensive forensic mental health service was established and enforced in 2005.

The questions explored the experience of the respondents with forensic evaluations; the respondents' recognition of, experience with, and attitude toward the Medical Treatment and Supervision (MTS) Act; and attitudes toward forensic mental health in general.\nThe data of 1770 respondents were analyzed in this study. Three main findings were obtained: psychiatrists generally had little experience with criminal responsibility evaluations, and a small percentage of psychiatrists tended to have conducted the majority of these evaluations; although psychiatrists widely recognized the enactment of the MTS Act, they were not sufficiently familiar with the details of the MTS Act; and in spite of a reluctance to address forensic mental health issues, the respondents harbored a general interest in these topics.\nDespite a general interest, general psychiatrists in Japan tend to possess insufficient knowledge of this subspecialty and lack experience in and opportunities to work in this subspecialty.

Epidemiological studies demonstrate the occurrence of metabolic syndrome between 22% and 66%, while the prevalence of diabetes is at least threefold compared to the non-psychiatric population in all age groups. Etiologically it is not clear to what extent these alterations are caused by direct genetic and biological effects in contrast to environmental factors. Among the latter the role of atypical antipsychotics should be emphasized.

The present study aimed to identify nursing phenomena mentioned in journal articles about the psychiatric inpatient nursing care and to compare these phenomena with the labels and the definitions of the nursing diagnoses to elucidate how well this classification covers these phenomena. A search of journal articles took place in the databases MedLine, PsychInfo, Cochrane and CINAHL. A qualitative content analysis approach was used to identify nursing phenomena in the articles. Various phenomena were found in the articles. The study demonstrated that NANDA-I describes essential phenomena for the adult inpatient psychiatry on the level of labels and definitions. However, some apparently important nursing phenomena are not covered by the labels or definitions of NANDA-I. Other phenomena are assigned as defining characteristics or as related factors to construct nursing diagnoses. The further development of the classification NANDA-I will strengthen the application in the daily work of psychiatric nurses and enhance the quality of nursing care in the inpatient setting."}, {"Title": "Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with migraine headaches.", "Abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is now recognized as a common disorder both in child and adult psychiatry.

A recent neuroethical investigation explored the psychological factors that are crucial in determining whether or not subjects give consent. While cognitive functions have been shown to play a central role, the impact of empathy and emotions on subjects' decisions in informed consent remains unclear.\nTo evaluate the impact of empathy and emotions on subjects' decision in informed consent in an exploratory study.\nDecisional capacity and informed consent to a subsequent imaging study were evaluated with the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research (MacCAT-CR). Empathy and emotion recognition were measured with the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) and the Florida Affect Battery (FAB).\nPsychiatric subjects were recruited from a general psychiatric hospital and a forensic state hospital.\nA mixed group of 98 healthy men and forensic and non-forensic psychiatric subjects were investigated.\nBoth empathy (MET) and emotion recognition (FAB) correlated with MacCAT-CR scores. Higher cognitive empathy and good emotion recognition (compared with low empathy and emotion recognition) were associated with increased decisional capacity and higher rates of refusal to give informed consent.\nThis study shows an empirical relationship between decision-making and informed consent, on the one hand, and emotions and empathy on the other.

Many of the applications will involve randomized controlled clinical trials that include an active comparator. The inclusion of an active comparator has implications for clinical trial design. Despite a common misperception, a clinical trial result of no significant difference between active treatment groups does not imply equivalence or noninferiority. A noninferiority trial, on the other hand, can directly test whether one active treatment group is noninferior to the other. For example, noninferiority of an inexpensive generic could be tested in comparison with a novel, more costly intervention. Although seldom used in psychiatry, noninferiority clinical trials could play a fundamental role in CER. Features of noninferiority and the nearly ubiquitous superiority designs are contrasted. The noninferiority margin is defined and its application and interpretation are discussed.\nEvidence of noninferiority can only come from well-designed and conducted noninferiority CER. Sample sizes needed in noninferiority trials and in superiority trials that include an active comparator are substantially larger than those needed in trials that can utilize a placebo control in their scientific design.

Eleven per cent of nurses (n=113) were current smokers. Nurses who smoked were more likely to be divorced/separated and report smoking amongst family and friends. Smoking was more common amongst nurses who work in psychiatry and the emergency departments. Amongst the nurses who smoked, 45% desired to stop smoking and while 89% had experienced previous quit attempts, only half had ever received help or advice about smoking cessation. The most common factors preventing smoking cessation included fear of withdrawal symptoms including stress, weight gain and anxiety.\nSmoking rates amongst nurses in this sample have declined below smoking rates amongst the general population.

Data included history of documented maltreatment, potentially traumatic domestic or community violence, neglect or emotional abuse, and noninterpersonal stressors as well as demographics, psychiatric diagnoses, and parent-rated child emotional and disruptive behavior problems. On a bivariate and multivariate basis, any past exposure to interpersonal violence-but not to noninterpersonal traumas-was related to more severe disruptive behavior problems, independent of the effects of demographics and psychiatric diagnoses. Noninterpersonal trauma and psychiatric diagnoses were associated with emotional problems; exposure to interpersonal violence appeared to partially account for this relationship despite not being independently associated with emotional problem severity. History of exposure to interpersonal violence warrants clinical and research attention as a severity marker and potential treatment focus in psychiatric outpatient services for children, particularly those with disruptive behavior problems."}, {"Title": "Lithium in neuropsychiatry: a 2010 update.", "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES. More than 60 years have passed since the introduction of lithium into modern psychiatry and special issues of Bipolar Disorders in 2009 and Neuropsychobiology in 2010 were devoted to this anniversary. Notwithstanding such a long tradition, a number of key articles on the neuropsychiatric aspects of lithium have appeared in recent years. METHODS. This update was based on the most important original papers and reviews on lithium published in recent years. The main topics were the efficacy of lithium in mood disorders, with a special focus on cognitive functions, the neuroprotective effects of this ion and the potential of using lithium in neurology. RESULTS. Clinical studies and reviews point to lithium being still a cornerstone for the prophylaxis of mood disorders, especially bipolar. The pro-cognitive and antisuicidal properties of lithium have been confirmed as an augmentation of antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. The neuroprotective effects of lithium have been evidenced in both experimental research and in clinical studies using brain imaging. The possible use of lithium in the prophylaxis of dementia and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is discussed. CONCLUSIONS.

While asynchronous medicine may be established in specialties like radiology and dermatology, there is little research regarding the use of asynchronous medicine in areas of medicine that traditionally rely on the physical doctor-patient interaction such as primary care, internal medicine, geriatrics, and psychiatry. The practice of psychiatry stands out as a discipline that is highly dependent on the quality of the physical meeting between the doctor and the patient, yet even in this specialty it is possible to utilize asynchronous medicine for some types of psychiatric consultations. Asynchronous medicine has the potential to be significantly disruptive to our current healthcare processes, as well as more clinically and economically efficient."}, {"Title": "[The psychosis epidemiology in Turkey: a systematic review on prevalence estimates and admission rates].", "Abstract": "To provide prevalence estimate, admission rates and related features of psychotic disorders in Turkey.\nStudies with data on prevalence and/or rates in outpatient or inpatient admissions after 1990 were included. Strings of ([schizo*OR psych*] AND Turkey) were used in PubMed and PsychINFO to detect relevant studies. Turkish Medical and Psychiatry indexes were screened with Turkish keywords. Abstract books of national congresses, national index of thesis, and references of the included papers were searched for additional data. Results were presented as prevalence per 1000 and median values of admission rates.\nA total of 56 studies were included, including 8 cross-sectional (4 core and 4 special group), 27 outpatient and 21 inpatient admission estimates or rates. The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia in general population (pooled data, n: 6022) was 8.9 per 1000 (Standard error [SE]: 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-11.3). Psychosis prevalence is higher in subgroups including university students, prisoners and homeless people. Patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder constituted 7.6% and 26.9% of adult outpatient and inpatient psychiatry admissions. However, median rates vary depending on institutional, regional, temporal and residential features. Male gender was at higher risk in all kinds of estimates and rates for all age groups.\nPrevalence of schizophrenia in Turkey is higher than the formerly reported estimates in different countries. Higher prevalence may be a consequence of sample properties, environmental risk exposures, and study design. However more research is needed to further elaborate the relatively higher prevalence.

Such a practice has a certain way of characterizing and defining humanity's lapses from acceptable human behavior--a lapse from human being. The modern practice of psychiatry applies a particular notion (largely influenced by Enlightenment ideals) of scientific instrumentation to the human person in order to diagnose the ailment and manufacture a corresponding treatment in keeping with a hidden conception of human biological flourishing. This covert vision is an impoverished (and possibly dangerous) one. As much as the practice of psychiatry is constrained by the goals of the dominant moral tradition of our day, it becomes a tool (or technique) for achieving the transient and partial ends of modern individualism. Given this truncated view of human nature and human end, modern psychiatry fails to attend comprehensively to the unity of a life, missing altogether the essential relevance of character formation, and thereby forfeiting excellence in human flourishing."}, {"Title": "Therapeutic alliance in forensic mental health: coercion, consent and recovery.", "Abstract": "We examined the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) and Interpersonal Trust in Physician (ITP) in a forensic psychiatry hospital, where all patients were detained under mental health legislation for psychosis. We hypothesised that working alliance and trust are bilateral and can be measured.\nWe adapted the WAI and ITP minimally so that patients rated both their treating psychiatrist and primary nurse. We also adapted them minimally so that clinicians could rate WAI and ITP with the patient. A total of 81 of 83 patients completed the assessments. The clinicians (seven consultant psychiatrists and 43 nurses) also completed a minimally altered version of the same questionnaires. All three (patient, nurse and psychiatrist) were blind to the ratings of the others.\nCronbach's alpha was greater than 0.9 for both patient and clinician versions of the WAI and greater than 0.8 for the ITP. The WAI and ITP correlated with each other (Spearman r > 0.67 for patients, for psychiatrists and for nurses). Patients rated clinicians higher than clinicians rated patients. Ratings were higher in pre-discharge wards than in acute wards. Patients' ratings of WAI for their psychiatrist and nurse correlated r = 0.75, and patients rating of IPT for psychiatrist and nurse correlated 0.67. Psychiatrists correlated with nurses 0.38 for WAI, 0.53 for IPT. Psychiatrists and patients mutual ratings correlated r = 0.35 for WAI, 0.24 for IPT. Nurses and patients correlated r = 0.34 for WAI, 0.25 for IPT. All correlations were statistically significant.

Its mechanism of action is different as aripiprazole is a partial dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Therefore, aripiprazole is thought to have an antagonistic action in the mesolimbic pathway but an agonistic action in the mesocortical pathway, tending to normalize the dopaminergic transmission regardless of the type of imbalance. Clinical trials involving children and adolescents have demonstrated the efficacy of aripiprazole in bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorders associated with pervasive developmental disorders, in tics and Tourette's. The most frequent side effects are extrapyramidal symptoms and sleepiness and are dose-dependant. Nevertheless, contrary to other second-generation antipsychotics available in France, it induces little weight gain, does not modify lipid and glucidic profiles, does not increase prolactin levels, or induce QTc lengthening. The main advantage of aripiprazole is its good safety profile, with different toxicity targets to other secondgeneration antipsychotics available in France. Aripiprazole appears to be an alternative for children and adolescents who are vulnerable to these side effects and are having trouble coping with them."}, {"Title": "A randomized controlled trial of mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment: I. Outcomes on self-report questionnaires and external ratings.", "Abstract": "Mother-infant relationship disturbances occur in three domains: maternal distress, infant functional problems, and relationship difficulties. They constitute common clinical problems. In Sweden, they are usually handled by nurses as part of public Child Health Centre care. Severe cases are referred to child psychiatry services. This randomized controlled trial compared two groups of mother-infant dyads in a Stockholm sample. One received only Child Health Centre care (the \"CHCC\" group) while the other received mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment plus CHCC (the \"MIP\" group). Eighty dyads of mothers and infants under 1\u00bd years of age where the mothers had serious concerns about themselves in their role as mothers, their infants' well-being, or the mother-baby relationship were randomly selected for either the MIP or the CHCC group. The primary outcomes were mother-reported depression, mother-reported infant functional problems, and interviewer-based relationship assessments, all at 6 months after joining the project. Secondary outcomes were mother-reported stress and general psychic distress, externally rated video-recorded interactions, and the consumption of healthcare at the CHC, again all after 6 months. Intent-to-treat analyses of Treatment \u00d7 Time effects significantly favored MIP treatment for maternal depression, mother-infant relationships, and maternal sensitivity. Effects were nearly significant on maternal stress, but nonsignificant on mother-reported infant functional problems, general psychic distress, maternal interactive structuring and nonintrusiveness, infant responsiveness and involvement, and healthcare consumption. MIP treatment improved mother-infant relationships and maternal sensitivity and depression, all of which are known to influence child development. If effects persist and are reproduced, MIP treatment holds promise for more widespread use."}, {"Title": "Attitudes toward borderline personality disorder: a survey of 706 mental health clinicians.", "Abstract": "We sought to determine attitudes toward patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) among mental health clinicians at nine academic centers in the United States.\nA self-report questionnaire was distributed to 706 mental health clinicians, including psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, social workers, nurses, and psychologists.\nThe study showed that most clinicians consider BPD a valid diagnosis, although nearly half reported that they preferred to avoid these patients. The clinician's occupational subgroup was significantly related to attitude. Staff nurses had the lowest self-ratings on overall caring attitudes, while social workers had the highest. Social workers and psychiatrists had the highest ratings on treatment optimism. Social workers and psychologists were most optimistic about psychotherapy effectiveness, while psychiatrists were most optimistic about medication effectiveness. Staff nurses had the lowest self-ratings on empathy toward patients with BPD and treatment optimism.DiscussionNegative attitudes persist among clinicians toward BPD, but differ among occupational subgroups.

It joins in the wider spectre of the interpersonal dependency. More and more patients suffering from this disorder are coming for psychiatric consultation. However, this notion remains vague and absent in the vocabulary of the psychiatrists. Globally, this term describes the functioning of certain patients who present a fear of not being loved and a dependency on another person. The fear of not being loved provokes a fear of abandonment or incites development of strategies to be loved (seduce, help). Dependency on another person is a consequence of the lack of confidence in the capabilities of the individual. The other person reassures them because this person does what the patient is afraid of doing, because he/she does not feel capable. The lack of confidence in own's capabilities can also incite the individual to become a perfectionist and successful. The fear of not being loved and of not being competent is determined partly in the person's childhood. These impressions are real and/or the individuals are hypersensitive.\nThe article describes the emotional, cognitive and behavioural levels, the various types of interpersonal dependency: dependences of type \"umbilical cord\", \"rescuer\", \"stereotype\" and \"against dependence\". The objective is to specify the concept better on clinical level, with the aim of defining criteria and pathological limits. This is the first stage before beginning rigorous scientific research. The stakes are high. There are relationships with anxiety, depressive disorders, alcoholism, food behaviour disorders, suicide and somatic pathologies.\nDependency seems to be the consequence of a pathological expression of the normal dimensions of the personality: the need to be loved and valued (admired). The onset of dependency occurs in stages, when the person is weakened by events of life or by depression. The impression not to have been loved and/or valued in childhood is vulnerability. We detail the common points and the differences between the types of described dependences and the diagnostic categories of the DSM. The category-specific classification of the DSM is not adapted to making a diagnosis in these patients. To diagnose a pathological personality, the patient has to be constantly in a functioning of pathological intensity, which is not still the case. This is a real problem, because these clinical situations are very frequent. We defend a dimensional approach of the personality disorders. A meeting between the psychiatry and the relationally dependent person is possible, on one hand in a dimensional classification of personality disorders and, on the other, by working on self-esteem. The relational dependency and self-esteem share the same appearances and the same causes. There are two different names from the same identity."}, {"Title": "[Telepsychiatry at the service of autism].", "Abstract": "The authors report on the set-up of a telehealth system developed to facilitate exchanges between the Autism Resource Centre of Brittany (centre de ressources pour l'autisme [CRA]) located in Brest and an adult psychiatry structure of Vannes' Hospital in the Morbihan region, these sites are about 200 kilometres distant.\nThis coordinated work using computer networks aims at sustaining the action of a unit specialised in autistic patients. The goal is to both render a precise diagnostic (teleexpertise) and favour assistance and support to residents and their families while instituting a medical education tool for the health professionals of this unit.\nThe creation of this telehealth experience, using multiple contact video conferencing, was possible thanks to the existence of the Megalis network, a high speed telecommunication system deployed in the Britanny and Loire region. The connexion of the two sites is made through Cisco type routers. Both sites are linked to the network through urban fiber optics (2-40 MMytes/s output) or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Access (64 or 128 kbytes/s output). This virtual private network (VPN) style high speed link offers a transparent and secure connexion through the service provider (Novasight) which supervises the technical organisation and the management of the address books of the various listed sites, controls access to the network and manages the network speed. As far as appliances are concerned, (video camera, LCD screen, microphone, maintenance, training), the cost is about 11,000 euros. From their experience, the authors develop the following applications: tele-staffs are meetings of about 2hours in length.\nThe authors insist on some essential rules, such as putting on the agenda the items to be discussed at the meeting, handing out to everyone the documents needed for the meeting, and designating someone in charge of guaranteeing the good progress of the meeting. His/her functions are to guarantee a precise format for the meeting, to distribute speaking time fairly, to clearly formulate the decisions made (organisation of results, summing up diagnostic results and evaluation of competencies, common institutional actions, arrangement of projects, university research and trainings, scheduling future meetings). Still using their experiences, the authors put forward several recommendations on technology, video and audio links (framing, sound checks, multidirectional microphones, video quality - forcing people to limit rapid gestures\u2026) but also insist on having fit for purpose rooms (soundproofing, neutral decor, homogenous lighting, neon for example\u2026). Contact with patients and their family through video-conference: despite being used less, this technique has shown its pertinence especially for the evaluation of diagnostics and competencies. In practice, the families are joined by the health professionals in charge of the patient in that institution. A meeting chair must be nominated, in our case the doctor in charge of the unit for autistic persons. The doctor from the CRA sits in on the meeting as consulting expert and intervenes at the invitation of the chair. The plan for the meeting and the must-ask questions have to be determined beforehand by the two doctors, so as make sure the meeting will be fast flowing and all the relevant clinical and biographical data are collated. Families, seeing different institutions working together to help their family member despite the distances using high tech solutions, were very satisfied.\nOn the whole, the authors help us to have good insight into the obstacles (cultural, administrative, technological) and the benefits (availability of consultants with specific competencies, reduction in the waiting time, more efficient use of resources, reduction in costs and risks of travel and of CO(2) emissions\u2026). They believe that health professionals cannot and should not completely avoid travel to the other sites because it is important to get to know the teams well, which is a prerequisite to a good video-conference meeting. This helps creating new directions for the future."}, {"Title": "Why do ethnic elders present later to UK dementia services? A qualitative study.", "Abstract": "Western policy initiatives prioritize early diagnosis of dementia, but minority ethnic (ME) people currently present later to dementia specialist care than their indigenous counterparts. In order to allow the development of rational interventions, we completed this first study to explore the link between attitudes to help-seeking for dementia and the help-seeking pathway in the ME and indigenous population.\nWe purposively recruited a maximum variation sample comprising 18 family carers of people with dementia from the major UK ethnic groups. We used semi-structured interviews to determine the barriers to and facilitators of help-seeking, and the pathways to diagnosis. Two researchers independently coded interviews and recruitment continued until theoretical saturation was reached.\nME carers, in contrast to the indigenous population, tended to delay help-seeking until they could no longer cope or until others commented on the problems. They often thought that families should look after their own elders and a diagnosis alone was purposeless. This appeared to relate to beliefs about the etiology of cognitive impairment, negative beliefs about psychiatry and their sense of familial responsibility.\nME carer beliefs were an important barrier to early diagnosis. Further work should explore whether an intervention can modify these attitudes, so that families understand that a diagnosis may allow planning and avoidance of crises; rather than signifying a failure in duty, disloyalty, or relinquishing of the caring role. Further research should focus on developing interventions to tackle barriers to help-seeking in ethnic minorities so that healthcare access can be equitable for all."}, {"Title": "Interrelationship between core interventions and core competencies of forensic psychiatric nursing in Finland.", "Abstract": "The importance of core competencies (CC) and their relationship to core interventions in clinical practice guidelines on schizophrenia (CPGS), and the abilities to master these competencies were studied among registered nurses (RN) and practical mental nurses (PMN) in a forensic psychiatric setting.

These fatalities were supposed to have been induced by obsolete psychotropic drugs and were associated with Ivan Pavlov's hypnotherapy. The incidents were investigated both by highest administrative bodies and the General State Prosecutor of the former GDR. Archival sources suggest that lower party organs and the ministerial administration tried to make use of the proceedings to bring about the downfall of the head of the Leipzig Department, who had become ideologically suspicious. However, the official General State Prosecutor's investigation ascertained that both M\u00fcller-Hegemann and Christa Kohler, head of the psychotherapeutic ward, were not to be held responsible. Although the SED Central Committee at first tried to influence the outcome on the basis of ideological reservations made by the university party organisation, it finally accepted and confirmed the judgment of the General State Prosecutor.

The authors argue that three domains in particular require change--an overemphasis on the outmoded diagnostic system, a residual attachment to archaic psychoanalytic constructs, and an unwarranted confidence in current therapeutic capabilities. They then propose first steps aimed at remedying each domain. The authors suggest increased curricular emphasis on taxonomic approaches distinct from that of the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders system, enhanced attention to and teaching of core cognitive neuroscientific concepts, and a concerted emphasis on the development of skills needed for critical evaluation of the empiric bases of therapeutics. They conclude that progress in psychiatry requires that educators shift their emphases toward what is currently known and being learned--including the scientific sophistication needed to assess such claims of knowledge--and away from taxonomic and conceptual systems that are demonstrably flawed, if not simply wrong."}, {"Title": "Evaluation of sleep disorders in the primary care setting: history taking compared to questionnaires.", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine if primary care providers (PCPs) screen for sleep disorders during clinical evaluation of new patients, and to compare this to likely sleep diagnoses as assessed by validated questionnaires.\nAdult patients evaluated as new patients in a primary care clinic at a tertiary care center were included in a prospective study.

IRD-IoP partnership showcases a successful north-south partnership with equality and efficiency. It has moved beyond start-up phase and has become a sustainable initiative in terms of funding, collaboration, research output and policy impact. International funding agencies, academics, and other bodies need to address sustaining such initiatives as priorities in reducing scarcity and inequity in mental health research in developing countries."}, {"Title": "Psychiatry and primary care integration: challenges and opportunities.", "Abstract": "Health systems across the world remain significantly fragmented, affecting access, quality and costs of the care delivered.

Only very few cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9-Syndrome (GBS) associated with eating disorders have been reported. The objective of this paper is to describe and discuss a case of anorexia nervosa and concomittant chronic GBS. We report on a course of medical management for a 15 year old female patient, who presented with acute neurological syndrome (GBS) which was followed by the onset of a severe eating disorder. The patient was diagnosed to have two different entities, with the association between the two remaining unclear. The mainstay of management was focused on the eating disorder. Using an integrative psychiatric therapy a significant improvement of the eating disorder was achieved. The patient's body weight was stabilised and the locomotor deficits improved. Though a significant somatic disorder was evident, it proved to be advantageous to primarily focus on the eating disorder, until it was under control. The possible correlations between the two distinct disorders are discussed."}, {"Title": "The contemporary practice of psychiatric surgery: results from a survey of North American functional neurosurgeons.", "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric indications is becoming increasingly safe and effective. As a result, the treatment of these conditions by neurosurgeons is becoming more widespread and a larger part of the functional neurosurgeons' practice. Given the troubled history of the field and its current renaissance, it is important to evaluate current practices, to serve as a baseline for future comparison, and to gauge changing cultural attitudes towards invasive neuromodulation.\nThe purpose of this study was to obtain a snapshot of the practice of the contemporary functional neurosurgeon engaged in psychiatric surgery. Current practices as well as attitudes towards the direction of the field and its future were also investigated.\nWe designed an online survey and distributed it electronically to 299 functional neurosurgeons in North America identified by membership in the World Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosugery. Subsequent statistical and thematic analysis was performed on the data obtained.\nOf 299 surveys sent out, 84 were completed (28%). Fifty percent of functional neurosurgeons are currently engaged in some form of psychiatric surgery, with DBS for obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression accounting for most cases. Most surgeons see psychiatric surgery as a growing field, with multidisciplinary teams and a greater engagement with psychiatry necessary for the expansion of the field. Opinions differed substantially on hypothetical scenarios dealing with surgical cognitive enhancement, with some in favour of it, citing patient autonomy and choice, and others drawing a clear distinction between pathologic and non-pathologic states.\nSurgery for psychiatric indications is a growing field in the contemporary functional neurosurgeon's practice. Most neurosurgeons see the field continuing to grow and psychiatric surgery becoming a larger part of their daily practice, with the appropriate ethical and psychiatric oversight. Future editions of this survey and their results can be used to trace the development and growth of the field as technology and cultural attitudes continue to evolve."}, {"Title": "A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of Melissa officinalis oil and donepezil for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease.", "Abstract": "Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are frequent in people with Alzheimer's disease and cause considerable stress to patients and their carers. Antipsychotics have been widely used as a first-line treatment, resulting in an estimated 1,800 excess strokes and 1,600 excess deaths in the UK alone. Safe and effective alternatives are urgently needed. Based upon preliminary evidence from clinical trials, aromatherapy with melissa oil may be such an alternative, but initial studies have been modest in size, and adequate blinding has been problematic. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of melissa aromatherapy in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease in an adequately powered and robustly blinded randomized controlled trial comparing it with donepezil, an anticholinesterase drug used with some benefit to treat BPSD.\nThe study was a double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled randomized trial across 3 specialist old age psychiatry centres in England. Participants had probable or possible Alzheimer's disease, were resident in a care home, had clinically significant agitation (defined as a score of 39 or above on the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory) and were free of antipsychotics and/or anticholinesterase for at least 2 weeks. Participants were allocated to 1 of 3 groups: placebo medication and active aromatherapy; active medication and placebo aromatherapy or placebo of both.\nThe primary outcome measure was reduction in agitation as assessed by the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale (PAS) at 4 weeks. This is an observational scale, and raters were required to wear nose clips to ensure that full blinding was maintained. The PAS, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; another measure of BPSD) and other outcome measures were completed at baseline, 4-week and 12-week follow-ups. 114 participants were randomized, of whom 94 completed the week 4 assessment and 81 completed the week 12 assessment. Aromatherapy and donepezil were well tolerated. There were no significant differences between aromatherapy, donepezil and placebo at week 4 and week 12, but importantly there were substantial improvements in all 3 groups with an 18% improvement in the PAS and a 37% improvement in the NPI over 12 weeks.\nWhen assessed using a rigorous design which ensures blinding of treatment arms, there is no evidence that melissa aromatherapy is superior to placebo or donepezil, in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease. However, the sizeable improvement in the placebo group emphasizes the potential non-specific benefits of touch and interaction in the treatment of agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease."}, {"Title": "Pregabalin for the discontinuation of long-term benzodiazepines use: an assessment of its effectiveness in daily clinical practice.", "Abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of pregabalin in the management of the discontinuation of benzodiazepines in long-term users.\nWe performed a 12-week, prospective, uncontrolled, non-interventional, and observational study in patients aged 18 years old or above, who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for benzodiazepine dependence without other major psychiatry disorder. Evaluations included the Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression Scale, and the Sheehan Disability Scale. A urine drug screen for benzodiazepines was performed at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter. The primary effectiveness variable was success rate, defined as achievement of benzodiazepine-free status at week 12 according to the urine drug screen.\nThe mean dose at week 12 was 315 (\u00b1166) mg/day. The success rate of the benzodiazepine taper in the primary efficacy population (n=282) was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46-58). Success rates for women and men were 58% (95% CI, 49-67) and 46% (95% CI, 38-55), respectively. The success rates did not differ according to either the benzodiazepine of abuse or the presence of other substance use disorders. Significant and clinically relevant improvements were observed in withdrawal and anxiety symptoms, as well as in patients' functioning. At week 12, tolerability was rated as good or excellent by 90% and 83% of the clinicians and patients, respectively.\nOur results suggest that pregabalin is an efficacious and well-tolerated adjunctive treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal."}, {"Title": "Pediatric bipolar disorder in a Spanish sample: results after 2.6years of follow-up.", "Abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) often starts in childhood or adolescence.

In Canada, the overriding social realities of indigenous peoples include their historical rootedness to a specific place (with traditional lands, communities, and transactions with the environment) and the profound displacements caused by colonization and subsequent loss of autonomy, political oppression, and bureaucratic control. We report observations from an ongoing collaborative project on resilience in Inuit, M\u00e9tis, Mi'kmaq, and Mohawk communities that suggests the value of incorporating indigenous constructs in resilience research. These constructs are expressed through specific stories and metaphors grounded in local culture and language; however, they can be framed more generally in terms of processes that include: regulating emotion and supporting adaptation through relational, ecocentric, and cosmocentric concepts of self and personhood; revisioning collective history in ways that valorize collective identity; revitalizing language and culture as resources for narrative self-fashioning, social positioning, and healing; and renewing individual and collective agency through political activism, empowerment, and reconciliation. Each of these sources of resilience can be understood in dynamic terms as emerging from interactions between individuals, their communities, and the larger regional, national, and global systems that locate and sustain indigenous agency and identity. This social-ecological view of resilience has important implications for mental health promotion, policy, and clinical practice."}, {"Title": "From benzos to berries: treatment offered at an Aboriginal youth solvent abuse treatment centre relays the importance of culture.", "Abstract": "First Nations and Inuit youth who abuse solvents are one of the most highly stigmatized substance-abusing groups in Canada. Drawing on a residential treatment response that is grounded in a culture-based model of resiliency, this article discusses the cultural implications for psychiatry's individualized approach to treating mental disorders. A systematic review of articles published in The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry during the past decade, augmented with a review of Canadian and international literature, revealed a gap in understanding and practice between Western psychiatric disorder-based and Aboriginal culture-based approaches to treatment and healing from substance abuse and mental disorders. Differing conceptualizations of mental health and substance abuse are discussed from Western psychiatric and Aboriginal worldviews, with a focus on connection to self, community, and political context. Applying an Aboriginal method of knowledge translation-storytelling-experiences from front-line workers in a youth solvent abuse treatment centre relay the difficulties with applying Western responses to Aboriginal healing. This lends to a discussion of how psychiatry can capitalize on the growing debate regarding the role of culture in the treatment of Aboriginal youth who abuse solvents. There is significant need for culturally competent psychiatric research specific to diagnosing and treating First Nations and Inuit youth who abuse substances, including solvents. Such understanding for front-line psychiatrists is necessary to improve practice. A health promotion perspective may be a valuable beginning point for attaining this understanding, as it situates psychiatry's approach to treating mental disorders within the etiology for Aboriginal Peoples."}, {"Title": "Review: a conceptual model of perceived burden of informal caregivers for older persons with a severe functional psychiatric syndrome and concomitant problematic behaviour.", "Abstract": "This literature review aims to delineate the determinants of perceived burden by informal caregivers and provide insight into the interrelatedness between these determinants.\nDespite the attention given to the various determinants of perceived burden, their interrelatedness has not been unravelled. Insight into this interrelatedness is mandatory for the development of successful, complex, multivariate interventions to reduce perceived burden of informal caregivers. DESIGN; Systematic review.\nFour electronic databases, CINAHL, Embase psychiatry, Medline, Psychinfo and reference lists of selected articles, were searched. Publications between January 1985-2008 were included if they concerned mental illness, burden and care giving. Articles were selected according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nThe results of mostly descriptive, cross-sectional and univariate research and the more process-oriented results coming from qualitative burden research are organised in a process orientated conceptual scheme or model adapted from the stress-theoretical framework by Lazarus and Folkman. The model indicates that perceived burden must be understood through the individual appraisal of stressors and the availability and use of internal and external resources. Perceived burden is the outcome of multiple, clinically overlapping psychiatric problems, problematic behaviour and functional disabilities.\nSo far, intervention programs to reduce perceived burden of informal caregivers have not devoted much attention to the interrelatedness of the origins of burden. The conceptual model provides an overview of the various determinants of perceived burden and a clear picture of the possible interrelatedness appears. This overview of the most important sources of burden helps to develop a complex, multivariate intervention that is comprehensive, long-term, individually tailored and has the flexibility to meet the dynamics of burden over time.\nUse of the conceptual model is crucial to professional nursing and the quality of support of informal caregivers."}, {"Title": "Mass catastrophe and disaster psychiatry.", "Abstract": "This paper discusses the vital role of disaster psychiatry in the evolving structures for preparedness and response in the fields of disaster management.

The diagnosis of Parkinson disease was made approximately four months prior. Despite initiation of carbidopa-levodopa, the patient's symptoms did not improve, and her mental and physical status declined. The patient was taking olanzapine 30 mg daily for bipolar disorder and had a 40-pack-year history of smoking, but she quit smoking approximately four months before this hospitalization. The results of a neurologic evaluation suggested that the patient did not have Parkinson disease but was possibly experiencing olanzapine toxicity secondary to smoking cessation. Carbidopa-levodopa was discontinued. Psychiatry was consulted, and a monthlong cross-taper to discontinue olanzapine and initiate aripiprazole with a target dosage of 20 mg daily was recommended. During the course of therapy, the patient's level of alertness and bradykinesia improved. Overall, it was noted that her extrapyramidal symptoms were gradually improving; two days before hospital discharge, she was noted to have no definite remaining evidence of parkinsonism. In this case, use of the Naranjo et al. adverse-drug-reaction probability scale and the drug interaction probability scale indicated that the adverse effects were probably related to the interaction between smoking and olanzapine.\nA 73-year-old woman receiving high-dosage olanzapine for bipolar disorder developed parkinsonism after smoking cessation."}, {"Title": "Association between severe dorsolateral prefrontal dysfunction during random number generation and earlier onset in schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia involves impairment in attention, working memory and executive processes associated with prefrontal cortical function, an essential contributor of social functioning.

Obviously we do, if such BrainMind functions exist in the animals we wish to understand. If so, how do we proceed, while still retaining materialistic-mechanistic perspectives? This essay outlines the historical forces that led to emotional feelings in animals being marginalized in behavioristic scientific discussions of why animals behave the way they do, and why mental constructs are generally disregarded in modern neuroscientific analyses. The roots of this problem go back to Cartesian dualism and the attempt of 19th century physician-scientists to ground a new type of medical curriculum on a completely materialistic approach to body functions. Thereby all vitalistic principles were discarded from the lexicon of science, and subjective experience in animals was put in that category and discarded as an invalid approach to animal behavior. This led to forms of rigid operationalism during the era of behaviorism and subsequently ruthless reductionism in brain research, leaving little room for mentalistic concepts such as emotional feelings in animal research. However, modern studies of the brain clearly indicate that artificially induced arousals of emotional networks, as with localized electrical and chemical brain stimulation, can serve as \"rewards\" and \"punishments\" in various learning tasks. This strongly indicates that animal brains elaborate various experienced states, with those having affective contents being easiest to study rigorously. However, in approaching emotional feelings empirically we must pay special attention to the difficulties and vagaries of human language and evolutionary levels of control in the brain. We need distinct nomenclatures from primary (unconditioned phenomenal experiences) to tertiary (reflective) levels of mind. The scientific pursuit of affective brain processes in other mammals can now reveal general BrainMind principles that also apply to human feelings, as with neurochemical predictions from preclinical animal models to self-reports of corresponding human experiences. In short, brain research has now repeatedly verified the existence of affective experience-various reward and punishment functions-during artificial arousal of emotional networks in our fellow animals. The implications for new conceptual schema for understanding human/primate affective feelings and how such knowledge can impact scientific advances in biological psychiatry are also addressed."}, {"Title": "[Risk assessment with intellectual disabled forensic psychiatric patients: how useful are risk assessment instruments?].", "Abstract": "Instruments for assessing the risk of violent behaviour have proved their worth in the field of forensic psychiatry.

One of the genes that may interact with cannabis is COMT, although available data are scarce. Here, we present a case-only study of the putative COMT-cannabis interaction in schizophrenia. Two Spanish samples from Santiago de Compostela and Valencia were screened for cannabis use. One hundred and fifty five individuals from a total of 748 patients were identified as cannabis users. Five SNPs in COMT, defining three common functional haplotypes with different enzymatic activities, were genotyped and analyzed for association at the SNP, haplotype and genotype levels. An association was detected between cannabis use and low activity variants (P<0.01) in the joint analysis and results were consistent between the two samples. Schizophrenic subjects homozygous for the Met allele at rs4680 doubled the probability of lifetime prevalence of cannabis use in comparison to Val homozygous (Mantel-Haenszel OR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.27-3.26, P=0.0031, in the combined sample). These data are in contrast to those from Caspi et al. (Biol. Psychiatry 57 (2005)1117-1127) who found association between schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder and homozygosity at the high activity Val variant of rs4680. The results of our study are discussed in the context of previous findings, suggesting the involvement of COMT polymorphisms in the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia as well as the existence of additional factors mediating this association. However, further research is needed to confirm the COMT-cannabis interaction."}, {"Title": "Treatment-seeking for social anxiety disorder in a general outpatient psychiatry setting.", "Abstract": "Many individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) seek treatment principally for another psychiatric disorder, but when directly asked, a majority of these individuals also desire treatment for SAD. Several reasons may exist for why individuals with SAD do not seek treatment for it, such as the severity or functional impairment related to SAD. The aim of the current study was to examine factors related to SAD severity, impairment, and comorbidity, to gain a better understanding of what factors may be related to treatment-seeking for SAD. In 819 psychiatric outpatients with SAD, initial results showed that age, duration of SAD illness, number of social fears endorsed, Clinical Global Impression score, Sheehan Disability Scale ratings for social life and distress, presence of major depressive disorder, and presence of depressive disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) were associated with treatment-seeking for SAD status. However, a regression analysis found that DDNOS was the most robust predictor of treatment-seeking for SAD status, followed by the number of feared social situations. Other factors should be examined in the future, such as knowledge of SAD and available treatment options."}, {"Title": "The rising demand for consultation-liaison psychiatry for older people: comparisons within Liverpool and the literature across time.", "Abstract": "To compare the rate of referrals of older people for consultation-liaison psychiatry services over time within Liverpool and with the literature.\nAll referrals to the liaison psychiatry service for older people in Liverpool between 1999 and 2004 were used to calculate referral rates and compared with data from the same hospital from 1981 to 1989 previously published. Data related to referral rates was extracted from other published studies to allow cross-national comparisons over time.\nBetween 1999 and 2004 there were 2760 referrals to the Liverpool liaison psychiatry service for older people producing an average annual referral rate of 2.89%. This compares to a referral rate of 0.7% in 1981 and 1.34% in 1989. Comparison with studies from the UK, North America, Europe, Singapore and Taiwan shows an increasing trend across a 30 year period. The rate of referral increases with increasing age up to age 90.\nTrends indicate increasing rates of referral of older people to consultation-liaison psychiatry services with greater representation of the older old.

The present narrative review synthesizes evidence from the following five categories of studies conducted with children and adolescents: (1) those examining the HPA system's response to the dexamethasone suppression test (DST); (2) those assessing basal HPA axis functioning; (3) those administering corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) challenge; (4) those incorporating psychological probes of the HPA axis; and (5) those examining HPA axis functioning in children of depressed mothers. Evidence is generally consistent with models of developmental psychopathology that hypothesize that atypical HPA axis functioning precedes the emergence of clinical levels of depression and that the HPA axis becomes increasingly dysregulated from child to adult manifestations of depression.

It is known that successful chronic disease management reduces hospital admission rates and improves patients' quality of life. Although recognized widely by other medical disciplines, it is beginning to have an impact on psychiatric practice; therefore, a review of how the CDSM approach is implemented in psychiatry is timely.\nThe move toward self-management in general medicine can be seen by and large as a holistic approach that encourages the person to work in partnership with health professionals to improve outcomes and assist patients to better manage their healthcare needs. One of the defining features of CDSM approaches is the active collaboration between the patient and the healthcare professional. Five mechanisms that demonstrate such active collaboration are self-directed care, illness management and recovery, shared decision-making, joint crisis planning and wellness planning. Their use in psychiatry is discussed.\nThe key feature of CDSM approaches is an active collaboration between healthcare professionals and healthcare consumers.

Data were extracted from case files of all people who were treated in a health area's old age psychiatry units with clozapine during a 15-year period. Additional details were obtained from clinicians who provided ongoing care after discharge from the hospital. Note was made of psychiatric diagnoses, length of time taking clozapine, dosage, side effects and outcome. Sixteen patients aged over 65 years commenced or continued taking clozapine while inpatients of the service. Of the 13 patients who had a history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, four patients (all female) developed neutropenia and therefore clozapine was stopped. In one case, neutropenia was first diagnosed 6 years after commencing the medication. Two women died; the nine other women, and one of the deceased, stopped taking clozapine, usually because of side effects. The mean daily dose at cessation was 236 mg. All five men were still taking clozapine (mean 260 mg daily) when followed at a mean age of 72 years, having taken it for an average of 10 years. This case review adds to evidence of the risk of neutropenia when older people are prescribed clozapine."}, {"Title": "Neuroimaging in psychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "In psychiatry, neuroimaging facilitates the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the development of new medications. It is used to detect structural lesions causing psychosis and to differentiate depression from neurodegenerative disorders or brain tumors. Functional neuroimaging, mostly in the form of molecular neuroimaging with positron emission tomography or single photon emission tomography, facilitates the identification of therapeutic targets, the determination of the dose of a new drug needed to occupy its target in the brain, and the selection of patients for clinical trials."}, {"Title": "[Hormone-based classification and therapy concepts in psychiatry].", "Abstract": "This study retells key aspects of the history of the idea of hormone-based classification and therapy concepts in psychiatry. Different contributions to the history are not only represented from a historical, but also from a current medico-scientific perspective. One of the oldest, yet ethically most problematic, indications concerning hormonal methods to modify undesirable behaviour and sexuality was castration, which was widely used in the 20th century to \"cure\" homosexuality. Felix Platter, whose concept was humoral-pathological in nature, documented the first postpartum psychosis in the German-speaking countries, the pathogenesis of which according to present-day expertise is brought about by changes in female hormones. The concept of an \"endocrine psychiatry\" was developed at the beginning of the 20th century. Some protagonists for neuroendocrinology are highlighted, such as Paul Julius M\u00f6bius around 1900 or, in the 1950s, Manfred Bleuler, the nestor of this new discipline. Only the discovery of the hormones as such and the development of technologies like radioimmunassay to measure and quantify these hormone changes in mental illnesses allowed investigating these conditions properly. Ever since hormone-based therapeutic and classification concepts have played an important role, above all, in sexual, affective and eating disorders as well as alcohol dependence."}, {"Title": "From reinforcement learning models to psychiatric and neurological disorders.", "Abstract": "Over the last decade and a half, reinforcement learning models have fostered an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the functions of dopamine and cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) circuits. More recently, these models, and the insights that they afford, have started to be used to understand important aspects of several psychiatric and neurological disorders that involve disturbances of the dopaminergic system and CBGTC circuits. We review this approach and its existing and potential applications to Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, schizophrenia and preclinical animal models used to screen new antipsychotic drugs. The approach's proven explanatory and predictive power bodes well for the continued growth of computational psychiatry and computational neurology."}, {"Title": "Body dysmorphic disorder and other psychiatric morbidity in aesthetic rhinoplasty candidates.", "Abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterised by the patient's preoccupation with an imagined defect in his or her physical appearance. Subjects with BDD often seek cosmetic surgery; however, the outcome of surgery is usually not satisfactory. The aim of current study was to investigate the prevalence of BDD among the patients seeking cosmetic surgery.\nIn a cross-sectional study, 306 patients referred to cosmetic surgery clinics were recruited. Two psychiatrists detected BDD by interviewing the patients using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition Text Revision (DSM IV-TR) criteria. Data analysis was done in Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) using the t-test and the Mann-Whitney test for numeral variables and the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for nominal variables.\nData analysis of demographics showed that 80% of patients were female. Analysis on disease-related variables showed that 126 (41%) of patients had an associated psychiatric disorder. Moreover, 75 patients (24.5%) fulfilled the DSM IV criteria for BDD.\nFindings from this study support earlier studies, which found that BDD is a relatively common disorder among individuals seeking aesthetic surgery, in particular in rhinoplasty patients.

Unfortunately, concerns have arisen about its effects on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. This article reviews television usage trends and television's impact on sleep, attention, and interpersonal relationships. American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on television use are also discussed. Many studies on television viewing have cross-sectional designs, and longitudinal research is limited. However, research to date suggests that excessive television viewing is associated with negative effects on sleep, attention, and interpersonal relationships. As use of different media formats escalates, research across multiple specialties (including child psychiatry) will need to incorporate evaluation of media use into its assessments. More research and education are needed on the appropriate use of media in youth. Information on the health effects of television may also increase awareness of potential issues with less well-studied media formats."}, {"Title": "Comparison of diagnostic names of mental illnesses in medical documents before and after the adoption of a new Japanese translation of 'schizophrenia'.", "Abstract": "The name of a disease entered in medical documents often differs from the true diagnosis in psychiatric practice. We examined the effects of different translations of 'schizophrenia' into Japanese on the usage of disease names in documents.\nWe conducted a retrospective survey of the names of diseases used in the medical documents of 250 outpatients with schizophrenia or depression. These patients had attended our department of psychiatry between 1998 and 2000. We also investigated the names of the diseases of 226 outpatients who had first visited our department between 2003 and 2007. We defined the diagnosis (based on ICD-10) as the 'ICD-10 disease name' and the name of the disease written in medical documents as the 'disease name in documents'. We classified the documents that were used to apply for national psychiatric care and welfare services as 'official documents' and those submitted to others as 'private documents'.\nPrior to 2000, the term 'seishin-bunretsu-byo' ('split-mind disease'; old translation of 'schizophrenia') was used in 72.3% of official documents and 3.6% of private documents. In 2003 and later, the term 'togo-shitcho-sho' ('integration disorder'; new translation of 'schizophrenia') was used in 98.0% of official documents and 21.7% of private documents.\nThe use of 'togo-shitcho-sho' in official documents has become established.

When the methods of mind/body medicine (MBM) are added to this combination, as in Western countries, a new concept emerges that drastically changes the approach toward illness.It is interesting to note that the joining of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in the early days of the Peoples' Republic of China preceded the Western model of IM by almost 50 years. Several elements that make up the key components of IM as practiced today in the West were already present in the Chinese version of IM, and Chinese medicine has played and continues to play an important role in advancing IM. However, one of the major differences between the Chinese and the Western models of IM today, besides MBM and some other treatment options, is that Western integrative medicine (WIM) strictly requires its CAM methods to be supported by scientific evidence.The therapeutic methods of IM and their applications are many and varied. However, they are most frequently employed to treat chronic medical conditions, e.g., bronchial asthma, rheumatic disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disorder and chronic pain. Other fields in which IM may be applied are internal medicine (inflammatory bowel diseases and cardiovascular diseases), musculoskeletal disorders, oncology (chemotherapy-induced side effects), obstetrics and gynecology (dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, infertility and menopausal complaints), pediatrics, geriatrics, neurology (migraine and chronic headache), and psychiatry (anxiety and depression).The concept of WIM is discussed here in detail by reviewing its scope and implications for the practice of medicine and focusing on the role of Chinese medicine in WIM."}, {"Title": "Do guidelines recommending pharmacogenetic testing of psychiatric patients affect treatment costs and the use of healthcare services?", "Abstract": "To identify the effects of local recommendations of pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatry with respect to treatment costs.\nBased on Danish patient registers, individual treatment costs within a 365-day period at three psychiatric hospitals recommending and using pharmacogenetic testing is compared retrospectively with treatment costs at other Danish psychiatric hospitals using alternate treatment strategies. Primary outcome of interest is total direct costs analyzed by multilevel modelling. Secondary outcome measures are healthcare consumption within specific sectors analyzed by Tobitregressions.\nCosts among patients treated at hospitals recommending and using pharmacogenetic testing were not found to be statistically significantly different from costs among patients treated at sites using alternate treatment strategies. In spite of recommendations to test all patients the uptake of the test was, however, low (26-31 %). Treatment practice using routine therapeutic drug monitoring (in \u00c3rhus) shows a trend towards lower costs.\nBased on this natural experiment we were not able to document statistically significant differences in total costs between treatment sites that had guidelines recommending pharmacogenetic testing, relative to sites without such guidelines, over a period of one year. However, guidelines of pharmacogenetic testing and possibly also therapeutic drug monitoring seem to lead to reductions in costs for primary care services. In the case of the former, reductions do, however, seem to be outweighed by increases in costs for psychiatric and non-psychiatric inpatient stays. In conclusion, no statistically significant differences in total direct costs across sites with different treatment strategies were found."}, {"Title": "Cortical mechanisms of the symptomatology in major depressive disorder: a resting EEG study.", "Abstract": "Diagnosis and treatment rely on symptom criteria in modern psychiatry. However, the cortical mechanisms of symptomatology in major depressive disorder (MDD) are still not clear. This study examined neural correlates of symptom clusters of MDD by electroencephalography (EEG).\nResting state eye-closed EEG signals were recorded in 196 depressive patients. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) of regional power, coherence and power series correlation across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were used to correlate with overall depression severity evaluated by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Further, statistical comparisons between patients with high vs. low qEEG indices (median-split) were undertaken regarding symptom severity of core depression, sleep, activity, psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, and delusion.\nNone of the qEEG indices significantly correlated with overall depression severity or differentiated symptom severity of core depression, sleep, activity and psychic anxiety. A higher symptom severity of somatic anxiety was associated with higher regional power over widespread cortical regions and lower strengths at bi-temporal, temporo-parietal and fronto-parietal connections. A higher symptom severity of delusion was associated with higher regional power in the frontal and temporal regions, and lower strengths at inter-hemispheric (frontal, temporal and parietal) and fronto-temporo-parietal connections.\nOur EEG recording with sampling rate of 128Hz and 20 electrodes may provide restricted spatial and temporal precision.\nOur results suggest that cortical mechanisms play important roles in the symptom manifestation of cognitive distortion (sub-score of delusion) and somatic anxiety in MDD. Our findings further imply that psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety are distinct entities."}, {"Title": "Serum haptoglobin levels in patients with melancholic and nonmelancholic major depression.", "Abstract": "Major depression (MD) is accompanied by systemic immune activation or an inflammatory response with the involvement of phagocytic cells, T cell activation, B cell proliferation, and an acute phase response with increased levels of positive and decreased levels of negative acute-phase proteins.

This has led to a considerable surge of clinical and commercial interest in DBS for psychiatric indications. Because of the high vulnerability of psychiatric patients, the lack of extensive short- and long-term data about effectiveness and the rapid spread of questionable indications this new field in psychiatry requires ethical criteria that can be applied to both research and clinical decision-making.\nWe here present an evidence-based systematic ethical analysis of psychiatric DBS using the criteria of beneficence, nonmaleficence, and autonomy.\nThe proposed criteria are helpful in analyzing empirical evidence, informing research investigations and guiding clinical decision-making.

A clear sense of strangeness could also be experienced in the \"dreamy state\" (\"jamais vu\"). Jackson himself did not use these French terms, but he was quite clear about the vivid feelings of strangeness and familiarity, which can occur in both normal and pathological conditions. In order to explore some of the exchanges between medical and nonmedical vocabularies, we examine the historical origins of this technical concept. By basing the study on European (medical and nonmedical) literature of the nineteenth century, we review the first descriptions of this state and compare them with the famous Hughlings-Jackson definitions.

As an empirical starting point for an examination of the possible forms of reciprocity between patients and nurses in psychiatry, we chose two qualitative in-depth interviews with two different patients. The manners in which these two patients relate to medical personnel--one is dependent, the other is independent--show that this presents challenges to nurses. The theoretical context is provided by the notion of mature care as it has been developed by feminist-oriented ethics of care, in contrast to the notion of altruistic care. In relation to the concept of mature care, we discuss how nursing can be perceived in demanding relationships with patients in psychiatry. Reciprocity implies that, in principle, the interests of the nurses also matter in a nurse-patient relationship. We show that reciprocity--in practice--is complicated and challenging in a number of different ways. Mature care--with its systematic inclusion of relationships and reciprocity--provides an alternative understanding of what takes place between patients and nurses compared with an altruistic notion of care. As such, mature care can be regarded as an useful paradigm for nurse-patient relationships in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Jean-Martin Charcot at the birth of Russian neurology.", "Abstract": "Russian neurology was virtually nonexistent in the middle of the 19th century which made a traineeship abroad an absolute necessity.

After returning home, young Russian doctors not only implemented everything they had learned in Western Europe, but proceeded to make their own original contributions. The most talented pupils of Charcot, including such prominent names as Kozhevnikov, Korsakov, Minor, Bekhterev and Darkshevich, became the founders of neurological schools in Russia. They laid the basis for the further development of neurology and psychiatry.

The aim of this study was to explore phenomenology occurring in patients with delirium referred to an old age psychiatry consultation-liaison setting and compare with delirium occurring in palliative care patients.\nConsecutive cases of DSM-IV delirium were assessed with the Delirium Rating scale Revised-98 (DRS-R98) and Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD).\nEighty patients (mean age 79.3 \u00b1 7.7 years; mean DRS-R98 total score 21.7 \u00b1 4.9 and total CTD score 10.2 \u00b1 6.3) were included. Forty patients (50%) with comorbid dementia were older, had a longer duration of symptoms at referral, and more severe delirium due to greater cognitive impairments. Inattention (100%) was the most prominent cognitive disturbance, while sleep-wake cycle disturbance (98%), altered motor activity (97%), and thought process abnormality (96%) were the most frequent DRS-R98 non-cognitive features. Inattention was associated with severity of other cognitive disturbances on both the DRS-R98 and CTD, but not with DRS-R98 non-cognitive items. The phenomenological profile was similar to palliative care but with more severe delirium due to greater cognitive and non-cognitive disturbance.\nDelirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with generalized cognitive impairment and disproportionate inattention.

It is used clinically in many countries, as well as in research, but studies have shown several problems with GAF, for example concerning its validity and reliability. Guidelines for rating are important. The present study aimed to identify the current status of guidelines for rating GAF, and relevant factors and gaps in knowledge for the development of improved guidelines.\nA thorough literature search was conducted.\nFew studies of existing guidelines have been conducted; existing guidelines are short; and rating has a subjective element. Seven main categories were identified as being important in relation to further development of guidelines: (1) general points about guidelines for rating GAF; (2) introduction to guidelines, with ground rules; (3) starting scoring at the top, middle or bottom level of the scale; (4) scoring for different time periods and of different values (highest, lowest or average); (5) the finer grading of the scale; (6) different guidelines for different conditions; and (7) different languages and cultures. Little information is available about how rules for rating are understood by different raters: the final score may be affected by whether the rater starts at the top, middle or bottom of the scale; there is little data on which value/combination of GAF values to record; guidelines for scoring within 10-point intervals are limited; there is little empirical information concerning the suitability of existing guidelines for different conditions and patient characteristics; and little is known about the effects of translation into different languages or of different cultural understanding.\nFew studies have dealt specifically with guidelines for rating GAF.

The aim of this review article is to examine the current evidence on nonliteral/figurative language (proverb, metaphor, metonymy, idiom, irony, sarcasm) comprehension in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. A comprehensive literature search identified 25 studies (16 proverb, 3 metaphor, 0 metonymy, 5 idiom, 3 sarcasm) on nonliteral language comprehension in dementia. Studies predominantly indicate a deficit. Most studies investigated Alzheimer's dementia. Applied correctly, nonliteral language is a worthwhile diagnostic tool to evaluate language and abstract thinking in dementias. During assessment, familiarity testing (e.g., by asking \"are you familiar with the proverb XY\") is obligatory. Still, future research is needed in several areas: evidence on decline of nonliteral language over the course of the illness is limited.

The variables that were most frequently associated with aggression or violence in the 66 identified studies of unselected psychiatric populations were the existence of previous episodes, the presence of impulsiveness/hostility, a longer period of hospitalisation, non-voluntary admission, and aggressor and victim of the same gender; weaker evidence indicated alcohol/drug misuse, a diagnosis of psychosis, a younger age and the risk of suicide. Alcohol/drug misuse, hostility, paranoid thoughts and acute psychosis were the factors most frequently involved in 12 studies of psychotic patients.

Although PMD have been widely recognised for many decades, their precise cause is still unknown and there are no definitive, universally accepted diagnostic criteria. To consider this issue, an international multidisciplinary group of experts met at a face-to-face consensus meeting to review current definitions and diagnostic criteria for PMD. This was followed by extensive correspondence. The consensus group formally became established as the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD). The inaugural meeting of the ISPMD was held in Montreal in September 2008. The primary aim was to provide a unified approach for the diagnostic criteria of PMD, their quantification and guidelines on clinical trial design. This report summarises their recommendations.

It is also hoped that the proposed definitions and guidelines could be used by all clinicians and investigators to provide a consistent approach to the diagnosis and treatment of PMD and to aid scientific and clinical research in this field."}, {"Title": "Animal models of epigenetic regulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Epigenetics describes the phenomenon of heritable changes in gene regulation that are governed by non-Mendelian processes, primarily through biochemical modifications to chromatin structure that occur during cell development and differentiation. Numerous lines of evidence link abnormal levels of chromatin modifications (either to DNA, histones, or both) in patients with a wide variety of diseases including cancer, psychiatry, neurodegeneration, metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Drugs that target the proteins controlling chromatin modifications can modulate the expression of clusters of genes, potentially offering higher therapeutic efficacy than classical agents with single target pharmacologies that are susceptible to biochemical pathway degeneracy. Here, we summarize recent research linking epigenetic dysregulation with diseases in neurosciences, the application of relevant animal models, and the potential for small molecule modulator development to facilitate target discovery, validation and translation into clinical treatments."}, {"Title": "[Professional misconduct in therapeutic relationships: developing critical attitudes in the medical community].", "Abstract": "Already the Hippocratic Oath defines maintaining boundaries in the physician-patient relationship as an essential part of medical care: \"\u2026In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or men, be they free or slaves\u2026\". The World Psychiatric Association's Declaration of Madrid 1996 specifically comments on boundary issues of physician-patient relationships in psychiatry. Boundary violations in any kind of therapeutic relationship - not only regarding psychotherapy - are both relevant and tabooed. There are hardly any options for patients concerned to find appropriate therapeutic and legal support. A public positioning of the medical profession seems to be very important.

Behavioural sensitisation found in suicide group but not in controls.", "Abstract": "Those who die by suicide and suffer from depression are known to have made more suicide attempts during their life-span as compared to other people with depression. A behavioural sensitisation or kindling model has been proposed for suicidal behaviour, in accordance with a sensitisation model of depressive episodes. The aim of the present study was to test such a model by investigating the distribution of initial and repeated suicide attempts across the depressive episodes in suicides and controls with a unipolar severe depression.\nA blind record evaluation was performed of 80 suicide victims and controls admitted to the Department of Psychiatry between 1956 and 1969 and monitored to 2010. The occurrence of initial and repeated suicide attempts by order of the depressive episodes was compared for suicides and controls.\nThe risk of a first suicide attempt decreased throughout the later episodes of depression in both the suicide group (p < .000) and control group (p < .000). The frequencies of repetition early in the course were actually higher in the control group (p < .007). After that, the risk decreased in the control group, while the frequencies remained proportional in the suicide group. At the same time, there was a significantly greater decreased risk of repeated attempts during later episodes in the control group as compared to the suicide group (p < .000). The differences were found despite a similar number of episodes in suicides and controls.\nRepeated suicide attempts in the later episodes of depression appear to be a risk factor for suicide in severe depression. This finding is compatible with a behavioural sensitisation of attempts across the depressive episodes, which seemed to be independent of a corresponding kindling of depression."}, {"Title": "Teaching motivational interviewing skills to third-year psychiatry clerkship students.", "Abstract": "despite a large percentage of health care costs being related to smoking, obesity, and substance abuse, most physicians are not confident in motivating patients to change health behaviors.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested as disease modulators for both CVD and MDD. Therefore, we studied whether polyunsaturated fatty acids and the Omega-3 Index may represent markers for assessment of the cardiovascular risk in somatically healthy patients suffering from MDD.\nWe conducted a case-control study from July 2004 to December 2007 in 166 adults (86 inpatients with MDD but without CVD from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and 80 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from an outpatient clinic of the Division of Preventive Cardiology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany). Information gathered at baseline included MDD diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria, depression ratings, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, and fatty acid and interleukin-6 determinations. Fatty acid composition was analyzed according to the HS-Omega-3 Index methodology. During the study, patients received no supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids. The main inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-IV and a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score of at least 17. Treatment response and remission were defined using the HDRS-17.\nSeveral conventional risk factors such as high triglyceride (mean, 152 mg/dL vs 100 mg/dL; P < .001) and fasting glucose (mean, 96 mg/dL vs 87 mg/dL; P = .005) values as well as greater waist circumference (mean, 97 cm vs 87 cm; P = .019) and higher body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2); mean, 26 vs 24; P = .011) were more prevalent in MDD patients in comparison with controls. The Omega-3 Index (mean, 3.9% vs 5.1%; P < .001) and individual omega-3 fatty acids were significantly lower in MDD patients. An Omega-3 Index < 4% was associated with high concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (\u03c7(2) = 7.8, P = .02).\nConventional cardiovascular risk factors, the Omega-3 Index, and interleukin-6 levels indicated an elevated cardiovascular risk profile in MDD patients currently free of CVD. Our results support the employment of strategies to reduce the cardiovascular risk in still cardiovascularly healthy MDD patients by targeting conventional risk factors and the Omega-3 Index."}, {"Title": "Pathway-based analysis of GWAS datasets: effective but caution required.", "Abstract": "Pathway-based analysis is rapidly emerging as an alternative but powerful approach for searching for disease causal genes from genomic datasets and has been applied to many complex diseases recently, but it is only now beginning to be applied in psychiatry.

For the first time German local newspapers were examined with respect to HOW and HOW OFTEN they use psychiatric terminology.\nAll newspapers of the East German Altmark were analyzed with respect to their usage of selected psychiatric terms for a period of one year. None of these newspapers could be described as tabloids or as predominantly sensation-seeking. For comparative purposes, our chosen methodology was similar to that of an earlier study of respected, German, internationally-read print media.\nIn 14 % of the newspapers studied, at least one term of the predefined psychiatric vocabulary appeared. A negative context was common (45 %), but for the most part this was in crime-related articles supplied by press agencies. In contrast with reputable, German language newspapers with a nationwide or international audience, in purely local reports, a negative context was rare, and no alienating usage of preselected psychiatric terms was found.\nLocal editorial teams seem to be closer to - and perhaps better informed about - regional psychiatric institutions. Hence, they can provide the public with more factual information.

In this context the functional connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to other areas of the affect regulation circuit is of interest. The aim of this study was to identify neural changes during antidepressant treatment and correlates associated with the treatment outcome. In an exploratory analysis it was investigated whether functional connectivity measures moderated a response to mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Twenty-three drug-free patients with MDD were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich. The patients were subjected to a 4-wk randomized clinical trial with two common antidepressants, venlafaxine or mirtazapine. Functional connectivity of the OFC, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging with an emotional face-matching task, was measured before and after the trial. Higher OFC connectivity with the left motor areas and the OFC regions prior to the trial characterized responders (p<0.05, false discovery rate). The treatment non-responders were characterized by higher OFC-cerebellum connectivity. The strength of response was positively correlated with functional coupling between left OFC and the caudate nuclei and thalami. Differences in longitudinal changes were detected between venlafaxine and mirtazapine treatment in the motor areas, cerebellum, cingulate gyrus and angular gyrus. These results indicate that OFC functional connectivity might be useful as a marker for therapy response to mirtazapine and venlafaxine and to reconstruct the differences in their mechanism of action."}, {"Title": "Current research in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging: highlights of the 23rd Annual EANM Congress.", "Abstract": "The most recent research developments in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging were presented at the 2010 Annual Congress of the EANM.

First, the neuroanatomical and functional overlap between pain and emotion/reward/motivation brain circuitry suggests integration and mutual modulation of these systems. Second, psychiatric disorders are commonly associated with alterations in pain processing, whereas chronic pain may impair emotional and neurocognitive functioning. Third, given its stressful nature, pain may serve as a functional probe for unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms inherent in psychiatric morbidity.\nPain training in psychiatry will contribute to deeper and more sophisticated insight into both pain syndromes and general psychiatric morbidity regardless of patients' pain status. Furthermore, it will ease the artificial boundaries separating psychiatric and medical formulations of brain disorders, thus fostering cross-fertilizing interactions among specialists in various disciplines entrusted with the care of patients experiencing pain."}, {"Title": "Revisiting the diagnosis of schizophrenia: where have we been and where are we going?", "Abstract": "Appropriate and reliable classification of mental illness is crucial for advancing the field of psychiatry as agreement on diagnosis has broad implications for treatment of mental disorders and research into the etiopathophysiology of mental disorders.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate several validity aspects of the NPD construct.\nThe material consisted of data from 2277 patients (80% of whom had a personality disorder [PD]) who were admitted to units connected to The Norwegian Network of Psychotherapeutic Day Hospitals. The Axis II diagnoses were assessed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, Fourth Edition, Axis II Personality Disorders.\nThe frequency of NPD was very low (0.8%). Male patients were overrepresented both on a diagnostic level and on criteria levels. The NPD category was positively associated with other cluster B disorders and negatively associated with avoidant PD. The criteria \"demands excessive admiration\" and \"fantasies of unlimited success\" correlated almost as highly with the histrionic PD category and loaded primarily on a histrionic factor. The dominant NPD factor also included the antisocial criterion of \"showing no regret having injured others.\" The major part of the patients' personality pathology could be attributed to other PD criteria.\nThe results challenge the notion of NPD as a distinct diagnostic category. Rather, narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the whole range of PDs. The results support the views put forward by Russ et al (Refining the construct of narcissistic personality disorder: diagnostic criteria and subtypes. Am J Psychiatry 2008;11:1473-1481) that what clinicians conceive as narcissism consists of several subtypes (dimensions). Our data support the existence of a grandiose/malignant type and an exhibitionistic type. Unfortunately, there was no measure of hypersensitivity. The proposal to delete NPD as a prototype category in the DSM, Fifth Edition, seems well justified. However, the proposed trait domain of antagonism in the DSM, Fifth Edition, seems to account better for the grandiose/malignant dimension than the exhibitionistic/histrionic dimension."}, {"Title": "Methylphenidate but not atomoxetine or citalopram modulates inhibitory control and response time variability.", "Abstract": "Response inhibition is a prototypical executive function of considerable clinical relevance to psychiatry.

Participants performed the task under each of the four drug conditions across four consecutive sessions.\nMethylphenidate led to a reduction in both response time variability and stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), indicating enhanced response inhibition compared with all other drug conditions. Crucially, the enhancement of response inhibition by MPH occurred without concomitant changes in overall response speed, arguing against a simple enhancement of processing speed. We found no significant differences between ATM and PLAC, CIT and PLAC, or ATM and CIT for either response time variability or SSRT.\nAn acute dose of MPH but not ATM or CIT was able to improve SSRT and reduce response time variability in nonclinical participants. Improvements in response inhibition and response variability might underlie the reported clinical benefits of MPH in disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder."}, {"Title": "[Future Psychiatry: a \"Think Tank\" for the Italian Psychiatry].", "Abstract": "The Future Psychiatry Project was founded with the goal to address the critical ratio of research/training / clinic.

Dreaming about insects has a peculiar history, marked by our desire to explain a dream's significance and by the tactic of evoking emotions by injecting insects in dream-related works of art, film, music, and literature.

Here, we examine this critical issue of informed consent for DBS research using available evidence regarding decision-making capacity and depression. Further, we explore the implications of the nature of TRD as well as that of the intervention (invasive brain surgery) for informed consent.

Kraepelin's twin pillars have governed psychiatric thinking, practice and research for over a century. However, a growing number of researchers, clinicians, and mental health service users argue contest the claim that there are fundamental differences between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and call for a symptom-led approach which prioritises subjective experience over diagnostic category. How can the published first-person accounts of experts by experience contribute to this debate? This short paper looks at the representation of psychiatric diagnosis in two much-lauded autobiographies: Kurt Snyder's <i>Me, Myself, and Them: A Firsthand Account of One Young Person's Experience with Schizophrenia</i> (2007) and Elyn Saks' <i>The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness</i> (2007). As well as providing a prognosis and a plan for treatment, the psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia, for both these writers, gives shape and meaning to the illness experience and ultimately becomes the pivot or platform from which identity and memoir unfold. Saks and Snyder do not claim to speak for all people who receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia and it would be a mistake to read their texts in this way even if they did. But if the debate about the future of psychiatric nosology is going to respect subjective experience, the insights they and others offer in to the multiple meanings and effects of psychiatric diagnosis more than compel our attention."}, {"Title": "Challenges and Solutions for Latin American-Trained International Medical Graduates in Psychiatry Residency.", "Abstract": "Latin American-trained IMGs in psychiatry face multiple challenges that go beyond their medical training. These challenges call for innovative problem-solving. Although the professional development of IMGs has been discussed in the professional literature, little is written about their experiences. In this case study report, a group of IMGs reflect on their experiences and describe how they solved challenges.\nUsing cogenerative ethnography, four IMGs trained in Colombia, Dominican Republic and Mexico provided insights on their challenges and solutions while adapting to psychiatric residency training. Individual interviews, focused discussion, focus groups, and written reports were analyzed using data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing techniques.\nWe illustrate the challenges of IMG training in psychiatry using their reflections and stories. We categorized these challenges into three domains: immigration and acculturation; social adjustment; and medical training. Quotes were selected to illustrate IMGs' challenges and coping strategies.\nSome of the combined cultural, social and academic challenges of Latin American-trained IMGs in psychiatry are described. Recognizing and planning for the personal challenges of IMGs in psychiatry can enhance the transition into psychiatric training. Ultimately, improvements in IMG training converts into improved healthcare for all patients."}, {"Title": "Pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder: present recommendations and future prospects.", "Abstract": "In selecting and adapting medications to treat the specific clinical features of a patient with bipolar disorder (BPD) over time, a foundation strategy is to have good working knowledge of up-to-date practice guidelines. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry Guidelines has the reasoned advantage of weighing safety/tolerability as high as efficacy. Most successful treatments for BPD start to separate from placebo within 1 week; most differences between regimens occur within the first 4 weeks. This observation extrapolates to a strategy of discontinuing or adding a second drug for symptoms unimproved within 1 month of treatment initiation. The weight of evidence argues against starting treatment with combination regimens, despite evidence that over time most patients do receive combination drug regimens and appear to tolerate them well. The current design paradigm for adjunctive trials generally strongly weights trials in favor of the sponsor drug.Well managed, BPD is often compatible with fully good health, both symptomatically and functionally. Consequently, for whatever regimens are found to accomplish excellent symptom control, it is important to achieve regimens that are well tolerated by all bodily systems. This chapter emphasizes the tactics needed to accomplish this specific to individual medications. The chapter also addresses the serious, broad failure of pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs with novel mechanisms for BPD therapy and proposes a series of steps that might reenergize drug development to the benefit of psychiatrists and patients alike."}, {"Title": "Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis in Psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack NMDA (<i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate)-type glutamate receptors at central neuronal synapses. Symptoms include a highly characteristic set of neurologic deficits, but also prominent psychiatric manifestations that often bring mental health professionals into the course of care. Distinct phases of illness have become increasingly appreciated, and include a range of psychotic symptoms early in the course of the disease followed by more severe fluctuations in consciousness with neurologic involvement, and ultimately protracted cognitive and behavioral deficits. Young women are most commonly impacted and an ovarian teratoma is sometimes associated with the syndrome. Patients respond well to immunotherapy, but psychiatric symptoms can be challenging to manage.

This prevalence rate is related to many factors including drug dependence. This study was conducted in people wounded during the Iran-Iraq war with PTSD, in order to compare the risk of suicide in those with and without drug and nicotine dependence.\nThis cross-sectional study, conducted in 2007-2008, comprised 104 male individuals who had participated in the Iran-Iraq war and had a current diagnosis of PTSD. They had been referred to a psychiatry hospital and the psychiatrists' offices in Kerman, Iran. Three questionnaires were used including Davidson Trauma Scale, California Risk Estimator for Suicide and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence to assess the severity of PTSD, the risk of suicide, and nicotine dependence, respectively. Data were analyzed by descriptive and analytical statistics using chi-square, regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), student-t and correlation tests.\nThe severity of PTSD was significantly different in individuals with low to moderate dependence on cigarette smoking than in those with heavy dependence on smoking (P = 0.002). However, the corresponding figures were not significantly different in individuals with and without substance abuse. Although the risk of suicide had no significant difference among individuals with low to moderate dependence on cigarettes compared to those with high nicotine dependence, it was higher in subjects with substance abuse than in those without it (P = 0.0001).\nOur findings suggest that dependence on cigarettes may not play a role in increasing the risk of suicide, whereas the dependence on opium and its derivatives may increase this risk. Therefore, prevention and treatment of drug abuse may be effective on the incidence of suicide in patients with war injuries and PTSD."}, {"Title": "Psychological status in patients seeking rhinoplasty.", "Abstract": "Rhinoplasty is the most common operation performed by our facial plastic surgery unit.

Data abstracted included demographic variables, multi-axial diagnoses (DSM-IV-TR), length of treatment, psychotropic medications, and number of medications discontinued because of side effects. Improvement in level of function with treatment was measured by change in global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores.\nOf 737 records reviewed, 37 (5%) contained a diagnosis of somatoform disorder. The most common comorbidities in the somatoform group were depression (P < .01), hypertension (P < .01), and arthritis (P < .05). The somatoform group was significantly more likely to have a chronic medical illness (P < .01) and history of surgeries (P < .05). The somatoform group patients' \u0394GAF was one fourth the \u0394GAF scores in all other psychiatric outpatients (1.41 vs 6.79, P < .01). The somatoform group changed medications more often because of side effects (1.35 times vs 0.71 times, P < .01), received a greater number of psychotropic medications (2.05 vs 1.62, P < .05), and was more likely to be taking an antidepressant (P < .05) than the nonsomatoform group.\nSomatoform disorder patients had a higher prevalence of depression, chronic medical conditions, and surgeries. They responded less favorably to treatment when compared to patients without a somatoform disorder, and manifested a decreased tolerance to medication side effects.

Some quantitative sampling of psychiatric journals provides one framework for understanding the history of psychiatry and, to some extent, the history of medicine in general in the twentieth century. After World War II, extreme national isolation of psychiatric communities gave way to substantial transnationalisation, especially in the 1980s, when a remarkable switch to English-language communication became obvious.

Missing follow-up information is a critical problem and may impede or bias the analysis of study data and result in delays. Moreover, additional patient recruitment may be necessary due to incomplete follow-up data. Current electronic data capture (EDC) systems in clinical studies are usually separated from hospital information systems (HIS) and therefore can provide limited functionality to support clinical workflow. In two case studies, we assessed the feasibility of HIS-based support of follow-up documentation.\nWe have developed a data model and a HIS-based workflow to provide follow-up forms according to clinical study protocols. If a follow-up form was due, a database procedure created a follow-up event which was translated by a communication server into an HL7 message and transferred to the import interface of the clinical information system (CIS). This procedure generated the required follow-up form and enqueued a link to it in a work list of the relating study nurses and study physicians, respectively.\nA HIS-based follow-up system automatically generated follow-up forms as defined by a clinical study protocol. These forms were scheduled into work lists of study nurses and study physicians. This system was integrated into the clinical workflow of two clinical studies. In a study from nuclear medicine, each scenario from the test concept according to the protocol of the single photon emission computer tomography/computer tomography (SPECT/CT) study was simulated and each scenario passed the test. For a study in psychiatry, 128 follow-up forms were automatically generated within 27 weeks, on average five forms per week (maximum 12, minimum 1 form per week).\nHIS-based support of follow-up documentation in clinical studies is technically feasible and can support compliance with study protocols."}, {"Title": "Depressive symptoms associated with changes in circadian rhythms. Concordance in perception between doctor and patient, clinical impact and its response to current antidepressant drugs.", "Abstract": "This is a descriptive, transversal and multicenter study using self-administered surveys concurrently to collect the opinions of two groups (psychiatrists and patients) and discuss their disagreements. The scope of study are hospital services, outpatient centers, individual professional consultation and other assistance system, public or private, which provides psychiatric care in Spain. Participated in this study 319 psychiatrists and 957 patients with the diagnosis of depression, stratified by autonomous communities. The populations they are intended to infer the results of this study were all patients diagnosed with depression and antidepressant treatment, and the group of specialists in psychiatry responsible for clinical monitoring at the national level. In the study sample, depressive symptoms related to circadian rhythms are very common: they are perceived by more than 65% of patients surveyed, except the \u00abearly morning awakening insomnia\u00bb (54%) and \u00abfatigue, anergy and unresponsiveness\u00bb (37%). In general, and endorsing the study hypothesis, the prevalence of almost all analyzed depressive symptoms is significantly underestimated by psychiatrists about the perception of the patients themselves. Only the presence of \u00abfatigue, anergy and unresponsiveness\u00bb is more often observed by professionals than by patients, perhaps by nature be of particular somatic symptoms that may suggest to the clinician to rule out underlying organic pathology. In light of the results presented it is concluded that disturbances in circadian rhythms are core aspects of depression and frequent cause of key symptoms and residual symptoms of patients in treatment. These disorders appear to be underestimated by professionals and only partially solved with existing antidepressant drugs."}, {"Title": "Ethics in Psychiatric Research: A Review of 25 Years of NIH-funded Empirical Research Projects.", "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: This paper reviews the past 25 years of empirical research funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on matters of ethics in psychiatric research. METHODS: Using the NIH RePORTER and Medline databases, we identified 43 grants and 77 publications that involved the empirical study of a matter of ethics in research involving mental health service users. RESULTS: These articles provide original and useful information on important topics, most especially the capacity to consent and the voluntariness of consent. For example, participants who share a diagnosis vary widely in levels of cognitive impairment that correlate with decisional capacity, and capacity to consent can be enhanced easily using iterative consent processes. Few articles address matters of justice or benefits in research, particularly from the perspectives of participants. No articles address matters of privacy, confidentiality, or researcher professionalism. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the usefulness of data from the studies conducted to date, current research on research ethics in psychiatry does not adequately address the concerns of service users as expressed in recent publications."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant-induced akathisia-related homicides associated with diminishing mutations in metabolizing genes of the CYP450 family.", "Abstract": "To examine the relation between variant alleles in 3 CYP450 genes (CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19), interacting drugs and akathisia in subjects referred to a forensic psychiatry practice in Sydney, Australia.\nThis paper concerns 10/129 subjects who had been referred to the first author's practice for expert opinion or treatment. More than 120 subjects were diagnosed with akathisia/serotonin toxicity after taking psychiatric medication that had been prescribed for psychosocial distress. They were tested for variant alleles in CYP450 genes, which play a major role in Phase I metabolism of all antidepressant and many other medications. Eight had committed homicide and many more became extremely violent while on antidepressants. Ten representative case histories involving serious violence are presented in detail.\nVariant CYP450 allele frequencies were higher in akathisia subjects compared with random primary care patients tested at the same facility. Ten subjects described in detail had variant alleles for one or more of their tested CYP450 genes. All but two were also on interacting drugs, herbals or illicit substances, impairing metabolism further. All those described were able to stop taking antidepressants and return to their previously normal personalities.\nTHE PERSONAL, MEDICAL, AND LEGAL PROBLEMS ARISING FROM OVERUSE OF ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS AND RESULTING TOXICITY RAISE THE QUESTION: how can such toxicity events be understood and prevented? The authors suggest that the key lies in understanding the interplay between the subject's CYP450 genotype, substrate drugs and doses, co-prescribed inhibitors and inducers and the age of the subject.

Discussion exists on whether with this population treatment guidelines for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be followed and Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) should be applied, or whether a phased model starting with stabilisation is preferable. Some clinicians fear that trauma-focused interventions may lead to unmanageable distress or may be ineffective. While cognitive-behavioural interventions have been found to be effective with traumatised refugees, no studies concerning the efficacy of EMDR with this population have been conducted as yet.\nIn preparation for a randomised trial comparing EMDR and stabilisation with traumatised refugees, a pilot study with 20 participants was conducted. The objective was to examine feasibility of participation in a randomised trial for this complex population and to examine acceptability and preliminary efficacy of EMDR.\nParticipants were randomly allocated to 11 sessions of either EMDR or stabilisation. Symptoms of PTSD (SCID-I, HTQ), depression and anxiety (HSCL-25), and quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) were assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 3-month follow-up.\nParticipation of traumatised refugees in the study was found feasible, although issues associated with complex traumatisation led to a high pre-treatment attrition and challenges in assessments. Acceptability of EMDR was found equal to that of stabilisation with a high drop-out for both conditions. No participants dropped out of the EMDR condition because of unmanageable distress. While improvement for EMDR participants was small, EMDR was found to be no less efficacious than stabilisation. Different symptom courses between the two conditions, with EMDR showing some improvement and stabilisation showing some deterioration between pre-treatment and post-treatment, justify the conduct of a full trial.\nWith some adaptations in study design, inclusion of a greater sample is justifiable to determine which treatment is more suitable for this complex population."}, {"Title": "BDNF polymorphism predicts the rate of decline in skilled task performance and hippocampal volume in healthy individuals.", "Abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated a link between the presence of polymorphism in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive and affective disorders. However, only a few have studied these effects longitudinally along with structural changes in the brain. This study was carried out to investigate whether valine-to-methionine substitution at position 66 (val66met) of pro-BDNF could be linked to alterations in the rate of decline in skilled task performance and structural changes in hippocampal volume. Participants consisted of 144 healthy Caucasian pilots (aged 40-69 years) who completed a minimum of 3 consecutive annual visits. Standardized flight simulator score (SFSS) was measured as a reliable and quantifiable indicator for skilled task performance. In addition, a subset of these individuals was assessed for hippocampal volume alterations using magnetic resonance imaging. We found that val66met substitution in BDNF correlated longitudinally with the rate of decline in SFSS. Structurally, age-dependent hippocampal volume changes were also significantly altered by this substitution. Our study suggests that val66met polymorphism in BDNF can be linked to the rate of decline in skilled task performance. Furthermore, this polymorphism could be used as a predictor of the effects of age on the structure of the hippocampus in healthy individuals. Such results have implications for understanding possible disabilities in older adults performing skilled tasks who are at a higher risk for cognitive and affective disorders.Translational Psychiatry (2011) 1, e51; doi:10.1038/tp.2011.47; published online 25 October 2011."}, {"Title": "Excess of serotonin affects neocortical pyramidal neuron migration.", "Abstract": "The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key molecule involved in the homeostasis of extracellular levels of serotonin and is regulated developmentally. Genetic deletion of SERT in rodents increases extracellular levels of serotonin and affects cellular processes involved in neocortical circuit assembly such as barrel cortex wiring and cortical interneuron migration. Importantly, pharmacological blockade of SERT during brain development leads to phenotypes relevant to psychiatry in rodents and to an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders in humans. Furthermore, developmental adversity interacts with genetically-driven variations of serotonin function in humans and nonhuman primates to increase the risk for a variety of stress-related phenotypes. In this study, we investigate whether an excess of serotonin affects the migration of neocortical pyramidal neurons during development. Using in utero electroporation combined with time-lapse imaging to specifically monitor pyramidal neurons during late mouse embryogenesis, we show that an excess of serotonin reversibly affects the radial migration of pyramidal neurons. We further identify that the serotonin receptor 5-HT(6) is expressed in pyramidal neuron progenitors and that 5-HT(6) receptor activation replicates the effects of serotonin stimulation. Finally, we show that the positioning of superficial layer pyramidal neurons is altered in vivo in SERT knockout mice. Taken together, these results indicate that a developmental excess of serotonin decreases the migration speed of cortical pyramidal neurons, affecting a fundamental step in the assembly of neural circuits. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental dysregulation of serotonin homeostasis has detrimental effects on neocortical circuit formation and contributes to increased vulnerability to psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Decanalization, brain development and risk of schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Waddington's original description of canalization refers to the ability of an organism to maintain phenotypic fidelity in the face of environmental and/or genetic perturbation.

Recently derived brain structures in our species, such as the expanded neocortex, may be more vulnerable to decanalization because there has been insufficient time to evolve buffering capacity. On the basis of modern notions of decanalization, we provide perspectives on selected environmental and genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, and we discuss strengths and weaknesses of this conceptual framework.

Of the respondents, 194 (91%) reported that they would support a general policy on shared care between primary care and specialized psychiatric services for patients who are stable on their treatment. However, 181 (85%) reported that they foresaw difficulties for patients in implementing such a policy including: increased financial burden on some patients (141, 66%); some patients may lack confidence in GP care (100, 47%); primary care is not adequately resourced with allied health professionals to support provision of psychiatric care (128, 60%); primary care providers are not adequately trained to provide psychiatric care (111, 52%); and lack of adequate cooperation between primary care and specialized mental health services (96, 45%).\nThe Irish government and the Colleges of General Practitioners and Psychiatrists in Ireland need to work together to remove the bottlenecks that hinder the active involvement of primary care in the management of patients with enduring mental health difficulties. Also, the health care systems need to be organized along a shared care model to facilitate effective collaboration between primary and specialized psychiatric services."}, {"Title": "Empirical evaluations of slice-timing, smoothing, and normalization effects in seed-based, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses.", "Abstract": "Recently, functional connectivity analyses using spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) fluctuations have been applied in the context of neurological and psychiatry diseases. In the analyses procedure, preprocessing steps are commonly utilized in exploring functional connectivity, the same strategy as what was conducted in the fMRI process. However, the effectiveness of these preprocessing steps on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was rarely investigated, and the significance of preprocessing steps on rs-fMRI needs to be studied. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of multiple preprocessing procedures, including slice-timing correction, smoothing, and spatial normalization, on rs-fMRI signal. Through a seed-based correlation analysis on the motor network, we empirically estimated three indices of spontaneous fMRI fluctuations induced: correlation coefficients (CC), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs), and fractional ALFF (fALFF), with different strategies of three preprocessing steps. Multiple repetition times (TRs = 2, 3, 4\u2009sec) were also compared to address the issue of temporal mismatch. In the temporal preprocess, we found that the use of slice-timing correction and different TRs had minimal effects on CC and fALFF. However, ALFF was significantly affected using different TR but not affected by slice-timing correction as well. In the spatial preprocess, fALFF was insensitive to both smoothing and normalization. Smoothing consistently increased spatial extents and CC, but suppressed ALFF values. Performing normalization before index calculations provided better spatial sensitivity with larger variability in ALFF, whereas performing normalization after index calculations might preserve the ALFF level as in the unnormalized data. Conclusively, the effects of choosing preprocessing parameters and strategies were presented in the current study, providing practical considerations when conducting rs-fMRI analyses."}, {"Title": "[Socialistic university policy between demand and reality--the example of Hans Heygster at the Rostock University Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology].", "Abstract": "The extent and boundaries of political influence are a central issue in the history of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). After 1945 socialist leaders attempted to exert political influence on education in the Soviet occupied zone and the later GDR. The Second University Reform in 1951/52 introduced a fundamental break with established university structures. One major aim was the establishment of a \"new socialist intelligentsia\" that was to spread the Marxist-Leninist theories at universities. Due to a lack of qualified personnel in the medical faculties, this aim was far from being reached until the end of the 1950s. The example of the university lecturer Hans Heygster (1905-1961), who worked at the East-German University Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology in Rostock between 1946 and 1953, shows how the GDR rulers sought to influence university education. It illustrates the opportunities and restrictions that University lecturers in East Germany faced during this time. Heygster soon found himself in real conflict, namely between political aims and demands set and reality. Based on of archival sources the study elaborates the background, the course of events and the consequences of these conflicts."}, {"Title": "Antidepressant drugs in children and adolescents: analytical and demographic data in a naturalistic, clinical study.", "Abstract": "Pharmacokinetics of antidepressant drugs (ATDs), in terms of steady-state and trough values, in patients from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry centers in the midsouth-eastern part of Sweden, were evaluated, and the use of ATDs in this population were described. Patients to be prescribed an ATD were studied between 2002 and 2004. Two hundred eleven children, 64% girls and 36% boys (ages 8-20 years) were evaluated. The primary indication for the antidepressant treatment was depression in 69% of subjects. The median body mass index was 20.2 kg/m\u00b2 (range, 12.4-38.6 kg/m\u00b2). Suspected adverse drug reactions were spontaneously reported in 31% (no serious). Monotherapy was indicated in 49% of request forms. The most common drug combination with the ATD was oral contraceptives. The concentrations of drugs in the patient evaluated population to referenced data for adults from the dose administered were as expected in 63%, higher than expected in 26% and lower than expected in 11%. The most prescribed ATD was sertraline (SERT). Dose-concentration relationships for SERT and metabolite desmethylsertraline (DSERT) were seen, rs = 0.48 and rs = 0.5, respectively. No relationship was found between dose and ratio DSERT/SERT. The median daily dose was 50 mg (range, 12.5-150 mg), SERT concentration 16 ng/mL (range, 3-88 ng/mL), and DSERT 33 ng/mL (range, 0-253 ng/mL). CYP2D6*4 was the most common poor metabolizer allele.

The subsequent imposition of the rigid conceptual dichotomy between depression and anxiety strengthened a notion that the focus of psychiatry should be on the 'depression side' of this divide. Having promoted cognitive-behavioural therapy as the best treatment for anxiety disorders, clinical psychologists have largely 'taken over' the anxiety disorders from psychiatrists. It is suggested that psychiatrists' surrender of the anxiety disorders may have negative consequences for the future of psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Symptoms of ADHD and depression in a large adolescent population: co-occurring symptoms and associations to experiences of sexual abuse.", "Abstract": "Symptoms of either attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or depression constitute the most common reasons for contact with child and adolescent psychiatry.

This study assessed the prevalence of clinically relevant psychiatric disorders and their predictors in children referred to a children's hospital for UCP. Psychiatry morbidity was assessed in 134 children, aged 8-17 years, using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-parent version (DISC-P) and the Semi-structured Clinical Interview for Children and Adolescents (SCICA). Clinical relevance was determined using a maladjustment criterion of 61 or lower on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). Pain parameters were measured with standardized questionnaires. Results were analysed by logistic regression. According to the DISC-P, 21% of the children had clinically relevant psychiatric disorders, predominantly anxiety disorders (18%). According to the SCICA, 28% of the children had clinically relevant psychiatric disorders, consisting of anxiety, affective, and disruptive disorders (12, 19, and 9%, respectively). Headache (compared to musculoskeletal pain) was an independent clinical predictor of psychiatric morbidity (OR = 3.10; 95% CI 1.07-8.92, p = 0.04/adjusted OR 2.99; 95% CI 1.02-8.74, p = 0.04).

Therefore, there is a need to study and evaluate effects of certain conditions for anti-aging of the brain. Nutrient supplementation can modify the brain function. The chemistry and function of both the developing and the mature brain are influenced by diet (Fernstrom, Am J Clinical Nutrition 71:1669S-1673S, 2000). Clinical, biochemical, and pathological aspects have shown a correlation between mental symptoms, especially depression and cognitive decline, with high incidence of folate deficiency (Bottiglieri et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 69:562, 2000). In the present study, consequences of folic acid supplementation on brain dysfunction as a result of aging were studied in cerebral cortex, mid brain, and cerebellar regions of rat brain. This study was carried out on 6-, 11-, and 16-month-old rats, which received folic acid at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for a period of 8 weeks. Respective control groups of the same age groups were also taken. At the end of the treatment duration, behavioral studies were performed and later the animals were killed for various biochemical and histological investigations. Results indicated significant improvement in memory as assessed by active avoidance, passive avoidance, and plus maze tests in the folic acid supplemented aged animals. Significant improvement was also seen in the cellular protective mechanisms where by the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes increased in folic acid supplemented group and so was the glutathione content. Increased lipid peroxidation content, a marker of aging, was also found to be decreased during folic acid supplementation in all the three regions of brain in our study. Thus, it can be concluded that folic acid helps in improving the memory status by reducing oxidative stress and maintaining the integrity of neurons during aging."}, {"Title": "High plasma nesfatin-1 level in patients with major depressive disorder.", "Abstract": "In the present study, our aim was to determine the changes in the plasma concentrations of a recently discovered peptide hormone nesfatin-1 in patients with major depressive disorder and then to make a comparison with the control group.\nSubjects in the patient group were randomly selected from Mustafa Kemal University, Medical School, Research and Training Hospital, Psychiatry Department, Outpatient Clinic and subjects in the control group were selected from healthy volunteers.

The predictive model identifies a combination of neural responses to neutral faces, large rewards, and safety cues as nonredundant predictors of depression. Regions of the brain associated with overall classification comprise a complex pattern of areas involved in emotional processing and the analysis of stimulus features.\nOur method of integrating neuroimaging data associated with multiple, symptom-related neural processes can provide a highly accurate algorithm for classification. The integrated biomarker model shows that data associated with both emotional and reward processing are essential for a highly accurate classification of depression. In the future, large-scale studies will need to be conducted to determine the practical applicability of our algorithm as a biomarker-based diagnostic aid."}, {"Title": "Mental health concerns among Canadian physicians: results from the 2007-2008 Canadian Physician Health Study.", "Abstract": "In light of prior reports on the prevalence of stress, depression, and other mental health problems among physicians in training and practice, we examined the mental health concerns of Canadian physicians using data from the 2007-2008 Canadian Physician Health Study.\nAmong 3213 respondents, 5 variables (depressive symptoms during the past year, anhedonia in the past year, mental health concerns making it difficult to handle one's workload in the past month, problems with work-life balance, and poor awareness of resources for mental health problems) were examined in relation to sex, specialty, practice type (solo practice vs group or other practice settings), and practice setting (inner city, urban/suburban, or rural/small town/remote).\nNearly one quarter of physicians reported a 2-week period of depressed mood, and depression was more common among female physicians and general practitioners/family physicians.

In due course, as what often happens with innovations, the concept of dual diagnosis displayed considerable limitations and was progressively replaced by comorbidity. This paper critically reviews the limitations of dual diagnosis and comorbidity and formulates an alternative proposal based on clinimetric methods. In many instances of diagnostic reasoning in psychiatry and in clinical psychology, the process ends with the identification of the disorders and their diagnoses. However, diagnostic end-points, the customary guidance of diagnostic reasoning, should be replaced by the conceptualization of disorders as \"transfer stations,\" which are amenable to longitudinal verification and modification. Indeed, diagnoses might encompass a wide range of manifestations, seriousness, prognosis, and response to treatment that need to be evaluated. A new clinimetric approach which takes advantage of clinimetric methods (including macro-analysis, micro-analysis, staging, and evaluation of subclinical symptoms) is proposed.

Electronic medical records (which included PHQ-9 and EDPS) were abstracted for a final sample of 81 pregnant and 104 postpartum patients (n=185). Psychometric properties were examined among women who met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on clinician diagnoses, as compared to women without any mood disorder diagnosis. Using commonly recommended cut-off scores, both measures had comparable sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for both pregnant and postpartum women. Comparative AUC for ROC contrasts were not significantly different between the two measures. Thus, this study found few significant differences in the performance of the PHQ-9 and EPDS in detecting clinician-diagnosed MDD in a psychiatry outpatient sample of pregnant and postpartum women."}, {"Title": "N-acetylcysteine in psychiatry: current therapeutic evidence and potential mechanisms of action.", "Abstract": "There is an expanding field of research investigating the benefits of alternatives to current pharmacological therapies in psychiatry. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is emerging as a useful agent in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Like many therapies, the clinical origins of NAC are far removed from its current use in psychiatry. Whereas the mechanisms of NAC are only beginning to be understood, it is likely that NAC is exerting benefits beyond being a precursor to the antioxidant, glutathione, modulating glutamatergic, neurotropic and inflammatory pathways. This review outlines the current literature regarding the use of NAC in disorders including addiction, compulsive and grooming disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. N-acetylcysteine has shown promising results in populations with these disorders, including those in whom treatment efficacy has previously been limited. The therapeutic potential of this acetylated amino acid is beginning to emerge in the field of psychiatric research."}, {"Title": "Atypical (second generation) antipsychotic treatment response in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.", "Abstract": "Symptom amelioration in older patients with very late onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) is often difficult, with limited psychotropic response reports yielding variable findings. Information about atypical (second generation) antipsychotic use in this population is scant.\nA consecutive sample of geriatric psychiatry outpatients and inpatients with psychotic disorders were retrospectively identified over a 31-month period based on systematic information abstraction from an electronic medical record (e-record). After exclusion criteria were applied, 8/138 outpatients and 13/362 inpatients met inclusion criteria for VLOSLP and had been naturalistically treated with an atypical antipsychotic during hospitalization or nine months of outpatient care. Mandatorily completed e-record standardized symptom severity response ratings were converted into positive treatment response thresholds.\n38% of outpatients and 77% of inpatients (mean age = 76 years for both groups; mean age of onset of psychosis = 70 years for outpatients and 74 years for inpatients) met criteria for positive treatment response to an atypical antipsychotic (either aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone) with sign/symptom amelioration, rather than eradication.\nVarious atypical antipsychotics at geriatric doses yielded a positive treatment response in nearly two-thirds of VLOSLP patients. Patients with less chronic, more severe symptoms responded at a higher rate.

Nonetheless, the case reports clearly showed that taking a thorough history with the patient, corroborated and supplemented by a close relative or caregiver who has known the patient for at least ten years, still remains the most important diagnostic tool.\nThe three case studies show that in clinical practice ASD can easily be missed in elderly individuals presenting with comorbid psychiatric disorders, potentially causing iatrogenic damage. Although further research on phenotyping and diagnosing ASD in older people is warranted, the most important step at this point is to create a greater awareness of the possibility of ASD in old age among health-care professionals working with people in this age group."}, {"Title": "Living in squalor: neuropsychological function, emotional processing and squalor perception in patients found living in squalor.", "Abstract": "Patients living in squalor have a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses, but these may have a common neural basis involving frontal systems.

This is especially the case in psychiatry when we usually have no direct method of measuring the pathology underlying the disorder being studied but, rather, have to rely on the subjective assessment of psychiatric symptoms. The use of the electroencephalogram (EEG) offers two potential major means of addressing this problem. First it is able to provide direct data relating to neural activity that may be abnormal in certain disorders. As such there are opportunities for utilizing the EEG in a variety of ways as an objective outcome measure. Second there is growing evidence that in certain circumstances the EEG can be used to predict which patients are likely to respond to treatment, thus potentially increasing the power of studies by decreasing non-response rates and increasing mean changes in outcome measure. Both of these uses of the EEG are illustrated in reference to the study of mood disorders and in particular depression and its treatment with antidepressants."}, {"Title": "Qualitative analysis of medical student impressions of a narrative exercise in the third-year psychiatry clerkship.", "Abstract": "Clinical clerkship directors and faculty undertake the challenge of teaching patient-centered communication to students who face the enormous doctor-centered task of learning diagnostic medicine. The authors examined students' written reactions to the narrative exercise, which, drawing from narrative medicine and narrative therapy, challenges students to be more patient-centered by writing a patient's life story and sharing it with that patient.\nDuring one-half of an academic year (2008-2009), the authors used qualitative methods to explore the range of medical student experiences with the narrative exercise in the psychiatry clerkship.\nDuring the study period, 46 medical students completed the exercise, and 44 (96%) submitted 367 comments for the research team to analyze. Four broad categories emerged: (1) communication, (2) insight, (3) hope, and (4) mixed or negative reactions. The most common theme was improved communication, which comprised the subcategories of enhanced active listening, opening up, and relationship building. Improved insights included student insights into their patients, as well as the facilitation of patient insights into themselves, especially regarding their own strengths and relationships. The exercise was well received by students: Only five comments were categorized as negative, and all of these related to difficulties selecting patients.\nStudents reported many examples of improved patient-centered communication facilitated by the exercise. The narrative exercise may also promote a greater understanding of patients as complete human beings rather than diagnostic entities.

Few studies address this issue from a lifetime perspective. In this naturalistic study, we aimed at analysing the prescription pattern of antipsychotic drugs among a sample of Swedish patients with a diagnosis of psychotic illness, from the first contact with psychiatry (typically between 1973 and 1997) until the last written note in the case history documents. A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed of all case history data of 66 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders. Patients with schizophrenia were prescribed antipsychotic medication more than 90% of the time. Each patient generally had been prescribed several (up to 16) different antipsychotic drugs and a quarter of the patients had been prescribed two or more antipsychotics for a third of their prescription time. Patients with psychosis were exposed to a cumulatively growing number of antipsychotics. Various factors, including clinician and patient expectations, and specific strengths and limitations of available antipsychotics may account for frequent medication changes over time."}, {"Title": "Novel approaches to the study of postmortem brain in psychiatric illness: old limitations and new challenges.", "Abstract": "Biological psychiatry has made significant advances through the development of postmortem studies, animal models, and studies with living humans.

Psychiatrists delivering care from a distance may be challenged to understand the health beliefs and practices of the local community as well as the social and community settings of clients from different cultural backgrounds. Similarly, because providing services via telepsychiatry typically requires the involvement of different health care organizations, bridging distinct institutional cultures can challenge the effective delivery of services.

It increased significantly from 2008 to 2009, is more pronounced in the east rather than in the west, in smaller rather than in larger clinics, and for assistant doctors rather than for specialists. The lack of applicants is most likely also masked by compensatory measures such as the hiring of psychologists for the position of a physician.

One of the potential benefits of including this diagnosis in DSM-5 is to identify persons at high risk of developing psychotic disorders to prevent the appearance of these disorders or lead to disorders with a better prognosis. One of the challenges applying the criteria proposed to the pediatric population is the difficulty in defining \"attenuated\" in the same way and it is done with adults. The threshold for psychosis may be lower in children and, therefore, what is attenuated in adults may be fully present, although transient, in paediatric population. Other potential risks are a lower threshold for prescribing antipsychotics without clear evidence and whether the help-seeking behaviour criterion will be applied to the patients and/or the parents."}, {"Title": "Standards for reporting randomized controlled trials in neurosurgery.", "Abstract": "The Consolidated Standards for Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) criteria were published in 1996 to standardize the reporting and improve the quality of clinical trials.

Since doctors have conceptually and practically differentiated the symptoms from neurological ('organic') disease it has been presumed to be a psychological disorder, but the psychological mechanism, and how this differs from feigning (conscious simulation), has remained elusive. Although misdiagnosis of neurological disease as conversion disorder is uncommon, it remains a concern for clinicians, particularly for psychiatrists who may be unaware of the positive ways in which neurologists can exclude organic disease. The diagnosis is anomalous in psychiatry in that current diagnostic systems require that feigning is excluded and that the symptoms can be explained psychologically. In practice, feigning is very difficult to either disprove or prove, and a psychological explanation cannot always be found. Studies of childhood and adult psychological precipitants have tended to support the relevance of stressful life events prior to symptom onset at the group level but they are not found in a substantial proportion of cases. These problems highlight serious theoretical and practical issues not just for the current diagnostic systems but for the concept of the disorder itself. Psychology, physiology and functional imaging techniques have been used in attempts to elucidate the neurobiology of conversion disorder and to differentiate it from feigning, but while intriguing results are emerging they can only be considered preliminary. Such work looks to a future that could refine our understanding of the disorder. However, until that time, the formal diagnostic requirement for associated psychological stressors and the exclusion of feigning are of limited clinical value.

This review argues in favor of the use of zebrafish as a novel animal model to study the impact of early (stressful) experiences on the development of differential stress phenotypes in later life. This phenomenon is evolutionary conserved among several vertebrate species and has relevance to the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Why do we need novel animal models? Although significant progress has been achieved with the use of traditional mammalian models, there are major pitfalls associated with their use that impedes progress on two major fronts: 1) uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying aspects of compromised (stress-exposed) brain development relevant to the etiology of psychiatric disorders, and 2) ability to develop high-throughput technology for drug discovery in the field of psychiatry. The zebrafish model helps resolve these issues. Here we present a conceptual framework for the use of zebrafish in stress research and psychiatry by addressing three specific domains of application: 1) stress research, 2) human disease mechanisms, and 3) drug discovery. We also present novel methodologies associated with the development of the zebrafish stress model and discuss how such methodologies can contribute to remove the main bottleneck in the field of drug discovery."}, {"Title": "Perinatal, maternal, and fetal characteristics of children diagnosed with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder: results from a population-based study utilizing the Swedish Medical Birth Register.", "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre- and perinatal factors on the risk of developing attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nWe investigated the medical history of 237 children (206 male; 31 female) from Malm\u00f6, Sweden born between 1986 and 1996 and in whom a diagnosis of ADHD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IIIR or IV) was subsequently made at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Lund University, and a reference group of 31,775 typically developing children from Malm\u00f6 using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register.\nThe results of multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that ADHD was significantly associated with a young maternal age (odds ratio [OR] for 5 y increase 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.99), maternal smoking (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.14-1.60), maternal birthplace in Sweden (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.45-2.94), and preterm birth <32 weeks (OR 3.05; 95% CI 1.39-6.71), and a male predominance (OR 6.38; 95% CI 4.37-9.32).

This review attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Is there evidence of significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome in SMDs? (2) How is this evidence explained by stress theory and functional polymorphism? (3) What role can psychopharmacology and psychosocial therapies play in minimizing the problem? We have done a historical review using related literature from Medline. Compared with the general population, metabolic syndrome is two to three times more common in SMDs. The evidence for this predates the era of antipsychotic drugs. Altered glucose metabolism and dyslipidemia seem to be integral to SMDs. However, major psychotropic drugs are associated with metabolic syndrome, because of their activity at the appetite-stimulating receptors. SMDs seem to trigger a pathogenic cycle that fuels metabolic syndrome. To explain these findings, a neural diathesis-stress model has been proposed. Furthermore, candidate genes associated with receptors for weight gain are implicated. Using metformin (\u2265750\u2009mg/day) may significantly reduce metabolic risks, and the data support consideration of this intervention for psychiatric patients taking antipsychotics. The obstacles to the implementation of the available guidelines for monitoring metabolic effects and changing unhelpful lifestyles need to be overcome by making monitoring mandatory and integration of physical exercise into routine care.

France had always been a highly centralized country, but during the 19th century, this trend started to change with the creation of medical faculties in Nancy (1872), Lille (1877), Lyon (1878), Bordeaux (1879), Toulouse (1891), Algiers (1910) and Marseille (1930). Following the creation of the 12 foundation courses, specialized chairs were progressively established in Paris, but for a long time this remained restricted to the French capital. However, with the emergence of medicine as an academic discipline in several towns outside Paris, came the development of neurology. This was greatly influenced by former students of Jean-Martin Charcot, local personalities, and the interactions between the two. Leading figures included Albert Pitres in Bordeaux, L\u00e9on Ingelrans in Lille, Eug\u00e8ne Devic and Jules Froment in Lyon, Lucien Cornil in Marseille, Joseph Grasset in Montpellier, and Marcel Riser in Toulouse. The interaction between French and Germanic medical communities also developed at this turbulent time under the influence of several great physicians such as Wilhelm Waldeyer, Adolf Kussmaul, and later Jean Alexandre Barr\u00e9 in Strasbourg, and Hippolyte Bernheim in Nancy. There are a number of other university towns outside Paris in which the development of neurology was probably influenced by the same interactions with psychiatry. It would be worth carrying out a thorough analysis of these towns in order to present an exhaustive overview of the development of neurology in France."}, {"Title": "Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud and Charcot's psychological and psychiatric legacy.", "Abstract": "A key moment in the history of psychiatry occurred during Charcot's time at La Salp\u00eatriere. Though his studies on hysteria and hypnotism, the founder of neurology inspired the work of two of his alumni: a Viennese Nervenartz and a French philosopher interested in the dissociation of personality. Even though neither of them was originally an alienist, their respective work allowed the field of neurosis--then belonging to internal medicine--to pass to psychiatry. The parallel lives of these fr\u00e8res enemis, both of whom were treated differently by fame, developed inside a very complex cultural and scientific milieu. Therefore, it is necessary to consider them together with other physicians, some of whom are much less well-known nowadays, who one way or another carried Charcot's influence into psychiatry, psychology and psychotherapy. The fates of the Dioscuri have been reversed--the fame and success of Freudian psychoanalysis ran parallel to Janet's oblivion and his long 'purgatory', but now the 'renaissance' of his work coincides with the decline of psychoanalysis as a theoretical explanation for mental pathology."}, {"Title": "Paul Sollier: the first clinical neuropsychologist.", "Abstract": "Paul Sollier (1861-1933) is perhaps the most unjustly forgotten follower of Jean-Martin Charcot. He studied with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Bourneville, Charcot's second interne, and was considered by L\u00e9on Daudet as the cleverest collaborator of Charcot, along with Joseph Babinski. Charcot assigned him the task of summarizing the theories on memory, which led to two major books, in 1892 and 1900, that anticipated several contemporary concepts by several decades. In 1905-1906, the novelist Marcel Proust spent 6 weeks with Sollier in his sanatorium at Boulogne-Billancourt, and it is now obvious that several of Proust's ideas on involuntary memories which appear inside In Search of Lost Time (published 8 years later) had been inspired by Sollier's theories on the 'surge of reminiscences'. Sollier also designed the framework which led to the intellectual quotient (IQ) and made interesting studies on hysteria and behavioral issues in neurological diseases, activities that may make him the first modern clinical neuro psychologist. Sollier was also the first to correlate clinical findings with neurophysiological concepts, which makes him a precursor of our current approach to neurology and psychiatry."}, {"Title": "Birth of modern psychiatry and the death of alienism: the legacy of Jean-Martin Charcot.", "Abstract": "At the time of Jean-Martin Charcot, Paris--the main center for studies on the nervous system and its disorders--was home to critical exchanges between the developing discipline of neurology and psychiatry. Contrary to the commonly held view, and in spite of an established tradition concerning mental diseases, emerging neurology had a much stronger influence on psychiatry ('alienism') than the reverse. This was largely due to the school built up by Jean-Martin Charcot himself, which was organized around the study and management of hysteria. Although Charcot always claimed to be uninterested in mental medicine, he stimulated the development of an original scientific approach to nervous system conditions, based on Claude Bernard's method, along with structured academic teaching. Conversely, alienism paradoxically remained stuck in organicism, after Antoine Bayle's report in 1822 of 'arachnitis' as the substratum of general paresis of the insane. Contrary to alienism, the young neurological school was capable of self-criticism, and progressively highlighted mental factors in hysteria. This led to the paradox that neurologists were active in a disease with no organic cerebral lesion, while alienists were postulating brain lesions in all mental disorders. Pushed by Charcot, the academic evolution led to the launch of a faculty chair of mental and brain diseases in 1875, which was taken over for nearly half a century by his direct pupils Benjamin Ball, Alix Joffroy and Gilbert Ballet, who held the position until 1916, supporting the development of modern psychiatry in general hospitals, while alienism progressively disappeared at the turn of the century."}, {"Title": "From reactive to proactive and selective control: developing a richer model for stopping inappropriate responses.", "Abstract": "A better understanding of the neural systems underlying impulse control is important for psychiatry. Although most impulses are motivational or emotional rather than motoric per se, it is research into the neural architecture of motor response control that has made the greatest strides. This article reviews recent developments in the cognitive neuroscience of stopping responses. Most research of this kind has focused on reactive control-that is, how subjects stop a response outright when instructed by a signal. It is argued that reactive paradigms are limited as models of control relevant to psychiatry. Instead, a set of paradigms is advocated that begins to model proactive inhibitory control-that is, how a subject prepares to stop an upcoming response tendency. Proactive inhibitory control is generated according to the goals of the subject rather than by an external signal, and it can be selectively targeted at a particular response tendency. This may have wider validity than reactive control as an experimental model for stopping inappropriate responses."}, {"Title": "Life events as precipitants of suicide attempts among first-time suicide attempters, repeaters, and non-attempters.", "Abstract": "The aims of this study were to investigate risk factors for suicide attempts and propose a model explaining the associations among life events and suicide status. We assessed 263 subjects admitted following a suicide attempt to the Division of Psychiatry of the Department of Neurosciences of the University of Parma and compared them with 263 non-attempter clinical control subjects. Attempters reported significantly more adverse life events both in the last 6 months, and between the ages of 0-15 years than non-attempters. A multinomial logistic regression analysis with stepwise forward entry indicated that the best model to explain suicide status was one which included life events in the last 6 months, life events during age 0-15 years, and their interaction. First-time attempter status (vs. non-attempters) was more likely to be linked to life events in the last 6 months, the interaction between life events in the last 6 months and life events during age 0-15 years, and low social support. Those attempters with one or more prior attempts (repeat attempters) were more likely than non-attempters to be linked to the interaction between life events in the last 6 months and life events during age 0-15 years, and to higher rates of psychopharmacological treatment before the index admission. Guided by these findings, monitoring the impact of early-life and recent events in vulnerable individuals should be part of risk assessment and treatment."}, {"Title": "Eating disorders, gene-environment interactions and epigenetics.", "Abstract": "This review describes the various subtypes of eating disorders and examines factors associated with the risk of illness. It considers evidence that the development and maintenance of eating disorders is due to gene-environment interactions (GxE) that alter genetic expression via epigenetic processes. It describes how environmental factors such as those associated with nutrition and/or stress may cause epigenetic changes which have transcriptional and phenotypic effects, which, in turn, alter the long term risk of developing an eating disorder. It reviews theoretical and practical issues associated with epigenetic studies in psychiatry and how these are relevant to eating disorders. It examines the limited number of epigenetic studies which have been conducted in eating disorders and suggests directions for further research. Understanding the relationship between epigenetic processes and the risk of an eating disorder opens possibilities for preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. For example, epigenetic changes associated with diet and weight may be reversible and those associated with cognitive processes may be accessible to pharmacological interventions."}, {"Title": "Behavioral models for anxiety and multisensory integration in animals and humans.", "Abstract": "Complaints related to dizziness, balance problems and spatial disorientation in psychiatry have seldom been considered as a possible manifestation of a distorted multisensory integrative ability. Several kinds of mismatches among simultaneous sensory information are encountered in everyday life but despite these, the central nervous system usually manages to update the internal representation of the body in the surrounding space. In some cases, a sensory mismatch may elicit an erroneous perception of the body in space, resulting in anxiety, dizziness and balance problems. As vestibular system dysfunction leads to dizziness and disorientation, it has been hypothesized that a peripheral vestibular abnormality could explain the presence of certain symptoms related to sensory mismatches in anxiety disorders. Several studies tried to find a link between panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and vestibular system dysfunction. Yet, even though some vestibular abnormalities have been demonstrated in these patients, it is difficult to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between panic disorder and vestibular dysfunction. However, this does not rule out a possible influence of anxiety on normal vestibular function. The study of the relation between vestibular system and anxiety has to take into account that the vestibular system has three main functions: to maintain equilibrium through the vestibular spinal reflexes; to stabilize the visualization of the world through the vestibular-ocular reflex; to contribute to perception and orientation in space. We will review different studies in humans, which have particularly paid attention to the third function and its relation to anxiety. Animal experiments offer possibilities to more precisely analyze the different parameters underlying the behavioral results, as well as possible pharmacological actions on them. Two attempts have been made by our group to model, in mice, the preceding human data on integrated functional sensory relations of the body to space in anxiety disorders: the rotating beam and the rotating tunnel. We summarize here the main results obtained."}, {"Title": "Understanding the effects of stimulant medications on cognition in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a decade of progress.", "Abstract": "The use of stimulant drugs for the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most widespread pharmacological interventions in child psychiatry and behavioral pediatrics. This treatment is well grounded on controlled studies showing efficacy of low oral doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine in reducing the behavioral symptoms of the disorder as reported by parents and teachers, both for the cognitive (inattention and impulsivity) and non-cognitive (hyperactivity) domains. Our main aim is to review the objectively measured cognitive effects that accompany the subjectively assessed clinical responses to stimulant medications. Recently, methods from the cognitive neurosciences have been used to provide information about brain processes that underlie the cognitive deficits of ADHD and the cognitive effects of stimulant medications.

In the present review, the scientific issues that influence placebo effects are elucidated. The evolution of the concept of placebo and how this has affected its historical importance in therapeutics is considered. The importance of placebo responses in psychiatry and psychotherapy is specifically examined, and recent progress in determining the cognitive and neurobiological bases of placebo effects is reviewed. Finally, it is argued that the placebo response is a cardinal mind-body pathway that promotes salutogenesis and that evidence suggests its relationship to central nervous system activities that are responsible for the concomitant development of positive affects and somatic procedural memories that govern states of mind/body well-being during maternal-infant attachment."}, {"Title": "Using game format to teach psychopharmacology to medical students.", "Abstract": "Most psychiatric programs provide lectures on basic principles of psychopharmacology.

Both didactic interventions were delivered concurrently for five consecutive weeks covering five psychopharmacology modules: antidepressants I (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and atypical antidepressants), antidepressants II (monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety agents/sedatives/hypnotics. The game follows similar rules of the famous TV show, \"Jeopardy\" using a power point grid and a multiple choice question format.\nForty-three medical students participated (29 assigned to the game approach, 14 to the traditional lecture approach). None of the demographic variables (age, gender, years after graduation, Graduate Point Averages, and United States Medical Licensing Examination 1) were significantly associated with the pre/posttest score difference between groups.

Students in the game group had a better perception of this educational method as measured by perceived enjoyment, increased knowledge of psychopharmacology, and stimulating interest in the subject compared to those in the lecture group (p < 0.05).\nTeaching psychopharmacology in medical students by using academic games can make the learning experience more enjoyable and motivating; however, future studies with higher quality methodology and design are needed to determine the role of educational games in acquiring new psychopharmacological knowledge."}, {"Title": "The stigma of mental illness in Southern Ghana: attitudes of the urban population and patients' views.", "Abstract": "Stigma is a frequent accompaniment of mental illness leading to a number of detrimental consequences. Most research into the stigma connected to mental illness was conducted in the developed world. So far, few data exist on countries in sub-Saharan Africa and no data have been published on population attitudes towards mental illness in Ghana. Even less is known about the stigma actually perceived by the mentally ill persons themselves.\nA convenience sample of 403 participants (210 men, mean age 32.4\u00b112.3 years) from urban regions in Accra, Cape Coast and Pantang filled in the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI) questionnaire. In addition, 105 patients (75 men, mean age 35.9\u00b111.0 years) of Ghana's three psychiatric hospitals (Accra Psychiatry Hospital, Ankaful Hospital, Pantang Hospital) answered the Perceived Stigma and Discrimination Scale.\nHigh levels of stigma prevailed in the population as shown by high proportions of assent to items expressing authoritarian and socially restrictive views, coexisting with agreement with more benevolent attitudes. A higher level of education was associated with more positive attitudes on all subscales (Authoritarianism, Social Restrictiveness, Benevolence and Acceptance of Community Based Mental Health Services). The patients reported a high degree of experienced stigma with secrecy concerning the illness as a widespread coping strategy. Perceived stigma was not associated with sex or age.\nThe extent of stigmatising attitudes within the urban population of Southern Ghana is in line with the scant research in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and mirrored by the experienced stigma reported by the patients.

It is important that questions are asked and that ethical mindfulness and sensitivity are developed along with clinical skills. In order to cultivate and deepen ethical awareness and subsequently solve issues in optimal fashion, investment should be made in the development of an ethical decision-making process as well as in education in the ethics of psychopharmacology to trainees in the field at all stages of their educational development. A clear approach to identifying ethical problems, engaging various ethical concepts in considering solutions and then applying these principles in problem resolution is demanded. An openness in identifying and exploring issues has become crucial to the future development and maturation of psychopharmacologists, both research and clinical. Consideration must be given to the social implications of psychopharmacological practice, with the best interests of patients always paramount. From both a research and clinical perspective, psychopharmacology has to be practised with fairness, sensitivity and ethical relevance to all.

Essentialist kinds are classes whose members share an essence from which their defining features arise. Although elegant and appropriate for some physical (e.g. atomic elements) and medical (e.g. Mendelian disorders) phenomena, this model is inappropriate for psychiatric disorders, which are multi-factorial and 'fuzzy'. Socially constructed kinds are classes whose members are defined by the cultural context in which they arise. This model excludes the importance of shared physiological mechanisms by which the same disorder could be identified across different cultures. Advocates of practical kinds put off metaphysical questions about 'reality' and focus on defining classes that are useful. Practical kinds models for psychiatric disorders, implicit in the DSM nosologies, do not require that diagnoses be grounded in shared causal processes. If psychiatry seeks to tie disorders to etiology and underlying mechanisms, a model first proposed for biological species, mechanistic property cluster (MPC) kinds, can provide a useful framework. MPC kinds are defined not in terms of essences but in terms of complex, mutually reinforcing networks of causal mechanisms. We argue that psychiatric disorders are objectively grounded features of the causal structure of the mind/brain. MPC kinds are fuzzy sets defined by mechanisms at multiple levels that act and interact to produce the key features of the kind. Like species, psychiatric disorders are populations with central paradigmatic and more marginal members. The MPC view is the best current answer to 'What kinds of things are psychiatric disorders?'"}, {"Title": "DSM diagnosis and beyond: on the need for a hermeneutically-informed biopsychosocial framework.", "Abstract": "While often dubbed \"the bible of contemporary psychiatry\" and widely hailed as providing \"a benchmark\" for the profession, on closer inspection the DSM is seen to be shot through with philosophical assumptions that restrict its theoretical cogency and limit it clinical efficacy. Hence, in the interests of enhanced patient-care it is important to think critically about the DSM, with a view to maximising its diagnostic strengths while minimising its weaknesses. The critical analysis undertaken in the present paper underscores the importance of not construing the DSM as a self-contained diagnostic tool but of viewing it, rather, as an indispensable component in a more comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostic process. More specifically, the contention is that the DSM's diagnostic limitations evoke a biopsychosocial framework of application as their necessary corrective, notwithstanding the entrenched tendency to construe these approaches as oppositional. Further, it is contended that a hermeneutically informed biopsychosocial template has particular advantages as an integrating framework."}, {"Title": "Self-mutilation of tongue and lip in a patient with simple schizophrenia.", "Abstract": "Self-inflicted lesions that cause mutilation are observed in schizophrenic patients.

The brain is an extremely intricate physical entity and we have only recently begun to develop the conceptual tools to decipher this complexity. We can begin to comprehend many of the mental functions and dysfunctions by using insights about brain organization as a developing physical entity of connectivity structures. A comprehensive theoretical framework for the re-conceptualization of mental disorders as real brain-disorders, called \"Clinical brain profiling\" can be generated to make testable predictions about the etiopathology of psychiatric disorders. If validated, this framework has groundbreaking relevance for psychiatry, not only by providing an etiological diagnostic system, in itself revolutionary, but in its potential to develop effective curative interventions. According to the proposed brain profiling all mental disturbances can be defined in a 3 dimensional space of brain disturbances (1) neural-complexity organization, (2) to neural resilience optimization dynamics and (3) to connectivity constructs for context and internal representations. Neural complexity relates to the ability of the brain to balance connectivity dynamics, neural resilience relates to brain plasticity and changeability for optimizing overall brain dynamics and contextual configurations shape the internal representations of outer world that pattern out reaction and personality styles. Each of these organizational brain functions is predicted to involve a relatively specific neuronal circuitry system in the brain. The circuitry of the nigra-striautum-cortex, are a component of the connectivity balance stabilizers and regulators, a type of neural complexity pacemaker. Thus a patient that rates high on phenomenology related to functional psychosis indicating a disturbance to connectivity balance will have disturbances that will show up in appropriate signal processing imaging of the nigra-striautum-cortex circuitry. The circuitry of thalamus-amygdala-cortex and related pathways are relevant for neuronal matching and constraint frustration. In this respect the patients scoring high on mood and anxiety disorders are predicted to suffer from perturbation shown on appropriate imaging involving the thalamus-amygdala-cortex circuitries. The hippocampus is related to the formation of internal configurations thus those patients rating highest on parameters related to personality organization and maturation will show alterations in the hippocampal organization and activation indicating deficient organizations of internal configurations."}, {"Title": "Environmental toxicology and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals from hospital wastewater.", "Abstract": "In this paper, we evaluated the ecotoxicological potential of the 100 pharmaceuticals expected to occur in highest quantities in the wastewater of a general hospital and a psychiatric center in Switzerland. We related the toxicity data to predicted concentrations in different wastewater streams to assess the overall risk potential for different scenarios, including conventional biological pretreatment in the hospital and urine source separation. The concentrations in wastewater were estimated with pharmaceutical usage information provided by the hospitals and literature data on human excretion into feces and urine. Environmental concentrations in the effluents of the exposure scenarios were predicted by estimating dilution in sewers and with literature data on elimination during wastewater treatment. Effect assessment was performed using quantitative structure-activity relationships because experimental ecotoxicity data were only available for less than 20% of the 100 pharmaceuticals with expected highest loads. As many pharmaceuticals are acids or bases, a correction for the speciation was implemented in the toxicity prediction model. The lists of Top-100 pharmaceuticals were distinctly different between the two hospital types with only 37 pharmaceuticals overlapping in both datasets. 31 Pharmaceuticals in the general hospital and 42 pharmaceuticals in the psychiatric center had a risk quotient above 0.01 and thus contributed to the mixture risk quotient. However, together they constituted only 14% (hospital) and 30% (psychiatry) of the load of pharmaceuticals. Hence, medical consumption data alone are insufficient predictors of environmental risk. The risk quotients were dominated by amiodarone, ritonavir, clotrimazole, and diclofenac. Only diclofenac is well researched in ecotoxicology, while amiodarone, ritonavir, and clotrimazole have no or very limited experimental fate or toxicity data available. The presented computational analysis thus helps setting priorities for further testing. Separate treatment of hospital wastewater would reduce the pharmaceutical load of wastewater treatment plants, and the risk from the newly identified priority pharmaceuticals. However, because high-risk pharmaceuticals are excreted mainly with feces, urine source separation is not a viable option for reducing the risk potential from hospital wastewater, while a sorption step could be beneficial."}, {"Title": "Psychopharmacology: a house divided.", "Abstract": "Psychopharmacology and psychiatry during the past 50 years have focused on the specificity model in which it is assumed that psychiatric disorders are specific entities which should respond to drugs with specific mechanisms of action.

Structural abnormalities in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), or global cortical atrophy, may influence therapeutic response. The respective value of these factors in response prediction is unclear.\nIn a naturalistic clinical cohort of 81 elderly patients diagnosed with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recorded and rated before ECT treatment. The study was conducted at the clinic for Geriatric Psychiatry of the VU University Medical Center/Stichting Buitenamstel Geestgronden, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, over a 5-year period (2001-2006). Severity of depressive symptoms was measured by using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Response to ECT was defined as a decrease of at least 50 percent on the MADRS, and remission was defined as a score below 10 points on the MADRS.\nPatients with moderate or severe MTA had a lower mean percentage decrease in MADRS scores after ECT (37.9% in those with MTA, compared to 66.2% in those without MTA, P = .008). Patients without MTA had a 3 times greater chance of remitting from their depression compared to patients with moderate or severe MTA, ie, the hazard ratio for remission was 3.22 (95% CI, 1.30 to 7.69, P = .01). In contrast, no differences in change in MADRS scores were found for white matter hyperintensities or global cortical atrophy.\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy--not white matter hyperintensities or global cortical atrophy--contributes to poor response to ECT in severely depressed elderly patients.

Kraepelin hoped for a \u2018 natural \u2019 classification of psychiatric illness but realized that the level of etiologic knowledge required to undergird this effort was not feasible in his own lifetime. This did not stop him, however, from developing a pragmatic approach based on his clinical method of careful description with detailed follow-up, coupled with the available fallible tools of pathological anatomy and, by 1919, genetics and biochemistry. Kraepelin saw psychiatric disorders as multifactorial, arising from the difficult to untangle action and interaction of internal and external causes. He was aware of the problem of defining the boundaries of illness and health but knew this was not unique to psychiatry. Contrary to his stereotype, he was sensitive to the importance of personality factors in psychiatric illness and advocated for their investigation. He also recognized the limitations of his \u2018 clinical method' and was especially critical of classifications based on single prominent symptoms.

Where possible, one-year follow-up was arranged.\n173 persons aged 65 years or more were referred to the service during the ten years and assessed as living in squalor (120 moderate or severe, two thirds of whom showed a moderate or severe degree of hoarding/clutter). Of 157 followed up after one year, 47% were still at home, 32% were in long-term care homes, 12% had moved elsewhere, and 9% had died. The annual new referral rate was close to 1 per 1000 elderly people in the catchment area, and of moderate or severe squalor was 0.66 per 1000. Limiting follow-up to those in moderate or severe squalor, 41% were still at home one year later. Current findings suggest that the minimum prevalence in the community of older people living in moderate or severe squalor in Sydney is 1 per 1000.\nThe costs of intervening in cases of severe domestic squalor are considerable.

Housekeeping genes and normalization strategies in human brain gene expression studies.", "Abstract": "Many studies in biological psychiatry compare the abundance of individual messenger RNAs between cases and control subjects or, more recently, between genotype groups. Most utilize some form of normalization procedure, usually expressing the transcript(s) of interest relative to that of a housekeeping gene or genes (also called reference genes), to overcome various sources of experimental error. Indeed, normalization is such a standard procedure that its purpose, principles, and limitations are sometimes overlooked, and some papers lack sufficient information as to its implementation. Here, we review the rationales for normalization and argue that in well-conducted psychiatric gene expression studies using human brain tissue, it is reducing intersubject variability rather than experimental error that is the major benefit of normalization. We also review the conceptual and empirical basis for the category of housekeeping genes-i.e., genes with a ubiquitous and invariant expression. We conclude that the evidence is against any such simple categorization and that a more pragmatic, less dogmatic, approach to the selection and implementation of reference genes is required, which takes into account the particular issues that pertain to human brain tissue studies. This pragmatism extends to the issue of whether normalization should be to one or multiple reference genes. We end by making several recommendations toward a more flexible, transparent, and comprehensive approach to data presentation and analysis. We illustrate the review with examples from studies of schizophrenia and mood disorder."}, {"Title": "An unusual case of mesalazine intoxication: oral and rectal overloading of the rectal suppository form.", "Abstract": "Drugs containing 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA) have been commonly used for inflammatory bowel diseases for more than half a century, but no case about overdose of suppository form of mesalazine which was taken both orally and rectally has been reported in the related literature up to now.

In recent years there is an increasing awareness of the differences between children and adults in psychopathology and pharmacology. Related to this new paediatric regulations have been introduced. This article reviews the regulatory and legislative measures that were adopted in the EU in 2007 and the subsequent impact of these measures on the field of paediatric psychopharmacology. The consequences of the paediatric regulation in the EU are reflected in several domains: regulatory, research aimed at drug development and clinical practices. In the regulatory domain, the consequences include: new paediatric indications, inclusion of special (class) warnings, specification of dose regimens, and information on safety specific to children and adolescents, and development of new medicinal formulations. The paediatric regulation leads to timely development of paediatric friendly formulations and better quality of the clinical evidence. In clinical practices, an increased awareness of the uniqueness of paediatric pharmacology is emerging among medical professionals, and subsequent improvement of medical care (i.e. correct doses, appropriate formulation, monitoring for expected adverse events). In addition, clinical guidelines will have to be revised more frequently in order to integrate the recently acquired knowledge. The new regulations stimulate transparency and discussions between academia, pharmaceutical industry, and regulators. The purpose is to optimize clinical research and obtain evidence for paediatric psychopharmacology, thereby providing adequate support for treatment."}, {"Title": "V-RISK-10: validation of a screen for risk of violence after discharge from acute psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Current violence risk assessment instruments are time-consuming and mainly developed for forensic psychiatry.

We studied the sense of coherence (SOC) using the SOC-13 questionnaire. For assessing distress reactions we used a primarily illness-specific 11-dimensional Parental Psychosocial Distress in Cancer (PPD-C) self-report questionnaire developed for use with parents of childhood cancer patients, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Resilience was defined as absence of/less severe distress.\nLow SOC was significantly associated with more severe distress in all dimensions of the PPD-C and GHQ. The protective effect of SOC was indicated by it being most negatively related to general psychiatric symptoms, physical and psychological stress symptoms, anxiety and depression. The influence of SOC varied with parents' gender, showing a stronger modifying influence among mothers. Mothers and fathers also differed in their utilisation of professional psychosocial support when confronted with the child's cancer.\nParental resilience to cancer-related distress varies with identifiable strength factors. A strengths-oriented approach helps in understanding parental adjustment to childhood cancer. In order to counteract psychological vulnerability, addressing resilience instead of pathology helps to identify parents at risk and in need of professional support when faced with a child's cancer."}, {"Title": "Vulnerability, life events and depression amongst Moslem Malaysian women: comparing those married and those divorced or separated.", "Abstract": "The experiences of married and single mothers were compared in an investigation of psychosocial vulnerability, stress and depression in a community-based study of Moslem mothers in Malaysia.

TCP generates the most likely prediction and a valid measure of confidence, as well as the set of all possible predictions for a given confidence level. We present the theoretical motivation for TCP, and we have applied TCP to structural and functional MRI data in patients and healthy controls to investigate diagnostic and prognostic prediction in depression. We verify that TCP predictions are as accurate as those obtained with more standard machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, while providing the additional benefit of a valid measure of confidence for each prediction."}, {"Title": "Zolpidem misuse with other medications or alcohol frequently results in intensive care unit admission.", "Abstract": "Zolpidem (trade name Ambien \u00ae) is commonly prescribed.

Participation rate was 66%.\nThe availability of a reliable and valid questionnaire (professionals' satisfaction questionnaire with electronic medical records [PSQ-EMR]) concerning health care professionals' satisfaction regarding EMR in psychiatry, exclusively generated from interviews with health care professionals, enables legitimate feedback to be incorporated into EMR implementation in order to formulate a high-quality health care."}, {"Title": "[Postgraduate training for specialists in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Problem-based learning - evaluation of a pilot project].", "Abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) emphasizes the student's individual needs, their ability to solve complex clinical problems, and a professional attitude that facilitates communication among colleagues. Thus, PBL appears to provide a perfectly suitable didactic format for postgraduate training of medical specialties. To date, it is only rarely used in this area though. In a pilot project, we implemented PBL into the curriculum of postgraduate training in psychiatry and psychotherapy, and evaluated the program over a period of 12\u00a0months, using structured questionnaires. A total of 41 PBL courses were held, with 447 residents participating. Participants as well as tutors assessed 19 of 21 aspects as good or very good (5-point Likert scale, mean value >4). Overall, PBL was rated as highly suitable for advanced training (participants: 4.5\u00b10.8; tutors: 5.0\u00b10.2). The results of this pilot project suggest that PBL might be a useful element of multifaceted advanced training programs, strengthening their practical component and the applicability of knowledge in the daily clinical routine."}, {"Title": "The role of imprinted genes in mediating susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders.", "Abstract": "Imprinted genes, which are thought to comprise <1% of the mammalian genome, are defined by their parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression arising as a consequence of differential epigenetic marking of alleles in the paternal and maternal germlines. Such genes are highly represented in the brain and placental transcriptomes, and have been shown to exert significant influence on fundamental developmental processes in these organs. Converging evidence from work in man and animal models has shown that imprinted genes can influence a variety of brain and behavioral endophenotypes. In this article, we review the current evidence that imprinted gene dysfunction is associated with vulnerability to several common psychiatric disorders. We also discuss how studying imprinted gene (dys)function may provide mechanistic insights into two important areas in modern psychiatry: first, how environmental factors (especially in utero) interact with genetic liability via epigenetic mechanisms to predispose to later mental illness, and second, the molecular underpinnings of sex-specific vulnerability to psychiatric disorders."}, {"Title": "Maras powder usage among Turkish psychiatric outpatients.", "Abstract": "A kind of smokeless tobacco known as Maras powder, which is used in the southeastern region of Turkey, causes nicotine dependence. The aim of this study was to determine the usage of Maras powder among psychiatric outpatients and nonpsychiatric controls. The study group consisted of 276 psychiatric patients and 283 nonpsychiatric patients from psychiatry and family medicine outpatient clinics. A socio-demographic form, the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence, and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders?4th Edition were given to the participants. The rates of Maras powder usage in the patient group (10.1%) were significantly higher than those in the control group (5.6%). Men were found to use Maras powder at a higher rate in both groups. The rates of Maras powder usage according to the psychiatric diagnosis were evaluated. This is the first study estimating Maras powder usage rates among psychiatric patients in Turkey. The study's limitations are noted."}, {"Title": "[Forensic psychiatry and behavioural analysis].", "Abstract": "A case report shows that a patient could make a progress in his therapy with the help of professional behavioural analysis after a 14-year period of stagnating forensic therapy. The method of behavioural analysis represents a criminalistic tool to reconstruct and to analyse an offence on the basis of objective data. Nowadays this method is also used successfully in individual cases in the field of forensic psychiatry. The article shows and discusses the methodology and the current use of behavioural analysis in forensic psychiatry.\nprofessional behavioural analysis of offences of certain forensic patients provides an additional benefit for their therapy and their risk assessment. This kind of approach should be intensified by increasing cooperation with behavioural analysis units and by further training for forensic therapists."}, {"Title": "Big ideas for small brains: what can psychiatry learn from worms, flies, bees and fish?", "Abstract": "While the research community has accepted the value of rodent models as informative research platforms, there is less awareness of the utility of other small vertebrate and invertebrate animal models. Neuroscience is increasingly turning to smaller, non-rodent models to understand mechanisms related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Although they can never replace clinical research, there is much to be learnt from 'small brains'. In particular, these species can offer flexible genetic 'tool kits' that can be used to explore the expression and function of candidate genes in different brain regions. Very small animals also offer efficiencies with respect to high-throughput screening programs. This review provides a concise overview of the utility of models based on worm, fruit fly, honeybee and zebrafish. Although these species may have small brains, they offer the neuropsychiatric research community opportunities to explore some of the most important research questions in our field."}, {"Title": "Regaining mental capacity for treatment decisions following psychiatric admission: a clinico-ethical study.", "Abstract": "Mental capacity is an emerging ethical legal concept in psychiatric settings but its relation to clinical parameters remains uncertain. We sought to investigate the associations of regaining capacity to make treatment decisions following approximately 1 month of in-patient psychiatric treatment.\nWe followed up 115 consecutive patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital who were judged to lack capacity to make treatment decisions at the point of hospitalization. We were primarily interested in whether the diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder associated with reduced chances of regaining capacity compared with other diagnoses and whether affective symptoms on admission associated with increased chances of regaining capacity. In addition, we examined how change in insight was associated with regaining capacity in schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD)-mania, and depression.\nWe found evidence that the category of 'schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder' associated with not regaining capacity at 1 month compared with BPAD-mania [odds ratio (OR) 3.62, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.13-11.6] and depression (OR 5.35, 95% CI 1.47-9.55) and that affective symptoms on admission associated with regaining capacity (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.48). In addition, using an interaction model, we found some evidence that gain in insight may not be a good indicator of regaining capacity in patients with depression compared with patients with schizophrenia and BPAD-mania.\nWe suggest that clinico-ethical studies using mental capacity provide a way of assessing the validity of nosological and other clinical concepts in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "The relationship between seclusion and restraint use and childhood abuse among psychiatric inpatients.", "Abstract": "Seclusion and restraint (S/R) is a controversial topic in the field of psychiatry, due in part to the high rates of childhood physical and sexual abuse found among psychiatric inpatients. The trauma-informed care perspective suggests that the use of S/R with previously abused inpatients may result in retraumatization due to mental associations between childhood trauma and the experience during S/R. Thus, though one would expect to see efforts on the part of inpatient psychiatric facilities to limit S/R of previously abused inpatients, research suggests that trauma victims may be more likely to experience S/R. The current study sought to clarify this possibility by examining whether presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual and physical abuse differed among three groups of adult inpatients (N = 622) residing at a mid-Western state psychiatric hospital. These groups are empirically derived on the basis of dramatic differences in the patterning of their exposure to S/R over the course of hospitalization. Results of Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that the classes did not significantly differ in presence or absence and chronicity of childhood sexual or physical abuse when male and female inpatients were analyzed separately. However, among the class of inpatients who experienced the most instances of S/R, 70% of the members have histories of childhood abuse. Implications for inpatients, clinicians, and policy makers are discussed."}, {"Title": "Effects of a genome-wide supported psychosis risk variant on neural activation during a theory-of-mind task.", "Abstract": "Schizophrenia is associated with marked deficits in theory of mind (ToM), a higher-order form of social cognition representing the thoughts, emotions and intentions of others. Altered brain activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal cortex during ToM tasks has been found in patients with schizophrenia, but the relevance of these neuroimaging findings for the heritable risk for schizophrenia is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that activation of the ToM network is altered in healthy risk allele carriers of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1344706 in the gene ZNF804A, a recently discovered risk variant for psychosis with genome-wide support. In all, 109 healthy volunteers of both sexes in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for rs1344706 were investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a ToM task. As hypothesised, risk carriers exhibited a significant (P<0.05 false discovery rate, corrected for multiple comparisons) risk allele dose effect on neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and left temporo-parietal cortex. Moreover, the same effect was found in the left inferior parietal cortex and left inferior frontal cortex, which are part of the human analogue of the mirror neuron system. In addition, in an exploratory analysis (P<0.001 uncorrected), we found evidence for aberrant functional connectivity between the frontal and temporo-parietal regions in risk allele carriers. To conclude, we show that a dysfunction of the ToM network is associated with a genome-wide supported genetic risk variant for schizophrenia and has promise as an intermediate phenotype that can be mined for the development of biological interventions targeted to social dysfunction in psychiatry."}, {"Title": "High rates of psychosis for black inpatients in Padua and Montreal: different contexts, similar findings.", "Abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that despite differences in setting, specifically in Padua or Montreal, black psychiatric inpatients will have higher rates of assigned diagnosis of psychosis than their non-black counterparts.\nData on psychotic patients admitted to the psychiatry ward were extracted from records of general hospitals in Padua and Montreal. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each site to determine the relation between being black and receiving a diagnosis of psychosis, while controlling for sex and age.\nMost black patients at both sites received a diagnosis of psychosis (76% in Padua and 81% in Montreal). Being black was independently and positively associated with being diagnosed with psychosis compared to patients from other groups.\nBlack patients admitted to psychiatry, whether in Padua or Montreal, were more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of psychosis than were other patients."}, {"Title": "Proteomic research in psychiatry.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and mood disorders are severe and disabling conditions of largely unknown origin and poorly understood pathophysiology. An accurate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders is often complicated by their aetiological and clinical heterogeneity. In recent years proteomic technologies based on mass spectrometry have been increasingly used, especially in the search for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in neuropsychiatric disorders. Proteomics enable an automated high-throughput protein determination revealing expression levels, post-translational modifications and complex protein-interaction networks. In contrast to other methods such as molecular genetics, proteomics provide the opportunity to determine modifications at the protein level thereby possibly being more closely related to pathophysiological processes underlying the clinical phenomenology of specific psychiatric conditions. In this article we review the theoretical background of proteomics and its most commonly utilized techniques. Furthermore the current impact of proteomic research on diverse psychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, mood and anxiety disorders, drug abuse and autism, is discussed. Proteomic methods are expected to gain crucial significance in psychiatric research and neuropharmacology over the coming decade."}, {"Title": "The recognition of mental health disorders and its association with psychiatric scepticism, knowledge of psychiatry, and the Big Five personality factors: an investigation using the overclaiming technique.", "Abstract": "The present study examined the general public's ability to recognise mental health disorders and this ability's association with psychiatric scepticism, knowledge of psychiatry, and the Big Five personality factors. A total of 477 members of the British general public completed an overclaiming scale, in which they were asked to rate the degree to which they believed 20 mental health disorders (of which five were foils designed to resemble real disorders) were real or fake. Participants also completed a novel scale measuring psychiatric scepticism, a single-item measure of knowledge of psychiatry, and a measure of the Big Five personality factors. Results showed that participants were significantly more likely to rate foils as fake disorders than real disorders. In addition, the difference between real and foil ratings was significantly predicted by knowledge of psychiatry, psychiatric scepticism, and the Big Five personality factors of agreeableness and openness to experience. These results are discussed in relation to the overclaiming technique as a novel method to study mental health literacy."}, {"Title": "Characteristics of ADHD among Omani schoolchildren using DSM-IV: descriptive study.", "Abstract": "There is a dearth of studies describing the characteristics of ADHD among schoolchildren attending child psychiatry clinics in the Arab world.

The aim of this study was to investigate if the finding of an inverse correlation between spirituality and 5-HT(1A) could be seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder or replicated among healthy volunteers. A total of 23 patients with major depressive disorder and 20 healthy volunteers were examined with PET using [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY-100635 as the radioligand. The personality traits were measured using the Finnish version of the Temperament and Character Inventory and correlated with ligand binding (BP). No significant correlations were found between the different Temperament and Character Inventory subscales and BP in any of the studied brain regions (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nuclei, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri, medial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, insular cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex). These results do not support the idea that the serotonin system forms the biological basis of spiritual experiences among patients suffering from major depressive disorder or among healthy volunteers."}, {"Title": "Paul Tillich and psychoanalysis.", "Abstract": "Paul Tillich (1886-1965) was one of the leading theologians of the twentieth century. Tillich was born in Germany and received his education and first academic appointments there. Tillich left Germany in 1933 to teach at Union Theological Seminary after having been dismissed from his university position by the National Socialist government for his radical views and political associations. In the United States, he became a highly successful lecturer, preacher, and public intellectual who reached numbers of persons who had departed or who had doubts regarding traditional religious belief and practice. Tillich underwent a series of traumatic losses in the early decades of his life that powerfully shaped his subsequent contributions to religious and cultural discourse. This essay outlines this pattern of loss and speculates about its impact upon his theological work. It lifts up Tillich's perspective of living and working \"on the boundary\" of disciplines, eras, and cultures, most particularly where psychoanalytic ideas contributed to his \"theology of culture.\" It also stresses Tillich's role in initiating the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry and psychoanalysis. The essay concludes with a summary critique of Tillich's work along with an affirmation of his considerable legacy. This essay was originally a presentation for the Richardson Research Seminar in the History of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College."}, {"Title": "Quantification of brain macrostates using dynamical nonstationarity of physiological time series.", "Abstract": "The brain shows complex, nonstationarity temporal dynamics, with abrupt micro- and macrostate transitions during its information processing. Detecting and characterizing these transitions in dynamical states of the brain is a critical issue in the field of neuroscience and psychiatry. In the current study, a novel method is proposed to quantify brain macrostates (e.g., sleep stages or cognitive states) from shifts of dynamical microstates or dynamical nonstationarity. A ``dynamical microstate'' is a temporal unit of the information processing in the brain with fixed dynamical parameters and specific spatial distribution. In this proposed approach, a phase-space-based dynamical dissimilarity map (DDM) is used to detect transitions between dynamically stationary microstates in the time series, and Tsallis time-dependent entropy is applied to quantify dynamical patterns of transitions in the DDM. We demonstrate that the DDM successfully detects transitions between microstates of different temporal dynamics in the simulated physiological time series against high levels of noise. Based on the assumption of nonlinear, deterministic brain dynamics, we also demonstrate that dynamical nonstationarity analysis is useful to quantify brain macrostates (sleep stages I, II, III, IV, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep) from sleep EEGs with an overall accuracy of 77%. We suggest that dynamical nonstationarity is a useful tool to quantify macroscopic mental states (statistical integration) of the brain using dynamical transitions at the microscopic scale in physiological data."}, {"Title": "Authorizing psychiatric research: principles, practices and problems.", "Abstract": "Psychiatric research is advancing rapidly, with studies revealing new investigative tools and technologies that are aimed at improving the treatment and care of patients with psychiatric disorders. However, the ethical framework in which such research is conducted is not as well developed as we might expect. In this paper we argue that more thought needs to be given to the principles that underpin research in psychiatry and to the problems associated with putting those principles into practice. In particular, we comment on some of the difficulties posed by the twin imperatives of ensuring that we respect the autonomy and interests of the research subject and, at the same time, enable potentially beneficial psychiatric research to flourish. We do not purport to offer a blueprint for the future; we do, however, seek to advance the debate by identifying some of the key questions to which better answers are required."}, {"Title": "Looking at the schizophrenia spectrum through the prism of self-disorders: an empirical study.", "Abstract": "Nonpsychotic anomalies of subjective experience were emphasized in both classic literature and phenomenological psychiatry as essential clinical features of schizophrenia. However, only in recent years, their topicality with respect to the construct validity of the concept of the schizophrenia spectrum has been explicitly acknowledged, mainly as a consequence of the increasing focus on early detection and prevention of psychosis. The current study tested the hypothesis of a specific aggregation of self-disorders (SDs, various anomalies of self-awareness) in schizophrenia-spectrum conditions, comparing different diagnostic groups; 305 subjects, previously assessed in the Copenhagen Schizophrenia Linkage Study, were grouped into 4 experimental samples, according to their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) main diagnosis: schizophrenia, (n = 29), schizotypal personality disorder (n = 61), other mental illness not belonging to the schizophrenia spectrum (n = 112), and no mental illness (n = 103). The effect of diagnostic grouping on the level of SDs was explored via general linear model and logistic regression. The diagnosis of schizophrenia and schizotypy predicted higher levels of SDs, and SDs scores were significantly different between spectrum and nonspectrum samples; the likelihood of experiencing SDs increased as well with the diagnostic severity. The findings support the assumption that SDs are a discriminant psychopathological feature of the schizophrenia spectrum and suggest their incorporation to strengthen its construct validity, with potential benefit for both early detection and pathogenetic research."}, {"Title": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Comparison of Current Knowledge, Attitudes and Interest among German Medical Students and Doctors.", "Abstract": "Although it has been agreed that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) should be included in the German medical curriculum, there is no consensus on which methods and how it should be taught. This study aimed to assess needs for CAM education by evaluating current knowledge, attitudes and interests of medical students, general physicians and gynecologists. Two instruments based on established and validated questionnaires were developed. One was given to seventh semester medical students and the other to office-based doctors. Data were analyzed by bivariate correlation and cross-tabulation. Altogether 550 questionnaires were distributed-280 to doctors and 270 to medical students. Completed questionnaires were returned by 80.4% of students and 78.2% of doctors. Although 73.8% (160/219) of doctors and 40% (87/217) of students had already informed themselves about CAM, neither group felt that they knew much about CAM. Doctors believed that CAM was most useful in general medicine, supportive oncology, pediatrics, dermatology and gynecology, while students believed that dermatology, general medicine, psychiatry and rheumatology offered opportunities; both recommended that CAM should be taught in these areas. Both groups believed that CAM should be included in medical education; however, they believed that CAM needed more investigation and should be taught \"critically\". German doctors and students would like to be better informed about CAM. An approach which teaches fundamental competences to students, chooses specific content based on evidence, demographics and medical conditions and provides students with the skills they need for future learning should be adopted."}]
